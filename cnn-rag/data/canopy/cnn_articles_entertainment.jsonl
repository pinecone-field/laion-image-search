Poppell disclosed the detail while on the stand during the second day of testimony in the involuntary manslaughter\u00a0trial of\u00a0actor Alec Baldwin, nearly three years after cinematographer\u00a0Halyna Hutchins\u00a0was fatally shot on the New Mexico set of the Western film. Asked about the live rounds of ammunition that were discovered on set, Poppell said investigators found some on a prop cart, in a box of ammo and also in two prop gun holsters \u2014 the one worn by Alec Baldwin and another worn by co-star Ackles. \u201cMr. Ackles, another actor on the set, turns out that he \u2014 as he acted, as he performed \u2014 had a live bullet in his bandolier, correct?\u201d asked defense attorney Alex Spiro. \u201cYes,\u201d Poppell replied. \u201cYou have no reason to think Mr. Ackles had any idea that was there, right?\u201d Spiro continued. \u201cCorrect,\u201d Poppell said. Ackles, known for his longtime role on the series \u201cSupernatural\u201d and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video\u2019s \u201cThe Boys,\u201d was on set the day Hutchins was killed and spoke to USA Today about the tragedy in a 2022 interview. \u201cYou can chalk it up to negligence or try to point a finger at anybody,\u201d Ackles told the publication. \u201cAt the end of the day, it was a horrible, horrible accident that ended with a life. Unfortunately, those do happen all the time around the world everywhere. You don\u2019t normally witness them like I did, and it\u2019s certainly shocking and jarring. It makes you value life even more than you had.\u201d Ackles remembered Hutchins\u2019 talent. \u201cWe were only about a week and a half away from being done with that film, so there was a lot of footage in the can and she was doing something really exceptional,\u201d he said in his USA Today interview. \u201cShe was an incredible talent, and I wish there was some way to get it out there to the masses, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s possible.\u201d Ackles is not listed in the IMDb cast credits for \u201cRust.\u201d Actor\u00a0Josh Hopkins\u00a0took on the role played by Ackles, who left the project due to a scheduling conflict, according to The Hollywood Reporter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/jensen-ackles-rust-set/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Part of the problem is the perspective tilts heavily toward the Kidman character\u2019s daughter, Zara (Joey King), who works as an assistant to actor Chris Cole (Efron), best known for playing a superhero called Icarus Rush. To Zara\u2019s chagrin, he\u2019s prone to stereotypical excesses, sending her on menial errands like running to a store to buy him isolated whey protein. (If you have to ask, it\u2019s not for you.) Zara has watched Chris use and dump women, threatening to quit almost as often as he talks about firing her. Their latest spat brings him to the house she shares with her mom, Kidman\u2019s Brooke, a successful and conveniently widowed author. After some mild awkwardness, Chris and Brooke wind up in bed together, leaving her, as she says, \u201cstarting to feel things again.\u201d Zara is understandably horrified by the prospect of the two hooking up, prompting her mom to offer that their age difference is a mere 16 years, not 20 (which is more accurate in reality, but never mind), so maybe just May-September in calendar terms. Directed by Richard Lagravenese \u2013 whose most pertinent credit here might be adapting the screenplay for \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d \u2013 \u201cA Family Affair\u201d suffers from the wholesale self-absorption of all concerned, which makes the notion of this as some grand romance harder to swallow. Not that the director along with writer Carrie Solomon don\u2019t try, including a dinner scene with Zara\u2019s grandma (Kathy Bates, again underemployed) that works hard at humanizing Chris beyond just Efron\u2019s \u201cIron Claw\u201d-sculpted physique. While there are a few amusing lines scattered along the way (when Brooke says she\u2019s Australian, Chris asks if she knows Margot Robbie), the comedy largely fizzles beyond the initial introductions, and the romance \u2013 after that first encounter \u2013 doesn\u2019t come across as terribly convincing. That leaves some star charisma, but not enough chemistry, to propel this across the finish line, dragging the customary Hollywood cliches \u2013 and lots of musical montages, seemingly to fill out the running time \u2013 along with it. Granted, \u201cA Family Affair\u201d probably qualified as a win for Netflix as soon as Kidman and Efron signed on the dotted lines, at least in terms of the algorithm and minutes-watched totals their pairing will generate. Even setting the expectations bar at a modest height, though, the movie doesn\u2019t quite clear it \u2013 another case, in rom-com terms, where the idea of them, as a marquee matchup, proves superior to the execution. \u201cA Family Affair\u201d premieres June 28 on Netflix.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_a-quiet-place-day-one-review", "text": "Like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d pries opens the door to a world with a host of possibilities, some of them \u2013 including the premise of a new prequel subtitled \u201cDay One\u201d \u2013 already touched upon in the two previous movies. Set in New York, the latest film begins from a slightly unexpected premise, but then efficiently spins it to yield additional horror while giving theater-goers every reason to keep their mouths shut. The 2021 sequel actually opened with a muscular flashback sequence to that moment when the grotesque, sound-sensitive alien invaders descended upon Earth, so the new film\u2019s tag line, \u201cExperience the day the world went quiet,\u201d reflects a bit of a conceptual echo. Introducing new characters, the main wrinkle in the new prequel \u2013 and it\u2019s a questionable one at first \u2013 involves telling the story from the perspective of Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a dying woman enduring hospice care with her cat, who serves as the de facto guide to all hell breaking loose. At a time when people are dying right and left, \u201cDay One\u201d thus uses a woman already close to death as the audience\u2019s surrogate. She interacts with various people along the way, but it\u2019s a fair stretch until she encounters the most significant one, Eric (Joseph Quinn, on a genre tear with \u201cStranger Things\u201d behind him and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d to come), who doesn\u2019t want to leave her side however much she tries \u2013 quietly \u2013 to chase him away. While the Emily Blunt- and John Krasinski-anchored family\u2019s sign-language fluency gave the original movie its gateway into an original-feeling twist on minimalist horror, this third film relies heavily on Nyong\u2019o\u2019s facial reactions, and it\u2019s hard to think of an actor who can say more with an expression. Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\u201cPig\u201d), who shares story credit with original director/producer Krasinski (whose summer dance card also includes \u201cIF\u201d), the film does let viewers see more of the horrifying creatures, although their lightning-quick attacks often keeps those images brief. There\u2019s also the matter of how the invaders manage to seemingly be everywhere at once, to the point where the slightest sound on screen provokes a sense of dread. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d takes advantage of those attributes, and even finds a way to use Sam\u2019s condition, somewhat awkwardly, to consider our humanity. If there\u2019s one clunky flourish, it\u2019s been clear going back to \u201cAlien\u201d that cats and sci-fi horror don\u2019t mix, and while her feline companion provides a periodic source of unpredictable tension, it\u2019s one of those devices that probably should have been left in the litter box. Unfortunately, everything that enjoys a modicum of success these days triggers talk of its own \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is no exception. Practically speaking, \u201cDay One\u201d takes a step toward demonstrating that this perilous post-invasion world offers no shortage of streets and hallways to tiptoe down, where nobody needs to ask \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d when they are greeted with silence. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_07_01_entertainment_lost-abc-netflix", "text": "ABC was struggling to find hits in 2004 when the network introduced two of them: \u201cDesperate Housewives,\u201d a new take on a primetime soap opera; and \u201cLost,\u201d a sci-fi-tinged mystery that fast became a fan sensation, from its cryptic numbers to what really happened to that crashed plane and its passengers. Of the two, though, it was \u201cLost\u201d that fundamentally changed television and the relationship between the creative talent behind TV shows and the networks that carried them \u2013 fueling what might be called the novelization of television \u2013 not in the way the series began, but rather how it ended in 2010. The roots of that actually began several years earlier, when the show\u2019s executive producers, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, recognized that the twisty, mysterious series\u2019 ratings were beginning to suffer because of the open-ended nature of viewers\u2019 commitment. When would we get some answers, fans wanted to know. At their urging, in what Variety called a \u201cparadigm-shifting play,\u201d ABC allowed them to announce an official end date for the series, ordering 48 episodes over three seasons to complete the story. The announcement served notice that the series was indeed building toward something, that a payoff awaited those who were sinking all this time \u2013 and graduate-school-level thought and analysis \u2013 in the show, and what it all meant. Until then, the prevailing wisdom in television was, in essence, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. Series ran until the audience stopped watching them, not when the creators said, as if they were novelists who had reached the conclusion of the story. \u201cI think for story-based shows like \u2018Lost,\u2019 as opposed to franchise-based shows like \u2018ER\u2019 or \u2018CSI,\u2019 the audience wants to know when the story is going to be over,\u201d Cuse stated at the time, spelling out the novel comparison by adding, \u201cWhen J.K. Rowling announced that there would be seven \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 books, it gave the readers a clear sense of exactly what their investment would be. We want our audience to do the same.\u201d Producer J.J. Abrams, who co-created the series with Lindelof and Jeffrey Lieber, at the time called the decision \u201cthe right choice,\u201d crediting ABC for having \u201creal foresight and guts to make a call like this.\u201d Since then, arguably, a different kind of television has emerged and taken root, giving creative talent more latitude to decide the shelf life of their stories. That has included the growth of limited series that offer the promise of closure and finality, creating arcs with a clear beginning and end. Others followed that example, from \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d with its two-season conclusion, to \u201cStranger Things,\u201d to most recently \u201cThe Boys,\u201d which announced that superhero satire\u2019s fifth season will wrap up the story. That equation has made TV richer and more ambitious, as well as able to wrestle with different kinds of serialized storytelling. In the immediate aftermath of that, the children of \u201cLost\u201d \u2013 plentiful at first, as they always are when something unexpectedly succeeds \u2013 benefited from that appetite, as networks ordered more projects with mysteries baked into them, even if few of them could live up to its promise. Tellingly, even \u201cLost\u201d didn\u2019t stick the landing, yielding a finale that answered many of its questions but felt frustrating in its resolution. Knowing when to end isn\u2019t exactly the same as knowing how. By then, though, the show\u2019s legacy was secure. Bringing that full circle, all 121 episodes of the show are appropriately landing on Netflix, where they can be rediscovered \u2013 and binged in a more concentrated fashion \u2013 by those who don\u2019t have to wait years to see how it all ends. Welcome to the 2020s. The \u201cLost\u201d finale might not have conjured an ending worthy of all the hype. By then, though, it had helped point TV toward a new approach to telling stories, which, never mind the numbers (for the record, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42), might be the formula that really matters the most. \u201cLost\u201d premieres July 1 on Netflix in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/entertainment/lost-abc-netflix/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_entertainment_maxxxine-review-mia-goth", "text": "In keeping with the current cinematic age, even a slasher/porn-centric franchise gets a \u201cuniverse\u201d these days, as \u201cMaXXXine\u201d caps off an unlikely trilogy from writer-director Ti West and star Mia Goth. Stepping up in class in terms of casting, the film works best as an ode to the movies and grime of 1980s Hollywood, and a bit less as a mystery built around its driven starlet-in-waiting. That would be Goth\u2019s Maxine Minx, an adult-film actor who survived a rural massacre during a remote shoot in \u201cX,\u201d the roots of which were explored in the prequel \u201cPearl.\u201d Maxine is now in L.A. and trying to make a go of it in legit movies (\u201cActing is acting,\u201d she says confidently during her audition), even if said movie is a horror film that\u2019s provoking protests and charges of satanism outside the studio. While chasing that big break, repeating her mantra, \u201cI will not accept a life I do not deserve,\u201d Maxine also learns that somebody appears to be after her, having set a private detective (Kevin Bacon, boiling over the top) on her tail, dredging up memories of her past. That at least provides connective tissue to \u201cX,\u201d and motivations that might go beyond the title character being really, really unlucky in that way \u201cfinal girls\u201d often are. The danger also comes at a time of high alert in the city, since it\u2019s 1985, and the Night Stalker killer remains at large. Not that Maxine\u2019s porn pals seem particularly on edge as they scrape and claw, trying to meet people with the clout to advance their careers. In addition to Bacon, the supporting cast includes Halsey, Giancarlo Esposito, \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, and Bobby Cannavale and Michelle Monaghan as a pair of detectives eager to glean what Maxine knows about the crime spree surrounding her \u2013 which merely triggers her skepticism and can-do attitude, applying the same ruthless pursuit of stardom to her self-defense. Goth again turns her alter ego into a force of nature, but the film\u2019s simplest pleasures come in its evocation of the time, with songs like \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d and the hit from \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d as well as Angelyne billboards and nods to movies like \u201cDressed to Kill.\u201d Although the theatrical box office has enjoyed welcome signs of life this summer, horror has stayed a reliable staple since the pandemic began, thanks in part to the discount-bin quality of films like \u201cX\u201d and \u201cPearl,\u201d relative to aspiring blockbusters, as long as they deliver the requisite thrills. West mixes some wit in with the gore here, even if the payoff, alas, doesn\u2019t rise to the level of the buildup. By then, though, \u201cMaXXXine\u201d has delivered enough nostalgia regarding its genre to merit a walk down its alleys, and not incidentally, the showcase and sendoff that Goth\u2019s character deserves. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d premieres July 5 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/entertainment/maxxxine-review-mia-goth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

A recent Forbes piece about the series, penned by author and activist Virgie Tovar, has caused a stir for referring to the pairing as \u201cmixed-weight,\u201d putting focus on the characters\u2019 different body types in a way some have found sexist. Known by fans as \u201cPolin,\u201d the duo\u2019s romance this season has been eagerly awaited since the show first premiered in 2020, given that fans of the series (and the Julia Quinn novels that inspired the hit Netflix franchise) know that Penelope has secretly yearned to catch Colin\u2019s eye from the beginning. As celebrated as the pair is, Tovar\u2019s article acknowledges the problematic discussion the characters\u2019 romantic relationship has spurred. \u201cFor some, this romance is unsettling because it forces them to consider that humans are simply not governed by tidy, predictable rules,\u201d Tovar writes. \u201cIf this romance upsets you, it says more about how deeply you\u2019ve internalized fatphobia than it says about the bodies of the actors playing Penelope and Colin.\u201d The article has drawn mixed reaction, with some celebrating the discussion and others decrying terminology used therein. Writer and critic Zo\u00eb Rose Bryant shared on X, \u201cI find it interesting how there are countless fictional couples in film and television where the man weighs more than the woman but people didn\u2019t start writing articles about whatever the f\u2014k a \u2018mixed-weight romance\u2019 is until it was the other way around.\u201d Tovar said to CNN in a statement, \u201cI think this conversation is really important, as difficult as it might be.\u201d \u201cAs someone who\u2019s watched \u2018Bridgerton\u2019 from Season 1, I genuinely and instantly saw myself in Penelope. That isn\u2019t an emotion that can be contrived, and I wrote the piece from that place,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think there needs to be room for both the plus-size person who didn\u2019t see themselves reflected in Penelope and those of us who did. Neither of us is wrong. I think it\u2019s important to hear from the people who don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d Coughlan has said she was aware of the conversations being had about her plus-sized body after the first two seasons and \u201cspecifically asked for certain lines and moments to be included\u201d in the new season, which features racy sex scenes between her character and Newton\u2019s. \u201cThere\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m very naked on camera, and that was my idea, my choice,\u201d Coughlan added at the time.

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec", "text": "This year, two disparate, big-budget films will share a release date: One, an R-rated historical epic stacked with a starry cast of Oscar hopefuls. The other, a musical based on a beloved property with plenty of pink and a Billboard-friendly soundtrack. Sound familiar? With \u201cGladiator II\u201d and the first part of \u201cWicked\u201d sharing a release date, days before Thanksgiving, movie theaters are nearing their truest chance at another \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d a viral phenomenon that in 2023 drove audiences to the movie theater by the millions, leaving a massive mark in pop culture and at the box office. But what will we call it? \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal thinks \u201cGlicked\u201d (pronounced glick-id) is the portmanteau that suits the prospective double feature best. \u201c\u2019Wickiator\u2019 doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue, does it?\u201d he said in a new interview with Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI think the films couldn\u2019t be more polar opposite and kind of worked in that context previously, so fingers crossed people come out and see both films on opening weekend.\u201d But maybe we moviegoers (and Mescal) are getting ahead of ourselves. Tom Nunan, a lecturer at UCLA\u2019s School of Theater, Film and TV and the founder of the production company Bull\u2019s Eye Entertainment, isn\u2019t fully sold on \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d 2.0. Both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d were major films with astronomical hype from respected auteurs, but even the studios couldn\u2019t have predicted that audiences would make both films appointment viewing over the same weekend, he said. (\u201cBarbie\u201d was produced by Warner Bros., which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.) \u201cIt\u2019s good when studios release big titles simultaneously,\u201d Nunan told CNN. \u201cI do think that they feed off of each other \u2013\u2013\u00a0that level of excitement. I think all of those things work in both of these films\u2019 favor. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the lightning in a bottle that \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was.\u201d Stranger things have happened, though \u2013\u2013 plus, there\u2019s a \u201cStranger Things\u201d actor in the \u201cGladiator\u201d sequel, which might attract some younger audiences. But if \u201cGlicked\u201d wants to achieve \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d heights of success, the films have a few more hurdles to clear than the Oscar-winning hits of last summer. \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 and \u2018Wicked\u2019 need a fun portmanteau First things first \u2013\u2013\u00a0\u201dBarbenheimer\u201d had a killer portmanteau. If the studios behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d want to emulate the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, they might want to turn to the movie lovers who helped coin the term that turned last year\u2019s summer flicks into a double feature. The Columbia Journalism Review credits awards pundit Matt Neglia with using \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d first in April 2023, but it quickly spread across the internet wherever movie fans lurked. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d wasn\u2019t clunky, and there was never any question which films \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d referred to \u2014\u00a0the same cannot be said just yet of \u201cGlicked,\u201d \u201cWickiator\u201d or the even uglier \u201cGladicked.\u201d It should be noted that after the smashing success of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer, no release weekends have seen the same double-feature draw, though musings of \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d and \u201cGarfuriosa\u201d pairings did make the rounds online. Those were more jokes about how two seemingly incompatible films could reach the same audiences than genuine attempts at creating a viral trend \u2014\u00a0in no world does the \u00fcber-graphic \u201cSaw X\u201d pair well with the kid-friendly \u201cPaw Patrol: The Mighty Movie.\u201d For now, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d simply haven\u2019t dominated the cultural conversation yet in the same way \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d did. But there\u2019s still time \u2014\u00a0they don\u2019t hit theaters until November 22. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019s\u2019 appeal was mystery Part of the appeal of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was wanting to see it as soon as possible to join the cultural conversation about two of the biggest movies of the year. It helped that we knew so little about both films before their premieres, Nunan said. Aside from a few paparazzi shots of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling rollerblading through Venice Beach, we knew virtually nothing about \u201cBarbie\u201d before it came out. And \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d while based in history, was still a Christopher Nolan film, so its marketing was mostly mysterious and teased major moments without revealing too much of its majesty. But both films had been hyped for over a year before their releases, thanks to marketing that kept much of the secrets of both films but offered fans just enough to keep them excited. A well-timed trailer here and a smart social campaign there \u2013\u2013\u00a0like those \u201cBarbie\u201d headshots with the quippy captions or the ominous live countdown clocks used on billboards and in trailers for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013\u2013\u00a0only made fans more ravenous ahead of the release date, Nunan said. There\u2019s less mystery with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II.\u201d The former is one of the most popular musicals of the century and the fourth-longest running on Broadway \u2013\u2013\u00a0millions have already seen it onstage or read the novel upon which it\u2019s based, so there are fewer surprises in store for audiences, Nunan said. And though \u201cGladiator\u201d won best picture among other Oscars, it came out 24 years ago. \u201cNeither of these franchises are fresh to the audience,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cThey\u2019re both known entities versus the unlimited potential of \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019\u201d Familiarity and continuations of franchises decades later can work \u2014\u00a0\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d was the first huge success since Covid-19 kneecapped movie theaters and spoke to viewers beyond those who\u2019d seen the original \u201cTop Gun\u201d back in 1986, Nunan said. But whether audiences will seek out that nostalgia again is harder to predict. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 had an air of prestige Another \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d advantage was both films\u2019 sublime pairing of director and subject matter. Here was indie staple and Oscar nominee Greta Gerwig helming her biggest film yet about the country\u2019s most famous doll \u2013\u2013 even those less familiar with her work were eager to see whether she could pull off \u201cBarbie.\u201d (The consensus was that she did.) \u201cOppenheimer\u201d director Christopher Nolan also has a distinct style and a dedicated fanbase, which has cemented Nolan as a reliable box office draw, with six of his 12 films making between half a billion to over $1 billion worldwide. The best picture-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d almost cracked a billion. The \u201cartistic audacity\u201d that both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d promised was thrilling in its own right, Nunan said, and part of what drove the more hardcore film fans to the theater for repeat viewings. And that\u2019s the test for a true blockbuster, he said: Whether viewers find it worth it to return and pay to see the same film again and again. The critical and commercial track records for the directors behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are less consistent, Nunan said, which could make a difference in the cultural and box-office impact they have. The prolific Ridley Scott of \u201cGladiator II\u201d has made classics like \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cThelma and Louise.\u201d But his more recent films haven\u2019t \u201cmoved the needle\u201d like his earlier work, Nunan said. Last year\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d and 2021\u2019s \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d made decent money but earned middling reviews; 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Last Duel,\u201d though lauded, was declared a \u201cbomb\u201d by trade publications. \u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu is perhaps best known for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d which was a hit with audiences in 2018, though his last film, 2021\u2019s adaptation of the musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d was beset by Covid-era box office challenges. Musicals like \u2018Wicked\u2019 can be tough sells It will be a harder road for \u201cWicked\u201d to excel than \u201cBarbie\u201d before it, Nunan said \u2013\u2013\u00a0movie musicals are a tougher sell with audiences, even those adapted from popular properties. (See: \u201cCats\u201d flopping in 2019, even though it was based on one of the longest-running musicals of all time and featured the world-conquering superstar Taylor Swift.) \u201cI think the fact that \u2018Wicked\u2019 is a musical actually limits its long term box office appeal,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cWicked\u201d is also a full-fledged musical where \u201cBarbie\u201d was marketed as a comedy that happened to feature a few impactful musical numbers led by a game Ryan Gosling, and even those numbers were revealed much later in the pre-release campaign, he said. There are exceptions to the movie musical rule, though: Just this year, another musical based on familiar IP did solid numbers \u2014 \u201cMean Girls,\u201d a film adaptation of the Broadway musical based on the 2004 film, made over $100 million in theaters. \u2018Glicked\u2019 does have star power As with \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before them, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d have star power in spades. The Roman Empire-set epic has a cast full of \u201cinternet boyfriends,\u201d the men for whom countless fans have pined since their breakout performances: Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn, to name three. Mescal starred in the pandemic-era series \u201cNormal People\u201d and became an Oscar nominee for \u201cAftersun\u201d at 27; the seasoned Pascal reached new heights of heartthrobbery with HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and Quinn appeared in the most recent season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d one of the most-watched Netflix series of all time. Scott\u2019s upcoming film also boasts a star so stratospherically charismatic that the New York Times named him the greatest actor of the 21st century: Denzel Washington, who nearly runs away with the trailer. And \u201cWicked\u201d is anchored by one of the premier pop divas of our time, Ariana Grande, who plays Galinda (yes, Ga-linda), the blonde foil to Cynthia Erivo\u2019s green-skinned Elphaba. Grande hasn\u2019t played a major leading role in a film yet, and she\u2019s only appeared in cameos and bit parts over the last decade. But it\u2019s possible that star power doesn\u2019t play as large a role as it once did in getting butts in seats, Nunan said. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, who played crucial supporting roles in \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d starred in \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d earlier this spring, which faltered at the box office and was sent to VOD just weeks after it hit theaters. \u201cI don\u2019t know, with these blockbuster tentpole films, if the casting is as important as the movie itself,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the quality and execution of the film.\u201d He cited \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which featured several major stars in supporting roles, like Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey, Jr. Their inclusion in the cast maybe lent the film an air of prestige, but he\u2019s not sure that any of them were the sole reason people saw the film. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us went to see because Matt and Emily and Robert were in it, but it helped,\u201d he said. There was something alchemical about the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d moment of last summer that exceeded all predictions about how popular both films would prove. It might have been easy to assume that viewers of one film wouldn\u2019t want to see the other since they were so dissimilar, Nunan said, but \u201caudiences proved the studios wrong\u201d and went to see both. \u201cThat summer, \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was meeting on so many levels of special,\u201d he said. Some magic just can\u2019t be replicated, though there\u2019s still a few months for \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d\u00a0to drum up the same must-see prestige as the films that dominated the summer of 2023. What remains to be seen is whether fans who see the films as a double feature will wear gladiator skirts and witch hats to the theater.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_sorry-not-sorry-documentary-louis-ck", "text": "What to do about the strange case of Louis C.K.? That question resides at the heart of \u201cSorry/Not Sorry,\u201d a documentary that poses thorny questions about what cultural sentence the comedian should have served for his sexual misconduct, unequal power dynamics, and how stardom contributed to people ignoring an \u201copen secret\u201d in the comedy community. Lest anyone have forgotten, Louis C.K. belatedly admitted to exposing himself and masturbating in front of women after a New York Times story detailed multiple allegations, initially losing deals and being shunned before returning to performing roughly nine months later. Produced by the Times and featuring several of its reporters, the film from directors Caroline Suh and Cara Mones focuses on three women \u2013 comics Jen Kirkman, Abby Schachner, and Megan Koester \u2013 who spoke out about what the last of that trio calls \u201can open secret\u201d in the comedy community. They and others address the reluctance of women to speak out in that male-dominated bastion, and the irony that the women who did come forward appeared to pay a higher price for simply telling the truth about Louis C.K.\u2019s behavior than he did. Having comics as the principal storytellers adds a level of humor and wit to the conversation, but there\u2019s a pointed side to all this as well, from Louis C.K.\u2019s self-serving characterization of events on stage to well-established performers Dave Chappelle and Bill Maher, who pride themselves on their subversive takes, and how they weighed in on the matter. At its core, though, are issues not easily remedied, including the fact that women trying to chart careers in comedy \u2013 a field in which they are a decided minority \u2013 didn\u2019t want to be perceived as complaining about someone with the power to influence their futures, as well as how other men in comedy processed (or more often, didn\u2019t) questions about someone many of them liked and admired. \u201cWhen it comes to telling the truth about one of our own, suddenly we shut up,\u201d notes comic Michael Ian Black, while TV producer Michael Schur \u2013 who worked with Louis C.K. on \u201cParks and Rec,\u201d and produced shows such as \u201cThe Good Place\u201d \u2013 says with the benefit of hindsight, \u201cThe fact that I thought it wasn\u2019t my problem is the problem.\u201d At the same time, \u201cSorry/Not Sorry\u201d grapples not just with the misbehavior, for lack of a better word, than the appropriate punishment, given the relatively brief period of time that Louis C.K. spent in comedy exile. \u201cHow long should somebody go without working?\u201d asks Noam Dworman, owner of New York City\u2019s Comedy Cellar, where Louis C.K. began his comeback, gradually moving up to larger venues and eventually arenas like Madison Square Garden. If there\u2019s no easy answer to that, \u201cSorry/Not Sorry\u201d takes issue with both the supposition that nobody was really victimized by Louis C.K.\u2019s actions and the mentality of first looking the other way amid what the comic initially dismissed as \u201crumors,\u201d then welcoming him back. Although Kirkman attributes much of that to stand-up culture \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019ve been socialized in this world where men get to treat women however they want,\u201d she says \u2013 the issue goes beyond that to broader inequality in the workplace and the fallout, or lack thereof, from the #MeToo movement. Louis C.K. declined to be interviewed for the film, but as clips show, he has turned the story, and the revelations about his \u201ckink,\u201d as he describes it, into a part of his act. Like much of his comedy, he finds humor and a sense of embarrassment in that; still, some will surely feel queasy watching \u201cSorry/Not Sorry,\u201d realizing that unlike the women featured discussing their experiences, he is, again, laughing all the way to the bank. \u201cSorry/Not Sorry\u201d premieres in select theaters and digitally on July 12.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/sorry-not-sorry-documentary-louis-ck/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_fly-me-to-the-moon-review-scarlett-johansson-channing-tatum", "text": "After a run of movies awash in the romance of the space program like \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cFirst Man,\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d cleverly uses the Apollo 11 mission as the backdrop to an old-style romance. Less than weighty in the comedy part of its equation, the film largely works as a vehicle for Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, even without completely sticking the landing. The movie casts Johansson as a corporate marketing specialist, which is somewhat ironic given that its marketing campaign isn\u2019t as clear as it could or should be in terms of conveying what to expect. While the story does include a subplot about staging a fake version of the moon landing \u2013 orchestrated as a back-up plan by a shadowy government operative (Woody Harrelson, again serving as one of the president\u2019s men, echoing his role in \u201cWhite House Plumbers\u201d) with ties to the Nixon administration \u2013 the heart of the film resides in the chemistry between the leads. In classic fashion, they are of course instantly drawn to each other, creating the need to erect barriers in order to keep them apart. In that sense, this is less about conspiracy theories and reality \u2013 though there\u2019s definitely an element of that woven into it \u2013 than the tension between NASA\u2019s square-jawed launch director, Cole Davis (Tatum), and Johansson\u2019s Kelly Jones, who gets recruited to \u201csell the moon\u201d to a skeptical public, leveraging her knack for bending the truth in order to close the deal. Coming almost exactly 55 years after Neil Armstrong took that \u201cone giant leap\u201d onto the lunar surface, director Greg Berlanti and writer Rose Gilroy introduce a strain of cynicism well suited to our current moment, juxtaposing that with the soaring, can-do spirit of the Apollo program. There\u2019s a crowd-pleasing quality to the combination, even if any crowds might prove short lived, inasmuch as the film\u2019s theatrical prospects (before a date on Apple TV+) amount to serving as counter-programming to the blockbuster \u201cTwisters\u201d and \u201cDeadpool\u201d sequels soon to come. A prolific TV producer, Berlanti has tilted toward romance with his forays into movies, including \u201cLove, Simon\u201d and \u201cLife as We Know It.\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d occupies a higher orbit in its ambition and star power, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that his leads look pretty celestial, while bathing in the period costumes and music of the time. After an eclectic string of roles, Johansson carries a film that might have starred someone like Faye Dunaway during the era in which it\u2019s set (think \u201cNetwork\u201d), while Tatum gets put to better use than his most recent rom-coms, the third \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cThe Lost City,\u201d admittedly not a super-high bar. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d possesses appealing virtues consciously plucked from the past, then adorns them with modern baubles. Whether that will \u201csell the moon\u201d to the moviegoing public remains to be seen, but to borrow from the song that shares its title, the pitch isn\u2019t much more complicated than an invitation to come play among the stars. \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d premieres July 12 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.

{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_beverly-hills-cop-axel-f-review-eddie-murphy", "text": "\u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d spawned a trio of movies, but more significantly, the 1984 film capped off a string of hits (after \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d and \u201cTrading Places\u201d) that launched Eddie Murphy into the movie-star stratosphere. As Murphy moves into the encores-for-streaming phase of his career (see \u201cComing 2 America\u201d), enter \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\u201d which features enough unapologetic nostalgia (cue the music) to power through its flat spots. The fact that the film is premiering via Netflix, as opposed to theaters, might warrant some second-guessing given the box-office numbers that the latest \u201cBad Boys\u201d sequel has delivered, but that\u2019s a debate for another day. From the get-go, the star appears up to the task as he slides back into a role to which he said goodbye 30 years ago, and introduced a decade before that. As with \u201cComing 2 America,\u201d \u201cAlex F\u201d uses a next-generation hook to get into the story and create the excuse to bring Murphy\u2019s Axel Foley from Detroit (after an introductory action sequence that goes on a bit too long) back to Beverly Hills, reuniting him with lots of familiar faces. In this case, he\u2019s summoned by Billy (Judge Reinhold) to help Axel\u2019s estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige, who followed \u201cHit the Floor\u201d with \u201cZola\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d), a lawyer representing a client who has triggered a warning to back off from some very bad people. Before you can say \u201cGet the f\u2014k outta here\u201d (which is, not surprisingly, said several times), Axel lands in L.A., cheerfully insisting, \u201cThey love me in Beverly Hills!\u201d Staying on brand, he quickly irks the local authorities as he sets about protecting Jane, while running afoul of a corrupt detective played by Kevin Bacon (one of two movies in which he appears this week, the other being \u201cMaXXXine\u201d). Axel also gets teamed up with a younger cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has some history with Jane, although frankly \u2013 other than \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s hilarious cameo as a Beverly Hills realtor \u2013 the newcomers don\u2019t stand much of a chance to register as holdovers like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and John Ashton join Reinhold in dropping by. In perhaps the wisest (and easiest) decision, first-time feature director Mark Molloy relies heavily on music associated with the original movies, from Harold Faltermeyer\u2019s electronic score to songs like \u201cThe Heat is On\u201d and \u201cNeutron Dance,\u201d augmented by a new one from Lil Nas X. In the early going, a younger colleague in Detroit points out that Axel continues to hit the streets at a time when \u201cguys your age\u201d are transitioning to desk jobs, which basically spells out the formulation here, and how Murphy effectively carries off the same mentality as his alter ego. \u201cAxel F\u201d only turns up the heat to a low simmer, but as breezy escapism goes, those armed with the proper attitude might find themselves doing the neutron dance, or a version of it, all over again. \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.

According to CNN affiliate JTBC news, the 28-year-old star uploaded a video to her personal YouTube channel that included footage of herself vaping in a room while getting her hair and make-up done. Stylists appear very close to her face as she breathes out. Though the footage was taken down from Kim\u2019s channel, a clip of her vaping spread across the internet. Some of the singer\u2019s fans quickly took to social media to criticize her, expressing their disappointment that she was vaping, especially in an enclosed room close to other people. Others stuck by the celebrity and posted their support, noting that it is a personal choice whether or not to vape. Odd Atelier, a label founded by Kim in November last year, posted the star\u2019s apology to X, writing that \u201cJennie acknowledges and deeply regrets her mistake of vaping indoors and causing inconvenience to the staff.\u201d She personally apologized to the staff on-site, Odd Atelier continued, adding that \u201cwe apologize to her fans who have been disappointed through this incident.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far", "text": "As we hurtle headlong into summer, we\u2019re dully aware six months\u2019 worth of new content has already hit our streaming platforms and our feeds this year \u2013 and in some rare cases, even gotten us out of the house and into a movie theater. While consensus seems to be that a lot of what pop culture has brought forth thus far in 2024 has been a bit \u201cmeh,\u201d there have also been standouts, triumphs and attention-getting titles worth of celebrating. Here\u2019s our list of some the year\u2019s best performances and content so far: MOVIES Best (or, most chillingly effective) cameo - Jesse Plemons in \u2018Civil War\u2019 The Oscars \u201cconversation\u201d already includes \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star Plemons delivering a brief performance so menacing, it calls to minds the scant 24 minutes Anthony Hopkins spent on screen before clinching an Academy Award for \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d Plemons\u2019 demented \u201csoldier\u201d in a crumbled and war-torn version of the near-future US, dispensing life and death with callous disdain, more than drives home the point filmmaker Alex Garland was trying to make with his latest movie. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how \u201cCivil War\u201d star Kirsten Dunst \u2013 who is married to Plemons in real life \u2013 felt comfortable going home with him after shooting his scene. Best genre-defying comedy -\u00a0\u2018Problemista\u2019 Writer, director and actor Julio Torres is an exceptional cinematic voice who has actually been around for awhile, creating excellent content for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and series such as \u201cLos Espookys\u201d and the soon-to-be released \u201cFantasmas.\u201d \u201cProblemista,\u201d which won acclaim at several festivals in 2023, features Torres as a toy designer from El Salvador trying to find opportunities to unleash his creative vision in the US, while also figuring out a way to stay in the country. He runs into both expected roadblocks as well as ones that are frustratingly inane, like a poorly designed grant website with a broken drop-down menu that makes it impossible for anyone located outside of country to apply. With artfully realized details like that, \u201cProblemista\u201d does the remarkable job of remaining universally engaging while exploring a very specific and individual experience. Plus, Tilda Swinton turns in one of her best idiosyncratic and delightfully deranged performances opposite the gifted Torres. Best meet-cute -\u00a0\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Not since \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d has Anne Hathaway captured the zeitgeist like this, and we\u2019re here for it. In \u201cIdea,\u201d she has a run-in at Coachella with It-Boy Nicolas Galiztine (of \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d and \u201cMary & George\u201d fame) that is so silly, and so disarming, it\u2019s hard not to go along for the gender-flipped \u201cNotting Hill\u201d (plus a few age-gap years) that follows. Other reasons to watch include the music performance scenes (the fictional boy band in the film isn\u2019t so fictional in that it was essentially created for the movie and has actually released music) and Hathaway\u2019s character\u2019s positively enviable Los Angeles enclave. Best visuals\u00a0- The Harkonnens in \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 It\u2019s getting harder and harder to dazzle with a truly original vision on the silver screen, but Denis Villeneuve pulls it off in his epic sci-fi sequel, which had been drastically delayed for a variety of reasons but finally dawned in the theaters this past spring. The sequences depicting the villainous Harkonnens \u2013 mostly monochromatic and overexposed to create an off-putting yet hypnotic ambiance \u2013 simply look like nothing else, and succeed in imparting a foreboding and terrifically extraterrestrial feel. Actor Austin Butler\u2019s improvised kiss planted on his uncle Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) helps as well. Honorable mentions: Best sports-infused romance/romance-infused sports movie\u00a0- \u201cChallengers\u201d Best use of profanity -\u00a0Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley in \u201cWicked Little Letters\u201d Best music documentary\u00a0- \u201cIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\u201d Best horror film - \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d Best animated film\u00a0- \u201cOrion and the Dark\u201d TV Best production - \u2018Shogun\u2019 The series production of the year, FX\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d managed to create the second showstopping television event based on the acclaimed James Clavell novel, after the first series did way back in 1980. CNN\u2019s Brian Lowry wrote in his glowing review that the new show \u201cblends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.\u201d Best show (somewhat) inspired by real life\u00a0- \u2018Baby Reindeer\u2019 While \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is by no means an easy watch, Richard Gadd\u2019s (true to an extent, that will surely be battled over for some time) recounting of his experience with a stalker \u2013 and how a previous experience of abuse played into it \u2013 is ultimately gratifying for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Gadd\u2019s layered and vulnerable performance anchors the show, and serves as the perfect foil for the brilliant Jessica Gunning \u2013 who plays his increasingly menacing stalker Martha \u2013 to truly shine and chew scenery at the same time. Best visuals -\u00a0\u2018Ripley\u2019 In a very different way from the villainous Harkonnen family in \u201cDune\u201d \u2013 but still depicting a nefarious villain nonetheless \u2013 the black-and-white Netflix series \u201cRipley\u201d can draw you in at practically any juncture, with stunningly ornate stylistic details and seaside Italian locations that are gasp-inducing maybe partially because they lack color. You could take screenshots from almost any scene and frame them as fine art, and the show \u2013 an austere retelling of the Patricia Highsmith novel after Anthony Minghella\u2019s far more colorful (literally and figuratively) film from 1999 \u2013 has the beguiling ability to make your eyes crave its somehow comfortable, monochromatic simplicity when you\u2019re not watching it. Best sophomore season -\u00a0\u2018Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u2019 \u201cInterview\u201d has only improved on what\u2019s come before \u2013 its first season, as well as the 1994 Neil Jordan movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt \u2013 and continues to be one of the best-acted and best-written shows on TV, while also remaining the juiciest. Vamps have never been more compelling than the iterations of the Anne Rice characters depicted here. Alternating between notes that are tragic, beautiful and sometimes hilarious, it\u2019s got a bit of everything. Which means its no surprise that AMC announced a third season renewal just this week. \u2013 Scottie Andrew Best cameo -\u00a0Carrot Top on \u2018Hacks\u2019 When Mr. Top (real name Scott Thompson, who while you weren\u2019t looking has become a major fixture in Las Vegas) comes out on screen in the second episode of this well-received third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d double-takes abound as to whether that\u2019s \u201creally him.\u201d His commitment in the scene is top notch, and stick around for the post-show featurette to watch him take director notes and do great line readings. Honorable mentions go to Dierdre Hall playing herself, sort of, as Paul W. Downs\u2019 mother in the Christmas episode, along with Christopher Lloyd as her maybe-new paramour. \u201cHacks\u201d also enjoys featured guests J. Smith-Cameron from \u201cSuccession,\u201d who finally gives (great) face to Kathy \u2013 Deborah\u2019s detested and two-timing sister \u2013 and Helen Hunt as a ball-busting network exec. Honorable mentions: Best documentary portrait of a living artist -\u00a0\u201cSteve! (Martin): A documentary in two pieces\u201d Best unabashed romance series -\u00a0\u201cOne Day\u201d Best mindless guilty summer reality obsession -\u00a0\u201cSummer House\u201d Best mystery - \u201cMonsieur Spade\u201d MUSIC Best musical genre reinvention - Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 A truly monocultural moment in music, Queen Bey\u2019s landmark eighth studio album took the old \u2013 like the Beatles\u2019 \u201cBlackbird\u201d and Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene\u201d \u2013 and made it new and vital again. It shined a light on both trailblazers and up-and-coming artists that normally aren\u2019t associated with the ever-changing genre that is \u201ccountry,\u201d while betraying a very personal story from Beyonc\u00e9 herself about her own experience in the music world as an artist of color. Best album that\u2019s definitely not for everyone - Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018Only God Was Above Us\u2019 There are few immediately hummable songs on the new record that call to mind \u201cHarmony Hall\u201d off of their last album in 2019, and the instrumentation is rich and complex and strangely captivating, like the band wanted to stuff as many distinctive sounds into each song as they could. And their trademark clever wordplay is very much on display in songs like \u201cGen-X Cops.\u201d \u2013 Brandon Griggs Best breakout - Chappell Roan While her debut album \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d was released late last year, Roan has been steadily gaining attention ever since \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 with viral performances at Coachella, the Governors Ball and Bonnaroo, along with a wonderful (and also very viral) set on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series in March. With a queer-centric performance style that is very drag-inspired, her latest single \u201cGood Luck Babe!\u201d epitomizes her fiercely independent, raw and authentic vibe. Plus, rock legend Elton John has already given his seal of approval. We\u2019re so in.  \u2013 Scottie Andrew and Alli Rosenbloom BOOKS \u2018Margo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u2019 by Rufi Thorpe Soon to be a TV series starring Elle Fanning, this novel \u2013 following a young, single, new mother with no job who joins OnlyFans and begins creating sexual content to stay afloat \u2013 toys with our perceptions of power and morality. What does it mean to be a good person, and who gets to decide? Over the course of the book, readers see Margo desperately trying to survive her situation, contending with the difficult \u2013 and sometimes unconventional \u2013 choices she makes in order to do so. \u2013 Leah Asmelash \u2018Sociopath: A Memoir\u2019 by Patric Gagne The release of \u201cRipley\u201d in April coincided with the arrival of the memoir\u00a0\u201cSociopath,\u201d\u00a0which offers a quite different case for demythologizing what it means to be a sociopath. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who\u2019s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and\u00a0argues that\u00a0the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed. \u2013 Sara Stewart PODCAST Best and most hilarious podcast about nothing in particular - \u2018The Bald and the Beautiful\u2019 The beloved queens from \u201cDrag Race\u201d Trixie and Katya blather on about nothing, and it\u2019s just everything. Their conversations get extremely raunchy and graphic, so be warned, but there are few funnier people on the planet than these two drag legends. \u2013 Scottie Andrew", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_the-man-with-1000-kids-netflix-review", "text": "Netflix has enjoyed success with a certain kind of nightmare-fuel docuseries that strains various aspects of society through fun-house mirrors. \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d fits right in, down to the title, although the headline on the New York Times article that preceded this UK production, \u201cThe Case of the Serial Sperm Donor,\u201d surely would have worked equally well. The chosen title does have the advantage of evoking a movie, \u201cMan of a Thousand Faces,\u201d a biography of the silent-film star and horror staple Lon Chaney. It is also imprecise, or at best an estimate, since as the Times reported, the actual number of children fathered by Jonathan Jacob Meijer, a Dutch musician, \u201cis impossible to say,\u201d with a Dutch organization stating the total \u201ccould run to several hundred, even 1,000,\u201d while Meijer put the figure at \u201capproximately 250.\u201d Whatever the math, the bottom line of the story is certainly attention-getting: Meijer agreed to provide sperm to a number of families, outside of conventional donation channels as well as through traditional ones, leaving parents feeling misled and outraged, betrayed and defrauded, upon learning the truth. Meijer also traveled the world, providing donations in multiple countries, making a full count of the children with his DNA extraordinarily difficult to obtain. Lacking many options to take action, the parents finally went to court, seeking to prevent him from donating to anyone else. Produced by the makers of \u201cLover, Stalker, Killer,\u201d \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d begins in almost whimsical fashion, interviewing various parents \u2013 from single mothers to lesbian couples to a man who, after his second marriage, couldn\u2019t have his vasectomy reversed \u2013 who found Meijer online, liked the image he presented and availed themselves of his services. Eventually, though, enthusiasm gave way to rising anger and efforts to stop him, as well as plenty of questions, still largely speculative, about what motivated him and others to far exceed established donor guidelines. (Meijer declined to participate in the documentary but told the Times in 2021 that his goal was \u201cto help parents with realizing their dream.\u201d) Like so many of these sensational documentaries \u2013 including \u201cOur Father,\u201d a Netflix project about an Indiana fertility specialist who used his own sperm to inseminate patients, or HBO\u2019s \u201cBaby God\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d raises questions about the fertility industry, and its regulation, that go beyond individual cases to consider ethical and logistical concerns through an extreme lens. While the numbers might not be completely accurate, in terms of appealing to an audience weaned on sensational titles like \u201cThe Tinder Swindler\u201d and similar fare, this feels right on target. \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/entertainment/the-man-with-1000-kids-netflix-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_shelley-duvall-death", "text": "Shelley Duvall, best known for her roles in \u201cThe Shining\u201d and several acclaimed Robert Altman films, has died, according to reports, citing a family spokesperson and her longtime partner. She was 75. Duvall died in her sleep at their home in Blanco, Texas of complications of diabetes, Dan Gilroy, her life partner of more than 30 years, told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cMy dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cToo much suffering lately, now she\u2019s free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley.\u201d Known for her thin physique, large expressive eyes and powerful performances, Duvall was a standout playing opposite Jack Nicholson in the iconic 1980 horror film \u201cThe Shining\u201d and Robin Williams in the comedy \u201cPopeye\u201d that same year. But hardcore fans of cinema also recognized her for her professional partnership with acclaimed filmmaker Altman, who first cast her as the love interest in the 1970 film, \u201cBrewster McCloud.\u201d Duvall would go on to memorable roles in some of his other movies, including his ensemble 1975 film \u201cNashville,\u201d and \u201c3 Women\u201d in 1977, which won her the Cannes Best Actress Award. In a Boca Raton News story published in 1977, Altman hailed the actress as being able to \u201cto swing all sides of the pendulum: charming, silly, sophisticated, pathetic \u2014 even beautiful.\u201d Duvall\u2019s other notable work includes her performances in \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d \u201cRoxanne\u201d and \u201cMcCabe & Mrs. Miller.\u201d She enjoyed an early hit in the premium cable era, as host and producer of Showtime\u2019s \u201cFaerie Tale Theatre\u201d from 1982 to 1987. She worked in the entertainment industry for decades before she fell on hard times. In 2016, Duvall appeared on Dr. Phil\u2019s daytime talk show in an interview titled, \u201cA Hollywood Star\u2019s Descent Into Mental Illness: Saving The Shining\u2019s Shelley Duvall.\u201d The actress made several troubling statements, claiming that her \u201cPopeye\u201d costar Williams, who died in 2014, was still alive and a shapeshifter. \u201cI\u2019m very sick,\u201d she told Dr. Phil at the time. \u201cI need help.\u201d There was backlash after the episode aired, as many complained that Duvall had been exploited on air. In April of this year, Duvall, who hadn\u2019t acted since 2002\u2019s \u201cManna from Heaven,\u201d gave a rare interview to the New York Times in which she reflected on her career and more recent absence from film and TV projects. \u201cI was a star; I had leading roles,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s just aging, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s violence.\u201d \u201cHow would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime \u2026 they turn on you?\u201d she added. \u201cYou would never believe it unless it happens to you. That\u2019s why you get hurt, because you can\u2019t really believe it\u2019s true.\u201d At the time, she and Gilroy were living in an \u201cisolated but serene\u201d one-story home in Texas Hill Country. Over the years, Duvall retained a large fanbase of supporters. She returned to screens in 2023 for the horror film \u201cThe Forest Hills.\u201d \u201cI wanted to act again. And then this guy kept calling, and so I wound up doing it,\u201d Duvall quipped in her interview with the Times. \u201cIf you ever do a horror film, other horror films are going to come to you, no matter what you do.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/shelley-duvall-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_12_entertainment_alec-baldwin-trial-rust", "text": "The involuntary manslaughter case against actor Alec Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion on Friday after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing state investigators did not properly share with the defense that a man had delivered a box of ammunition purportedly connected to the case to investigators. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer sent the jury home for the day and heard several hours of testimony about the alleged issue. At about 4 p.m. local time, she sided with the defense and dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. \u201cThe state\u2019s discovery violation has injected a needless, incurable delay into the jury trial,\u201d she said. \u201cDismissal with prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system and the efficient administration of justice. Your motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted.\u201d Follow our live coverage here. Baldwin could be seen crying as the decision was announced, and he immediately hugged his wife Hilaria as court was excused for the day. The decision came after a chaotic hearing Friday just a few days into Baldwin\u2019s involuntary manslaughter trial related to the\u00a0fatal shooting\u00a0of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on October 21, 2021, on the New Mexico set of the Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Baldwin had pleaded not guilty and could have faced up to 18 months in prison. Baldwin was practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 with a prop gun when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. At opening statements Wednesday, prosecutors alleged Baldwin violated the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety\u201d by pointing the prop gun at Hutchins and pulling the trigger. However, the defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director \u2013 jointly in charge of firearm safety on set \u2013 for allowing a real bullet to be loaded into the prop gun and failing to make it safe before it reached Baldwin. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d The case against Baldwin has been marked by yearslong fits and starts with turnovers in prosecutors, a prosecution stalled by questions surrounding the integrity of evidence and a steady spate of motions from Baldwin\u2019s team attempting to get the charge thrown out. This is the third criminal case related to the on-set shooting. In March, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d was\u00a0found guilty of involuntary manslaughter\u00a0and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Her attorney Jason Bowles spoke to CNN after Baldwin\u2019s case was dismissed. \u201cThe judge found intentional misconduct and we also have had the same failures in Hannah\u2019s case, by the State,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be moving for dismissal of Hannah\u2019s case.\u201d Dave Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the\u00a0district attorney\u00a0for New Mexico\u2019s First Judicial District said. The terms of the deal included six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. How the case unraveled The case unraveled in real time on Friday afternoon and culminated with a bizarre scene in which special prosecutor Kari Morrissey agreed to take the stand as a witness and answer sharp questions under oath from defense attorney Alex Spiro. In her testimony, Morrissey stated special prosecutor Erlinda Johnson \u2013 who delivered opening statements against Baldwin \u2013 had resigned from the prosecution team that day. \u201cMy understanding is that she didn\u2019t agree with the decision to have a public hearing,\u201d Morrissey said. The evidence issue first came to light on Thursday. In court, a crime scene technician testified that a man had delivered a box of ammunition to the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office in March after the conviction of \u201cRust\u201d armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed. The man, Troy Teske, a retired police officer and friend of the armorer\u2019s father, told investigators he believed the ammunition could be associated with the \u201cRust\u201d incident, crime scene technician Marissa Poppell testified. However, the technician testified the items were catalogued separately from Baldwin\u2019s case and were not included in the \u201cRust\u201d case inventory or tested to see if they matched the lethal round. Baldwin\u2019s team argued prosecutors did not properly disclose this evidence to the defense and asked for the case to be dismissed. In response, Morrissey said investigators determined the ammunition was not a match to those found on the \u201cRust\u201d set and had no evidentiary value to the case. \u201cThis is a wild goose chase,\u201d Morrissey argued. The judge sent the jury home for the day and allowed further testimony about the issue. In a \u201cvery unusual\u201d development, the judge asked for Poppell to be called back to the stand to discuss the rounds outside the presence of the jury. The witness, judge, and attorneys all donned blue gloves and gathered around a table in the center of the courtroom, where the envelope holding the rounds was unsealed and examined by the judge to determine whether it matches the rounds recovered from the film set. The courtroom was silent and thick with tension as the judge compared the rounds. The judge then ordered additional witnesses to testify, and several law enforcement investigators took the stand and spoke about how Teske had delivered a box of ammunition to the sheriff\u2019s office in March, which he said was a match to the live rounds found on set. The investigators testified they and Morrissey determined the ammo was not relevant to the \u201cRust\u201d case and so did not turn it over to the defense. Poppell said she filled out a report on the interaction but it was filed under a different case number. However, Cpl. Alexandria Hancock, the lead investigator on the case, testified under questioning from the judge the rounds looked \u201csimilar\u201d to the dummy rounds on the set of \u201cRust.\u201d She said she attempted to reach Teske for a further interview, but he did not return her calls. After a break, Morrissey then called herself to the stand as a witness in a remarkably unusual setup. She said she had received a photo from Teske of some live rounds earlier and determined they were not similar to those on the set of \u201cRust,\u201d and when he brought the box of ammo to the sheriff\u2019s office in March she believed they were similar to those in the photo. Spiro, the defense attorney, then sharply questioned her, eliciting testimony that her colleague had resigned, and about her personal feelings about Baldwin. \u201cI appreciate his movies. I appreciated the acting he did on Saturday Night Live, and I really appreciate his politics,\u201d she said. Outside court after the dismissal, Morrissey said she was disappointed by the decision and argued there was no evidence any of that ammunition was related to Hutchins\u2019 death. \u201cI understand the court disagrees with me, and I respect the court\u2019s decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the people can disagree. I\u2019m disappointed because I believe that the importance of the evidence was misconstrued by the defense attorneys, but I have to respect the court\u2019s decision.\u201d She said she does not believe they let down Hutchins\u2019 family. \u201cWe did everything humanly possible to bring justice to Halyna and to her family and we\u2019re proud of the work we did,\u201d she said. How we got here The shocking death of Hutchins on set was the first of its kind since the 1993 death of\u00a0actor Brandon Lee, who was killed in the filming of \u201cThe Crow\u201d when his co-star fired a prop gun containing a fragment of a bullet. A journalist turned\u00a0promising cinematographer, Hutchins was a native of Ukraine and worked as an investigative journalist with British documentary productions in Europe, where she did feature documentaries for the BBC and Discovery. She lived in New York City, where she found a love for photography, before moving to Los Angeles. After taking a UCLA extension course for directing, Hutchins quickly figured out she loved cinematography more than directing, according to an interview for \u201cWhy Women Are Excelling in Hollywood\u201d\u00a0posted on YouTube months before her death.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/entertainment/alec-baldwin-trial-rust/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_entertainment_streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros", "text": "Streaming appears poised to undergo what some have called \u201cThe Great Re-Bundling,\u201d with services merging, combining or forming alliances that will essentially reconstruct the cable \u201cbundle\u201d that consumers relied upon for decades. While that makes sense for studios eager to offer \u201cmore robust and streamlined content,\u201d as Disney CEO Bob Iger said earlier this year, subscribers have every reason to wonder \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?,\u201d and if all these high-stakes corporate announcements will really benefit them. Will it make access to at-home viewing options cheaper? More plentiful? Easier to navigate and find what you want? Less of a chore to manage in terms of juggling multiple subscriptions? That\u2019s the goal, but honestly, we can\u2019t really know. The latest news to ripple through the streaming front involved reports Paramount, prior to moving forward on its merger with Skydance, looking to combine its Paramount+ with another service. Max, the HBO-centered provider from CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery, was among those cited as potential partners. Such an arrangement would follow the formal announcement in February of Venu Sports, a joint sports offering consisting of Disney\u2019s ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros.; Disney\u2019s intra-studio attempt to create a mega-service to subscribers who ante up for its trio of services: Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+; and Disney\u2019s collaboration plan with Warner Bros. on a bundle consisting of Disney+, Max and Hulu. The advantages for the companies, as they seek to compete with Netflix and the tech giants (Amazon and Apple foremost among them) that have helped crowd the streaming waters, aren\u2019t certain, but the objectives seem clear, beginning with the hope these combined or consolidated services will reduce churn \u2013 that is, people signing up and cancelling and signing up again. What has become increasingly obvious, though, is for all the knocks on cable, starting with the fact consumers paid for lots of channels they never watched, its one-stop-shopping approach eliminated some of the challenges springing up now. That old system worked because the \u201cbundle\u201d actually created a mechanism to financially support a vast number of choices serving various tastes. Simply put, paying for ESPN if you don\u2019t like sports, or CNN and MSNBC if you don\u2019t watch news, might have been irritating, but those millions of cable subscriptions spread out the revenue in a way that made dozens and dozens of channels available and affordable. The dream of a more a la carte system, where you pay for what you watch, has turned out to elusive, primarily because there\u2019s no way \u2013 at least yet \u2013 to adopt that where the cost doesn\u2019t become onerous, and maybe even prohibitive, for many consumers. Unwinding the bundle by \u201ccord cutting\u201d on cable subscriptions might have felt good, but in terms of the industry\u2019s economics, that shift opened Pandora\u2019s box. While Disney or Paramount\u2019s profits need not concern consumers, the ability of those companies to produce and present TV shows and movies people want to see does. After cutting the cord, stitching it back together in a different form through re-bundling comes with question marks, and risks. Just ask newspapers that once delivered a physical bundle that landed on people\u2019s doorsteps before the digital age upended their business model. The promises made by executives like Iger, who called Venu \u201ca major win for sports fans,\u201d might very well work out. In theory, consumers could indeed be spared some of the \u201cannoyance and decision-making,\u201d as Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle wrote, associated with keeping track of a half-dozen streaming services, adding that\u2019s \u201cwhy so many consumers prefer things like all-inclusive vacations, and why bundling is a common business practice.\u201d Still, when it comes to implementing structural changes in how entertainment gets distributed and consumed, an adage well known to most Disney characters remains worth remembering: Be careful what you wish for.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/entertainment/streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
