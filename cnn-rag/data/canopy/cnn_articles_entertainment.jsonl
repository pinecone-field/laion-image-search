{"id": "2024_05_21_entertainment_sean-diddy-combs-new-lawsuit-sexual-assault", "text": "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u00a0has been accused of sexual assault in a new lawsuit filed on Tuesday by Crystal McKinney, a former model and winner of MTV\u2019s 1998\u00a0Model\u00a0Mission\u00a0competition show. According to the complaint, filed in New York and obtained by CNN, McKinney claims that she was \u201cdrugged and sexually assaulted\u201d in 2003 by Combs following a Men\u2019s Fashion Week event in New York City. McKinney, who was 22 years old at the time, first met Combs at a dinner, where\u00a0he\u00a0came on to her \u201cin a sexually suggestive manner\u201d\u00a0and told her to call\u00a0him later, the complaint alleges.\u00a0McKinney \u201cfelt confused but hopeful that Combs would fulfill his promises to help her career,\u201d and Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, the complaint continues. At the\u00a0studio,\u00a0Combs\u00a0offered McKinney\u00a0marijuana, which she claims was \u201claced\u201d with \u201ca narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\u201d\u00a0The complaint alleges Combs saw McKinney was \u201cvery intoxicated\u201d and demanded her to follow him as he \u201cphysically led\u201d her to the bathroom. In the bathroom, Combs \u201cbegan kissing her without her consent\u201d and later \u201cforced her to perform oral sex on him,\u201d according to the complaint. After the assault, McKinney claims she felt \u201cmore and more woozy and then lost consciousness,\u201d later waking up in a taxicab heading back to\u00a0the apartment belonging to the designer she was working with at the time. \u201cAs her consciousness returned, Plaintiff realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs,\u201d the complaint reads. CNN has reached out to representatives for Combs and McKinney for comment, as well as representatives for Bad Boy Records, Sean John Clothing LLC, and Universal Music Group Inc., the entities of which were also named as defendants. McKinney is suing the defendants for violation of the New York Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law. According to the New York City Council, the law gives \u201csurvivors of gender-motivated acts of violence more time to pursue civil actions by extending the statute of limitations\u201d and also \u201capplies to such acts committed by parties who direct, enable, participate in, or conspire in a gender-motivated act of violence.\u201d McKinney was crowned the winner of MTV\u2019s Model Mission in 1998 and was awarded a modeling contract with IMG. She became a familiar face on various MTV shows and modeled in a fashion campaign for designer Tommy Hilfiger. As a result of the incident, McKinney became \u201cseverely depressed,\u201d and \u201cexperienced alcohol and drug addiction\u201d as she tried to cope, the complaint claimed. To this day, the complaint states, McKinney still experiences mental health struggles stemming from the alleged assault and has since ceased pursuing a career in modeling. She is seeking an unspecified amount in punitive and compensatory damages. Latest suit in a series against Combs This latest lawsuit comes days after CNN released exclusive surveillance footage that showed Combs physically attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016. The attack was first referenced in a November 2023 lawsuit that Ventura brought against the rap mogul, whom she dated off and on from 2007 to 2018. In her\u00a0complaint\u00a0that was settled a day after being filed, Ventura alleged Combs raped her in 2018 and subjected her to years of repeated physical and other abuses over the course of their relationship. Following the settlement, an attorney for Combs said the \u201cdecision to settle a lawsuit\u2026is in no way an admission of wrongdoing.\u201d Combs\u00a0apologized\u00a0on Sunday for his actions in the video. Ventura\u2019s attorney Meredith Firetog criticized his response saying, \u201cWhen Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.\u201d This is the seventh lawsuit in which\u00a0Combs has\u00a0been named in recent months. Six of those lawsuits,\u00a0including the one filed Tuesday,\u00a0contain allegations\u00a0of sexual assault. One of the six suits names Combs as a defendant but was was brought against Combs\u2019 son, Christian Combs. Only Ventura\u2019s has been settled. Authorities\u00a0searched Diddy\u2019s homes on March 25, 2024, because he is a target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security team that handles human trafficking crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The investigation stems from many of the same sexual assault allegations put forth in the\u00a0civil lawsuits, according to a second law enforcement source familiar with the searches.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-new-lawsuit-sexual-assault/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review", "text": "Seven years after a trilogy that ended with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d didn\u2019t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it\u2019s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity \u2013 the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren \u2013 the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What\u2019s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) \u2013 an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom \u2013 attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (\u201cThe Witcher\u2019s\u201d Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing \u201cThe Planet of the Apes\u201d but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run. Hollywood blockbusters aren\u2019t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these \u201cApes\u201d prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don\u2019t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it\u2019s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d premieres May 10 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_entertainment_ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes", "text": "Audiences will be forgiven if they forget that Ilana Glazer and Michelle Buteau are actually playing roles in their new film \u201cBabes.\u201d The raunchy comedy about a pair of childhood friends who navigate two life-changing pregnancies is right in the wheelhouse for the actors, who have known each other since they were up-and-coming comics and have now both become moms in real life. So is it easier or harder playing roles that might in some ways mimic their real lives? Turns out, it\u2019s both. \u201cI would say easier,\u201d Glazer, of \u201cBroad City\u201d fame, told CNN. \u201cSo much easier.\u201d \u201cEasier to play, easier to understand how tired, how confused, how frustrated, how grateful you are to pump and dump (breastmilk), to have a shot (of alcohol) when you\u2019re off the clock,\u201d Buteau chimed in. \u201cAnd also harder because then you\u2019re away from your kids.\u201d The film \u2013 which is being compared to \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and marketed as \u201ca hilarious and heartfelt comedy about the bonds of friendship and the messy, unpredictable challenges of adulthood and becoming a parent\u201d \u2013 was written by Glazer and actor/producer Josh Rabinowitz, who also worked with her on her famed \u201cBroad City\u201d series. That series, which ran from 2014 to 2019, has a cult following, as does Buteau\u2019s recently renewed Netflix series \u201cSurvival of the Thickest\u201d based on her book of essays of the same title. Suffice it to say with two such funny performers working together, not to mention the other cast members including Hasan Minhaj, Oliver Platt and John Carroll Lynch, it was a rollicking good time on the \u201cBabes\u201d set. \u201cWe were cracking up, like crying,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cMy co-writer Josh Rabinowitz famously during the plumber scene laughed so hard he smacked his head on his chair. He like injured his forehead, we were laughing so hard.\u201d Shooting in 25 days, with Buteau only being available to film for 15, heightened both the tension and the hilarity, they said, and Glazer confirmed that some of the best of those funny moments are being put together as extras for streaming. Director Pamela Adlon, best known for her starring role on acclaimed series \u201cBetter Things,\u201d said it was challenging getting the project done in such a short period of time. Yet the timing couldn\u2019t have been better given that she had just wrapped the final season of her show. Plus, the script really spoke to her, she told CNN. \u201cI read it and it was emotional besides all the comedy. And there was an edginess to it,\u201d Adlon said. \u201cAll those things have to go together for me to really respond to something. I gotta have the dark, I gotta have the funny, I gotta have the heart. It\u2019s gotta hit you in the gut to make you feel, make you cry, but then you gotta have a little light.\u201d Glazer should be proud to know that, as she said she, Rabinowitz and their producer Susie Fox worked really hard to mine their own life experiences as parents to craft a relatable script. \u201cIt was really important for us to have something so funny, but to balance it with heart and emotional heft,\u201d she said. \u201cThose were our guideposts.\u201d \u201cBabes\u201d is in theaters Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/entertainment/ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_entertainment_ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review", "text": "Less than a year after Hulu\u2019s Ashley Madison documentary, Netflix settles for seconds with \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal,\u201d a three-part British production that has the advantage of feeling like roughly four documentaries in one. Part business meltdown, part crime mystery, part media critique, and part \u201ctales of Ashley Madison,\u201d it\u2019s a look at the married-people hookup site that\u2019s plenty salacious and definitely not monotonous. Founded on the theory that a surprising number of married people were signing up for dating sites, Ashley Madison (taken from two popular girl names) began with the slogan \u201cWhen monogamy becomes monotony\u201d before its evolution under CEO Noel Biderman to the more in-your-face line, \u201cLife is short. Have an affair.\u201d Yet while the company enjoyed explosive subscriber growth, and Biderman became media catnip by making the rounds subjecting himself to the righteous indignation of (mostly outraged) TV interviewers, the dirty secret was that Ashley Madison hadn\u2019t taken the promised steps to protect its data, leaving itself vulnerable to a 2015 hack that exposed thousands of clients. \u201cIt was like gambling with people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Evan Back, a sales executive and strategist who is one of the former employees interviewed. In one respect, director Toby Paton approaches the new docuseries in a manner that\u2019s very much of a piece with the daytime-TV mentality Biderman successfully exploited at the time from a marketing standpoint, working off the theory that there was no such thing as bad publicity for a site offering the prospect of adulterous hookups made easy. \u201cAshley Madison\u201d thus spends a lot of time chronicling a few specific soap-opera-worthy tales of lives that were upended when the hacked information went public, such as the fallout for Sam Rader, a Dallas area Christian vlogger who had secretly signed up, and his wife, Nia. At the same time, the docuseries both builds a kind of strange suspense toward the hack, on multiple levels, while providing a pointed media dissection of the voyeurism, with a touch of schadenfreude often masquerading as journalism that made this story so irresistible. As the cherry on top, Paton also devotes a portion of the series to the investigation into the hackers, self-identified as The Impact Team, which didn\u2019t behave like most corporate hackers in the way it presented its demands, leaving lingering questions and speculation regarding its motives. Put all that together, and \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\u201d lives up \u2013 or perhaps better, down \u2013 to its name. Like the ad said, life is short when it comes to committing to another docuseries. Still, people will no doubt be willing to take the leap for a story with such delicious \u201cThere but for the grace of God\u2026\u201d overtones. \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\u201d premieres May 15 in Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/entertainment/ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

It was an exciting season full of star-studded cameos (hello Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce), instantly classic sketches and snarky political impersonations. Emma Stone and Kristen Wiig became the latest five-timers club inductees and an iconic spoof of two Comedy Central cartoon characters had us all laughing our faces off. Take a look at our best selects: \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d Even \u201cSNL\u201d veteran Heidi Gardner couldn\u2019t stop herself from laughing at Mikey Day and host Ryan Gosling\u2019s physical transformation into \u201890s cartoon icons Beavis and Butt-Head in an instantly classic sketch in April. Clips of Gardner breaking character immediately went viral, and Day and Gosling continued to ride the wave when they later appeared at Gosling\u2019s \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d movie premiere in their Beavis and Butt-Head getups. \u201cI\u2019m Just Pete\u201d \u201cSNL\u201d alum Pete Davidson kicked off Season 49 as host in October, and appeared in a hilarious sketch spoofing the Oscar-nominated \u201cBarbie\u201d song \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d with his own rendition titled \u201cI\u2019m Just Pete.\u201d Davidson sang, \u201cI\u2019m just Pete, my dating life is not discreet,\u201d while cast members performed the song\u2019s choreography with the utmost \u201cKenergy.\u201d \u201cProtective Mom 2\u201d Pedro Pascal made a surprise cameo in an October sketch alongside host and musical guest Bad Bunny, playing cast member Marcello Hernandez\u2019s judgmental Spanish-speaking mom who trash-talks his White girlfriend (Chloe Troast) through a comical half-English-half-Spanish conversation. Pascal, wearing a wig and pink outfit, eventually fawns over Troast when she insists Hernandez eat something \u2013 as moms love to do. \u201cRome Song\u201d Jason Momoa hosted a November episode of \u201cSNL\u201d and rapped about the viral Roman Empire social media trend in a wild music video sketch. Suddenly appearing in a gladiator costume on a Roman colosseum-looking set and accompanied by backup dancers, Momoa rapped, \u201cThe Roman Empire, ancient Rome. Five times a day it pops into my dome.\u201d \u201cABBA Christmas\u201d Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and Bowen Yang joined host Kate McKinnon in December to appear in an incredibly funny sketch framed as a retro paid TV advertisement that spoofed a fictional Christmas album by Swedish pop supergroup group ABBA. The foursome performed classic ABBA songs with a holiday twist, including a song sung in the style of \u201cMamma Mia\u201d where they poked fun at the group\u2019s signature style of singing while \u201cstanding close facing different directions.\u201d Watching everyone barely being able to hold it together makes this skit one for the books. Caitlin Clark on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d Freshly minted WNBA star Caitlin Clark made a surprise cameo in an April \u201cWeekend Update\u201d bit where she told a couple of shady jokes about anchor and comedian Michael Che \u2013 and then made him read some jokes that she wrote \u2013 proving that she can deliver both on the court and off. She capped off her appearance on a sentimental note when she thanked a number of WNBA legends who \u201ckicked down the door so I could walk inside.\u201d \u201cEarthquake and Eclipse\u201d on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d \u201cSNL\u201d cast members Kenan Thompson and Marcello Hernandez had us all shook, with laughter, when they personified the 2024 total solar eclipse and 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rocked the Northeast, respectively, in another ridiculously memorable \u201cWeekend Update\u201d bit in April. \u201cSOTU Cold Open\u201d with Scarlett Johansson as Sen. Katie Britt When Republican Sen. Katie Britt\u2019s 2024 State of the Union rebuttal went viral, social media was buzzing about which star would impersonate the Alabama Senator on the then-upcoming episode of \u201cSNL.\u201d Marvel star (and Mrs. Colin Jost) Scarlett Johansson then made an iconic surprise cameo when she scored the job, hilariously satirizing Britt\u2019s rebuttal in the March episode\u2019s cold open with quips like, \u201dYou see, I\u2019m not just a mother. I\u2019m a wife, a mother, and the craziest b\u2014h in the Target parking lot.\u201d \u201cAirplane Baby\u201d December host Adam Driver acting as a cranky baby named \u201clittle Eddie\u201d on an airplane, with his adult-sized head appearing atop a baby\u2019s body, was one of the most awkward and memorable sketches of this season. His mom (Sarah Sherman) paid no mind to his disruptive cries, messy spit-ups, shouts about missing \u201cthe womb\u201d and attempt to put his whole baby fist in his mouth, despite how much his adult-like facial features and fully-developed speech were creeping out the other passengers. \u201cHot Ones with Beyonc\u00e9 2\u201d Can you imagine Beyonc\u00e9 actually sitting down to eat increasingly spicy hot wings on \u201cHot Ones,\u201d the internet\u2019s favorite hot wing interview show? Well, Mikey Day and Maya Rudolph gave it their best go when Rudolph reprised her classic impersonation of the \u201cTexas Hold Em\u201d singer in a \u201cHot Ones\u201d-inspired sketch this month that saw Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s assistant (Kenan Thompson) squirt cooling coco butter lotion into her mouth to help tame the heat. \u201cBowen\u2019s Straight\u201d Sydney Sweeney admits that she has an \u201citsy-bitsy crush\u201d on \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Bowen Yang, who in real life identifies as LGBTQ+, in a comical pre-taped sketch from March that showed an alternate universe in which Yang is straight. \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m full hetero,\u201d Yang tells Sweeney, before the pair are seen making out in a dressing room. The ridiculously funny sketch featured Yang being a total ladies man who blows off a very sad Sweeney in the end.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/entertainment/saturday-night-live-season-49-best-sketches/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

So, the transformation doesn\u2019t fix anything,\u201d Coughlan said. In an unexpected twist, Colin takes on the role of mentor, helping Penelope navigatethe world of courtship. And it works, with Penelope soon attracting the attention of LordDebling (Sam Phillips), a character who doesn\u2019t appear in the books. Almost inevitably, this sparks jealousy in Colin. In a Season 3 preview, we see himpensively ask his mother, \u201cIs the best foundation for love friendship?\u201d While fans ofthe series will be screaming \u201cYES\u201d at their TV screens, Coughlan emphasizes thecharacters must go on a crucial journey of self-love before coming together. \u201cThere\u2019s a real overarching theme throughout the story with both Colin and Pen, ofthem learning to love themselves, as cheesy as that sounds,\u201d Coughlan said cringingly. \u201cBut it\u2019s so important. Once they learn to live in who they are, that\u2019s when they really, trulyblossom.\u201d Newton chimed in, \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other for a really long time, they know each other\u2019s insecurities, and it\u2019s about accepting that person rather than idolizing a version of them that just isn\u2019t real.\u201d As this season\u2019s main love interest, Newton admitted to feeling slight pressure, but said he\u2019s embracing the legacy left by his predecessors (Bailey along with Season 1\u2019s Reg\u00e9-Jean Page as Simon Basset) while bringing a fresh take on the archetype. \u201cHaving sat in this role for the last four years, I felt in a really good place with Colin. He has a lot of traits that the previous male leads didn\u2019t quite have. He\u2019s got this sensitivity and empathy for other characters,\u201d he said. Unlocking their sexual chemistry Coughlan and Newton said that becoming series leads felt exciting and natural. Their strong bond and open communication allowed them to \u201cunlock\u201d their chemistry rather than having to work on it, proving invaluable when filming \u201cBridgerton\u2019s\u201d famous love scenes. \u201cIn the lead up, I was very nervous,\u201d Coughlan admitted. \u201cBut then once we got into it,we had so much control over what we were doing. They ended up being really fun and watching them back, I think they\u2019re really beautiful.\u201d What the pair aren\u2019t comfortable with is dishing out dating advice. Both insisted theyaren\u2019t qualified to give modern-day advice (asking for a friend), but they believe thatultimately, Colin, Penelope and the rest of us are \u201cjust human.\u201d \u201cYou can have a crush, but don\u2019t think that they\u2019re the be-all and end-all,\u201d Coughlaninstructed.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_back-to-black-review-marisa-abela-amy-winehouse", "text": "The tragic arc of Amy Winehouse\u2019s brief life and nova-like career creates built-in problems for a biography of the singer, which doesn\u2019t dampen the knockout performance by Marisa Abela in \u201cBack to Black,\u201d capturing the talent, rage and self-destructiveness that defined her. Thin as biopics go, the power of Abela\u2019s portrayal elevates the film, providing a poignance and strength that\u2019s the clearest motivation to go, go, go. Indeed, Winehouse\u2019s stratospheric rise and paparazzi-plagued stardom lean in the direction of a fairly one-dimensional story, as she falls head over heels for the troubled Blake (Jack O\u2019Connell), entering into a relationship that combines passion, excess and toxicity in roughly equal measure. At the same time, she\u2019s making her mark as a songwriter and singer, though her fondness for drink (and Blake\u2019s dalliances with drugs) goes hand in hand with that \u2013 tendencies that provoke less concern than they seemingly should from her father (Eddie Marsan) and colorful grandmother (Lesley Manville), a one-time jazz singer who isn\u2019t above telling tales out of school about the likes of Tony Bennett. Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (whose credits include the John Lennon biopic \u201cNowhere Boy\u201d as well as \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d) from a script by Matt Greenhalgh, \u201cBack to Black\u201d tilts too heavily toward Winehouse\u2019s personal struggles at the expense of her musical triumphs. Then again, as constructed here, the two went hand in hand, with the lyrics to songs like \u201cBack to Black\u201d and \u201cRehab\u201d directly addressing her addictions to her relationship with Blake and alcohol. Having appeared in the HBO series \u201cIndustry,\u201d Abela pulls off this remarkably challenging character both musically and dramatically, in a way that isn\u2019t necessarily sympathetic \u2013 to the extent Winehouse is often the author of her own troubles \u2013 but rather, magnetic. Ill-equipped for the demands of fame, she achieved it with sheer ferocity and talent, becoming the sort of commodity where the train\u2019s moving too fast to slow down much for warning signs. Of course, just making a movie about Winehouse invites charges of exploiting her tragic end at age 27 as opposed to celebrating her talent, but that\u2019s an issue that can be laid at the feet of any number of gone-too-soon musical biographies, from \u201cThe Doors\u201d to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d (The recent \u201cBob Marley: One Love\u201d was notably made with the blessing and participation of his family and felt like a licensed product.) In terms of capturing what animated Winehouse, the blinding star power that Abela emits here ultimately justifies the exercise. As for whether that means seeing \u201cBack to Black\u201d now in a theater or later at home, it\u2019s the kind of small-boned movie that, unlike its subject, doesn\u2019t quite have the feel of a headliner. \u201cBack to Black\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_if-review-ryan-reynolds-john-krasinski", "text": "Occasionally a movie gets misleadingly marketed for understandable reasons, and so it is with \u201cIF,\u201d a sweetly sentimental film from writer-director John Krasinski that the ads make look like a madcap romp. The best parts should strike a mildly receptive chord with parents while potentially boring younger kids, a prescription that could subject the movie\u2019s imaginary friends to a harsh reality once audiences in summer-movie mode get a good look at it. After his breakout success with \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (whose delayed prequel will arrive in June), Krasinski shifts toward a PG-rated movie built around animated characters, infused with a family-friendly vibe. Yet it\u2019s no accident that the classic James Stewart movie \u201cHarvey\u201d at one point plays on the TV, since \u201cIF\u201d seeks the same whimsical tone, while owing perhaps its strongest debt to the 1995 film adaptation of \u201cA Little Princess\u201d \u2013 which also focuses on a young girl dealing with grief, loss and uncertainty \u2013 brightened by detours into the fantastic. Bea (Cailey Fleming, delivering a splendid anchoring performance after growing up among \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) has already lost her mom, and now her dad (Krasinski) is hospitalized as he awaits heart surgery. Forced to stay with her grandma (Fiona Shaw), Bea discovers a neighbor (Ryan Reynolds in kinder, gentler mode) who works to find new homes for imaginary friends (or IFs) whose kids have grown up and forgotten them. The imaginary friends, not surprisingly, turn out to be an eclectic and colorful lot, featuring a wide assortment of celebrity voices, among them Krasinski\u2019s wife, Emily Blunt, and the late Louis Gossett Jr. The most prominent imaginary pair each have notable connections to other cast members: Krasinski\u2019s \u201cThe Office\u201d co-star Steve Carell, whose needy Blue bears a too-strong resemblance to McDonald\u2019s Grimace; and Blossom, voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who produced \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d which co-starred Shaw. As Bea states at the outset, she no longer considers herself a kid given what she\u2019s endured, which makes the dual mission pretty overt \u2013 not just finding kids to go with these eccentric monsters, but helping the girl rediscover the wonders of childhood. In that latter regard, Krasinski conjures some touching, lovely moments, although they coexist awkwardly with the imperative to wring laughs and sight gags out of the computer-generated characters, which, however impressively they\u2019re rendered, has the effect of flattening the movie. In one respect, it\u2019s admirable that Krasinski would try to parlay whatever clout he\u2019s amassed into something more heartfelt, but that approach might have fared better by sparing the demands and expectations that go with lining up all those big names, lavish premieres, colorful character posters and marketing tie-ins. Simply put, it\u2019s a tough needle to thread. \u201cSometimes, life doesn\u2019t always have to be fun,\u201d Bea somberly tells her dad early on, as he tries to lift her spirits and allay her fears. \u201cIF\u201d does make the case for finding the fun in life, but in a movie that needs to be more fun than it is. \u201cIF\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_20_entertainment_rick-and-morty-animated-tv-series-cec", "text": "After 10 years on the air, \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d the animated sci-fi comedy about a misanthropic scientist and his 14-year-old grandson\u2019s interdimensional adventures, is surprising as ever. In its seven seasons, it has steered its characters through apocalypses, divorces, an alien musical reality TV competition and school dances \u2014 events with equal gravity in its off-kilter universe. There are very few rules in \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d which makes the job all the more fun for its writers, who are working on its eighth and ninth seasons now. But in the middle of its seventh season, which ended in December, \u201cRick and Morty\u201d made its most shocking move yet \u2013\u2013\u00a0it finally gave Rick what he\u2019s spent more than half of his 70-odd years seeking. Rick finally killed his mortal enemy, Rick Prime, in the fifth episode of the show\u2019s recent 10-episode season. Rick Prime, a cruel version of Rick from another dimension, killed our Rick\u2019s wife, throwing his life off-course. Our protagonist\u2019s curdled, single-minded pursuit of vengeance eventually led him to rejoin his family, recruit his daughter Beth\u2019s teenage children for his interdimensional travels and set the series in motion. But true to \u201cRick and Morty\u2019s\u201d deeply cynical tone, Rick feels nothing when he kills Rick Prime in a series of increasingly brutal punches. Afterwards, back at his family home, while Morty rejoices in Rick\u2019s \u201cvictory,\u201d Rick is as numb as a zombie. The act of killing his enemy, Rick realizes, was ultimately meaningless and does nothing to ease the loss of his wife. It takes him a few episodes to shake his despair. \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d says series writer Heather Anne Campbell, is incredibly silly but utterly serious about the weirdness of being alive.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get at some deeper, funnier, dumber, more nihilistic truth about what we\u2019re doing here,\u201d Campbell told CNN. \u201cThe most effective way to demonstrate that to an audience is like, yeah, have you achieved your goal? And it doesn\u2019t feel like anything? What does that mean? Because that\u2019s something everybody experiences, I think, all the time.\u201d To love \u201cRick and Morty\u201d is to know that it can go anywhere at any time, from the planet Alphabetrium, made up of letter-shaped beings including the rapper Ice-T, to Viking Valhalla with Bigfoot. There are endless possibilities in the world(s) it\u2019s built, where substance-addled scientist Rick is the self-proclaimed smartest man in the universe and can do pretty much anything except readily admit his love for Morty, granddaughter Summer or Beth, or anyone beyond his best friend, the recently resurrected Bird Person. The season wasn\u2019t all major revelations and deeply sad dramatic beats, though. Just a week before that pivotal installment, \u201cRick and Morty\u201d aired an episode in which Rick feeds his family delicious spaghetti that they discover was made from a dead body. (Campbell wrote that one, plus the season seven finale.) That\u2019s the fulfilling joy of writing for \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d Campbell says \u2013\u2013 its \u201cinfinite sandbox.\u201d No idea is off limits as long as it rings true in the universe of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d and to its viewers, be it the moral cost of a spaghetti dinner or the emptiness felt after vanquishing a foe. \u201cThe six seasons previous have shown us that literally anything can be an episode,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the strength of the show is taking any of these completely absurd sci-fi concepts and really interrogating them and trying to illuminate some stupid truth about what life is and what we\u2019re experiencing.\u201d Rick made major strides in season seven, with one major setback As in previous seasons, \u201cRick and Morty\u2019s\u201d seventh season was profane, uproariously funny and often deeply upsetting. (\u201cRick and Morty\u201d is a property of Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN.) It was the first to air after Justin Roiland, who co-created the series with Dan Harmon and voiced both title characters, was fired due to allegations of sexual assault. But his departure didn\u2019t kneecap the series \u2013\u2013 new actors Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden were brought in to voice Rick and Morty, respectively, and the show continues to probe the mysteries of life in outlandish scenarios, asking questions like, Would you stage an intervention for your alcoholic friend whose wife left him for the Predator? And also, what if Hugh Jackman was there? Nihilism is where \u201cRick and Morty\u201d thrives \u2013\u2013\u00a0in the very first season, our title characters abandoned Morty\u2019s home planet with his parents and sister still on it after they unleashed a Cronenberg-ian mutation that turned everyone into oozing, murderous monsters, and all because Morty asked Rick for a love potion. But by the end of this seventh season, our title characters have emotionally matured somewhat. The pair get a subtly sweet moment in the season finale: Rick and Morty have grown jaded by the horrors they\u2019ve seen across dimensions and find they can no longer be scared. Eager to feel the jitters again, they leap into something called the Fear Hole, which brings to life their deepest anxieties. For Morty, that\u2019s a life where Rick leaves. Inside the hole, Morty meets a version of Diane, Rick\u2019s dead wife. Morty\u2019s fear manifests a version of Rick, who Diane tries to convince to stay in the hole \u2014\u00a0even though it\u2019ll kill him. Morty finally climbs out of the hole, but only after confronting his fear that Rick could leave the family as suddenly as he reentered their lives, stranding Morty in an unremarkable life once again. \u201cAm I \u2026 irreplaceable?\u201d Morty asks Rick once he\u2019s left the hole. Rick, ever withholding, counters: \u201cDefine irreplaceable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good \u2026 good,\u201d Morty says, hugging Rick tightly, a rarity in the series. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d Teetering on the edge of the hole, which is inexplicably located in a bathroom stall inside a Denny\u2019s, Rick is briefly tempted to find Diane, a choice made weightier by Rick\u2019s recent killing of the man who killed her. Instead, he pulls a photo of Morty out of his wallet and pins it to a corkboard inside the stall to signify, with pride, that his grandson is one of the few to make it out of the Fear Hole alive. It\u2019s as close as Rick can come to admitting he loves his grandson. The quiet moment lands because it\u2019s taken Rick so long to go that far \u2013\u2013\u00a0and leaves the rest of the series wide open. It\u2019s an exciting prospect for viewers and even for Cardoni, the new voice of Rick, who doesn\u2019t know where the series is headed either. \u201cThe character is growing,\u201d Cardoni told CNN ahead of the finale. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some great turns with (Rick) just in the season, in terms of his emotional health and mental health. We\u2019ve seen it working, and we\u2019re seeing him open up in different ways. I\u2019ll bring to that whatever I can, but I think the character is what\u2019s alive now.\u201d On a show where anything can happen, everything will Because an episode of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d can start from anything, Campbell pitched the idea for suicide spaghetti. It starts out like a \u201cclassic \u2018Rick and Morty\u2019 adventure\u201d in which Morty morally objects to something Rick does \u2013\u2013 in this case, serving delicious spaghetti to his family that\u2019s actually made from the remains of people whose insides turn to pasta only when they die by suicide. Harmon wasn\u2019t sold on the concept as an entire episode at first, Campbell said, but encouraged her to riff on it. It turned into \u201cThat\u2019s Amorte.\u201d At first, the episode feels like it\u2019s taking a blackly comic take on taboo subjects to disturbing extremes \u2013\u2013\u00a0fairly typical terrain for a series that once featured a \u201csoul orgy\u201d between Rick, Morty and Summer, plus a gaggle of dragons. But it turns oddly moving once the suicide spaghetti industry balloons and Morty finds himself complicit in its success. Rick ends the demand for pasta for good by hooking a dying man up to a machine that broadcasts scenes from his life to those watching across the planet. Eating the remains of a man who lived, lost and loved is suddenly no longer appetizing. \u201cI wanted to get across that life is not a direct path from one point to another \u2013\u2013\u00a0it is a constantly meandering river,\u201d Campbell said of the montage of the man\u2019s life. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t rob it of meaning, especially if you look at the entire thing all at once.\u201d The spaghetti episode only worked because co-creator Dan Harmon and showrunner Scott Marder were \u201cfully indulgent and patient\u201d in letting Campbell explore pasta as a plot device and developed it with her from the very beginning of the pitch process, she said. \u201cTapping that excitement for an area usually leads to stronger drafts for each episode on the whole,\u201d Marder told CNN. As for the ideas that make it that far, the \u201cenergy in the writer\u2019s room\u201d is the most important barometer of potential, Harmon told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about everyone laughing, but it is about them being excited \u2013\u2013 when two or more writers start talking over each other, and everyone is pitching very different possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf two people can disagree fundamentally about how they\u2019d use X-ray glasses, that\u2019s a sign there may be a story\u2019s worth of energy in X-ray glasses.\u201d Or, spaghetti. Campbell\u2019s pasta-centric episode tonally fits right in alongside the bleak episode in which Rick Prime dies. \u201cWe always say every episode needs to run a marathon, in terms of its lifespan, from a kernel of an idea to making it to air,\u201d Marder said, \u201cso an idea really works when it\u2019s got a strong enough engine in it to help power it, and our enthusiasm for it, through that 26-mile race.\u201d \u201cRick and Morty\u201d writers are working on the next three seasons at once, in varying stages of development. It\u2019s helpful that way, Campbell said, because they can easily chart how a major canonical move will reverberate in a future season. For example: With his death, Rick Prime ceded his position as the show\u2019s major villain to Evil Morty, who helped our Rick find his nemesis \u2014 but, by the episode\u2019s end, has the power to destroy all Ricks in every dimension, upsetting the show\u2019s balance at any time. Where \u201cRick and Morty\u201d goes next is anyone\u2019s guess, especially with a dead Rick Prime and rogue Evil Morty. But the unknown is the point of the series, Campbell said. \u201cThe future is so terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing alive is a puzzle. And those things colliding against each other is where the show is going.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/entertainment/rick-and-morty-animated-tv-series-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

We\u2019re good mimics, but I didn\u2019t want to pick one specific person and try to do them because I knew it had to be my own style,\u201d Smart said. \u201cIt had to come from me and my sense of humor and timing and things like that. And I\u2019ve always liked watching comedians, so it\u2019s one of my favorite parts of the show that I get to do standup now.\u201d The third season of \u201cHacks\u201d finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism.

Smart shared her thoughts why it remains harder for female comedians to break through. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really interesting topic,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s still this prevailing feeling that women aren\u2019t really as funny as men or that they shouldn\u2019t be off color and things like that.

Barrymore even filmed a commercial with her dog, Douglas, in support of the campaign (Jeremy, her bearded dragon, makes a cameo) in which she has to explain to her pup that she can\u2019t submit his photo because he\u2019s a \u201cnepo puppy.\u201d She recently lost her golden retriever, Lucy, a month ago, an experience Barrymore said \u201cwas so hard.\u201d \u201cThe whole show built like a memorial wall to her, which was so sweet. \u2018cause everyone in the building was so affected,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we all started in Covid, we weren\u2019t allowed to have guests or people. So, I would bring the dogs and they just made everything feel so much safer and cozier.\u201d Barrymore has been connected to animals almost since the beginning. She began her acting career as an infant and her first commercial was for a Purina puppy chow when she was a toddler. As a young adult she shared her home with cats and now as a 49 year-old mother of two young daughters her pets are a big part of the family. \u201cThere\u2019s just this like, unspoken relationship that you have this connection, this constant companion, this love that is just so profound,\u201d Barrymore said. \u201cMy dogs sleep in my bed with me and so do my cats and it makes me feel like a whole human being.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I won\u2019t sleep with my friends,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m weird about sharing a bed, but with my kids and animals, I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d She joked that she could have used a Ring camera on set as Lucy loved to wander around her daytime talk show. \u201cWe use cameras to watch babies. I certainly had many, many baby monitors,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God. Between the two kids. I felt like I was wrapped up in baby monitor cords. So yes, I\u2019m like, this totally makes sense.\u201d And while she loves the family she\u2019s built, Barrymore said she\u2019s not anxious to grow it. \u201cAfter we lost Lucy, the girls were like, we should get another dog for Douglas,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, another dog for Douglas will be my undoing. I can\u2019t do it right now.  I think it\u2019ll be a minute.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/entertainment/drew-barrymore-pets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_20_entertainment_bridgerton-staircase-scene-season-3", "text": "This article may contain spoilers for Bridgerton Season 3. Dearest gentle reader\u2026 By now, viewers have had time to watch the first four episodes of the highly anticipated third season of Bridgerton.\u00a0This season turned its focus to\u00a0the love story between Penelope\u00a0Featherington\u00a0(Nicola Coughlan) and\u00a0Colin Bridgerton\u2019s (Luke Newton), who the internet has lovingly nicknamed #Polin. After hearing Colin\u2019s disparaging words about her at the end of Season 2, Penelope decides to take a husband. Thinking it will help her chances with finding a match, she decides to get a makeover, starting with her clothes. In the first episode, \u201cOut of the Shadows,\u201d Penelope abandons her family\u2019s usual\u00a0bright citrus colors and lets her hair down. When she arrives at the ball wearing an ornate emerald gown, everyone in attendance turns their attention to her as she descends the stairs. That scene in particular was inspired by the 1999 romantic comedy, \u201cShe\u2019s All That,\u201d according to showrunner Jess Brownell. The movie features a scene in which geeky protagonist Laney Boggs, played by Rachael Leigh Cook, comes down the stairs to the song \u201cKiss Me\u201d following a makeover in which she trades her glasses for a pair of heels she can barely walk on. Brownell, told Final Draft\u2019s \u201cWrite On\u201d podcast that it was important to include a makeover scene in the season that pays homage to romantic comedies. \u201cRom-coms have been the movies that have informed\u00a0my approach to writing more than anything,\u201d Brownell said, also listing John Hughes films and \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d starring Patrick Dempsey. But the writing and producing team also wanted to give a fresh spin on the trope to avoid any pitfalls. \u201cWe talked a lot in the [writer\u2019s] room about the fact that the makeover trope can be problematic in a lot of ways \u2013 to suggest that a woman should just take off her glasses and let her hair down and instantly she\u2019s going to be so much more appealing.\u201d For \u201cBridgerton,\u201d Brownell says they decided to make the makeover about Penelope\u2019s internal journey and \u201cher need to find her confidence and step into her truth.\u201d The references to rom-coms didn\u2019t stop there this season. While the first two seasons portrayed the fake dating and enemies to lovers tropes, this season is all about two people going from friends to lovers. At one point, Colin decides to help Penelope\u2019s search for a husband by offering his advice, leading to several hilarious scenes in which she fails miserably at talking to potential suitors. But Penelope catches the eye of Lord Debling (Sam Phillips), causing a love triangle. The show also further develops its resident mean girl, Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen). Like your typical rom-com bully, Cressida has been a rival to other characters also searching for husbands. In Season 1, she threatened to spread a story about Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Bassett that would have damaged both of their reputations. This season, viewers see a more humanized version of Cressida as she desperately searches for a husband in her third year just like Penelope. If she doesn\u2019t find a husband this year, her parents will find one for her. \u201cNo mean girl is born a mean girl. There\u2019s always an origin story. We realize that Cressida, in fact, comes from a difficult home where her parents aren\u2019t nearly as loving as either the Bridgertons or even the Featheringtons,\u201d Brownell added. \u201cThere\u2019s room for some reflection and some growth in her as well.\u201d The first four episodes of Bridgerton Season 3 are now available to stream on Netflix. Bridgerton Season 3 Part 2 will premiere June 13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/entertainment/bridgerton-staircase-scene-season-3/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

He was 92. Coleman died on Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, according to a statement from his daughter Quincy Coleman sent to CNN by the late actor\u2019s manager Jeff Goldberg. \u201cMy father crafted his time here on Earth with a curious mind, a generous heart and a soul on fire with passion, desire and humor that tickled the funny bone of humanity. As he lived, he moved through this final act of his life with elegance, excellence and mastery,\u201d Quincy Coleman\u2019s statement read. \u201cA teacher, a hero and a king, Dabney Coleman is a gift and blessing in life and in death as his spirit will shine through his work, his loved ones and his legacy \u2026 eternally.\u201d An Austin, Texas native, Coleman studied law and served in the US Army before pursuing acting as a career, according to a biography. His Hollywood career spans decades, beginning in the early 1960s up until his final credit in 2019, when he appeared on an episode of \u201cYellowstone.\u201d A gifted comedic actor who moved between movies and television, Coleman was often cast as a bad guy or at best, a lovable jerk. That included roles in the Academy Award-winning film \u201cOn Golden Pond,\u201d the sci-fi drama feature \u201cWarGames\u201d and perhaps most famously as the firmly pre-#MeToo, highly lecherous boss in the movie \u201c9 to 5,\u201d in which he starred opposite Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. Coleman worked extensively in television through the 1960s and \u201870s, often in guest roles before landing the soap-opera spoof \u201cMary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\u201d He appeared in a recurring part on the sitcom \u201cThat Girl\u201d in the mid-1960s, but another decade passed before he landed the role of Merle Jeter on \u201cHartman\u201d in 1976, which Coleman, in a 2012 interview, would call \u201cthe turning point in my career.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where it all started, as far as people\u2019s belief that I could do comedy, particularly that negative, caustic, cynical kind of guy,\u201d he told the AV Club, in a nod to some his note notable roles like in \u201c9 to 5.\u201d Coleman really broke out, though, in the 1980s, including supporting roles in the Oscar-winning comedy \u201cTootsie\u201d opposite Dustin Hoffman, \u201cThe Muppets Take Manhattan,\u201d and starring in a pair of critically acclaimed if relatively short-lived TV series, \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d and \u201cThe Slap Maxwell Story.\u201d Coleman received Emmy nominations for both of those series, but won his only Emmy \u2013 out of six total nominations \u2013 for \u201cSworn to Silence\u201d a 1987 dramatic TV movie. Coleman also won a Golden Globe in 1988 for his performance in \u201cSlap Maxwell.\u201d Other roles included playing Mr. Drysdale in the movie version of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d and the ruthless Commodore in the HBO drama \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d along with his more recent turn in the hit drama \u201cYellowstone.\u201d On Friday, Goldberg added that \u201cit has been a great privilege to have represented Dabney and to have been able to call him my friend.

{"id": "2024_05_17_entertainment_the-big-cigar-review-huey-p-newton", "text": "Long before \u201cfake news,\u201d \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d looks back to the time of a fake movie \u2013 specifically, one designed to provide Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton cover to flee America for Cuba. Yet what should be an enticing mashup of the civil-rights movement and Hollywood in the freewheeling \u201870s doesn\u2019t entirely ignite, in a limited series whose underlying true story packs more of wallop than the finished product. The story, certainly, has a stranger-than-fiction aspect, and anyone familiar with this period will likely be fascinated by the bold-face names that basically just pass through. That said, the Apple TV+ show provides a snapshot of a window in time that doesn\u2019t quite come to life. At its core, \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d resembles the recent Paramount+ series \u201cThe Offer,\u201d about the making of \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d in capturing the rebel spirit that swept through Hollywood in the early \u201870s, fueled by the anti-war movement. Here, that mentality is embodied by the colorful Bert Schneider (\u201cThe Many Saints of Newark\u201d star Alessandro Nivola), the counterculture producer of \u201cEasy Rider\u201d and \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d who went on to make headlines with his controversial 1975 Oscar acceptance speech for the latter. Before that, Schneider was connected to Black Panther leader Newton (Andr\u00e9 Holland), who had already done time in prison and faced an additional sentence when the police framed him, he maintained, for the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Deciding to seek exile, he warily becomes involved with Schneider, who hatched the plan of faking a movie (\u201cThe Big Cigar,\u201d explaining the title) to obscure the details of their elaborate scheme. In a sign of those times, personalities like Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen and Richard Pryor cross Schneider\u2019s path, but Newton possesses a different kind of real-world star power that the producer clearly finds intoxicating. As Newton reminds him, they\u2019re playing around with his life, not some game, with Schneider often treating the whole experience like a film shoot with production fires to be put out, much to the chagrin of his producing partner Steve Blauner (P.J. Byrne). Consisting of six episodes that generally run 40 minutes or less, \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d moves reasonably well, while boasting star credentials behind the camera as well, with Don Cheadle among the producers and directing the first two episodes. The story, however, bogs down at times as both the producer and revolutionary deal with their respective bureaucracies, while Newton wrestles with paranoia \u2013 much of it admittedly legitimate \u2013 about the police lurking outside every door and listening at every keyhole. Adapted from a magazine article, \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d bills itself as being mostly true, granting it the license to engage in some flights of fancy when the story would have likely been better served by either giving in to those satirical impulses or rigidly adhering to the facts. From that perspective the show peaks early when Newton, as the narrator, expresses skepticism that Hollywood will tell his story right. Landing somewhere in between, \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d justifies those misgivings, presenting a wonderfully rich historical moment in a less than fully engaging way. In terms of reaching the top tier of limited series, score that as close, but no cigar. \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d premieres May 17 on Apple TV+.

{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling", "text": "Superhero movies have seen better days at the box office, but an action-comedy based on a 1980s TV show still feels like an unlikely candidate to kick off the summer. Buoyed by the lure of what Ryan Gosling can do for a post-\u201cBarbie\u201d encore (or Ken-core), \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d is too flat in the early going to fully meet that challenge, rallying toward the end without reaching the heights required to make a really big splash. At its best, director David Leitch (\u201cDeadpool 2\u201d) has served up a movie defined by its love for the movies, and specifically, the stunt work where he cut his professional teeth before shifting into the big chair. In that sense, the TV series that starred Lee Majors (a show most memorable for its theme song, which is featured) creates a very loose template to set up a vehicle about a stuntman whose troubles spill off the screen into real life, forcing him to put his skills to use dealing with real bad guys. Getting there requires some buildup, with Gosling\u2019s Colt Seavers introduced serving as the stunt double for a typically self-absorbed star, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), while becoming involved with Jody (Emily Blunt), a fellow member of the crew. An accident derails Colt\u2019s plans and indeed life, and time passes before he\u2019s called out of retirement by Gail (\u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham), the fast-talking, troubleshooting producer on all of Ryder\u2019s films. Of course, he\u2019d probably stay safely at home if the space epic in question didn\u2019t mark Jody\u2019s directing debut, offering the prospect of a reunion that, naturally, doesn\u2019t go as smoothly as he hoped. There are also hidden reasons for the renewed interest in Colt, which has to do with offscreen shenanigans and Ryder becoming involved with some nefarious characters. That forces Colt into what amounts to private-eye mode, using his movie-trained skills to get himself both into and out of perilous situations. Setting all that up, including the romance, results in some arid stretches between the elaborate stunts, which are ultimately the main source of \u201cThe Fall Guy\u2019s\u201d appeal and certainly its comedy. Gosling imbues Colt with a goofy charm and amusing neediness, but the underlying premise was a trifle strained even back in the Reagan era, and putting the whole thing on steroids for the movies doesn\u2019t completely address those issues. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d thus stands out primarily for smaller moments and wrinkles, such as Colt\u2019s boss (Winston Duke) constantly quoting movie lines to him, Taylor-Johnson sounding a whole lot like Matthew McConaughey, and a stunt dog trained to respond to French, including an especially juvenile command. Perhaps foremost, \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d feels burdened by the weight of expectations and its positioning as a major blockbuster when the movie really operates as a light-hearted ode to the unknown stuntman, in a way that\u2019s basically just amiably OK. Gosling has broad shoulders, but trying to make it anything more than that is, even for him, a heavy lift. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d premieres May 3 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_entertainment_trump-trial-harvey-weinstein-ambra-battilana-gutierrez", "text": "For years, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez says she knew she was being silenced. It was 2015 when the Italian model says she was assaulted by then movie mogul Harvey Weinstein during a casting meeting. She immediately went to the police to report what happened, assuming law enforcement would help her. Nearly a decade later, she is still searching for answers \u2013 not, she says, about just her attack, but what she says are failures of the criminal justice system and how victims are treated. \u201cI was 22 years old, in New York City, I had just got here. I had very little, a thousand dollars, in my bank account and I was assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. I reported him and then I just tried to follow the justice and what they told me to do,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cNow, I know there were so many people against me,\u201d she says. The alleged efforts to silence her have come into clearer focus for Battilana Gutierrez this month \u2013 and not from anything to do with Weinstein, but from the ongoing trial of former President Donald Trump. Battilana Gutierrez says she sees chilling parallels between the alleged conspiracy surrounding a hush-money payment connected to Trump and what happened to her. During Trump\u2019s trial, tabloid king David Pecker \u2013 who oversaw American Media Inc., the parent company to the influential supermarket magazine, The National Enquirer \u2013 testified to buying and suppressing negative stories to help his friend, Trump, win the presidency. \u201cI said that anything that I hear in the marketplace, if I hear anything negative about yourself or if I hear anything about women selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen,\u201d Pecker testified he told Trump. \u201cAnd then he would be able to have them kill in another magazine or have them not be published or somebody would have to purchase them.\u201d He said on the stand that he also looked out for other powerful men he was close to, professionally or personally \u2013 men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, mega talent agent Ari Emanuel and his brother Rahm, who resigned as President Barack Obama\u2019s first Chief of Staff to run for and win the Chicago mayorship. CNN has reached out to representatives for Schwarzenegger, Ari and Rahm Emanuel for comment. But another powerful figure in Pecker\u2019s world who never came up in the Trump trial was Weinstein. \u201cIt would be very interesting to see if he had to speak about the Harvey Weinstein trial,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez said of Pecker. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 Battilana Gutierrez says she was targeted by the National Enquirer in a \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d story operation in 2015 after she told police in New York City that Weinstein groped her breasts and put his hand up her skirt during a casting meeting. She tells CNN that she received an offer of $150,000 from The National Enquirer in 2015 to buy her story. She declined the large sum of money. \u201cThe National Enquirer was in touch with me, and they were asking questions: \u2018What do you want? What do you want?\u2019 because they were trying to buy my story,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez says. \u201cI kept answering, \u2018Nothing.\u2019 I wanted to tell my story, but I wanted to trust someone.\u201d As she was trying to come forward with her story in 2015, suddenly, she was smeared on the front pages of tabloid magazines. \u201cI was put under accusation of not being truthful and to be a prostitute or not a perfect victim because I am a model and I work with bikinis and lingerie. It is ridiculous,\u201d she says. \u201cI just got my life destroyed because the media didn\u2019t know how to buy me. They saw that I didn\u2019t want to be silenced, I didn\u2019t want to get money and they just destroyed my credibility.\u201d Pecker and The National Enquirer\u2019s parent company did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. But during Trump\u2019s trial, Pecker testified to engaging in \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d practices, paying for stories so they would never come to light. Many of the circumstances surrounding Battilana Gutierrez have previously been reported by journalists who helped crack the Weinstein case open. Battilana Gutierrez has spoken to the media extensively as a prominent face of the Weinstein saga \u2013 but up until this conversation with CNN, she has never spoken on-the-record to the media herself about many of these details. It wasn\u2019t just the tabloid media in 2015 that she says tried to silence her. Battilana Gutierrez tells CNN that lawyers for Weinstein offered her up to $1 million to sign a non-disclosure agreement, once they heard that she was trying to come forward with her allegations. \u201cI knew that they were trying to offer me $100,000,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez says, detailing the specifics of Weinstein\u2019s alleged settlement offers. \u201cThey went up to $300,000, $700,000, $1 million, and I still turned down every time.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s spokesperson, Juda Engelmayer, told CNN in a statement, \u201cMs. Gutierrez\u2019 lawyers controlled those meetings and set the terms for it.\u201d  Engelmayer did not respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries specifically regarding Weinstein\u2019s relationship to Pecker, The National Enquirer and their alleged joint efforts to kill Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s story and plant negative pieces about her across the tabloid media. But his spokesperson did say that Weinstein\u2019s recent overturned conviction has \u201copened the flood gates for some to get back into the spotlight, whereas it had all but disappeared.\u201d \u201cEven though he\u2019s in prison and convicted in Los Angeles, Harvey Weinstein\u2019s name alone seems to continue to inspire coverage and attention,\u201d Engelmayer said. Of Battilana Gutierrez, he added, \u201cHarvey wishes her well and hopes only for happiness and success for her.\u201d Eventually, Battilana Gutierrez did sign a non-disclosure agreement with Weinstein\u2019s legal team. She said she felt she had no choice, after her brother back in Italy was randomly approached by strangers inquiring about her, and she was concerned that her family\u2019s safety was in danger. Weinstein\u2019s spokesperson did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment regarding Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s allegations about her brother being approached in Italy, which she says scared her into ultimately signing the NDA. Battilana Gutierrez is disregarding her NDA to speak for this interview. She says it is \u201cmore important\u201d to share her truth. A pursuit of justice Since the initial\u00a0 reporting by The New Yorker and The New York Times in 2017 that led to his downfall, Weinstein has been charged, convicted and sentenced for sex crimes. In New York, he was first sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted of\u00a0 first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape \u2013 guilty verdicts that have now been overturned by the New York Court of Appeals. In Los Angeles, he was sentenced to an additional 16 years in prison for rape and sexual assault. At Weinstein\u2019s New York sentencing, Judge James Burke said: \u201cThis is a first conviction, but it is not a first offense.\u201d Gutierrez now confirms to CNN that she was an anonymous source for Ronan Farrow, who wrote for the New Yorker, giving him audio of Weinstein apparently admitting to groping her breasts, which was recorded during a NYPD sting operation. Even with the recording, prosecutors did not move forward with her case, claiming there wasn\u2019t enough evidence for a conviction. Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan DA at the time, told CNN via email that he assigned the head of the sex crimes unit to examine Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s case and believed she conducted \u201ca full and detailed investigation\u201d before recommending against prosecution for a number of reasons. \u201cI accepted her recommendation because I was personally familiar with her experience, judgment and commitment in this area of criminal investigations,\u201d Vance said. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment on the Weinstein investigation under Vance, but noted that current District Attorney Alvin Bragg is moving forward with a re-trial of Weinstein, after his conviction was overturned last month by the New York Court of Appeals \u2013 a decision that sent shockwaves through communities of survivors of sexual assault and marked a stunning set-back for the #MeToo movement. \u201cAs we stated in court, we will retry the case against Harvey Weinstein, and we urge anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault to call us,\u201d a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office told CNN in response to this story. Weinstein\u2019s spokesperson told CNN, \u201cThe DA\u2019s office knew all the facts and passed on this case. Had they felt they could pursue it, they would have.\u201d Buying the story to bury it Last month, a former editor from the National Enquirer published an essay in New York Times Magazine, sharing what he claims he witnessed during his time at the tabloid, both pertaining to \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d efforts with both Weinstein and Trump. The reporter, Lachlan Cartwright, alleged that in an effort to smear Battilana Gutierrez, attorneys for the Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc. (AMI), engaged in conversations with the Manhattan DA\u2019s Office. He doubled down on that claim, telling CNN, \u201cI learned that a top lawyer at AMI, in 2015, had been in touch with the Manhattan DA\u2019s Office and that person had effectively flipped the script and had been telling the DA\u2019s Office that Ambra was trying to sell her story to the National Enquirer, which was the complete opposite of what was going on.\u201d Cartwright told CNN he learned about this when he served as an anonymous source for the New York Times\u2019 investigation into Weinstein. CNN has not independently verified Cartwright\u2019s claim, and Battilana Gutierrez says while she does not have direct knowledge whether a lawyer for the Enquirer approached the Manhattan DA\u2019s Office, she believes that a \u201cvery complicated web of people were [was] working together to destroy me.\u201d In his email to CNN, Vance did not directly deny Cartwright\u2019s claim, but said, \u201cI have no information that I recall presently that the National Enquirer or anyone representing it spoke with our office about selling a story to the Enquirer.\u201d Cartwright says that when he worked at the Enquirer, he received a tip in 2015 about Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s police report concerning her allegations against Weinstein. He pitched the story \u2013 which would have been a major scoop in a pre #MeToo world \u2013 and was surprised when his bosses asked to buy her story, rather than report the story. \u201cBoth Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump were \u2018FOPs\u2019 \u2013 Friends of Pecker,\u201d Cartwright told CNN. \u201cThe Ambra Battilana story is almost a \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019 in that I think if she had have agreed for her story to be sold, I don\u2019t think the intention was to publish it. I think the intention was to make sure it wasn\u2019t published.\u201d In 2017, The New Yorker reported that the National Enquirer shared unpublished material with Weinstein regarding actress Rose McGowan\u2019s rape accusation, giving him a heads up on allegations that would eventually prove to be damning for Weinstein. Speaking to CNN, Cartwright confirms that during his time at the magazine, the Enquirer\u2019s top editor spoke to Weinstein about McGowan. At the time Battilana Gutierrez filed her 2015 police report, The Weinstein Company was in business with Pecker. Just weeks before Weinstein\u2019s alleged assault on Battilana Gutierrez, Weinstein and Pecker\u2019s companies had signed a deal to create a TV show with the content of the AMI website Radar Online. The show never came to fruition, but the relationship, nevertheless, did benefit Weinstein. \u201cThat meant Harvey Weinstein was a protected species,\u201d Cartwright said, adding, \u201cPeople within American Media \u2026 were working to help Harvey Weinstein and protect him and using the resources of American Media to do so.\u201d A chance to testify Nearly a decade after she first came forward with her allegations against Weinstein, Battilana Gutierrez is still continuing her fight for justice \u2013 especially as Weinstein\u2019s fate in New York remains unknown with an overturned conviction and he vows to appeal his Los Angeles conviction. \u201cI have a lot of questions about 2015 that I have never had answers,\u201d she says. Through Trump\u2019s hush money trial and Weinstein\u2019s continuing legal battles, she sees a common theme: Enormous efforts to silence women, in order to keep influential men in power. \u201cI never really wanted to be an activist. It was something (that) just came up to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like I couldn\u2019t close my eyes when I see something that is not right.\u201d Today, Battilana Gutierrez is on the board of directors at the Model Alliance, a New York- based nonprofit that works towards better treatment of workers in the fashion industry. A working model, she says that her industry is still rife with abuse, despite the efforts of the #MeToo movement. In 2022, she got the chance to testify about what she says happened to her at Weinstein\u2019s Los Angeles trial \u2013 not because her New York case was ever prosecuted, but because Los Angeles prosecutors brought her in as a \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witness, in order to provide more evidence to help establish a pattern of the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s prior pattern of alleged behavior. In that trial, the jury heard Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s recordings with Weinstein. Soon after the verdicts were handed down in 2022, a juror told this reporter he had been particularly struck by Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s story and would have voted to convict if her experience had been directly connected to a charge against Weinstein. When the story was recounted to Battilana Gutierrez in CNN\u2019s interview, she became emotional at everything that had passed since her first meeting with Weinstein. \u201cMy whole wish in 2015 was to be helpful for someone,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez now says, filled with anger and hope. \u201cAll these years that have been passing for me, knowing that if maybe I could have just (found) the right person to release those recordings, I wouldn\u2019t lose everything I lost.\u201d Battilana Gutierrez tells CNN that she hopes the New York case is re-tried this fall, as the DA has announced its intention to do so. And if Weinstein\u2019s Los Angeles appeal is successful, she says she would testify again. She says she won\u2019t stop searching for answers until justice has been served. \u201cWho was the responsible person that made that happen? Because it wasn\u2019t just him. I know there [are] more people behind him that have positions of power that he was using as well.\u201d She adds, \u201cThings that are bad \u2013 lies \u2013 always come out to light.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jason Kravarik contributed to this story.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/entertainment/trump-trial-harvey-weinstein-ambra-battilana-gutierrez/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_04_25_entertainment_challengers-review-zendaya", "text": "In tennis, \u201clove\u201d means nothing. Love also has little to do with \u201cChallengers,\u201d which uses the sport as the backdrop to serve up an elaborate, non-linear psychological triangle that proves twisty and enticing for much of the match, before double faulting by whiffing on the ending. Seduction and sex are again at the heart of this film from \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d director Luca Guadagnino, who also throws in twists of fate, paths not taken and \u2013 in the case of the central character played by Zendaya \u2013 a burning desire to win and exercise control over those around her, exploring how that elite-athlete mentality bleeds into her personal life. The framing device is a singles match between Art (\u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d Mike Faist), a decorated superstar who might be nearing the end, at least in his mind, of his tournament-winning career; and Patrick (\u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Josh O\u2019Connor), who arrives at the off-the-beaten-track tournament where they end up facing off in a run-down car that, his finances being what they are, doubles as his hotel room. Flashing back 13 years, we discover that the two were bosom pals as junior tennis players when they first set their eyes \u2013 springing out of their heads almost cartoon-like \u2013 on Tashi (Zendaya), a rising star whose game provokes as much lust from them as her striking looks. Back in the present, Tashi is Art\u2019s wife and coach, having lost her own career to a devastating knee injury. Yet it\u2019s pretty obvious that she\u2019s living through him \u2013 he addresses the point overtly, saying, \u201cI\u2019m playing for both of us\u201d \u2013 which only makes how she wound up with him, as well as the outcome of Art and Patrick\u2019s (very) protracted match, more intriguing. While sexual tension plays a central role in the movie (and certainly the marketing of it), \u201cChallengers\u201d is as much about blurring the lines between sex and the seductive power of big-time sports, with winning and success as the ultimate aphrodisiac. Add to that the two boys/men being pretty transparent about what they want, Tashi remains a source of mystery, in part because of the unscheduled detour her career has been forced to take. After his fine young cannibals romance \u201cBones and All,\u201d Guadagnino, working from a script by playwright Justin Kuritzkes, occupies more conventional and commercial territory here, while doing all he can to sex up how he films the tennis sequences. Despite the zooming angles and whizzing balls, there\u2019s no escaping the sheer abundance of those scenes, especially for anyone who has never sat through an entire US Open or Wimbledon final. Even using the sport as a metaphor, \u201cChallengers\u201d might become a bit of a challenge for those who show up eager to see the principals sweat for different reasons. Because she\u2019s playing more complicated angles, Zendaya\u2019s Tashi is the most interesting character as well as a source of frustration. Then again, the details regarding all three of the key figures stay somewhat vague thanks in part to the structure, though all are prone to the occasional racket-mangling tantrum. While the build-up proves effective, the payoff simply feels too precious, in a way that\u2019s particularly unsatisfying. That misstep doesn\u2019t invalidate sitting through this otherwise neatly choreographed match, but in tennis terms, it\u2019s the kind of unforced error that prevents Guadagnino\u2019s latest film from ranking as an unqualified winner. \u201cChallengers\u201d premieres April 26 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/25/entertainment/challengers-review-zendaya/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_entertainment_50-cent-diddy-beef", "text": "There is no love lost between hip-hop moguls 50 Cent and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs. 50 Cent has long trolled Diddy on social media, most recently after CNN\u2019s publication of surveillance video showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in 2016. On Tuesday, 50 Cent posted on social media to confirm a TMZ report that he has sold a multi-part documentary about Combs\u2019 legal troubles to Netflix. Combs is currently named in six civil lawsuits, accusing him of a range of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity, the latest of which was filed Tuesday. He is also the target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security Investigations team that handles human trafficking and other crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Combs has previously denied all allegations of wrong doing. CNN has reached out to representatives for 50 Cent and Netflix for comment. But why the bad blood? Here\u2019s a look back at how there came to be animosity between the two men. A diss track In 2006, 50 Cent released a diss track \u201cThe Bomb,\u201d which featured sounds of gunfire and his allegation that Combs knew the identity of the killer of Christopher Wallace, a rapper known as The Notorious B.I.G., who was both a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and best friend to Combs. Wallace was gunned down in Los Angeles in March 1997 as he and his crew, which included Combs, were traveling in a caravan. Combs was in a different vehicle from the one Wallace was in at the time Wallace was shot. No one has ever been charged with the murder. In his diss track, 50 raps, \u201cI guess this means I won\u2019t be invited to the white parties in the Hamptons,\u201d referencing Combs\u2019 famous soirees held in the upscale New York community. 50 Cent has also said he believes Combs is connected to the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur. Combs called such allegations \u201cnonsense\u201d in a 2016 interview with the syndicated radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club.\u201d He has never been charged in connection to either case. Consistent trolling Followers of 50 are familiar with his reputation for sharp comments and social media trolling. The rapper-turned-television-producer has made Combs a frequent target, attacking everything from his music to his age.  Some believed it was mostly marketing, especially given the men\u2019s parallel career tracks and even competing vodkas at one point, Effen Vodka from 50 Cent and Ciroc, which used to be owned by Combs. But 50 upped his comments after Combs was sued in November 2023 by Ventura, who in a now-settled civil complaint alleged that Combs raped her in 2018 and abused her over the more than decade they were in an off-and-on relationship. Combs has denied the allegations, but apologized on Sunday for the incident depicted in the surveillance video. After federal investigators searched Combs\u2019 homes in Miami and Los Angeles in March, 50 Cent  posted on X, \u201cNow it\u2019s not Diddy do it, it\u2019s Diddy done. They don\u2019t come like that unless they got a case.\u201d Diddy denies there\u2019s beef Combs was asked about the tension between him and 50 Cent during an appearance on \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d in 2018. \u201cI don\u2019t have no beef with Fif. He loves me,\u201d Combs said. \u201cY\u2019all can\u2019t see that he loves me? You really think that\u2019s hate? \u2026 You know he loves me.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t take the things 50 Cent says about him seriously. \u201cWhen he does that it\u2019s like funny to me,\u201d Combs said. \u201cI don\u2019t really take it personal. I know he has a different sense of humor, and he\u2019s just not in my life. We don\u2019t have to never cross paths, and I will never say nothing negative about him, you know, because that\u2019s just not me.\u201d A son\u2019s defense Christian Combs, who goes by King Combs, is the 26-year-old son of Diddy. Earlier this month, he released a song titled \u201cPick a Side\u201d in support of his father and taking aim at critics like 50 Cent. The younger Combs and his brother, Justin, were temporarily handcuffed and detained by authorities during the March search on their father\u2019s home. Neither was arrested or charged. Aaron Dyer, Diddy\u2019s attorney, said in a statement to CNN at the time that \u201cthere was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs\u2019 residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.\u201d King Combs appeared to profess his father\u2019s innocence in his track and took a swipe at 50 Cent. \u201cAll that gossip sh*t is whack when all they had was 50 Cent / Who put this city on the map? / Stop lying,\u201d the younger Combs raps. 50 Cent responded with a tongue-in-cheek post on social media. \u201cI feel so threatened by the things Christian is saying on his record,\u201d he wrote in a since-delated post on Instagram, according to Billboard. \u201cI\u2019m afraid for my life, please don\u2019t hurt me guys.\u201d The TMZ story about the docuseries that 50 Cent shared on Tuesday said the project will reportedly be titled, \u201cDiddy Do It?\u201d \u201cIf more victims keep coming out I\u2019m gonna need more episodes,\u201d he wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/entertainment/50-cent-diddy-beef/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_entertainment_matthew-perry-investigation-ketamine", "text": "The Los Angeles Police Department is conducting a criminal investigation into the source of the ketamine that led to the death of actor Matthew Perry, LAPD Capt.\u00a0Scot Williams told CNN Tuesday. Two federal agencies, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and the\u00a0US Postal Inspection Service, are\u00a0also involved in the joint investigation, which has been ongoing, the LAPD said in a\u00a0social media post\u00a0later Tuesday. \u201cFriends\u201d star Perry, who was found floating face down in the pool of his Pacific Palisades home on October 28, 2023, died as a result of \u201cacute effects of ketamine\u201d and subsequent drowning,\u00a0CNN previously reported, citing the Los Angeles Medical Examiner\u2019s Office\u00a0autopsy report. He was 54. The LAPD\u2019s\u00a0Robbery-Homicide Division led the initial death investigation because of Perry\u2019s high profile as a well-known actor, and continued looking into the source of the ketamine\u00a0after\u00a0the\u00a0autopsy\u00a0report was released in December, nearly two months after his death, Williams said. The captain would not elaborate on the investigation, but indicated that it is criminal in nature. \u201cHypothetically there\u2019s a potential for criminal culpability depending on what the investigation undercovers, but at this point, we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Williams said, adding that authorities are looking into where Perry got the drugs and who supplied them. The DEA had no comment on the investigation and spokesperson Rosa Valle-Lopez referred questions to the LAPD. Perry was \u201creported to be receiving ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety,\u201d the autopsy report stated. Perry\u2019s last known treatment was a week and a half prior to his death, according to the autopsy, well beyond the time it would still be in his system from the treatment. The beloved, Emmy-nominated actor enjoyed a decades-long career, most notably as the affable Chandler Bing on the NBC sitcom \u201cFriends\u201d between 1994 and 2004, starring alongside Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_young-sheldon-series-finale-review", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The following contains spoilers about the \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d series finale. Seventeen years after \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d made its debut, spinoff \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d has remained one of the bigger hits that network TV can still produce in this diluted day and age. Yet the CBS comedy has seldom figured in the awards conversation, something that its emotionally wrenching yet satisfying series finale should remedy, but probably won\u2019t. A master class on weaving comedy with grief and regrets, the two-part conclusion to the series, after seven seasons, dealt with the aftermath of central character Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) losing his father (Lance Barber) as he prepares to head off to Cal Tech. That includes reliving his final exchange with his dad over and over, thinking about all the things he could have said \u2013 and wished that he had \u2013 but didn\u2019t. The finale also revealed that the voiceover throughout the series by the older Sheldon (Jim Parsons, reprising his \u201cBig Bang\u201d role along with Mayim Bialik) actually came as he was writing his memoir, a middle-aged Nobel prize winner but still as persnickety as ever. Perhaps most interestingly, the arc of the later seasons of \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d also exposed him as a not-entirely-trustworthy source in regard to his father when speaking about him, usually not very charitably, during \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d with George emerging as a much more sympathetic character as the show progressed. Series co-creator Chuck Lorre addressed the challenge in his end-of-show vanity card on the penultimate episode, saying when writing Sheldon\u2019s backstory in \u201cBig Bang\u201d that he didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d be grappling with this challenge years later. (Both shows were produced by Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.) In an interview with CNN, \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d executive producer Steve Holland said the producers decided that the older Sheldon might have been focusing on his father\u2019s failings as a way of dealing with his grief. Holland also noted that the young actors in the series, including Armitage and Raegan Revord as his sister Missy, had grown up since the show began and were able to handle the heavy dramatic scenes they shot as the family remembered and eulogized George, prompting his wife Mary (Zoe Perry) to break down and embrace religion even more fiercely as an emotional balm. The finale managed to give practically everyone an opportunity to shine, from Georgie (Montana Jordan) saying \u201cI won\u2019t let you down, dad\u201d to the assortment of \u201csupporting legends\u201d \u2013 as Holland called them \u2013 who fleshed out the cast, including Annie Potts, Craig T. Nelson, Wallace Shawn, Ed Begley Jr., and Wendie Malick. \u201cIt was important for us in these last few episodes to give people their moments,\u201d Holland said. For all the tears (and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to get through this hour without shedding a few), the episode ended on a sweetly hopeful and uplifting note, using the Dire Straits song \u201cWalk of Life,\u201d which, Holland noted, was the very first heard on the series.

Prime Video released the first trailer for the upcoming second season of the \u201cLord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\u201d series on Tuesday, giving a sprawling glimpse into how the realm is preparing to battle the Dark Lord Sauron, whose reemergence was chronicled in Season 1. \u201cAn evil, ancient and powerful, has returned,\u201d says dwarven Prince Durin IV (Owain Arthur) in the opening seconds of the trailer. Sauron (Charlie Vickers) is seen sporting a new look, disguising himself as an Elf with bleach-blonde hair and elven ears. He sparsely appears in the trailer, but his presence is felt throughout as Galadriel (Morfydd Clark), Isildur (Maxim Baldry), Arondir (Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova) and Elrond (Robert Aramayo) are shown fighting to protect Middle-earth. The trailer impressively showcases fiery battles, Orc armies, nefarious sea creatures, a Great Eagle, three Rings of Power and the land of Mordor shrouded in darkness, all set to composer Bear McCreary\u2019s dramatic score. The Stranger (Daniel Weyman) \u2013 whose identity has yet to be revealed but is speculated to be the all-powerful wizard Gandalf \u2013 is also briefly shown slamming a staff into the ground. \u201cOne of the exciting things about this year is we\u2019re going to see Sauron out in the open making everything happen,\u201d Vickers said in a Season 2 behind-the-scenes featurette released on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to watch it all unfold.\u201d Season 2 will pick up with the return of the cunning Dark Lord, who must rebuild his strength to oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, \u201cwhich will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will,\u201d according to an official synopsis. Plunged into darkness, the characters are each challenged to \u201cfind their place in a world that is increasingly on the brink of calamity,\u201d the synopsis reads. \u201cAs friendships are strained and kingdoms begin to fracture, the forces of good will struggle ever more valiantly to hold on to what matters to them most of all\u2026 each other.\u201d Season 1 debuted in 2022 and is set in Middle-earth\u2019s Second Age, \u201cthousands of years before the events of J.R.R.

The film about the presumptive Republican nominee comes five months before the presidential election. Starring Sebastian Stan as a young Trump, the film is an \u201cexploration of power and ambition set in a world of corruption and deceit,\u201d according to an official synopsis. \u201cSuccession\u201d star Jeremy Strong co-stars as Roy Cohn, the lawyer and fixer who Trump considered a mentor early in his career. \u201cIt\u2019s a mentor-protege story that charts the origins of an American dynasty. Filled with larger than life characters, it reveals the moral and human cost of a culture defined by winners and losers,\u201d the synopsis reads. \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which, despite the title, is not a reference to the reality competition series Trump starred in, includes a disclaimer that some parts of the story are slightly fictionalized. It is written by biographer and political journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Iranian-Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi. \u201cIn the time of turmoil, there\u2019s this tendency to look inwards, to sort of bury your head deep in the sand and look inside and hope for the best, hope for the storm to get away,\u201d Abassi told the audience at the movie\u2019s premiere on Monday, according to footage posted online. \u201cBut, the storm,\u201d Abassi continued, \u201cis not going away. The storm is coming, actually. The worst times are to come.\u201d Abassi went on to say that he chose to make a film \u201cabout the world\u201d through a story about Trump, because \u201cthere is no nice metaphorical way to deal with the rising wave of fascism.\u201d \u201cThere is only the messy way, there is only the banal way. There is only the way of dealing with this wave on its own turfs at its own level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty, but I think the problem with the world is that the good people have been quiet for too long.\u201d The film includes a depiction of Trump\u2019s relationship with his first wife, Ivana, and their divorce, according to The Hollywood Reporter. A scene of the former president undergoing liposuction drew audible gasps from the crowd, the publication reported. \u201cWe will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked,\u201d Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThis \u2018film\u2019 is pure malicious defamation, should not see the light of day, and doesn\u2019t even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire.\u201d Maria Bakalova plays the late Ivana Trump, who died in 2022. Martin Donovan, Catherine McNally and Charlie Carrick, among others, round out the cast.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish", "text": "Billie Eilish has always done things her own way. Whether it be releasing her 2016 viral hit \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d onto Soundcloud, a DIY music streaming site, or writing and recording her record-breaking debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u201d with her collaborator and brother Finneas O\u2019Connell in her childhood bedroom, Eilish, 22, has never been shy about straying from industry norms \u2013 and it seems to be working well for the two-time Oscar-winner. With her third studio album \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d which drops on Friday, she\u2019s remained consistent. The sound of the album is sure to be a surprise to all, because Eilish intentionally chose to not release a single prior to launching the album \u2013 again, a rather unorthodox move. \u201cI wanna give it to you all at once,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram page last month when announcing the album. Her 2019 debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,\u201d along with 2021\u2019s \u201cHappier Than Ever\u201d and the new record, were all co-written and produced by O\u2019Connell. It follows Eilish and O\u2019Connell\u2019s Oscar win in March for their original song for the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie,\u00a0\u201cWhat Was I Made For,\u201d which was one of 2023\u2019s biggest hits. The duo previously won the Oscar for original song in 2022 for \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d However \u201cHard and Soft\u201d sounds, which we shall soon find out, Eilish hinted in an interview with Rolling Stone last month that she found herself harkening back to her roots with this record, bringing to mind a time in Eilish\u2019s musical journey where she first set her own precedent for being in control. \u201cI feel like this album is me,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a character. It feels like the \u2018When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u2019 version of me. It feels like my youth and who I was as a kid.\u201d Her penchant for bucking the norm is continuing into her plans for her upcoming \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d tour, which kicks off in Baltimore this fall. Eilish is choosing to skirt scalpers by restricting ticket transfers for those purchasing tickets to her shows. \u201cThe tour wants to give fans, not scalpers, the best chance to buy tickets at face value. To make this possible, they have chosen to use Ticketmaster\u2019s Face Value Exchange,\u201d Ticketmaster\u2019s Eilish ticket page reads. It further notes that if fans can\u2019t attend shows in the US or Canada that they\u2019ve purchased tickets for, they have the option to resell them at face value. The move comes nearly two years after the fervor surrounding the purchase of tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour crashed the Ticketmaster site, resulting in fans not having access to tickets, scalpers trying to resell the tickets at ungodly prices and a subsequent congressional hearing. Eilish was clearly paying attention and appears to be one of the only major mainstream artists to adapt, in hopes of preventing scalpers being able to hawk tickets at exorbitant resale fees. And with \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d Eilish is also trying to stand out and apart in the industry with her effort to protect something else she\u2019s historically passionate about: the environment. The \u201cBad Guy\u201d singer made waves when she lamented in a March interview with Billboard about the \u201cwasteful\u201d practice of releasing a multitude of album variants which, in turn, \u201cgets them more money.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so wasteful, and it\u2019s irritating to me that we\u2019re still at a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much about making money \u2013 and it\u2019s all your favorite artists doing that s\u2014,\u201d she said at the time. To back up her complaint, Eilish posted a manifesto on her website describing her sustainability plan for the release of \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d after announcing the album. She wrote that she will only release eight vinyl variants \u201ceach on the same day, containing the same track-listing across the board\u201d \u2013 to remove the incentive for die-hard fans who would purchase all the variants for any differing bonus tracks \u2013 \u201cand all produced with the most sustainable practices available.\u201d Environmental sustainability has remained at the forefront for Eilish to the current moment, as on her Instagram stories on Wednesday, she included sustainable transport plans to her New York album listening event. Perhaps emboldened by the two Oscars or nine Grammys that she\u2019s won, or the fact that her first two albums have hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the young entertainer has a proven track record of success doing things her way. And why should she change now, if it\u2019s working?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Nicely played by the leads, this tale of a 40-year-old woman swept off her feet by a 20-something boy-band star amounts to playing the genre\u2019s hits while following all the same old steps. Destined for Amazon, it\u2019s a competent date-night or gals\u2019-night movie for those who don\u2019t want to leave the house \u2013 Chardonnay optional, but recommended \u2013 which makes practical sense, landing as it does in a middle ground that has struggled at the box office. Cheated on and left by her husband, Sol\u00e9ne (Hathaway) is a successful art-gallery owner who gets roped at the last-minute into squiring her teenage daughter and the kid\u2019s friends to Coachella, where her ex has purchased a meet-and-greet experience with the members of August Moon, whose following might lean more toward the tween crowd. A reluctant attendee, Sol\u00e9ne has the ultimate meet-cute moment with band member Hayes (Galitzine, of \u201cMary & George\u201d and \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d renown), stumbling into his trailer thinking it\u2019s the restroom. After some awkward banter and obvious chemistry \u2013 which with the benefit of hindsight is about as good as the movie gets \u2013 Hayes shows up unexpectedly (by her, that is) at Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s gallery, telling her shyly, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t meet people like you very often.\u201d For a pop star, he\u2019s an endearingly sensitive soul, which doesn\u2019t do much to quell her reticence, due both to their age gap and his fame. Romance and complications ensue, with writer-director Michael Showalter (\u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and \u201cSpoiler Alert,\u201d sharing script credit with Jennifer Westfeldt) adapting Robinne Lee\u2019s novel in part by relying on the customary montages to handle some of the heavy lifting. If only the garnishes were a little less tired, including the prying paparazzi and Reid Scott as Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s no-right-to-be-bent-out-of-shape ex. All that really leaves, then, is the interplay between Hathaway and Galitzine, with the latter (starring in his second Amazon movie in a year\u2019s time about a romance complicated by fame) performing double duty on the songs. The problem is however well they might work in terms of rooting for them as a couple, it\u2019s hard to avoid the very real issue that the world he inhabits and indeed people in general can be pretty lousy. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d will likely be most satisfying for those who choose not to sweat the details, enjoying the scenery and fantasy wrapped up in it. Think of it as one of those movies that really reinforces the adage there are no new ideas, just fresh versions of old ones set to different beats. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d premieres May 2 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_bridgerton-season-3-review-penelope-colin", "text": "Once you\u2019ve mastered basic \u201cBridgerton,\u201d it\u2019s possible to sit back and let each new season predictably wash over you, its level of satisfaction dictated simply by how much one connects with the latest characters to be paired off. Fortunately, the third round (after a \u201cQueen Charlotte\u201d detour) has the highly sympathetic Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) at its core, adding some additional sweetness to the formula. For the uninitiated, poor Penelope has spent two seasons secretly moonlighting as the acid-tongued gossip Lady Whistledown (still voiced by Julie Andrews, because, well, Julie Andrews!), using her access to the coming and goings and romances among the elite to greatly irritate many (the queen foremost among them) while titillating them at the same time. Penelope has channeled her creative energies in this direction in part because of her skepticism that she\u2019ll ever find a match for herself, a process made no easier by her infatuation with Colin (Luke Newton), the latest of the seemingly endless parade of dashing Bridgerton progeny to brave the matrimonial dance. (There\u2019s a praying mantis quality to Bridgertons, since while mating doesn\u2019t lead to death, they do tend to lose their heads and then mostly disappear.) As usual, there are complications and hurdles thrown at Colin and Penelope, including the latter finding a new potential suitor after experiencing the disgrace of having Colin\u2019s gallant efforts to help her find a match exposed. The whole interlude prompts him to begin grasping his own complicated feelings, although in keeping with its Jane Austen-flecked roots, the course of true love never runs smoothly. To their credit, the producers juggle a few extra balls (debutante and otherwise) this time around, including subplots involving Colin\u2019s sister Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and even the family matriarch Violet (Ruth Gemmell), which, given the contortions surrounding the central duo, come across as prudent distractions. Frankly, the level of heat generated by \u201cBridgerton\u201d still remains something of a mystery, not because the show isn\u2019t well done \u2013 possessing the customary trappings for which producer Shonda Rhimes is known \u2013 but simply because everything about it feels so familiar to anyone who ever watched \u201cMasterpiece Theater,\u201d other than a bit more latitude when it comes to the ripping and removal of bodices and the clever use of contemporary music. Give some credit to the casting and, more pragmatically, the strength of Netflix as a platform relative to the more rarefied homes for such fare. Underscoring the show\u2019s value, the service will divide the eight-episode season into two drops, emulating its strategy with shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d to lengthen its hold on viewers beyond an instant binge. If the storytelling has already begun to feel a trifle tired, Coughlan\u2019s vulnerability (and the semi-adorable note that she has asked for an edited version to show her parents) provides a welcome infusion. By sustaining and indeed replenishing those soap-opera qualities, the series seems likely to exhaust its roster of marriage-eligible Bridgertons before Netflix will need to find some buzzworthy new bauble to beguile those who have bought into this world. \u201cBridgerton\u201d begins its third season May 16 on Netflix, with the second half to premiere on June 13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/bridgerton-season-3-review-penelope-colin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
