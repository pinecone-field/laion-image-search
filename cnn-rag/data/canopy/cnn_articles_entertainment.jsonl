Following the success of its second season, which saw the electrifying \u201cwill they,won\u2019t they\u201d love story of Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and KateSharma (Simone Ashley) \u2013 dubbed \u201cKanthony\u201d by frenzied fans \u2013 the spotlight hasshifted to two familiar characters poised for their turn in the spotlight: Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan). The two beloved characters are finally taking center stage as the latest installment of the Regency-era romantic drama, and \u201cPolin\u201d shippers have eagerly awaited this moment, having watched Penelope secretly pine for Colin since the series launched in 2020. But with a deviation from the order of events in Julia Quinn\u2019s \u201cBridgerton\u201d novels, they will finally be getting the resolution they (and we) have been longing for. When we last saw the duo in Season 2, Colin had inadvertently hurt Penelope,when she overheard him telling his gentry friends that he would never court her,creating a rift and setting up the emotional tension for this season. \u201cWhen you meet them, they\u2019re both putting on masks,\u201d Coughlan told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cThey each feel like they need to be other people to survive and to be loved, and to find a match.\u201d The journey from friends to something more The new season begins with Colin returning from a summer of traveling abroad, witha new look and newfound attention from the society ladies. Meanwhile, Penelope is determined to find a husband in attempt to escape her family home, dominated by her scheming mother and newly-married sisters. With this season promising that \u201ceven a wallflower can blossom,\u201d Penelope\u2019s resolve comes with a \u201cglow up\u201d of sorts, which rids her of citrus-colored gowns and awkward hair updos in favor of a more mature, sophisticated look. \u201cFor her, she\u2019s thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t care about romance or love, that doesn\u2019t interest me.I\u2019m going to be practical and find a husband.\u2019 But you realize that she\u2019s done no workon herself. So, the transformation doesn\u2019t fix anything,\u201d Coughlan said. In an unexpected twist, Colin takes on the role of mentor, helping Penelope navigatethe world of courtship. And it works, with Penelope soon attracting the attention of LordDebling (Sam Phillips), a character who doesn\u2019t appear in the books. Almost inevitably, this sparks jealousy in Colin. In a Season 3 preview, we see himpensively ask his mother, \u201cIs the best foundation for love friendship?\u201d While fans ofthe series will be screaming \u201cYES\u201d at their TV screens, Coughlan emphasizes thecharacters must go on a crucial journey of self-love before coming together. \u201cThere\u2019s a real overarching theme throughout the story with both Colin and Pen, ofthem learning to love themselves, as cheesy as that sounds,\u201d Coughlan said cringingly. \u201cBut it\u2019s so important. Once they learn to live in who they are, that\u2019s when they really, trulyblossom.\u201d Newton chimed in, \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other for a really long time, they know each other\u2019s insecurities, and it\u2019s about accepting that person rather than idolizing a version of them that just isn\u2019t real.\u201d As this season\u2019s main love interest, Newton admitted to feeling slight pressure, but said he\u2019s embracing the legacy left by his predecessors (Bailey along with Season 1\u2019s Reg\u00e9-Jean Page as Simon Basset) while bringing a fresh take on the archetype. \u201cHaving sat in this role for the last four years, I felt in a really good place with Colin. He has a lot of traits that the previous male leads didn\u2019t quite have. He\u2019s got this sensitivity and empathy for other characters,\u201d he said. Unlocking their sexual chemistry Coughlan and Newton said that becoming series leads felt exciting and natural. Their strong bond and open communication allowed them to \u201cunlock\u201d their chemistry rather than having to work on it, proving invaluable when filming \u201cBridgerton\u2019s\u201d famous love scenes. \u201cIn the lead up, I was very nervous,\u201d Coughlan admitted. \u201cBut then once we got into it,we had so much control over what we were doing. They ended up being really fun and watching them back, I think they\u2019re really beautiful.\u201d What the pair aren\u2019t comfortable with is dishing out dating advice. Both insisted theyaren\u2019t qualified to give modern-day advice (asking for a friend), but they believe thatultimately, Colin, Penelope and the rest of us are \u201cjust human.\u201d \u201cYou can have a crush, but don\u2019t think that they\u2019re the be-all and end-all,\u201d Coughlaninstructed. Note taken. \u201cBridgerton\u201d Season 3, Part 1 is streaming now on Netflix. Part 2 will release on June 13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/entertainment/bridgerton-penelope-season-3/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_atlas-review-jennifer-lopez", "text": "Say what you want about Jennifer Lopez, but streaming algorithms surely love her, which accounts for her parade of recent movies \u2013 \u201cThe Mother\u201d (Netflix), \u201cShotgun Wedding\u201d (Amazon) and \u201cMarry Me\u201d (Peacock), all in the last two years. Add to that \u201cAtlas,\u201d a nonstop sci-fi action movie that basically gets the job done with a plot that recalls Disney\u2019s \u201cBig Hero 6,\u201d just with a lot more cursing. Although \u201cAtlas\u201d hinges on the now ever-popular \u201cartificial intelligence runs amok\u201d theme, that backdrop becomes a transparent excuse to set up a bonding exercise between Lopez\u2019s Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant data analyst who grew up with the AI robot Harlan (Simu Liu), who in turn has lead the rebellion against humanity. Atlas must then team up with another AI robot (voiced by Gregory James Cohan) in order to survive. The movie begins by racing through the devastating AI attack triggered by Harlan, before jumping 28 years into the future, when its title character gets recruited by a pair of military types (Mark Strong and Sterling K. Brown, both underemployed) regarding an opportunity to locate and stop him. After the obligatory chatter about her bad attitude and being ill-equipped for such a mission, she tags along, at which point the film becomes very Lopez-centric for an extended stretch. Of course, the idea of being forced to get to know the thing the protagonist hates and/or fears is a very old conceit, often explored through the prism of science fiction. In that respect, \u201cAtlas\u201d doesn\u2019t turn over new ground conceptually any more than it does with its robot design, which bears a strong resemblance to the oversized armored suits featured in \u201cAvatar\u201d or \u201cAliens,\u201d take your pick. Still, \u201cAtlas\u201d more than anything wants to operate as an action movie, and director Brad Peyton \u2013 a veteran of the Dwayne Johnson vehicles \u201cRampage,\u201d \u201cJourney 2: Mysterious Island\u201d and \u201cSan Andreas\u201d \u2013 keeps the story moving with a check-your-brain-at-the-door level of efficiency, relying on the shorthand of how familiar almost every beat of it feels. Netflix continues to lay down expensive bets on genre movies, with Zack Snyder\u2019s two-part \u201cRebel Moon\u201d among the more prominent recent examples. For her part, Lopez steps into a slightly different role \u2013 and wisely away from another rom-com \u2013 in her dual capacity as producer and star. While it\u2019s not entirely clear how the math works out on that, one needn\u2019t be a particularly brilliant data analyst to identify the boxes Netflix is hoping to check with the J-Lo + sci-fi equation. \u201cAtlas\u201d premieres May 24 on Netflix. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/atlas-review-jennifer-lopez/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_entertainment_nicki-minaj-amsterdam-police", "text": "Rapper Nicki Minaj apologized to fans outside her hotel in Manchester early Sunday morning for postponing a UK show after she was stopped by Dutch authorities on allegations she was carrying drugs. \u201cI love you and I\u2019m so sorry this happened tonight,\u201d Minaj said in a video\u00a0posted on social media. Minaj had earlier revealed the name of her Manchester hotel\u00a0in a post on X, and invited fans to see her. \u201cI\u2019m going on the balcony so if you\u2019re outside I\u2019ll be able to see you & I may come downstairs. I\u2019ll be out there for about an hour. Rlly (really) wanted to at least get to see you,\u201d she said. Though Minaj was released from police custody on Saturday evening, the concert, set to be held in Manchester on the same night, was unable to go ahead. In a statement published by both Live Nation and the concert\u2019s venue Co-op Live, organizers said they were \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the inconvenience caused. \u201cDespite Nicki\u2019s best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight\u2019s show happen, the events of today have made it impossible,\u201d the statement, published on Saturday evening, said. In a video captured on the hip-hop artist\u2019s Instagram Live \u2013 which was later\u00a0disseminated online\u00a0by various social media accounts \u2013 Minaj is heard speaking with police at Amsterdam\u2019s\u00a0Schiphol\u00a0Airport while holding her camera phone. In the clip, Minaj mentions \u201cpre-rolls they found,\u201d and is then seen being ushered out of her vehicle and urged to get in a police van. When she asks why she is being told to board the van, an official informs her she is \u201cunder arrest,\u201d\u00a0later adding,\u00a0for \u201ccarrying drugs.\u201d Minaj replies, \u201cI\u2019m not carrying drugs.\u201d Minaj repeatedly asks for the address of the police station and to have a lawyer present throughout the clip, while the police ask her to stop filming. When CNN reached out to Amsterdam authorities with Minaj\u2019s given name Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty, the Netherlands military police, known as the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, said they arrested a 41-year-old American woman with \u201csoft drugs\u201d at Schiphol Airport. Later on Saturday, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee said the woman detained in their custody \u201con suspicion of exporting soft drugs has been released.\u201d \u201cFollowing consultation with the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the suspect received a monetary fine and is now permitted to continue her journey,\u201d the statement continued. CNN has reached out to representatives for Minaj for comment. Minaj is currently on her Pink Friday 2 World Tour in support of her latest album, released late last year. Minaj performed in Amsterdam on Thursday night, and is set to perform in Birmingham, UK, Sunday night. Another Nicki Minaj concert is scheduled at the Co-op Live, Manchester, for Thursday, May 30.

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_baby-reindeer-you-stalking-netflix-cec", "text": "With Netflix\u2019s \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d captivating audiences \u2014 nearly 60 million viewers watched it in its first month \u2014 and the fifth and final season of \u201cYou\u201d set to release this year, stories about stalkers have clearly struck people\u2019s attention. But some experts warn that what you see on your screen isn\u2019t always representative of reality. Many Hollywood-ified dramatizations lean into storylines of extreme behaviors and sometimes don\u2019t include appropriate warnings, leading to misconceptions about what stalking actually is. For some victims, this could lead to more harm than good. Real-life stalking, experts say, can be more subtle than what is usually portrayed in popular media \u2014 though just as damaging and dangerous. How stalking is portrayed in popular media \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is a dramatized version of real events that happened to series creator and actor Richard Gadd. In the show, Gadd\u2019s character, Donny, meets Martha at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. The TV series \u201cYou,\u201d based on the 2014 novel of the same name, follows the perspective of stalker Joe Goldberg as he tracks, manipulates and murders his victims, often using romance and his good looks as a lure. Forensic psychologist Dr. Lorraine Sheridan says stalking is not always the cookie-cutter formula audiences are enthralled by. \u201cA lot of it (the media) is all killer, no filler. You don\u2019t get the more mundane aspects of stalking. You just get the really, really dramatic bits,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cThat means it is often quite misrepresented because the everyday, boring, hideous, demeaning, fear-inducing \u2014 but ultimately kind of predictably miserable \u2014 aspects of stalking does not make good TV.\u201d Gadd\u2019s story is real, but he says the version that appears in \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. \u201cI\u2019ve put out a statement publicly saying I want the show to be received as a piece of art, and I want the show to people (sic) to enjoy as a piece of art,\u201d Gadd told The Hollywood Reporter, speaking about those who aim to find the show\u2019s real life counterparts. \u201cI\u2019m called Donny Dunn. It exists in a sort of fictional realm, even though it\u2019s based on truth, it exists in a fictional realm, let\u2019s enjoy the world that I\u2019ve created.\u201d \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d comes with a standard post-credits disclaimer that says, \u201cThis program is based on real events; however certain characters, names, incidents, locations and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.\u201d One notable change is in the show: Martha is charged with three counts of harassment and stalking, found guilty and sent to prison. In real life, Gadd says the legal situation with his stalker was simply \u201cresolved.\u201d Stalking has always been a subject of popular media, even before many viewers can grasp the actual concept, since so much of it appears in content aimed at young people. In \u201cTwilight,\u201d the main character Edward breaks into his school crush Bella\u2019s room to watch her sleep. In \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d Emilio Estevez\u2019s character follows Andie MacDowell\u2019s character across town to crash her and her boyfriend\u2019s vacation. These representations can lead to confusion about what is stalking and what is romantic, according to the Stalking Prevention, Awareness and Resource Center (SPARC), which issued a discussion guide in 2019 that noted, \u201cRomantic films often include protagonists who are \u2018guys like Joe (Goldberg),\u2019 ones who stop at nothing to get the girl. Usually there is no negative consequence for their actions \u2014 in fact, the stalking is successful, and they persuade their initially reluctant romantic interests that they should be together.\u201d For its part in reducing victim blaming, Sheridan says that \u201cYou\u201d makes viewers \u201cquestion ourselves and (it) demonstrates how we can get taken in by somebody who is so cruel, selfish, sadistic and evil.\u201d Stalkers don\u2019t only take the shape of dashing, cunning men. In \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d Gadd\u2019s stalker is portrayed as unattractive and mentally ill \u2014 someone whom her victim actually feels sorry for. While both male and female fictional stalkers are portrayed as dangers, Sheridan notes\u00a0 that, typically, only women stalkers are portrayed in a way that gives audiences license to laugh and ridicule them. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth noting those more nuanced, less sensational, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to do something about this\u2019 kind of pieces of media (like \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cLover Stalker Killer\u201d) are both showing men as the victims,\u201d said Dana Fleitman, a SPARC training and awareness specialist. \u201cWhen we see women as victims, it is often on other networks that are a lot more campy (and) sensational.\u201d While 1 in 3 women will experience stalking in their lifetime, 1 in 6 men will as well, making it not a fully gendered issue. Some argue that stories where males are the victims may lend extra legitimacy to the problem. Anna Nasset, a stalking survivor and founder of Stand-Up Resources, watched \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d upon the recommendation of her colleagues and thought the show was \u201creally good.\u201d \u201cHaving the male victim in \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is going to do more than if the gender was switched. It just is,\u201d Nasset said. \u201cI hate to say it that way, but I think there\u2019s still that narrative of \u2018Well, this is just part of being a woman, this what you get!\u2019 Media portrayals of stalking aren\u2019t always accurate Media representations can also cause victims to believe they are not actually being stalked if\u00a0 their situation doesn\u2019t seem as severe as what they see on screen. \u201cStalking is very underreported and under-identified and so people kind of think they know what it is, but they\u2019re actually very unlikely to have received any sort of formal or real education on it. So, where are we learning what stalking is? It\u2019s often from these (media) misrepresentations,\u201d Fleitman said. Fleitman believes these dramatizations cause the public to confuse stalkers with sexy, romantic and heroic leads (much like Edward Cullen of \u201cTwilight\u201d) and think real-life victims are overreacting to a harmless, awkward attachment. With the exclusion of a US National Stalking Hotline and stalking public service announcements, Fleitman wishes there were more content warnings and resources around stalker-centered media so that audiences and organizations didn\u2019t have to do the bulk of the work. \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d rated TV-MA by Netflix for \u201clanguage, nudity, sex, sexual violence, substances,\u201d only has a viewer discretionary warning before \u201cEpisode 4\u201d wherein Gadd\u2019s character is sexually assaulted. In the series finale, the resource, wannatalkaboutit, pops up in the credits. Created by Netflix, it includes round tables and discussions guides of other Netflix shows and films, links to resources such as the National Suicide Hotline, Crisis Text and the Domestic Violence Hotline. Information is also available on sexual assault, sexual violence and relationship abuse. Yet no mention of stalking, despite it being the main subject matter of the show. Neither Netflix nor the \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d teams responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Nasset echoes that educating people about stalking is difficult but believes \u201cwe\u2019re on track\u201d to be able to have more public awareness around stalker-centered media, noting that content warnings or PSAs around sexual violence, which are now common, were rare as recently as 10 to 20 years ago. Fletiman calls stalking shows without PSAs and resources \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Sheridan argues that such efforts at public awareness are important, and reflect changing outlooks on what issues are worth talking about. \u201cI love the way the young people are standing up. I don\u2019t see it that they\u2019re soft and easily offended. I\u2019m seeing they\u2019re just not going to take that crap anymore and I\u2019m loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the PSAs, all the content warnings, bring it on. Because that comes with an opportunity for education as well.\u201d Fleitman also believes these stories have an opportunity: \u201cI think that the media can be a really good starting place for discussion, for learning, for empathizing with victims and survivors (and) for understanding stalking, but only if it\u2019s used that way.\u201d she said. The realities of stalking Stalkers are often imagined as hooded strangers in a secret lair but the reality is less dramatic \u2014 though just as scary. According to Fleitman, stalkers are more likely to be a current or past partner or acquaintance \u2014 a situation represented in both \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and \u201cYou.\u201d Stalking is about scaring or upsetting somebody, she says. SPARC defines stalking as \u201ca pattern of behavior directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress.\u201d Although the definition varies for different areas, Sheridan hopes to defy its notorious murkiness. \u201cA lot of things are hard to define. The bloody weather is hard to define, and people know what that is,\u201d she said. Fleitman hopes \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d can raise awareness for stalking victims, like men and so-called \u201cimperfect victims\u201d whose stories may not look like the ones we\u2019re used to seeing. The term \u201cimperfect victim\u201d refers to people who may be seen by those outside of the situation as not doing enough to prevent their abusers\u2019 actions \u2014 in some cases, they are even accused of doing something themselves to incite the stalker, such as not establishing boundaries or sharing too much private information. Fleitman said what someone chooses to share on the Internet can be seen as the new \u201cwell, what were you wearing?\u201d when it comes to stalking. The narrative enforces that victims are to be seen as blameless and innocent with no prior indiscretions of their own. Nasset often gets called a \u201cperfect victim\u201d because she was quick to report her situation to law enforcement, but she thinks the moniker is a \u201chorrible term.\u201d \u201c[A] stalker is going to do what the stalker is going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re trying to bargain with them or be nice to them, [it\u2019s] not necessarily going to change the trajectory.\u201d In fiction, stalking may make for tense drama, but in reality it is so insidious that it is often called \u201cslow motion homicide.\u201d And, indeed, stalking often ends with violence and death. 76% of intimate partner femicides included stalking in the year prior to their death and stalking increases the risk of intimate partner homicide by three times, according to SPARC. Nasset\u2019s stalker is currently serving 10 years in prison after being sentenced in 2019. He was a stranger who hung around her art gallery and began stalking her in 2011. Stalking is illegal in all US states and territories, but the topic is still under-researched and awareness resources are scant. In fact, stalking first became a crime in the US less than 35 years ago \u2014 in 1990 in the state of California. In Edinburgh, Scotland, where \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d takes place, harassment laws weren\u2019t introduced until 1997 before being amended in 2010 to more accurately reflect stalking\u2019s danger, validity and to call it out by name. This was just five years before the real-life Martha started stalking Gadd and four years before \u201cYou\u201d hit shelves in its first novel incarnation. While stalking makes for compelling storylines, the real-life issue is difficult to navigate. Representation in TV shows or movies could change this for the better by raising awareness about the nuances of predatory behavior. Or, it could perpetuate outdated and dangerous ideas about what stalking really is.

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_morgan-spurlock-death", "text": "Morgan Spurlock, the filmmaker and former CNN series host whose McDonald\u2019s documentary \u201cSuper Size Me\u201d was nominated for an Academy Award, died of cancer complications Thursday, according to his family. Spurlock, who was 53, died in New York, surrounded by family and friends, his brother said in a statement.  \u201cIt was a sad day, as we said goodbye to my brother Morgan,\u201d Craig Spurlock said. \u201cMorgan gave so much through his art, ideas, and generosity. The world has lost a true creative genius and a special man. I am so proud to have worked together with him.\u201d Spurlock\u2019s directing career was varied and unpredictable. He was best known for \u201cSuper Size Me,\u201d which sparked a national conversation \u2014 and no shortage of controversy \u2014 over America\u2019s relationship with fast food. The film involved his experiment in consuming only food from McDonald\u2019s for a 30 days and required him to \u201csuper-size\u201d his food order if prompted in the sales transaction. But he also made a satiric documentary about searching for Osama bin Laden, directed a One Direction concert film and even made a movie about Homer Simpson and baseball.For several years, Spurlock served as host of a popular CNN Original series, \u201cMorgan Spurlock Inside Man.\u201d Born in Parkersburg, West Virginia, the future filmmaker was raised in Beckley, where he graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. He went on to graduate from New York University in 1993. Spurlock was the founder of the New York-based production studio Warrior Poets and his first film, \u201cSuper Size Me,\u201d premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004, where it won him a best director honor. The film went on to win the inaugural Writers Guild of America best documentary screenplay award, as well as garner an Academy Award nomination for best feature documentary. Spurlock\u2019s willingness in that documentary to use himself to experiment with the effects of eating fast food for breakfast, lunch and dinner fascinated audiences. He gained 25 pounds and documented the negative effects it had on his body. His film \u201cSuper Size Me 2: Holy Chicken\u201d was released in 2019. Propelled by the success of his first project, Spurlock delved into other documentaries, including 2008\u2019s \u201cWhere in the World is Osama Bin Laden?\u201d and 2011\u2019s \u201cPOM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.\u201d He also created the reality television series \u201c30 Days\u201d in 2005 and helped Hulu dive into original programming with the platform\u2019s first series, \u201cA Day in the Life.\u201d In 2017, as the #MeToo movement accelerated, Spurlock admitted to sexual misconduct in his past in a statement posted on social media. \u201cI\u2019ve come to understand after months of these revelations, that I am not some innocent bystander, I am also a part of the problem,\u201d he wrote at the time, referencing the recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations against prominent men. He stepped down as CEO of his production company. Spurlock was also a prolific writer and producer.

{"id": "2024_05_22_entertainment_trump-trial-harvey-weinstein-ambra-battilana-gutierrez", "text": "For years, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez says she knew she was being silenced. It was 2015 when the Italian model says she was assaulted by then movie mogul Harvey Weinstein during a casting meeting. She immediately went to the police to report what happened, assuming law enforcement would help her. Nearly a decade later, she is still searching for answers \u2013 not, she says, about just her attack, but what she says are failures of the criminal justice system and how victims are treated. \u201cI was 22 years old, in New York City, I had just got here. I had very little, a thousand dollars, in my bank account and I was assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. I reported him and then I just tried to follow the justice and what they told me to do,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cNow, I know there were so many people against me,\u201d she says. The alleged efforts to silence her have come into clearer focus for Battilana Gutierrez this month \u2013 and not from anything to do with Weinstein, but from the ongoing trial of former President Donald Trump. Battilana Gutierrez says she sees chilling parallels between the alleged conspiracy surrounding a hush-money payment connected to Trump and what happened to her. During Trump\u2019s trial, tabloid king David Pecker \u2013 who oversaw American Media Inc., the parent company to the influential supermarket magazine, The National Enquirer \u2013 testified to buying and suppressing negative stories to help his friend, Trump, win the presidency. \u201cI said that anything that I hear in the marketplace, if I hear anything negative about yourself or if I hear anything about women selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen,\u201d Pecker testified he told Trump. \u201cAnd then he would be able to have them kill in another magazine or have them not be published or somebody would have to purchase them.\u201d He said on the stand that he also looked out for other powerful men he was close to, professionally or personally \u2013 men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, mega talent agent Ari Emanuel and his brother Rahm, who resigned as President Barack Obama\u2019s first Chief of Staff to run for and win the Chicago mayorship. CNN has reached out to representatives for Schwarzenegger, Ari and Rahm Emanuel for comment. But another powerful figure in Pecker\u2019s world who never came up in the Trump trial was Weinstein. \u201cIt would be very interesting to see if he had to speak about the Harvey Weinstein trial,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez said of Pecker. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 Battilana Gutierrez says she was targeted by the National Enquirer in a \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d story operation in 2015 after she told police in New York City that Weinstein groped her breasts and put his hand up her skirt during a casting meeting. She tells CNN that she received an offer of $150,000 from The National Enquirer in 2015 to buy her story. She declined the large sum of money. \u201cThe National Enquirer was in touch with me, and they were asking questions: \u2018What do you want? What do you want?\u2019 because they were trying to buy my story,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez says. \u201cI kept answering, \u2018Nothing.\u2019 I wanted to tell my story, but I wanted to trust someone.\u201d As she was trying to come forward with her story in 2015, suddenly, she was smeared on the front pages of tabloid magazines. \u201cI was put under accusation of not being truthful and to be a prostitute or not a perfect victim because I am a model and I work with bikinis and lingerie. It is ridiculous,\u201d she says. \u201cI just got my life destroyed because the media didn\u2019t know how to buy me. They saw that I didn\u2019t want to be silenced, I didn\u2019t want to get money and they just destroyed my credibility.\u201d Pecker and The National Enquirer\u2019s parent company did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. But during Trump\u2019s trial, Pecker testified to engaging in \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d practices, paying for stories so they would never come to light. Many of the circumstances surrounding Battilana Gutierrez have previously been reported by journalists who helped crack the Weinstein case open. Battilana Gutierrez has spoken to the media extensively as a prominent face of the Weinstein saga \u2013 but up until this conversation with CNN, she has never spoken on-the-record to the media herself about many of these details. It wasn\u2019t just the tabloid media in 2015 that she says tried to silence her. Battilana Gutierrez tells CNN that lawyers for Weinstein offered her up to $1 million to sign a non-disclosure agreement, once they heard that she was trying to come forward with her allegations. \u201cI knew that they were trying to offer me $100,000,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez says, detailing the specifics of Weinstein\u2019s alleged settlement offers. \u201cThey went up to $300,000, $700,000, $1 million, and I still turned down every time.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s spokesperson, Juda Engelmayer, told CNN in a statement, \u201cMs. Gutierrez\u2019 lawyers controlled those meetings and set the terms for it.\u201d  Engelmayer did not respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries specifically regarding Weinstein\u2019s relationship to Pecker, The National Enquirer and their alleged joint efforts to kill Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s story and plant negative pieces about her across the tabloid media. But his spokesperson did say that Weinstein\u2019s recent overturned conviction has \u201copened the flood gates for some to get back into the spotlight, whereas it had all but disappeared.\u201d \u201cEven though he\u2019s in prison and convicted in Los Angeles, Harvey Weinstein\u2019s name alone seems to continue to inspire coverage and attention,\u201d Engelmayer said. Of Battilana Gutierrez, he added, \u201cHarvey wishes her well and hopes only for happiness and success for her.\u201d Eventually, Battilana Gutierrez did sign a non-disclosure agreement with Weinstein\u2019s legal team. She said she felt she had no choice, after her brother back in Italy was randomly approached by strangers inquiring about her, and she was concerned that her family\u2019s safety was in danger. Weinstein\u2019s spokesperson did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment regarding Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s allegations about her brother being approached in Italy, which she says scared her into ultimately signing the NDA. Battilana Gutierrez is disregarding her NDA to speak for this interview. She says it is \u201cmore important\u201d to share her truth. A pursuit of justice Since the initial\u00a0 reporting by The New Yorker and The New York Times in 2017 that led to his downfall, Weinstein has been charged, convicted and sentenced for sex crimes. In New York, he was first sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted of\u00a0 first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape \u2013 guilty verdicts that have now been overturned by the New York Court of Appeals. In Los Angeles, he was sentenced to an additional 16 years in prison for rape and sexual assault. At Weinstein\u2019s New York sentencing, Judge James Burke said: \u201cThis is a first conviction, but it is not a first offense.\u201d Gutierrez now confirms to CNN that she was an anonymous source for Ronan Farrow, who wrote for the New Yorker, giving him audio of Weinstein apparently admitting to groping her breasts, which was recorded during a NYPD sting operation. Even with the recording, prosecutors did not move forward with her case, claiming there wasn\u2019t enough evidence for a conviction. Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan DA at the time, told CNN via email that he assigned the head of the sex crimes unit to examine Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s case and believed she conducted \u201ca full and detailed investigation\u201d before recommending against prosecution for a number of reasons. \u201cI accepted her recommendation because I was personally familiar with her experience, judgment and commitment in this area of criminal investigations,\u201d Vance said. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment on the Weinstein investigation under Vance, but noted that current District Attorney Alvin Bragg is moving forward with a re-trial of Weinstein, after his conviction was overturned last month by the New York Court of Appeals \u2013 a decision that sent shockwaves through communities of survivors of sexual assault and marked a stunning set-back for the #MeToo movement. \u201cAs we stated in court, we will retry the case against Harvey Weinstein, and we urge anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault to call us,\u201d a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office told CNN in response to this story. Weinstein\u2019s spokesperson told CNN, \u201cThe DA\u2019s office knew all the facts and passed on this case. Had they felt they could pursue it, they would have.\u201d Buying the story to bury it Last month, a former editor from the National Enquirer published an essay in New York Times Magazine, sharing what he claims he witnessed during his time at the tabloid, both pertaining to \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d efforts with both Weinstein and Trump. The reporter, Lachlan Cartwright, alleged that in an effort to smear Battilana Gutierrez, attorneys for the Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc. (AMI), engaged in conversations with the Manhattan DA\u2019s Office. He doubled down on that claim, telling CNN, \u201cI learned that a top lawyer at AMI, in 2015, had been in touch with the Manhattan DA\u2019s Office and that person had effectively flipped the script and had been telling the DA\u2019s Office that Ambra was trying to sell her story to the National Enquirer, which was the complete opposite of what was going on.\u201d Cartwright told CNN he learned about this when he served as an anonymous source for the New York Times\u2019 investigation into Weinstein. CNN has not independently verified Cartwright\u2019s claim, and Battilana Gutierrez says while she does not have direct knowledge whether a lawyer for the Enquirer approached the Manhattan DA\u2019s Office, she believes that a \u201cvery complicated web of people were [was] working together to destroy me.\u201d In his email to CNN, Vance did not directly deny Cartwright\u2019s claim, but said, \u201cI have no information that I recall presently that the National Enquirer or anyone representing it spoke with our office about selling a story to the Enquirer.\u201d Cartwright says that when he worked at the Enquirer, he received a tip in 2015 about Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s police report concerning her allegations against Weinstein. He pitched the story \u2013 which would have been a major scoop in a pre #MeToo world \u2013 and was surprised when his bosses asked to buy her story, rather than report the story. \u201cBoth Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump were \u2018FOPs\u2019 \u2013 Friends of Pecker,\u201d Cartwright told CNN. \u201cThe Ambra Battilana story is almost a \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019 in that I think if she had have agreed for her story to be sold, I don\u2019t think the intention was to publish it. I think the intention was to make sure it wasn\u2019t published.\u201d In 2017, The New Yorker reported that the National Enquirer shared unpublished material with Weinstein regarding actress Rose McGowan\u2019s rape accusation, giving him a heads up on allegations that would eventually prove to be damning for Weinstein. Speaking to CNN, Cartwright confirms that during his time at the magazine, the Enquirer\u2019s top editor spoke to Weinstein about McGowan. At the time Battilana Gutierrez filed her 2015 police report, The Weinstein Company was in business with Pecker. Just weeks before Weinstein\u2019s alleged assault on Battilana Gutierrez, Weinstein and Pecker\u2019s companies had signed a deal to create a TV show with the content of the AMI website Radar Online. The show never came to fruition, but the relationship, nevertheless, did benefit Weinstein. \u201cThat meant Harvey Weinstein was a protected species,\u201d Cartwright said, adding, \u201cPeople within American Media \u2026 were working to help Harvey Weinstein and protect him and using the resources of American Media to do so.\u201d A chance to testify Nearly a decade after she first came forward with her allegations against Weinstein, Battilana Gutierrez is still continuing her fight for justice \u2013 especially as Weinstein\u2019s fate in New York remains unknown with an overturned conviction and he vows to appeal his Los Angeles conviction. \u201cI have a lot of questions about 2015 that I have never had answers,\u201d she says. Through Trump\u2019s hush money trial and Weinstein\u2019s continuing legal battles, she sees a common theme: Enormous efforts to silence women, in order to keep influential men in power. \u201cI never really wanted to be an activist. It was something (that) just came up to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like I couldn\u2019t close my eyes when I see something that is not right.\u201d Today, Battilana Gutierrez is on the board of directors at the Model Alliance, a New York- based nonprofit that works towards better treatment of workers in the fashion industry. A working model, she says that her industry is still rife with abuse, despite the efforts of the #MeToo movement. In 2022, she got the chance to testify about what she says happened to her at Weinstein\u2019s Los Angeles trial \u2013 not because her New York case was ever prosecuted, but because Los Angeles prosecutors brought her in as a \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witness, in order to provide more evidence to help establish a pattern of the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s prior pattern of alleged behavior. In that trial, the jury heard Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s recordings with Weinstein. Soon after the verdicts were handed down in 2022, a juror told this reporter he had been particularly struck by Battilana Gutierrez\u2019s story and would have voted to convict if her experience had been directly connected to a charge against Weinstein. When the story was recounted to Battilana Gutierrez in CNN\u2019s interview, she became emotional at everything that had passed since her first meeting with Weinstein. \u201cMy whole wish in 2015 was to be helpful for someone,\u201d Battilana Gutierrez now says, filled with anger and hope. \u201cAll these years that have been passing for me, knowing that if maybe I could have just (found) the right person to release those recordings, I wouldn\u2019t lose everything I lost.\u201d Battilana Gutierrez tells CNN that she hopes the New York case is re-tried this fall, as the DA has announced its intention to do so. And if Weinstein\u2019s Los Angeles appeal is successful, she says she would testify again. She says she won\u2019t stop searching for answers until justice has been served. \u201cWho was the responsible person that made that happen? Because it wasn\u2019t just him. I know there [are] more people behind him that have positions of power that he was using as well.\u201d She adds, \u201cThings that are bad \u2013 lies \u2013 always come out to light.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jason Kravarik contributed to this story.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/entertainment/trump-trial-harvey-weinstein-ambra-battilana-gutierrez/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

This is especially apparent in the new trailer for her upcoming documentary \u201cI Am: Celine Dion,\u201d in which she showcases how much her love of singing and performing live keeps her going while living with stiff person syndrome, a rare neurological disorder.

{"id": "2024_05_23_entertainment_shane-gillis-tires-netflix", "text": "Shane Gillis enjoyed what can only be seen as a triumphant full-circle moment in February. After being hired and quickly dropped by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2019 when racist and homophobic comments surfaced, the comic returned to host the show, reflecting how far his stand-up career had progressed in that span. Gillis\u2019 new series, \u201cTires,\u201d follows a familiar route for rising comedians, migrating to a TV program built around their persona. Yet the worn-out nature of the Netflix show, which Gillis co-created, reflects how much the comedy world has changed since that practice\u2019s heyday in the 1980s and \u201890s, when Bill Cosby, Roseanne Barr, Jerry Seinfeld, Tim Allen, Brett Butler and Ray Romano made the transition to TV and significantly broadened their appeal in shows that attracted vast audiences. \u201cTires,\u201d by contrast, exhibits the narrow qualities of the streaming age, featuring Gillis in an independently produced series unlikely to bring many new admirers his way, but rather narrowly tailored to those already in his cheering section. At six sitcom-length episodes (the shortest runs 18 minutes), \u201cTires\u201d has a small-boned feel even before getting to how flat the jokes are. Indeed, Netflix bought the series along with a second Gillis stand-up special for the streaming service, which is probably the higher priority after his first, \u201cBeautiful Dogs,\u201d premiered last year. In the series, Gillis plays the goofball cousin of Will (Steven Gerben), who\u2019s running a struggling auto-repair shop owned by his father. \u201cTires\u201d possesses the same proudly juvenile tone as Gillis\u2019 act, whether that\u2019s pounding beers at work or leering at women who participate in a promotional bikini car wash. It\u2019s naughty, but not particularly edgy. Like a lot of stand-ups, Gillis operates in his comfort zone by playing a version of himself, and he\u2019s established a clear, potentially more widely marketable niche. Yet as a sign of how the comedy calculus has shifted, there\u2019s less incentive to bother trying to expand his reach, as something like \u201cHome Improvement\u201d or \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d did, instead catering to a small subset of Netflix subscribers. Netflix has positioned itself as a home for all kinds of comedy, including controversial material, presenting specials from Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais that triggered strong criticism. The service responded by expressing support for artistic expression, recognizing, as its statement of culture notes, \u201cNot everyone will like \u2013 or agree with \u2013 everything on our service. \u2026 We program for a diversity of audiences and tastes; and we let viewers decide what\u2019s appropriate for them.\u201d For Gillis, the last few months have appeared validating and vindicating, with \u201cSNL\u201d \u2013 and the mainstream platform the show still commands \u2013 as the cherry on top. During his monologue in February, he briefly joked about his hiring and firing, telling viewers who weren\u2019t familiar with the history, \u201cPlease don\u2019t Google that.\u201d Watching \u201cTires,\u201d though, anybody only vaguely aware of Gillis might be tempted to do exactly that. Because at least in this worn-out vehicle, a casual observer might reasonably wonder why he merited such a fuss to begin with. \u201cTires\u201d premieres May 23 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/entertainment/shane-gillis-tires-netflix/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_anya-taylor-joy-charlize-theron-furiosa", "text": "Nearly a decade after Charlize Theron starred in \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d the franchise continues with the latest installment from director George Miller, \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga.\u201d The new film, which hits theaters Friday, is a prequel to the 2015 \u201cFury Road\u201d and centers on the character\u00a0Furiosa, first played by Theron. Now, Anya Taylor-Joy steps into the role to portray the central heroine in an origin story set in\u00a0Furiosa\u2019s childhood and teenage years. Taylor-Joy raved about Theron in a recent interview with CNN, and said she has been in touch with the Oscar-winning actress, now that they both share a role in Miller\u2019s franchise. \u201cWe have emailed a bunch. We met at the Oscars, and she\u2019s just as lovely and gracious and cool as you could imagine,\u201d Taylor-Joy says of Theron. \u201cWe are due a very long dinner, just to swap war stories. But I feel so lucky to share a character with her. She\u2019s one of my favorite actors and I just think she\u2019s fabulous.\u201d Taylor-Joy said that before she even read the script for \u201cFuriosa,\u201d she felt connected to the character because she had watched Theron in the 2015 film. \u201cI was lucky enough to fall in love with\u00a0Furiosa\u00a0through Charlize\u2019s interpretation in \u2018Fury Road.\u2019 I thought that the character was just somebody who had really stuck with me,\u201d Taylor-Joy says. Miller \u2014 the mastermind director who created the \u201cMad Max\u201d action franchise back in 1979 when Mel Gibson debuted as the title character \u2014 said he considered having the \u201cmagnificent\u201d Theron reprise in the new film, but ultimately decided to find a new star to more accurately portray the timeline of\u00a0Furiosa\u2019s story-arc. (In the new film,\u00a0Furiosa\u00a0is seen from ages 10 to 26.) Miller had initially considered using de-aging technology to bring Theron back to play\u00a0Furiosa, but ultimately decided against it because he believes the technology can be distracting from an artist\u2019s performance. The director said even in some of the best filmmaker\u2019s hands \u2014 like Martin Scorsese and Ang Lee \u2014 he does not believe de-aging technology is as effective as an original performance. \u201cWay back, my intention was, if we were to do the other film, was to do it with Charlize. But almost 10 years has gone by and then I thought, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll try the de-aging,\u2019\u201d Miller told CNN. \u201cAnd then I saw de-aging in the hands of really great filmmakers like Martin Scorsese in the \u2018Irishman\u2019 and Ang Lee in \u2018Gemini Man.\u2019 And what you tend to do is only see the technology \u2014 you\u2019re not really watching performance. So there\u2019s a risk of distracting.\u201d Miller continued,\u00a0\u201cWe watch on the big screen, particularly human faces and we read all the micro things almost subliminally, all the micro movements and gestures and we feel the truth of it in ways that we can\u2019t even analyze \u2014 and even at this point, even computers really can\u2019t do it. So we very quickly, I steered away from that.\u201d That\u2019s how Miller found Anya Taylor-Joy, known for her award-winning performance in \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know who could play it,\u201d Miller said, noting the \u201cbig shoes to fill,\u201d taking on the role played by Theron. He said after watching another one of Taylor-Joy\u2019s films, he thought, \u201cHoly cow \u2013 there\u2019s someone who could take this on. He added, \u201cShe\u2019s got that sort of mystique \u2013 a timeless quality, a wonderful intensity, almost regal.\u201d Starring opposite Taylor-Joy is Chris Hemsworth. The Marvel star, known for playing Thor, takes on a villainous role. \u201cThis was a huge departure from anything I had done before,\u201d Hemsworth told CNN. In the movie, Hemsworth is nearly unrecognizable, wearing a prosthetic nose, fake teeth and long hair. Miller said that he conceived the character years ago \u2014 actually before 2015\u2019s \u201cFury Road.\u201d He said he crafted\u00a0Furiosa\u2019s entire origin story prior to the 2015 film, even though the prequel wouldn\u2019t come out until years late. \u201cWe had some concept art and I wanted him to have this sort of almost Roman emperor nose,\u201d Miller said of the villainous character, Dementus, who is played by Hemsworth. \u201cThat was in the early concept art [and] looked nothing like Chris, at the time.\u201d Hemsworth said his transformation helped him embrace the character. \u201cThe prosthetics, the hair, the makeup provides so much of that, as do the sets and everything involved.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_back-to-black-review-marisa-abela-amy-winehouse", "text": "The tragic arc of Amy Winehouse\u2019s brief life and nova-like career creates built-in problems for a biography of the singer, which doesn\u2019t dampen the knockout performance by Marisa Abela in \u201cBack to Black,\u201d capturing the talent, rage and self-destructiveness that defined her. Thin as biopics go, the power of Abela\u2019s portrayal elevates the film, providing a poignance and strength that\u2019s the clearest motivation to go, go, go. Indeed, Winehouse\u2019s stratospheric rise and paparazzi-plagued stardom lean in the direction of a fairly one-dimensional story, as she falls head over heels for the troubled Blake (Jack O\u2019Connell), entering into a relationship that combines passion, excess and toxicity in roughly equal measure. At the same time, she\u2019s making her mark as a songwriter and singer, though her fondness for drink (and Blake\u2019s dalliances with drugs) goes hand in hand with that \u2013 tendencies that provoke less concern than they seemingly should from her father (Eddie Marsan) and colorful grandmother (Lesley Manville), a one-time jazz singer who isn\u2019t above telling tales out of school about the likes of Tony Bennett. Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (whose credits include the John Lennon biopic \u201cNowhere Boy\u201d as well as \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d) from a script by Matt Greenhalgh, \u201cBack to Black\u201d tilts too heavily toward Winehouse\u2019s personal struggles at the expense of her musical triumphs. Then again, as constructed here, the two went hand in hand, with the lyrics to songs like \u201cBack to Black\u201d and \u201cRehab\u201d directly addressing her addictions to her relationship with Blake and alcohol. Having appeared in the HBO series \u201cIndustry,\u201d Abela pulls off this remarkably challenging character both musically and dramatically, in a way that isn\u2019t necessarily sympathetic \u2013 to the extent Winehouse is often the author of her own troubles \u2013 but rather, magnetic. Ill-equipped for the demands of fame, she achieved it with sheer ferocity and talent, becoming the sort of commodity where the train\u2019s moving too fast to slow down much for warning signs. Of course, just making a movie about Winehouse invites charges of exploiting her tragic end at age 27 as opposed to celebrating her talent, but that\u2019s an issue that can be laid at the feet of any number of gone-too-soon musical biographies, from \u201cThe Doors\u201d to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d (The recent \u201cBob Marley: One Love\u201d was notably made with the blessing and participation of his family and felt like a licensed product.) In terms of capturing what animated Winehouse, the blinding star power that Abela emits here ultimately justifies the exercise. As for whether that means seeing \u201cBack to Black\u201d now in a theater or later at home, it\u2019s the kind of small-boned movie that, unlike its subject, doesn\u2019t quite have the feel of a headliner. \u201cBack to Black\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/back-to-black-review-marisa-abela-amy-winehouse/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish", "text": "Billie Eilish has always done things her own way. Whether it be releasing her 2016 viral hit \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d onto Soundcloud, a DIY music streaming site, or writing and recording her record-breaking debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u201d with her collaborator and brother Finneas O\u2019Connell in her childhood bedroom, Eilish, 22, has never been shy about straying from industry norms \u2013 and it seems to be working well for the two-time Oscar-winner. With her third studio album \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d which drops on Friday, she\u2019s remained consistent. The sound of the album is sure to be a surprise to all, because Eilish intentionally chose to not release a single prior to launching the album \u2013 again, a rather unorthodox move. \u201cI wanna give it to you all at once,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram page last month when announcing the album. Her 2019 debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,\u201d along with 2021\u2019s \u201cHappier Than Ever\u201d and the new record, were all co-written and produced by O\u2019Connell. It follows Eilish and O\u2019Connell\u2019s Oscar win in March for their original song for the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie,\u00a0\u201cWhat Was I Made For,\u201d which was one of 2023\u2019s biggest hits. The duo previously won the Oscar for original song in 2022 for \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d However \u201cHard and Soft\u201d sounds, which we shall soon find out, Eilish hinted in an interview with Rolling Stone last month that she found herself harkening back to her roots with this record, bringing to mind a time in Eilish\u2019s musical journey where she first set her own precedent for being in control. \u201cI feel like this album is me,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a character. It feels like the \u2018When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u2019 version of me. It feels like my youth and who I was as a kid.\u201d Her penchant for bucking the norm is continuing into her plans for her upcoming \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d tour, which kicks off in Baltimore this fall. Eilish is choosing to skirt scalpers by restricting ticket transfers for those purchasing tickets to her shows. \u201cThe tour wants to give fans, not scalpers, the best chance to buy tickets at face value. To make this possible, they have chosen to use Ticketmaster\u2019s Face Value Exchange,\u201d Ticketmaster\u2019s Eilish ticket page reads. It further notes that if fans can\u2019t attend shows in the US or Canada that they\u2019ve purchased tickets for, they have the option to resell them at face value. The move comes nearly two years after the fervor surrounding the purchase of tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour crashed the Ticketmaster site, resulting in fans not having access to tickets, scalpers trying to resell the tickets at ungodly prices and a subsequent congressional hearing. Eilish was clearly paying attention and appears to be one of the only major mainstream artists to adapt, in hopes of preventing scalpers being able to hawk tickets at exorbitant resale fees. And with \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d Eilish is also trying to stand out and apart in the industry with her effort to protect something else she\u2019s historically passionate about: the environment. The \u201cBad Guy\u201d singer made waves when she lamented in a March interview with Billboard about the \u201cwasteful\u201d practice of releasing a multitude of album variants which, in turn, \u201cgets them more money.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so wasteful, and it\u2019s irritating to me that we\u2019re still at a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much about making money \u2013 and it\u2019s all your favorite artists doing that s\u2014,\u201d she said at the time. To back up her complaint, Eilish posted a manifesto on her website describing her sustainability plan for the release of \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d after announcing the album. She wrote that she will only release eight vinyl variants \u201ceach on the same day, containing the same track-listing across the board\u201d \u2013 to remove the incentive for die-hard fans who would purchase all the variants for any differing bonus tracks \u2013 \u201cand all produced with the most sustainable practices available.\u201d Environmental sustainability has remained at the forefront for Eilish to the current moment, as on her Instagram stories on Wednesday, she included sustainable transport plans to her New York album listening event. Perhaps emboldened by the two Oscars or nine Grammys that she\u2019s won, or the fact that her first two albums have hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the young entertainer has a proven track record of success doing things her way. And why should she change now, if it\u2019s working?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_summer-movie-preview-2024", "text": "It may feel like not long ago, but a year has passed since the summer of \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d and Hollywood is hoping for another season of enthusiastic audiences and perhaps an unlikely but viral cinematic pairing. (\u201c#Garfiosa,\u201d anyone?) Some things about this summer\u2019s slate of movies feel similar \u2013 namely, a lot of sequels on offer \u2013 while other elements feel a bit different, like the lingering hangover from last year\u2019s twin strikes that brought movie production to a months-long standstill. Nevertheless, there are more than a few characters sure to distract from that with their showy antics, some masked and mouthy (here\u2019s looking at you, Deadpool) and others aiming to turn our emotions \u201cInside Out\u201d all over again. Behold a list of the most buzzy movies being released theatrically between Memorial and Labor Day Weekends, 2024. For ease of reference, any sequel, prequel or reboot is marked with an asterisk: \u2018Furiosa\u2019* (May 24) George Miller\u2019s fifth foray into the gnarly post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max, \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d explores the origins of the titular character originated by Charlize Theron in 2015\u2019s Oscar-winning epic \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d Here, Furiosa is played to the mettle by Anya Taylor-Joy, with villainous antics (and a prosthetic nose) supplied by Chris Hemsworth. \u2018The Garfield Movie\u2019 (May 24) Chris Pratt gets to add another voice credit to his list of animated roles after last year\u2019s hit \u201cMario Bros. Movie\u201d with \u201cGarfield,\u201d following the famously lethargic ginger cat hailing from the comic strips of yore. Joining Pratt as the titular cat in this family-friendly romp are Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein, along with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Cecily Strong and Bowen Yang. \u2018Ezra\u2019 (May 31) Robert De Niro joins Bobby Cannavale and Rose Byrne in this drama about a comedian who is father to an autistic child, and the unexpected road trip they embark upon. Whoopi Goldberg, Vera Farmiga and Tony Goldwyn (who also directs) costar. Introducing William A. Fitzgerald in the title role as Ezra. \u2018Robot Dreams\u2019 (May 31) Nominated for best animated feature at the Academy Awards earlier this year, \u201cRobot Dreams\u201d is the winsome tale of a dog, named Dog, and his new robot friend named\u2026 you guessed it, Robot. This one gets extra points for being a period piece, of sorts, taking place in New York City in the 1980s. \u2018Summer Camp\u2019 (May 31) This \u201cBook Club\u201d-esque take on three friends from summer camp reuniting later in life for another hurrah stars Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard and Eugene Levy in what (inexplicably) looks to be the role of the hunk they fawned over as youngsters. With this plus \u201cBook Club,\u201d its sequel last year as well as \u201cPoms,\u201d Keaton looks to be launching her very own genre. \u2018Bad Boys: Ride or Die\u2019* (June 7) Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back for a fourth go-round of this buddy comedy/action hybrid, with the twist being that this time, they\u2019re on the run (according to the IMDb logline). The movie, costarring Vanessa Hudgens, follows 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (it seems that title\u2019s promise didn\u2019t quite stick). \u2018The Watchers\u2019 (June 7) The nepo baby phenomenon extends beyond actors, as this June entry marks the feature directorial debut of one Ishana Shyamalan, daughter to M. Night (she gained footing on his Apple TV+ series \u201cServant\u201d). The film looks dutifully creepy, and stars the talented Dakota Fanning (\u201cRipley\u201d) as an artist who finds herself in a strange forest in Ireland. Soon, that becomes the least of her problems. \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 (June 7) You read that right \u2013 this 1999 international classic is being rereleased with a 4K restoration to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie\u2019s original US debut. Starring Franka Potente and directed by the visionary Tom Tykwer, \u201cLola\u201d follows a young woman in Berlin who has 20 minutes to get across town to her boyfriend \u2013 and find 100,000 Deutche Marks on the way \u2013 or else he dies. As time ticks by and Lola makes split-second decisions, her life and that of those around her become remarkably altered. \u2018Inside Out 2\u2019* (June 14) Almost a decade (!!) since Pixar\u2019s Oscar-winning exploration into the mind and emotions of one young Riley, Amy Poehler and company are back as Riley grows into her teen years. Several new emotions will be at play, including Anxiety (voiced by \u201cStranger Things\u2019\u201d Maya Hawke), Envy (\u201cThe Bear\u201d star Ayo Edebiri), embarrassment and even ennui. Oh, to be a teen once again. \u2018Treasure\u2019 (June 14) \u201cGirls\u201d star and creator Lena Dunham and \u201cWilde\u201d actor Stephen Fry play a daughter and father who travel to Poland in the early 1990s to explore the latter\u2019s roots. But the specter of his trauma from surviving the Holocaust causes him to try to sabotage their trip, as the pair nonetheless face the past and grow closer in the process. \u2018Kinds of Kindness\u2019 (June 21) After last year\u2019s surprisingly bizarre and very acclaimed \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is the next team-up between two-time Oscar-winner Emma Stone and \u201cPoor Things\u201d director Yorgos Lanthimos. The new film is billed as a dark \u201ctriptych fable,\u201d costarring Willem Dafoe, \u201cCivil War\u201d actor Jesse Plemons,\u00a0Margaret Qualley, \u201cThe Whale\u201d star Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Mamoudou Athie and \u201cEuphoria\u201d rising star Hunter Schafer. \u2018The Bikeriders\u2018 (June 21) The next starring vehicle for \u201cElvis\u201d actor Austin Butler, \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d looks like a mashup of \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d and \u201cMidnight Cowboy,\u201d with Butler at the head of a rough and tumble biker gang in \u201960s Chicago. Costarring Tom Hardy and \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star\u00a0Jodie Comer. \u2018Thelma\u2019 (June 21) Marking her first lead role, \u201cThelma\u201d stars 94-year-old June Squibb as the titular senior who is targeted in a phone scam and decides to take matters into her own hands to get back what\u2019s hers. The Oscar-nominated \u201cNebraska\u201d star is joined in the new movie by \u201cThe White Lotus\u2019s\u201d Fred Hechinger, who plays her grandson. \u2018A Quiet Place: Day One\u2019* (June 28) This prequel sure looks like it\u2019ll make a lot of noise. The latest entry in John Krasinski\u2019s super sound-sensitive alien invasion franchise, \u201cDay One\u201d stars Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o and will focus on when the vicious beasts first arrive and begin wreaking havoc. \u201cStranger Things 4\u201d breakout star Joseph Quinn, along with franchise returnee Djimon Hounsou, costar. \u2018Horizon: An American Saga\u2019 - Chapter 1 (June 28) Long before \u201cYellowstone,\u201d Kevin Costner roamed the wild American frontier in \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d and he\u2019s clearly not done with the Western genre as this June\u2019s \u201cHorizon\u201d is just the first movie in a series, centered on expansion and settlement both before and after the Civil War. \u201cChapter 2\u201d comes on August 16, with a third installment currently in production. \u2018Despicable Me 4\u2019* (July 3) The Minions are back for another zany romp, with Steve Carell\u2019s Gru and family welcoming a new addition, Gru Jr., and facing off against a new baddie voiced by Well Ferrell. This one is sure to be a known quantity, especially for beleaguered parents looking for a break over July 4th weekend. \u2018MaXXXine\u2019* (July 5) Ti West\u2019s horror trilogy comes to a bloody close with this 1980s Hollywood-set movie starring Mia Goth as an adult film star harboring some killer secrets who is stalked by a slasher. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d comes after West\u2019s impressive 2022 film \u201cX,\u201d and the slightly less convincing \u201cPearl\u201d from later that year. The third entry boasts a phenomenal supporting cast including \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Giancarlo Esposito, Kevin Bacon and singer Halsey. \u2018Fly Me to the Moon\u2019 (July 12) This period piece stars Scarlett Johansson as a PR maven tasked with staging a fake moon landing in case the real one doesn\u2019t take off successfully, opposite Channing Tatum playing the launch director whose job it is to make sure it does. Woody Harrelson costars. \u2018Longlegs\u2019 (July 12) This terrifying-looking thriller stars the prolific Nicolas Cage as a severely demented serial killer leaving occult clues (think \u201cSe7en\u201d) for an FBI agent played by Maika Monroe, the excellent actress who played the final girl in \u201cIt Follows.\u201d The trailer has \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d vibes, in the scariest possible way. \u2018Twisters\u2019* (July 19) Taking a look at weather-related news these days, it\u2019s pretty clear that extreme tornadoes are no longer an odd occurrence deserving of big-budget Hollywood treatment. Nonetheless, \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star Glen Powell is taking over storm-chasing duties from the late Bill Paxton in this almost 30-years-later sequel. Be on the lookout for debris, cows and a possible cameo from Helen Hunt. \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019* (July 26) Almost certainly the blockbuster to beat this summer, the highly anticipated sequel (are you sensing a trend yet?) will see Ryan Reynolds return as the famed Merc with a Mouth, joined for this third go-round by none other than Hugh Jackman, reprising his signature role of Wolverine after (temporarily, anyway) saying goodbye to his claws in 2017\u2019s \u201cLogan.\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is also significant as Marvel\u2019s first R-rated superhero movie, bridging the gap between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the 20th\u00a0Century Fox crop of heroes \u2013 namely the X-Men \u2013 who now belong to Marvel\u2019s parent company Disney. Expect extensive, fourth wall-breaking commentary from Deadpool himself on all of this in the movie. \u2018D\u00ecdi\u2019 (July 26) Coming of age stories are a well-mined area, but this spirited look at a Taiwanese-American 13-year-old boy enjoying the last month of summer before high school in 2008 looks like just the off-kilter and authentic experience that can serve as excellent counter-programming to all the noisier and more mainstream cinematic fare this season. Perhaps make it a double-feature with the aforementioned superheroes, and launch the #DidiPool trend? You heard it here first. \u2018Harold and the Purple Crayon\u2019 (August 2) Based on the popular children\u2019s book by Crockett Johnson, \u201cHarold\u201d stars Zachary Levi (\u201cShazam!\u201d) as the titular owner of a purple crayon that can create anything he imagines. In a bit of a meta moment, he manages to draw himself out of the book and into the real world, where his powers draw the attention of both good and bad players. \u2018Cuckoo\u2019 (August 2) Starring \u201cEuphoria\u2019s\u201d Hunter Schafer in her first lead film role, this horror film looks positively creepy and a bit, well, cuckoo. Schafer plays a young woman visiting a mysterious German Alpine resort with her family. She is soon plagued by horrifically bloody visions and believes a strange woman is following her. The trailer mentions the habits of birds in nature, which definitely ratchets up the ick-factor. Costarring Dan Stevens. \u2018Sing Sing\u2019 (August 2) After his Oscar-nominated turn in last year\u2019s \u201cRustin,\u201d Colman Domingo (who also counts \u201cEuphoria\u201d among his credits) stars in another film based on a true story, this one set at the infamous prison in New York State. In the film, Domingo plays a wrongfully imprisoned inmate who finds meaning through acting in a theatre group alongside other incarcerated men in the penitentiary. Featuring an ensemble cast of formerly incarcerated actors. \u2018Kneecap\u2019 (August 2) This biopic about an Irish rap trio \u2013 who rap in their native Irish tongue \u2013 made a splash at Sundance earlier this year, with the actual trio portraying themselves in the movie. If that\u2019s not enough to pique curiosity, try this \u2013 the film features Michael Fassbender in a supporting role. \u2018Trap\u2019 (August 9) While his daughter\u2019s been busy with her own film (see \u201cThe Watchers\u201d above), M. Night Shyamalan hasn\u2019t slowed down himself, welcoming Josh Hartnett in a plum lead role as a dad taking his kid to the concert of a wildly popular Taylor Swift-like star whose fans are obsessive. Oh, and Hartnett\u2019s character also happens to be a serial killer, and the cops have blockaded the concert venue to trap him (hence the title). The big question is, if we were able to glean all that from the trailer, what could the final Shyamalan twist possibly be at the end? \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 (August 9) Blake Lively stars in this adaptation from the bestselling Colleen Hoover novel, about a traumatized woman torn between her first love and a new relationship, one that reminds her of patterns she\u2019s seen before. Costarring Justin Baldoni, Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj. \u2018Borderlands\u2019 (August 9) In case you\u2019re missing the Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 who took their final bow last summer \u2013 \u201cBorderlands\u201d should have you covered, as the film looks to follow a similarly freewheeling cohort of intergalactic misfits on a valiant quest. Here, they\u2019re led by Oscar-winners Cate Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with Kevin Hart and \u201cBarbie\u201d star Ariana Greenblatt. Based on the bestselling video game. \u2018Alien: Romulus\u2019* (August 16) Just when you thought it was safe to scream in space again, the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise returns, hopefully with a better entry than (at least) the last two. \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe\u201d director Fede Alvarez directs \u201cCivil War\u201d and \u201cPriscilla\u201d star Cailee Spaeny \u2013 who, from the looks of the trailer, seems to be on serious Sigourney Weaver duty \u2013 as she accompanies a group of space colonizers inspecting a derelict space station. It\u2019s a safe bet that they find trouble, and then some. \u2018Close to You\u2019 (August 16) \u201cUmbrella Academy\u2019s\u201d Elliot\u00a0Page stars as Sam, a trans man going home for the first time since transitioning. Once there, he rekindles a romance with an old flame, and must face long-simmering issues. Costarring Hillary Baack and Wendy Crewson. \u2018Blink Twice\u2019 (August 23) Jam packed with a starry cast, \u201cBlink Twice\u201d looks like a perfect late summer movie \u2013 attractive people, elaborate action sequences, and mindless mayhem. This is Channing Tatum\u2019s second entry this summer after \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d here playing a crazy tech billionaire who whisks a cocktail waitress (Naomi Ackie) and her friend (Alia Shawkat) off to his private island for what turns into an insane interlude.

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_another-woman-accuses-diddy-of-drugging-and-sexually-assaulting-her-in-eighth-lawsuit-since-november", "text": "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u00a0has been accused of sexual assault in a new lawsuit filed on Thursday by April Lampros, who says she met him in 1994 when she was\u00a0a student at\u00a0New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology. According to the complaint, filed in New York and obtained by CNN, Lampros accuses Combs of four instances of sexual assault from the mid-1990s to the early-2000s. The suit further accuses the rap mogul of battery, assault, negligent infliction of emotional distress and violation of the victims of gender-motivated violence protection law. The filing has not been reviewed yet by the county clerk. \u201cI\u2019m confident that justice will prevail and the veil will be removed so no other woman will have to endure what I did,\u201d Lampros said in a statement to CNN Thursday. CNN has sought comment from a representative for Combs. This is the eighth lawsuit against Combs since November \u2013 the seventh directly accusing him of sexual assault. One of the eight lawsuits, filed by former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, has been settled. Another lawsuit accused his son Christian Combs of sexual assault, and Sean Combs is accused of aiding and abetting. Lampros had shared with Combs that she wanted to work in the fashion industry, and Combs promised to mentor her, introduce her to music and fashion industry executives and help her find work, the suit says. But, the lawsuit claims: \u201cWhat Mr. Combs displayed as kind gestures quickly manifested into an aggressive, coercive, and abusive relationship based on sex.\u201d In the first encounter in 1995, Lampros alleges that Combs pressured her to drink at a New York City bar and then later at a hotel \u201cshe was laid on the hotel bed where Mr. Combs forced himself on top of her,\u201d the lawsuit said. Lampros claims that Combs raped her after she \u201cpleaded with Mr. Combs to stop.\u201d \u201cShe was nude, sore, and confused\u201d the next morning, according to the lawsuit. During another incident, they were in a parking garage near his Manhattan apartment when Combs allegedly grabbed her and \u201cdemanded Ms. Lampros perform oral sex\u201d while a parking attendant was watching, the lawsuit claims. \u201cMs. Lampros was in shock, morally depleted, embarrassed, and in physical agony because of Mr. Combs violently yanking her down to her knees and pulling her hair,\u201d the suit says. Afterwards, Lampros attempted to leave and distance herself from Combs, and \u201che immediately switched his approach and became angry, threatening, and forceful,\u201d the suit alleges. Combs had \u201cdeveloped this mobster persona, and Ms. Lampros was in fear of him,\u201d the lawsuit said. One night in 1996, Combs allegedly forced Lampros and one of his former girlfriends to take ecstasy at his apartment, after which he demanded the two have sexual intercourse. After Lampros opposed, Combs threatened \u201che could make her lose her job,\u201d the lawsuit claims. Combs then masturbated and raped Lampros, the lawsuit alleges. \u201cShe felt disgusted, ashamed, and embarrassed and couldn\u2019t believe what had happened,\u201d according to the suit. Around 1998, Lampros ended her relationship with Combs, according to the suit. Years later, between the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001, they met again and Combs violently grabbed Lampros and forced himself onto her, kissing and touching her against her will, the lawsuit claims. As a result, Lampros \u201chas suffered and continues to suffer harm, including physical injury, severe emotional distress, humiliation, anxiety,\u201d the lawsuit claims. More recently, Lampros says she was told that Combs had in the past recorded them having sex without her knowing and showed it to multiple people, according to the lawsuit. Combs had a temper and often threatened to harm her if she didn\u2019t act according to his demands, talked to other men or didn\u2019t take his phone calls, Lampros claims in the suit. According to Lampros, she was also not allowed to talk about her relationship with Combs to anyone, the lawsuit claims. \u201cShe felt that if she disobeyed him, he would take away her dreams of pursuing a career in his world. Mr. Combs would also threaten to blacklist her in the industry if she tried to mess with him in any way,\u201d the suit said. \u201cMs. Lampros\u2019 dreams and everything she\u2019s been working hard for were in the palm of his hands.\u201d The suit was filed by Lampros\u2019 attorney Tyrone Blackburn, who also represents others who filed lawsuits against Combs, including\u00a0Rodney Jones, as well as Grace O\u2019Marcaigh, the woman who accused his son Christian Combs of assault.  Defendants named in the suit also include Bad Boy Records, Arista Records and Sony Music Entertainment. Lampros was an intern for Arista Records \u2013 a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment and former parent company of Diddy\u2019s Bad Boy Records \u2013 during at least one of the alleged assaults, the suit says. The complaint alleges Arista Records enabled the sexual abuse by placing Combs in a position of authority and failing to protect Lampros.  CNN has sought comment from representatives for Combs, Bad Boy Records, Arista Records and Sony Music Entertainment. The latest lawsuit comes just two days after former model and winner of MTV\u2019s 1998\u00a0Model\u00a0Mission\u00a0competition show, Crystal McKinney, accused Combs of drugging and sexual assaulting her in a lawsuit. It also comes after CNN released exclusive surveillance footage that showed Combs physically attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016. Combs is a target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security team that handles human trafficking crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. \u201cThere has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations,\u201d said Aaron Dyer, Diddy\u2019s attorney, after two of the musician\u2019s homes were searched in March as part of the investigation.\u00a0\u201cMr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/another-woman-accuses-diddy-of-drugging-and-sexually-assaulting-her-in-eighth-lawsuit-since-november/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_entertainment_furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-review", "text": "In a sign of its priorities \u2013 action over character, production design over story \u2013 Anya Taylor-Joy doesn\u2019t even show up until roughly an hour into \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga.\u201d Then again, the movie\u2019s namesake is really less the star than the dystopian Wasteland that she must navigate, which serves as the backdrop for an undeniably muscular sensory assault that\u2019s a bit malnourished as an origin-story detour off \u201cFury Road.\u201d Director/co-writer George Miller again infuses his film with a manic energy essentially designed to power through its narrative shortcuts. The frenetic and visceral nature of that yields a series of elaborate chases with relatively modest connective tissue holding them together. Spending almost as much time with younger versions of Furiosa as Taylor-Joy, the already-tough girl is quickly abducted from a haven called the Green Place \u2013 \u201ca place of abundance,\u201d as one of the raiders describes it \u2013 and taken to the warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth with an over-the-top lustiness that puts Thor to shame, even before factoring in the amusingly nasty prosthetic nose. Motivated by revenge and exposed to all the horrors the Wasteland can offer, Furiosa winds up operating among the three fortresses of that unyielding world, including one, the Citadel, presided over by the Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme), the nightmare-faced heavy who also appeared in 2015\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cFury Road.\u201d After a strong start, the action becomes a bit repetitive. And while the Mad Max series has never exactly been known for its intricate plotting, the centerpiece of those movies \u2013 \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d \u2013 built a credible foundation, stakes and framing device for the high-octane violence. Here, Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris structure the film in five numbered acts (roughly 30 minutes each), which adds to its already episodic quality, causing the few major characters to disappear for stretches. Similarly, a relationship between Furiosa and an intrepid driver named Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke, who played Orson Welles in \u201cMank\u201d) feels particularly tossed in from left field, though they do make a formidable pair in the carnage-causing department. Like her predecessors leading these movies, Taylor-Joy should be grateful she\u2019s not getting paid by the word, although she\u2019d clean up if her compensation was linked to glowering stares. The main challenge, really, involves treating Furiosa, with her limited screen resume, as the kind of figure to foster keen curiosity about, including the details that forged her. In some respects, \u201cFuriosa\u201d might be less significant for fleshing out the character originated by Charlize Theron than establishing a point of entry \u2013 and a Max-free one, no less \u2013 into one of those \u201cuniverses\u201d that all the cool studios yearn to create. (The film is distributed by Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.) Forty-five years after \u201cMad Max\u201d introduced many to a young Aussie named Mel Gibson, Miller certainly hasn\u2019t lost his touch as a visual stylist and mad maestro of elaborate action. In almost every other respect, this feels like one of those instances where there\u2019s more sound than \u201cFury.\u201d \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d premieres May 24 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling", "text": "Superhero movies have seen better days at the box office, but an action-comedy based on a 1980s TV show still feels like an unlikely candidate to kick off the summer. Buoyed by the lure of what Ryan Gosling can do for a post-\u201cBarbie\u201d encore (or Ken-core), \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d is too flat in the early going to fully meet that challenge, rallying toward the end without reaching the heights required to make a really big splash. At its best, director David Leitch (\u201cDeadpool 2\u201d) has served up a movie defined by its love for the movies, and specifically, the stunt work where he cut his professional teeth before shifting into the big chair. In that sense, the TV series that starred Lee Majors (a show most memorable for its theme song, which is featured) creates a very loose template to set up a vehicle about a stuntman whose troubles spill off the screen into real life, forcing him to put his skills to use dealing with real bad guys. Getting there requires some buildup, with Gosling\u2019s Colt Seavers introduced serving as the stunt double for a typically self-absorbed star, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), while becoming involved with Jody (Emily Blunt), a fellow member of the crew. An accident derails Colt\u2019s plans and indeed life, and time passes before he\u2019s called out of retirement by Gail (\u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham), the fast-talking, troubleshooting producer on all of Ryder\u2019s films. Of course, he\u2019d probably stay safely at home if the space epic in question didn\u2019t mark Jody\u2019s directing debut, offering the prospect of a reunion that, naturally, doesn\u2019t go as smoothly as he hoped. There are also hidden reasons for the renewed interest in Colt, which has to do with offscreen shenanigans and Ryder becoming involved with some nefarious characters. That forces Colt into what amounts to private-eye mode, using his movie-trained skills to get himself both into and out of perilous situations. Setting all that up, including the romance, results in some arid stretches between the elaborate stunts, which are ultimately the main source of \u201cThe Fall Guy\u2019s\u201d appeal and certainly its comedy. Gosling imbues Colt with a goofy charm and amusing neediness, but the underlying premise was a trifle strained even back in the Reagan era, and putting the whole thing on steroids for the movies doesn\u2019t completely address those issues. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d thus stands out primarily for smaller moments and wrinkles, such as Colt\u2019s boss (Winston Duke) constantly quoting movie lines to him, Taylor-Johnson sounding a whole lot like Matthew McConaughey, and a stunt dog trained to respond to French, including an especially juvenile command. Perhaps foremost, \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d feels burdened by the weight of expectations and its positioning as a major blockbuster when the movie really operates as a light-hearted ode to the unknown stuntman, in a way that\u2019s basically just amiably OK. Gosling has broad shoulders, but trying to make it anything more than that is, even for him, a heavy lift. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d premieres May 3 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_entertainment_ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes", "text": "Audiences will be forgiven if they forget that Ilana Glazer and Michelle Buteau are actually playing roles in their new film \u201cBabes.\u201d The raunchy comedy about a pair of childhood friends who navigate two life-changing pregnancies is right in the wheelhouse for the actors, who have known each other since they were up-and-coming comics and have now both become moms in real life. So is it easier or harder playing roles that might in some ways mimic their real lives? Turns out, it\u2019s both. \u201cI would say easier,\u201d Glazer, of \u201cBroad City\u201d fame, told CNN. \u201cSo much easier.\u201d \u201cEasier to play, easier to understand how tired, how confused, how frustrated, how grateful you are to pump and dump (breastmilk), to have a shot (of alcohol) when you\u2019re off the clock,\u201d Buteau chimed in. \u201cAnd also harder because then you\u2019re away from your kids.\u201d The film \u2013 which is being compared to \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and marketed as \u201ca hilarious and heartfelt comedy about the bonds of friendship and the messy, unpredictable challenges of adulthood and becoming a parent\u201d \u2013 was written by Glazer and actor/producer Josh Rabinowitz, who also worked with her on her famed \u201cBroad City\u201d series. That series, which ran from 2014 to 2019, has a cult following, as does Buteau\u2019s recently renewed Netflix series \u201cSurvival of the Thickest\u201d based on her book of essays of the same title. Suffice it to say with two such funny performers working together, not to mention the other cast members including Hasan Minhaj, Oliver Platt and John Carroll Lynch, it was a rollicking good time on the \u201cBabes\u201d set. \u201cWe were cracking up, like crying,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cMy co-writer Josh Rabinowitz famously during the plumber scene laughed so hard he smacked his head on his chair. He like injured his forehead, we were laughing so hard.\u201d Shooting in 25 days, with Buteau only being available to film for 15, heightened both the tension and the hilarity, they said, and Glazer confirmed that some of the best of those funny moments are being put together as extras for streaming. Director Pamela Adlon, best known for her starring role on acclaimed series \u201cBetter Things,\u201d said it was challenging getting the project done in such a short period of time. Yet the timing couldn\u2019t have been better given that she had just wrapped the final season of her show. Plus, the script really spoke to her, she told CNN. \u201cI read it and it was emotional besides all the comedy. And there was an edginess to it,\u201d Adlon said. \u201cAll those things have to go together for me to really respond to something. I gotta have the dark, I gotta have the funny, I gotta have the heart. It\u2019s gotta hit you in the gut to make you feel, make you cry, but then you gotta have a little light.\u201d Glazer should be proud to know that, as she said she, Rabinowitz and their producer Susie Fox worked really hard to mine their own life experiences as parents to craft a relatable script. \u201cIt was really important for us to have something so funny, but to balance it with heart and emotional heft,\u201d she said. \u201cThose were our guideposts.\u201d \u201cBabes\u201d is in theaters Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/entertainment/ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_entertainment_50-cent-diddy-beef", "text": "There is no love lost between hip-hop moguls 50 Cent and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs. 50 Cent has long trolled Diddy on social media, most recently after CNN\u2019s publication of surveillance video showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in 2016. On Tuesday, 50 Cent posted on social media to confirm a TMZ report that he has sold a multi-part documentary about Combs\u2019 legal troubles to Netflix. Combs is currently named in six civil lawsuits, accusing him of a range of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity, the latest of which was filed Tuesday. He is also the target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security Investigations team that handles human trafficking and other crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Combs has previously denied all allegations of wrong doing. CNN has reached out to representatives for 50 Cent and Netflix for comment. But why the bad blood? Here\u2019s a look back at how there came to be animosity between the two men. A diss track In 2006, 50 Cent released a diss track \u201cThe Bomb,\u201d which featured sounds of gunfire and his allegation that Combs knew the identity of the killer of Christopher Wallace, a rapper known as The Notorious B.I.G., who was both a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and best friend to Combs. Wallace was gunned down in Los Angeles in March 1997 as he and his crew, which included Combs, were traveling in a caravan. Combs was in a different vehicle from the one Wallace was in at the time Wallace was shot. No one has ever been charged with the murder. In his diss track, 50 raps, \u201cI guess this means I won\u2019t be invited to the white parties in the Hamptons,\u201d referencing Combs\u2019 famous soirees held in the upscale New York community. 50 Cent has also said he believes Combs is connected to the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur. Combs called such allegations \u201cnonsense\u201d in a 2016 interview with the syndicated radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club.\u201d He has never been charged in connection to either case. Consistent trolling Followers of 50 are familiar with his reputation for sharp comments and social media trolling. The rapper-turned-television-producer has made Combs a frequent target, attacking everything from his music to his age.  Some believed it was mostly marketing, especially given the men\u2019s parallel career tracks and even competing vodkas at one point, Effen Vodka from 50 Cent and Ciroc, which formally partnered with Combs. But 50 upped his comments after Combs was sued in November 2023 by Ventura, who in a now-settled civil complaint alleged that Combs raped her in 2018 and abused her over the more than decade they were in an off-and-on relationship. Combs has denied the allegations, but apologized on Sunday for the incident depicted in the surveillance video. After federal investigators searched Combs\u2019 homes in Miami and Los Angeles in March, 50 Cent  posted on X, \u201cNow it\u2019s not Diddy do it, it\u2019s Diddy done. They don\u2019t come like that unless they got a case.\u201d Diddy denies there\u2019s beef Combs was asked about the tension between him and 50 Cent during an appearance on \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d in 2018. \u201cI don\u2019t have no beef with Fif. He loves me,\u201d Combs said. \u201cY\u2019all can\u2019t see that he loves me? You really think that\u2019s hate? \u2026 You know he loves me.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t take the things 50 Cent says about him seriously. \u201cWhen he does that it\u2019s like funny to me,\u201d Combs said. \u201cI don\u2019t really take it personal. I know he has a different sense of humor, and he\u2019s just not in my life. We don\u2019t have to never cross paths, and I will never say nothing negative about him, you know, because that\u2019s just not me.\u201d A son\u2019s defense Christian Combs, who goes by King Combs, is the 26-year-old son of Diddy. Earlier this month, he released a song titled \u201cPick a Side\u201d in support of his father and taking aim at critics like 50 Cent. The younger Combs and his brother, Justin, were temporarily handcuffed and detained by authorities during the March search on their father\u2019s home. Neither was arrested or charged. Aaron Dyer, Diddy\u2019s attorney, said in a statement to CNN at the time that \u201cthere was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs\u2019 residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.\u201d King Combs appeared to profess his father\u2019s innocence in his track and took a swipe at 50 Cent. \u201cAll that gossip sh*t is whack when all they had was 50 Cent / Who put this city on the map? / Stop lying,\u201d the younger Combs raps. 50 Cent responded with a tongue-in-cheek post on social media. \u201cI feel so threatened by the things Christian is saying on his record,\u201d he wrote in a since-delated post on Instagram, according to Billboard. \u201cI\u2019m afraid for my life, please don\u2019t hurt me guys.\u201d The TMZ story about the docuseries that 50 Cent shared on Tuesday said the project will reportedly be titled, \u201cDiddy Do It?\u201d \u201cIf more victims keep coming out I\u2019m gonna need more episodes,\u201d he wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/entertainment/50-cent-diddy-beef/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_sean-kingston-fraud-arrest-home-raid", "text": "Rapper Sean Kingston and his mother have been arrested on fraud and theft charges after the star\u2019s South Florida residence was raided by a SWAT team Thursday morning, authorities announced. Arrest and search warrants were served at a home in Southwest Ranches, a town about 15 miles from Fort Lauderdale, according to the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The singer\u2019s mother, Janice Turner, was taken into custody following the raid and Kingston was arrested Thursday evening in Fort Irwin, California, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Both face \u201cnumerous fraud and theft charges,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. Arrest warrants issued for Kingston and Turner on May 20 detail an alleged scheme starting October 2023 to defraud several businesses including a jeweler and car dealership of a variety of goods valued at $100,000 or more. The mother and son were accused of grand theft of property valued around $86,000, grand theft from a car dealership of a luxury car worth about $159,000 and grand theft of jewelry worth $480,000, according to the documents. They are further accused of several counts of identity fraud and writing bad checks, and Kingston was charged with violating\u00a0his probation in connection with trafficking stolen property, according to the documents. Kingston posted on Instagram Thursday night, \u201cPeople love negative energy! I am good and so is my mother! My lawyers are handling everything as we speak.\u201d CNN has sought comment from Kingtston\u2019s publicist but has been unable to identify an attorney for the singer. The home that was raided Thursday is listed as Kingston\u2019s residence in a breach of contract lawsuit brought against the singer by Ver Ver Entertainment, a company that sells and installs high-end television and sound systems, according to court documents filed in February. It\u2019s unclear whether the lawsuit is connected to the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigation, which the office says began in nearby Dania Beach. Ver Ver Entertainment alleges that Kingston reached out to the company in September 2023 about purchasing a 232-inch TV and sound system, according to the suit. The lawsuit alleges Kingston promised to film promotional videos for the company with singer Justin Bieber in exchange for a lower down payment on the entertainment system. Kingston paid a $30,000 down payment and the entertainment system was installed, according to the suit. But Kingston did not make the remaining payments on the TV or promote the company alongside Bieber, the suit alleges. Kingston and Bieber collaborated in 2010 on the hit song \u201cEenie Meenie\u201d and the rapper told Ver Ver last year that he still had a \u201ccurrent and ongoing working relationship\u201d with Bieber, the suit alleges. The lawsuit says Kingston\u00a0didn\u2019t have an ongoing\u00a0working relationship with Bieber and the singer didn\u2019t \u201chave any intention\u201d of making promotional content with the pop star for Ver Ver. Ver Ver made several attempts to get the remaining payments from Kingston but was unsuccessful, the lawsuit states. The entertainment system and its installation were valued at more than $110,000 in an invoice included in the lawsuit. Dennis Card, an attorney representing Ver Ver, alleged that Kingston and his mother work together to obtain expensive items. \u201cHe leads people to believe he\u2019s a wealthy, high-rolling guy,\u201d Card told CNN. Kingston\u2019s career exploded in 2007 with hit platinum chart-topper \u201cBeautiful Girls\u201d and his collaboration with Bieber on \u201cEenie Meenie\u201d catapulted him even further into pop stardom. After releasing a string of singles and his \u201cBack 2 Life\u201d album in the 2010s, Kingston largely stayed out of the limelight until his fourth album, \u201cRoad to Deliverance\u201d was released in 2022.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/sean-kingston-fraud-arrest-home-raid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_entertainment_the-garfield-movie-review", "text": "Given Garfield\u2019s long history it\u2019s hard to imagine a film about the corpulent cat that feels as if it\u2019s made for almost nobody, but \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d limbos under the bar. Big and loud, with animated action aimed at kids, the film also loads up references to things like \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d \u201cTop Gun\u201d and \u201cFargo\u201d and still manages to feel as stale as a week-old lasagna left out too long in the summer. Part heist movie, part family reunion, the film draws upon the most salient characteristics of the flabby feline, but mostly as an excuse to build a story that seems to crawl further from its origins with every passing frame. A bevy of star voices (Chris Pratt leading the way in the title role, along with Samuel L. Jackson) can\u2019t enliven a project that, creatively speaking, exhausts at least four or five of its nine lives. Peaking during a pre-credit sequence, the film introduces a big-eyed baby Garfield (those plush toys aren\u2019t going to sell themselves) who gets abandoned by his dad, Vic (Jackson), a resourceful outdoor cat, and taken home by Jon (Nicholas Hoult), who even adopts Odie the dog to keep him company. Flash forward several years, and the grown and well-fed Garfield has his suburban bliss upended when he\u2019s abducted (catnapped?) by Jinx (Hannah Waddingham, in a mini-\u201cTed Lasso\u201d reunion with Brett Goldstein as one of her hench cats), using him as bait to lure Vic out of hiding and exact revenge. Said revenge involves forcing Vic and the resentful Garfield to team up on a milk heist from Lactose Farms, a setup that should make even dairy enthusiasts feel a trifle intolerant. In the process they encounter a lovelorn bull (Ving Rhames) and a security guard (Cecily Strong) named Marge who sure sounds a whole lot like her \u201cFargo\u201d namesake. A lot more happens, but it\u2019s all a transparent ploy to keep the audience distracted long enough for Garfield and Vic to engage in family bonding, and squabble over their \u201cThe Aristocats\u201d-style differences, which proves less heartwarming than intended. Part of the inherent challenge has to do with the demands of taking the simplicity of the original \u201cGarfield\u201d comic strip and blowing it up into something that can sustain this kind of enterprise, a task that feels especially thorny in this case. Traditionally, parents have looked for movies they can safely take kids to during the summer, and barring a few mildly racier gags, \u201cGarfield\u201d meets those modest criteria, at least, until reinforcements like the \u201cInside Out\u201d and \u201cDespicable Me\u201d sequels arrive. For anyone with an appetite for more than air conditioning and a PG rating, though, \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d is more like a stale snack than a fancy feast. \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d premieres May 24 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/entertainment/the-garfield-movie-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_if-review-ryan-reynolds-john-krasinski", "text": "Occasionally a movie gets misleadingly marketed for understandable reasons, and so it is with \u201cIF,\u201d a sweetly sentimental film from writer-director John Krasinski that the ads make look like a madcap romp. The best parts should strike a mildly receptive chord with parents while potentially boring younger kids, a prescription that could subject the movie\u2019s imaginary friends to a harsh reality once audiences in summer-movie mode get a good look at it. After his breakout success with \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (whose delayed prequel will arrive in June), Krasinski shifts toward a PG-rated movie built around animated characters, infused with a family-friendly vibe. Yet it\u2019s no accident that the classic James Stewart movie \u201cHarvey\u201d at one point plays on the TV, since \u201cIF\u201d seeks the same whimsical tone, while owing perhaps its strongest debt to the 1995 film adaptation of \u201cA Little Princess\u201d \u2013 which also focuses on a young girl dealing with grief, loss and uncertainty \u2013 brightened by detours into the fantastic. Bea (Cailey Fleming, delivering a splendid anchoring performance after growing up among \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) has already lost her mom, and now her dad (Krasinski) is hospitalized as he awaits heart surgery. Forced to stay with her grandma (Fiona Shaw), Bea discovers a neighbor (Ryan Reynolds in kinder, gentler mode) who works to find new homes for imaginary friends (or IFs) whose kids have grown up and forgotten them. The imaginary friends, not surprisingly, turn out to be an eclectic and colorful lot, featuring a wide assortment of celebrity voices, among them Krasinski\u2019s wife, Emily Blunt, and the late Louis Gossett Jr. The most prominent imaginary pair each have notable connections to other cast members: Krasinski\u2019s \u201cThe Office\u201d co-star Steve Carell, whose needy Blue bears a too-strong resemblance to McDonald\u2019s Grimace; and Blossom, voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who produced \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d which co-starred Shaw. As Bea states at the outset, she no longer considers herself a kid given what she\u2019s endured, which makes the dual mission pretty overt \u2013 not just finding kids to go with these eccentric monsters, but helping the girl rediscover the wonders of childhood. In that latter regard, Krasinski conjures some touching, lovely moments, although they coexist awkwardly with the imperative to wring laughs and sight gags out of the computer-generated characters, which, however impressively they\u2019re rendered, has the effect of flattening the movie. In one respect, it\u2019s admirable that Krasinski would try to parlay whatever clout he\u2019s amassed into something more heartfelt, but that approach might have fared better by sparing the demands and expectations that go with lining up all those big names, lavish premieres, colorful character posters and marketing tie-ins. Simply put, it\u2019s a tough needle to thread. \u201cSometimes, life doesn\u2019t always have to be fun,\u201d Bea somberly tells her dad early on, as he tries to lift her spirits and allay her fears. \u201cIF\u201d does make the case for finding the fun in life, but in a movie that needs to be more fun than it is. \u201cIF\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/if-review-ryan-reynolds-john-krasinski/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_entertainment_jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-question-timeline", "text": "Plenty of people are wondering if Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are having problems in their marriage, but one person had the nerve to ask in a public forum. In a widely video shared video from a press conference in Mexico for her new film \u201cAtlas,\u201d an unidentified reporter is heard asking Lopez about speculation the couple is on the outs. \u201cYou know better than that,\u201d Lopez said, before the talk quickly moved on to a different topic. Lopez and Affleck have stayed mum about speculation that they are experiencing issues, but that hasn\u2019t stopped chatter in the pop cultureverse. In addition to reports that Affleck is living in a different home than his wife, he was noticeably absent from both a recent premiere of \u201cAtlas\u201d and the Met Gala earlier this month, where Lopez served as a co-chair. CNN has reached out to representatives for Affleck and Lopez for comment. In the meantime, here is a reminder of their more than 20-year-love-story. December 2001 Lopez and Affleck met on the set of the rom-com \u201cGigli,\u201d where they played criminals stuck on a job together and the pair strike up real-life friendship. April 2002 Suggestions Ben and Jen were more than just friends began after Affleck took out a full-page ad in trade publications to both promote their film and praise her performance. \u201cIt has been nothing but an honor and a pleasure to work with you,\u201d the ad read. \u201cI only wish I were lucky enough to be in all your movies.\u201d Signed: \u201cWith love, respect, and gratitude, Ben Affleck.\u201d July 2002 Lopez and Cris Judd filed for divorce during the summer of 2002, but had reportedly been split for a bit by then. \u201cJennifer Lopez and Cris Judd have announced they have resolved all issues arising out of their marriage,\u201d the couple\u2019s lawyers said in a statement at the time. \u201cThe resolution was extremely amicable \u2026 The two will remain friends.\u201d August 2002 Paparazzi photos were published of Affleck and Lopez looking cozy. November 2002 The couple got engaged after Affleck popped the question with a custom 6.1-carat pink diamond ring from Harry Winston. He also appeared as Lopez\u2019s love interest in the music video for her single \u201cJenny From the Block,\u201d which featured a storyline centered on media attention to their relationship. In the video, Affleck \u2013 literally \u2013 kisses her famous booty in a scene of the couple on a yacht. March 2003 Lopez and Affleck made a stunning pair on the red carpet at the 75th Annual Academy Awards. July 2003 The couple attended the premiere of their film \u201cGigli,\u201d which struggled at the box office. September 2003 Days before the pair are set to wed, they postponed their nuptials and released the following statement: \u201cDue to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date. When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate \u2018decoy brides\u2019 at three different locations, we realized that something was awry. We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.\u201d Sources told CNN at the time that the couple was \u201ctaking a break.\u201d January 2004 The duo officially called off their engagement and parted ways. March 2004 Another film in which the two costarred together, \u201cJersey Girl,\u201d debuted and also underperformed with audiences. June 2004 Lopez married friend, singer Marc Anthony, with whom she shares twins \u2013 a son and a daughter. In her 2014 book, \u201cTrue Love,\u201d Lopez reportedly wrote that the end of her relationship with Affleck was her first \u201creal heartbreak\u201d and \u201cMarc came back into my life three days after I should have been at the altar saying \u2018I do\u2019 to another man.\u201d June 2005 A year later, Affleck married actress Jennifer Garner in a private ceremony. They went on to have three children together. July 2011 Fans are stunned when Lopez and Anthony announce they are separating. He filed for divorce in April 2012. July 2015 There\u2019s even more shock when Garner and Affleck announced their split. Their official divorce filing came two years later. \u201cThey remain friends and continue to co-parent their three kids amicably,\u201d a source close to the couple told CNN at the time. \u201cThey had always planned to divorce but just needed time. As always, their children are their first priority.\u201d August 2018 Affleck entered rehab for the third time, having earlier completed treatment stays in 2001 and 2017. In March 2017, he shared in a Facebook post why he had sought help at that time. \u201cI have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I\u2019ve dealt with in the past and will continue to confront,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be. I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step.\u201d March 2019 Lopez and former baseball player Alex Rodriguez became engaged, two years after they started dating and 20 years after she autographed a poster for the self-avowed Lopez fan. February 2020 Affleck raved about Lopez to CNN while promoting his film, \u201cThe Way Back.\u201d He said he had no regrets about making \u201cGigli\u201d because \u201cI made a great friendship with Jennifer Lopez, who I think is a fabulous person and I\u2019m so excited for her continued success.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think she always got the respect that she deserved, in part, because she was a powerful woman,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also because she was a Latina and she was really groundbreaking and nobody wanted to acknowledge that. They just wanted to kind of hate, so it\u2019s nice to see her having that success.\u201d March 2021 There was some confusion as Lopez and Rodriguez reportedly split, only to say days later in a statement that they were still a couple after all. April 2021 Rodriguez and Lopez announced their engagement was called off. They released the following statement. \u201cWe have realized we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so. We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects. We wish the best for each other and one another\u2019s children. Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support.\u201d Soon after, Affleck was photographed visiting Lopez\u2019s Los Angeles home. July 2021 The summer heated up after Lopez and Affleck made their reunion and relationship Instagram official. September 2021 Paparazzi (and fans) went wild when the pair returned to the red carpet for the premiere of his film \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d at the Venice Film Festival in Italy. December 2021 Affleck expressed his gratitude for second chances in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, calling his rekindled romance with Lopez \u201cbeautiful.\u201d \u201cMy life now reflects not just the person that I want to be, but the person that I really feel like I am \u2013 which is not perfect, but somebody who tries very hard and cares very much about being honest and authentic and accountable,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say who benefits more, without going into gossipy detail.\u201d February 2022 Lopez was also seemingly thrilled about their reconciliation. \u201cI feel so lucky and happy and proud to be with him,\u201d Lopez told People magazine about reuniting with Affleck. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful love story that we got a second chance.\u201d April 2022 The pair became engaged once again, after Affleck surprises Lopez with a proposal while she was in the bathtub. July 2022 Lopez and Affleck eloped by traveling to Las Vegas with their children, where they stood in line with other couples to be wed at a chapel in the desert city. August 2022 Getting married was so nice, the couple did it twice. They held a lavish wedding on Affleck\u2019s sprawling estate outside of Savannah, Georgia, complete with famous friends like Matt Damon and director Kevin Smith in attendance alongside their families. February 2024 Lopez releases both an album and a film titled \u201cThis is Me\u2026Now: A Love Story,\u201d as well as her documentary on the project, \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told.\u201d In the doc, Affleck speaks to some of their challenges as a couple. In reflecting on their earlier relationship, he said, \u201cI had a very firm sense of boundaries initially around the press, while Jen I don\u2019t think objected to it in the way I did. I very much did object to it.\u201d \u201cGetting back together, I said, \u2018Listen, one of the things I don\u2019t want is a relationship on social media,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd then I sort of realized it\u2019s not a fair thing to ask. It\u2019s sort of like you\u2019re gonna marry a boat captain and you go, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like the water.\u2019 We\u2019re just two people with kind of different approaches trying to learn to compromise.\u201d May 2024 Reports of tension circulate after the couple had not been photographed together in 47 days, according to People magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-split-question-timeline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_the-beach-boys-brian-wilson-music-documentaries", "text": "Streaming has yielded bounties in numerous areas, but nowhere more than in the field of music documentaries catering to Baby Boomers. Those projects have also been enriched not just by nostalgia for great acts but by weaving their soundtracks into the evolution of the culture through tumultuous times in the 1960s and \u201870s. Add two more projects to that tally this week: \u201cThe Beach Boys,\u201d an ode to the band that gave the world the surf sound and whose members, among other things, crossed paths with the Manson family; and \u201cStax: Soulsville USA,\u201d HBO\u2019s multi-part look at the Memphis music label that championed such artists as Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes. These productions have caught a different kind of wave, following \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back\u201d and Peter Jackson\u2019s more recent restoration of the Fab Four\u2019s \u201cLet It Be\u201d on Disney+; \u201cPaul Simon: In Restless Dreams\u201d (MGM+); Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Night in Pop,\u201d about the recording of \u201cWe Are the World\u201d in 1985; \u201cThank You, Good Night \u2013 The Bon Jovi Story\u201d (Hulu), and many more, among them an upcoming Cyndi Lauper documentary, \u201cLet the Canary Sing,\u201d on Paramount+. Despite advertisers\u2019 historic emphasis on reaching younger viewers, streaming services also rely on subscriptions, and Baby Boomers\u2019 money is as green as everybody else\u2019s. Beyond appealing to that demo, the documentaries create the opportunity to introduce these acts and their music to newer generations, while providing fresh insights for those weaned on them. \u201cThe Beach Boys,\u201d in particular, feels like a logical companion to Disney+\u2019s material on the Beatles, given the extent to which the two bands competed and fed off of each other\u2019s triumphs. As USC professor and cultural historian Josh Kun notes, the relationship between the bands was as much a collaboration as a rivalry, with Beach Boys songwriter/producer/troubled genius Brian Wilson drawing inspiration from John Lennon and Paul McCartney\u2019s creative output, and McCartney heralding Wilson\u2019s towering accomplishment, \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d as near perfection. Fueled by interviews with the surviving members, directors Frank Marshall (whose work in this space included \u201cThe Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\u201d) and Thom Zimny (a frequent Bruce Springsteen collaborator, including \u201cLetter to You\u201d) also enlist other musical luminaries to weigh in on the Beach Boys\u2019 influence and significance. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, for example, recalls crying when she first heard \u201cGod Only Knows,\u201d while Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Lindsey Buckingham discusses the tension between Wilson\u2019s creative ambitions and the commercial imperatives of a record label that didn\u2019t understand them. Wilson hated touring, retreating to the studio after experiencing what amounted to a breakdown on the road. After that, the Beach Boys essentially became two bands, one performing live and the other writing and fine-tuning songs back home. The Beach Boys\u2019 carefree image also proved out of tune with the Vietnam War. It was during those years when rifts formed and Dennis Wilson befriended Charles Manson, with band member Mike Love recalling that one encounter with the cult leader was enough for him. Discussing the band\u2019s internal dynamics, Love explains, \u201cI complemented Brian\u2019s melancholy with my upbeat-ness.\u201d \u201cThe Beach Boys,\u201d too, offers melancholy and nostalgia, and more than anything heightens appreciation for all those lingering vibrations, good and otherwise. As for \u201cStax,\u201d which premiered earlier this week on HBO, that story also conveys a combination of the sweet and sour, with the joy of the label\u2019s music offset by memories of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination and the shocking death of Redding in a 1967 plane crash, just before his \u201c(Sittin\u2019 On) the Dock of the Bay\u201d became a million-selling hit. Founded in 1957, Stax had to grapple with segregation and racism while building its profile, which, in one of the more enlightening sections, included an elaborate Oscar campaign for Hayes\u2019 theme from the movie \u201cShaft,\u201d as he became the first Black songwriter to win. Like Brian Wilson and Love, \u201cThe Beach Boys\u201d and \u201cStax\u201d complement each other, along with past documentaries that have covered similar territory, such as \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d Thanks to streaming, the road back to the music of the \u201860s and \u201870s is well traveled, but productions like these make those trips well worth taking. \u201cThe Beach Boys\u201d premieres May 24 on Disney+. \u201cStax: Soulsville USA\u201d is playing on HBO and Max, which, like CNN, are units of Warner Bros. Discovery.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/the-beach-boys-brian-wilson-music-documentaries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_entertainment_rick-and-morty-animated-tv-series-cec", "text": "After 10 years on the air, \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d the animated sci-fi comedy about a misanthropic scientist and his 14-year-old grandson\u2019s interdimensional adventures, is surprising as ever. In its seven seasons, it has steered its characters through apocalypses, divorces, an alien musical reality TV competition and school dances \u2014 events with equal gravity in its off-kilter universe. There are very few rules in \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d which makes the job all the more fun for its writers, who are working on its eighth and ninth seasons now. But in the middle of its seventh season, which ended in December, \u201cRick and Morty\u201d made its most shocking move yet \u2013\u2013\u00a0it finally gave Rick what he\u2019s spent more than half of his 70-odd years seeking. Rick finally killed his mortal enemy, Rick Prime, in the fifth episode of the show\u2019s recent 10-episode season. Rick Prime, a cruel version of Rick from another dimension, killed our Rick\u2019s wife, throwing his life off-course. Our protagonist\u2019s curdled, single-minded pursuit of vengeance eventually led him to rejoin his family, recruit his daughter Beth\u2019s teenage children for his interdimensional travels and set the series in motion. But true to \u201cRick and Morty\u2019s\u201d deeply cynical tone, Rick feels nothing when he kills Rick Prime in a series of increasingly brutal punches. Afterwards, back at his family home, while Morty rejoices in Rick\u2019s \u201cvictory,\u201d Rick is as numb as a zombie. The act of killing his enemy, Rick realizes, was ultimately meaningless and does nothing to ease the loss of his wife. It takes him a few episodes to shake his despair. \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d says series writer Heather Anne Campbell, is incredibly silly but utterly serious about the weirdness of being alive.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get at some deeper, funnier, dumber, more nihilistic truth about what we\u2019re doing here,\u201d Campbell told CNN. \u201cThe most effective way to demonstrate that to an audience is like, yeah, have you achieved your goal? And it doesn\u2019t feel like anything? What does that mean? Because that\u2019s something everybody experiences, I think, all the time.\u201d To love \u201cRick and Morty\u201d is to know that it can go anywhere at any time, from the planet Alphabetrium, made up of letter-shaped beings including the rapper Ice-T, to Viking Valhalla with Bigfoot. There are endless possibilities in the world(s) it\u2019s built, where substance-addled scientist Rick is the self-proclaimed smartest man in the universe and can do pretty much anything except readily admit his love for Morty, granddaughter Summer or Beth, or anyone beyond his best friend, the recently resurrected Bird Person. The season wasn\u2019t all major revelations and deeply sad dramatic beats, though. Just a week before that pivotal installment, \u201cRick and Morty\u201d aired an episode in which Rick feeds his family delicious spaghetti that they discover was made from a dead body. (Campbell wrote that one, plus the season seven finale.) That\u2019s the fulfilling joy of writing for \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d Campbell says \u2013\u2013 its \u201cinfinite sandbox.\u201d No idea is off limits as long as it rings true in the universe of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d and to its viewers, be it the moral cost of a spaghetti dinner or the emptiness felt after vanquishing a foe. \u201cThe six seasons previous have shown us that literally anything can be an episode,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the strength of the show is taking any of these completely absurd sci-fi concepts and really interrogating them and trying to illuminate some stupid truth about what life is and what we\u2019re experiencing.\u201d Rick made major strides in season seven, with one major setback As in previous seasons, \u201cRick and Morty\u2019s\u201d seventh season was profane, uproariously funny and often deeply upsetting. (\u201cRick and Morty\u201d is a property of Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN.) It was the first to air after Justin Roiland, who co-created the series with Dan Harmon and voiced both title characters, was fired due to allegations of sexual assault. But his departure didn\u2019t kneecap the series \u2013\u2013 new actors Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden were brought in to voice Rick and Morty, respectively, and the show continues to probe the mysteries of life in outlandish scenarios, asking questions like, Would you stage an intervention for your alcoholic friend whose wife left him for the Predator? And also, what if Hugh Jackman was there? Nihilism is where \u201cRick and Morty\u201d thrives \u2013\u2013\u00a0in the very first season, our title characters abandoned Morty\u2019s home planet with his parents and sister still on it after they unleashed a Cronenberg-ian mutation that turned everyone into oozing, murderous monsters, and all because Morty asked Rick for a love potion. But by the end of this seventh season, our title characters have emotionally matured somewhat. The pair get a subtly sweet moment in the season finale: Rick and Morty have grown jaded by the horrors they\u2019ve seen across dimensions and find they can no longer be scared. Eager to feel the jitters again, they leap into something called the Fear Hole, which brings to life their deepest anxieties. For Morty, that\u2019s a life where Rick leaves. Inside the hole, Morty meets a version of Diane, Rick\u2019s dead wife. Morty\u2019s fear manifests a version of Rick, who Diane tries to convince to stay in the hole \u2014\u00a0even though it\u2019ll kill him. Morty finally climbs out of the hole, but only after confronting his fear that Rick could leave the family as suddenly as he reentered their lives, stranding Morty in an unremarkable life once again. \u201cAm I \u2026 irreplaceable?\u201d Morty asks Rick once he\u2019s left the hole. Rick, ever withholding, counters: \u201cDefine irreplaceable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good \u2026 good,\u201d Morty says, hugging Rick tightly, a rarity in the series. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d Teetering on the edge of the hole, which is inexplicably located in a bathroom stall inside a Denny\u2019s, Rick is briefly tempted to find Diane, a choice made weightier by Rick\u2019s recent killing of the man who killed her. Instead, he pulls a photo of Morty out of his wallet and pins it to a corkboard inside the stall to signify, with pride, that his grandson is one of the few to make it out of the Fear Hole alive. It\u2019s as close as Rick can come to admitting he loves his grandson. The quiet moment lands because it\u2019s taken Rick so long to go that far \u2013\u2013\u00a0and leaves the rest of the series wide open. It\u2019s an exciting prospect for viewers and even for Cardoni, the new voice of Rick, who doesn\u2019t know where the series is headed either. \u201cThe character is growing,\u201d Cardoni told CNN ahead of the finale. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some great turns with (Rick) just in the season, in terms of his emotional health and mental health. We\u2019ve seen it working, and we\u2019re seeing him open up in different ways. I\u2019ll bring to that whatever I can, but I think the character is what\u2019s alive now.\u201d On a show where anything can happen, everything will Because an episode of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d can start from anything, Campbell pitched the idea for suicide spaghetti. It starts out like a \u201cclassic \u2018Rick and Morty\u2019 adventure\u201d in which Morty morally objects to something Rick does \u2013\u2013 in this case, serving delicious spaghetti to his family that\u2019s actually made from the remains of people whose insides turn to pasta only when they die by suicide. Harmon wasn\u2019t sold on the concept as an entire episode at first, Campbell said, but encouraged her to riff on it. It turned into \u201cThat\u2019s Amorte.\u201d At first, the episode feels like it\u2019s taking a blackly comic take on taboo subjects to disturbing extremes \u2013\u2013\u00a0fairly typical terrain for a series that once featured a \u201csoul orgy\u201d between Rick, Morty and Summer, plus a gaggle of dragons. But it turns oddly moving once the suicide spaghetti industry balloons and Morty finds himself complicit in its success. Rick ends the demand for pasta for good by hooking a dying man up to a machine that broadcasts scenes from his life to those watching across the planet. Eating the remains of a man who lived, lost and loved is suddenly no longer appetizing. \u201cI wanted to get across that life is not a direct path from one point to another \u2013\u2013\u00a0it is a constantly meandering river,\u201d Campbell said of the montage of the man\u2019s life. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t rob it of meaning, especially if you look at the entire thing all at once.\u201d The spaghetti episode only worked because co-creator Dan Harmon and showrunner Scott Marder were \u201cfully indulgent and patient\u201d in letting Campbell explore pasta as a plot device and developed it with her from the very beginning of the pitch process, she said. \u201cTapping that excitement for an area usually leads to stronger drafts for each episode on the whole,\u201d Marder told CNN. As for the ideas that make it that far, the \u201cenergy in the writer\u2019s room\u201d is the most important barometer of potential, Harmon told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about everyone laughing, but it is about them being excited \u2013\u2013 when two or more writers start talking over each other, and everyone is pitching very different possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf two people can disagree fundamentally about how they\u2019d use X-ray glasses, that\u2019s a sign there may be a story\u2019s worth of energy in X-ray glasses.\u201d Or, spaghetti. Campbell\u2019s pasta-centric episode tonally fits right in alongside the bleak episode in which Rick Prime dies. \u201cWe always say every episode needs to run a marathon, in terms of its lifespan, from a kernel of an idea to making it to air,\u201d Marder said, \u201cso an idea really works when it\u2019s got a strong enough engine in it to help power it, and our enthusiasm for it, through that 26-mile race.\u201d \u201cRick and Morty\u201d writers are working on the next three seasons at once, in varying stages of development. It\u2019s helpful that way, Campbell said, because they can easily chart how a major canonical move will reverberate in a future season. For example: With his death, Rick Prime ceded his position as the show\u2019s major villain to Evil Morty, who helped our Rick find his nemesis \u2014 but, by the episode\u2019s end, has the power to destroy all Ricks in every dimension, upsetting the show\u2019s balance at any time. Where \u201cRick and Morty\u201d goes next is anyone\u2019s guess, especially with a dead Rick Prime and rogue Evil Morty. But the unknown is the point of the series, Campbell said. \u201cThe future is so terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing alive is a puzzle. And those things colliding against each other is where the show is going.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/entertainment/rick-and-morty-animated-tv-series-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it\u2019s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity \u2013 the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren \u2013 the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What\u2019s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) \u2013 an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom \u2013 attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (\u201cThe Witcher\u2019s\u201d Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing \u201cThe Planet of the Apes\u201d but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run. Hollywood blockbusters aren\u2019t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these \u201cApes\u201d prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don\u2019t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it\u2019s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d premieres May 10 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_20_entertainment_bridgerton-staircase-scene-season-3", "text": "This article may contain spoilers for Bridgerton Season 3. Dearest gentle reader\u2026 By now, viewers have had time to watch the first four episodes of the highly anticipated third season of Bridgerton.\u00a0This season turned its focus to\u00a0the love story between Penelope\u00a0Featherington\u00a0(Nicola Coughlan) and\u00a0Colin Bridgerton\u2019s (Luke Newton), who the internet has lovingly nicknamed #Polin. After hearing Colin\u2019s disparaging words about her at the end of Season 2, Penelope decides to take a husband. Thinking it will help her chances with finding a match, she decides to get a makeover, starting with her clothes. In the first episode, \u201cOut of the Shadows,\u201d Penelope abandons her family\u2019s usual\u00a0bright citrus colors and lets her hair down. When she arrives at the ball wearing an ornate emerald gown, everyone in attendance turns their attention to her as she descends the stairs. That scene in particular was inspired by the 1999 romantic comedy, \u201cShe\u2019s All That,\u201d according to showrunner Jess Brownell. The movie features a scene in which geeky protagonist Laney Boggs, played by Rachael Leigh Cook, comes down the stairs to the song \u201cKiss Me\u201d following a makeover in which she trades her glasses for a pair of heels she can barely walk on. Brownell, told Final Draft\u2019s \u201cWrite On\u201d podcast that it was important to include a makeover scene in the season that pays homage to romantic comedies. \u201cRom-coms have been the movies that have informed\u00a0my approach to writing more than anything,\u201d Brownell said, also listing John Hughes films and \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d starring Patrick Dempsey. But the writing and producing team also wanted to give a fresh spin on the trope to avoid any pitfalls. \u201cWe talked a lot in the [writer\u2019s] room about the fact that the makeover trope can be problematic in a lot of ways \u2013 to suggest that a woman should just take off her glasses and let her hair down and instantly she\u2019s going to be so much more appealing.\u201d For \u201cBridgerton,\u201d Brownell says they decided to make the makeover about Penelope\u2019s internal journey and \u201cher need to find her confidence and step into her truth.\u201d The references to rom-coms didn\u2019t stop there this season. While the first two seasons portrayed the fake dating and enemies to lovers tropes, this season is all about two people going from friends to lovers. At one point, Colin decides to help Penelope\u2019s search for a husband by offering his advice, leading to several hilarious scenes in which she fails miserably at talking to potential suitors. But Penelope catches the eye of Lord Debling (Sam Phillips), causing a love triangle. The show also further develops its resident mean girl, Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen). Like your typical rom-com bully, Cressida has been a rival to other characters also searching for husbands. In Season 1, she threatened to spread a story about Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Bassett that would have damaged both of their reputations. This season, viewers see a more humanized version of Cressida as she desperately searches for a husband in her third year just like Penelope. If she doesn\u2019t find a husband this year, her parents will find one for her. \u201cNo mean girl is born a mean girl. There\u2019s always an origin story. We realize that Cressida, in fact, comes from a difficult home where her parents aren\u2019t nearly as loving as either the Bridgertons or even the Featheringtons,\u201d Brownell added. \u201cThere\u2019s room for some reflection and some growth in her as well.\u201d The first four episodes of Bridgerton Season 3 are now available to stream on Netflix.

Nicely played by the leads, this tale of a 40-year-old woman swept off her feet by a 20-something boy-band star amounts to playing the genre\u2019s hits while following all the same old steps. Destined for Amazon, it\u2019s a competent date-night or gals\u2019-night movie for those who don\u2019t want to leave the house \u2013 Chardonnay optional, but recommended \u2013 which makes practical sense, landing as it does in a middle ground that has struggled at the box office. Cheated on and left by her husband, Sol\u00e9ne (Hathaway) is a successful art-gallery owner who gets roped at the last-minute into squiring her teenage daughter and the kid\u2019s friends to Coachella, where her ex has purchased a meet-and-greet experience with the members of August Moon, whose following might lean more toward the tween crowd. A reluctant attendee, Sol\u00e9ne has the ultimate meet-cute moment with band member Hayes (Galitzine, of \u201cMary & George\u201d and \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d renown), stumbling into his trailer thinking it\u2019s the restroom. After some awkward banter and obvious chemistry \u2013 which with the benefit of hindsight is about as good as the movie gets \u2013 Hayes shows up unexpectedly (by her, that is) at Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s gallery, telling her shyly, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t meet people like you very often.\u201d For a pop star, he\u2019s an endearingly sensitive soul, which doesn\u2019t do much to quell her reticence, due both to their age gap and his fame. Romance and complications ensue, with writer-director Michael Showalter (\u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and \u201cSpoiler Alert,\u201d sharing script credit with Jennifer Westfeldt) adapting Robinne Lee\u2019s novel in part by relying on the customary montages to handle some of the heavy lifting. If only the garnishes were a little less tired, including the prying paparazzi and Reid Scott as Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s no-right-to-be-bent-out-of-shape ex. All that really leaves, then, is the interplay between Hathaway and Galitzine, with the latter (starring in his second Amazon movie in a year\u2019s time about a romance complicated by fame) performing double duty on the songs. The problem is however well they might work in terms of rooting for them as a couple, it\u2019s hard to avoid the very real issue that the world he inhabits and indeed people in general can be pretty lousy. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d will likely be most satisfying for those who choose not to sweat the details, enjoying the scenery and fantasy wrapped up in it. Think of it as one of those movies that really reinforces the adage there are no new ideas, just fresh versions of old ones set to different beats. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d premieres May 2 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.

It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become. With a lot of hard work, I am better today, but I will always be recovering from my past.\u201d She then turned her focus to seek support for others. \u201cMy only ask is that EVERYONE open your heart to believing victims the first time. It takes a lot of heart to tell the truth out of a situation that you were powerless in,\u201d Ventura wrote. \u201cI offer my hand to those that are still living in fear. Reach out to your people, don\u2019t cut them off. No one should carry this weight alone.\u201d \u201cThis healing journey is never ending, but this support means everything to me,\u201d she concluded her message. Combs and Ventura dated off and on from 2007 to 2018. In her complaint that was settled within a day of its filing in November 2023, Ventura alleged Combs raped her in 2018 and subjected her to years of repeated physical and other abuses over the course of their relationship. Combs has denied her allegations. \u201cA decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing,\u201d Ben Brafman, an attorney for Combs, told CNN in a statement in November. \u201cMr. Combs\u2018 decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.\u201d Combs apologized on Sunday for his actions in the surveillance video. Ventura\u2019s attorney Meredith Firetog criticized his response. \u201cWhen Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday,\u201d she in a statement to CNN. Ventura and Combs did not name each other in their respective statements. Their November settlement states that neither of them can speak about each other in any way,\u00a0according to\u00a0multiple sources familiar with the agreement. Growing legal issues for Combs Including Ventura\u2019s lawsuit, Combs has\u00a0been named in seven civil lawsuits in recent months. Six of those lawsuits,\u00a0including one filed Tuesday,\u00a0contain allegations\u00a0of sexual assault. One of the six suits names Combs as a defendant but was brought against Combs\u2019 son, Christian Combs. Only Ventura\u2019s has been settled. Authorities\u00a0searched Diddy\u2019s homes on March 25, 2024, because he is a target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security team that handles human trafficking and other crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The investigation stems from many of the same sexual assault allegations put forth in the\u00a0civil lawsuits, according to a second law enforcement source familiar with the searches. Combs and his attorneys have denied the allegations. Six lawsuits remain active.

She needn\u2019t worry. Smart\u2019s pitch-perfect performance as Vance has earned her rave reviews and two Emmy Awards for lead actress in a comedy series. When Wallace asked if Smart modeled her performance on any comedians, she said she knew she had make her comedic delivery her own. \u201cI mean, you know actors, we\u2019re monkey see monkey do. We\u2019re good mimics, but I didn\u2019t want to pick one specific person and try to do them because I knew it had to be my own style,\u201d Smart said. \u201cIt had to come from me and my sense of humor and timing and things like that. And I\u2019ve always liked watching comedians, so it\u2019s one of my favorite parts of the show that I get to do standup now.\u201d The third season of \u201cHacks\u201d finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. In the series and in reality, the seats are still predominately held by men. Smart shared her thoughts why it remains harder for female comedians to break through. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really interesting topic,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s still this prevailing feeling that women aren\u2019t really as funny as men or that they shouldn\u2019t be off color and things like that. And I have mixed feelings about it. Because obviously playing Deborah, you know, and I know, certainly Deborah\u2019s philosophy about it is that that\u2019s not true.\u201d Season 3 of \u201cHacks\u201d is currently airing on HBO and streaming on Max, which like CNN is part of Warner Bros. Discovery. New episodes of \u201cWho\u2019s Talking to Chris Wallace?\u201d debut Friday on Max.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/hacks-jean-smart-chris-wallace/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_entertainment_apprentice-movie-premiere", "text": "\u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d a new film about former President Donald Trump\u2019s real estate dealings in New York in the \u201980s, debuted to a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and criticism from his campaign. The film about the presumptive Republican nominee comes five months before the presidential election. Starring Sebastian Stan as a young Trump, the film is an \u201cexploration of power and ambition set in a world of corruption and deceit,\u201d according to an official synopsis. \u201cSuccession\u201d star Jeremy Strong co-stars as Roy Cohn, the lawyer and fixer who Trump considered a mentor early in his career. \u201cIt\u2019s a mentor-protege story that charts the origins of an American dynasty. Filled with larger than life characters, it reveals the moral and human cost of a culture defined by winners and losers,\u201d the synopsis reads. \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which, despite the title, is not a reference to the reality competition series Trump starred in, includes a disclaimer that some parts of the story are slightly fictionalized. It is written by biographer and political journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Iranian-Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi. \u201cIn the time of turmoil, there\u2019s this tendency to look inwards, to sort of bury your head deep in the sand and look inside and hope for the best, hope for the storm to get away,\u201d Abassi told the audience at the movie\u2019s premiere on Monday, according to footage posted online. \u201cBut, the storm,\u201d Abassi continued, \u201cis not going away. The storm is coming, actually. The worst times are to come.\u201d Abassi went on to say that he chose to make a film \u201cabout the world\u201d through a story about Trump, because \u201cthere is no nice metaphorical way to deal with the rising wave of fascism.\u201d \u201cThere is only the messy way, there is only the banal way. There is only the way of dealing with this wave on its own turfs at its own level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty, but I think the problem with the world is that the good people have been quiet for too long.\u201d The film includes a depiction of Trump\u2019s relationship with his first wife, Ivana, and their divorce, according to The Hollywood Reporter. A scene of the former president undergoing liposuction drew audible gasps from the crowd, the publication reported. \u201cWe will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked,\u201d Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThis \u2018film\u2019 is pure malicious defamation, should not see the light of day, and doesn\u2019t even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire.\u201d Maria Bakalova plays the late Ivana Trump, who died in 2022. Martin Donovan, Catherine McNally and Charlie Carrick, among others, round out the cast. A release date for the film has yet to be announced. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d does not yet have a US-based distributor, according to IMDb.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/entertainment/apprentice-movie-premiere/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
