In an episode of \u201cLet\u2019s Be Clear\u201d that was published on June 23, the \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210\u201d star gave her listeners a tough update: She was going to resume chemotherapy treatment. Still, she offered a bit of positivity with the bitter pill that is stage IV cancer. \u201cSo for the first time in a couple of months I feel hopeful because there are so many more protocols now,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I was hopeful, but I was still getting prepared. Now, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t need to be prepared, I need to go on vacation. I need to go on a boat again and explore places!\u2019\u201d She closed the episode saying, \u201cI can tell you I\u2019m not going anywhere right now.\u201d Doherty died Sunday at age 53, according to a statement from her publicist. An actress who rose from what TV Guide dubbed in the \u201990s the \u201cyouth-quake\u201d era of television, she carried a reputation for being outspoken on sets in a time when any self-advocacy by a young woman resulted in her being labeled \u201cdifficult.\u201d But Doherty\u2019s determination would serve her well in the role she took on in recent years: A voice of authority and advocacy in the cancer community. She first disclosed her breast cancer diagnosis in 2015 and kept well-wishers up to date on her treatment, announcing her remission in 2017, and, ultimately, a return of her cancer in 2020. Doherty\u2019s vulnerable and candid disclosures were humanizing for a figure once painted by tabloid media as a rebellious figure with a penchant for departing high-profile acting roles (See: \u201c90210\u201d and \u201cCharmed\u201d) amid controversy. \u201cI have felt misunderstood my whole life,\u201d Doherty told People in 2020. \u201cThe only difference is that now I\u2019m OK with it. But there have been moments where we\u2019ve been able to talk about things.\u201d She debuted \u201cLet\u2019s Be Clear\u201d in December 2023, roughly six months after she had announced cancer had spread to her brain. In some instances, the platform was a place to reflect on her career and her memorable roles. Other episodes focused on her treatment and prognosis during informative conversations with members of her care team. Doherty discussed her surgeries, medications and difficult decisions along the way. \u201cI don\u2019t have many people that I talk to cancer about,\u201d she told her oncologist, Dr. Lawrence Piro, in one episode. \u201cFor me, I talk to you about cancer because I think you\u2019re qualified to talk to me about cancer.\u201d Doherty may have leaned on professionals for advice about her own case, but didn\u2019t hesitate to stretch her hand out to those going through similar circumstances. Actress Olivia Munn, who earlier this year shared her own breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent double mastectomy, said she and Doherty \u201cbonded through a shared battle and a desire to help other women.\u201d \u201cLooking back on the last text she sent me just a couple months ago, she asked how I was doing and if she could do anything for me,\u201d Munn wrote on Instagram. \u201cTrue to form, Shannen was offering her support even though she was in the final stage of fighting this horrific disease. Cancer is really f***ing scary and Shannen faced it with such dignity, strength and grace.\u201d In that episode with Dr. Piro, Doherty encouraged listeners to advocate for themselves. \u201cMost of the time, a lot of patients feel as if they don\u2019t have the right to ask for a better doctor or to change doctors, or they\u2019re scared their insurance won\u2019t cover a new doctor or feel like they can\u2019t change doctors,\u201d she said. Piro affirmed: \u201cEveryone deserves world-class health care\u2026also a world-class patient experience because if you get, even if you get great care, if you get PTSD trying to get care, then the quality if your life is not good at all.\u201d Quality of life was a focus of Doherty\u2019s in her final months. \u201cI\u2019m not the person who likes to give up very easily,\u201d she said in June. \u201cI just don\u2019t want my sickness to last that long.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/entertainment/shannen-doherty-cancer-advocacy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_entertainment_streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros", "text": "Streaming appears poised to undergo what some have called \u201cThe Great Re-Bundling,\u201d with services merging, combining or forming alliances that will essentially reconstruct the cable \u201cbundle\u201d that consumers relied upon for decades. While that makes sense for studios eager to offer \u201cmore robust and streamlined content,\u201d as Disney CEO Bob Iger said earlier this year, subscribers have every reason to wonder \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?,\u201d and if all these high-stakes corporate announcements will really benefit them. Will it make access to at-home viewing options cheaper? More plentiful? Easier to navigate and find what you want? Less of a chore to manage in terms of juggling multiple subscriptions? That\u2019s the goal, but honestly, we can\u2019t really know. The latest news to ripple through the streaming front involved reports Paramount, prior to moving forward on its merger with Skydance, looking to combine its Paramount+ with another service. Max, the HBO-centered provider from CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery, was among those cited as potential partners. Such an arrangement would follow the formal announcement in February of Venu Sports, a joint sports offering consisting of Disney\u2019s ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros.; Disney\u2019s intra-studio attempt to create a mega-service to subscribers who ante up for its trio of services: Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+; and Disney\u2019s collaboration plan with Warner Bros. on a bundle consisting of Disney+, Max and Hulu. The advantages for the companies, as they seek to compete with Netflix and the tech giants (Amazon and Apple foremost among them) that have helped crowd the streaming waters, aren\u2019t certain, but the objectives seem clear, beginning with the hope these combined or consolidated services will reduce churn \u2013 that is, people signing up and cancelling and signing up again. What has become increasingly obvious, though, is for all the knocks on cable, starting with the fact consumers paid for lots of channels they never watched, its one-stop-shopping approach eliminated some of the challenges springing up now. That old system worked because the \u201cbundle\u201d actually created a mechanism to financially support a vast number of choices serving various tastes. Simply put, paying for ESPN if you don\u2019t like sports, or CNN and MSNBC if you don\u2019t watch news, might have been irritating, but those millions of cable subscriptions spread out the revenue in a way that made dozens and dozens of channels available and affordable. The dream of a more a la carte system, where you pay for what you watch, has turned out to elusive, primarily because there\u2019s no way \u2013 at least yet \u2013 to adopt that where the cost doesn\u2019t become onerous, and maybe even prohibitive, for many consumers. Unwinding the bundle by \u201ccord cutting\u201d on cable subscriptions might have felt good, but in terms of the industry\u2019s economics, that shift opened Pandora\u2019s box. While Disney or Paramount\u2019s profits need not concern consumers, the ability of those companies to produce and present TV shows and movies people want to see does. After cutting the cord, stitching it back together in a different form through re-bundling comes with question marks, and risks. Just ask newspapers that once delivered a physical bundle that landed on people\u2019s doorsteps before the digital age upended their business model. The promises made by executives like Iger, who called Venu \u201ca major win for sports fans,\u201d might very well work out. In theory, consumers could indeed be spared some of the \u201cannoyance and decision-making,\u201d as Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle wrote, associated with keeping track of a half-dozen streaming services, adding that\u2019s \u201cwhy so many consumers prefer things like all-inclusive vacations, and why bundling is a common business practice.\u201d Still, when it comes to implementing structural changes in how entertainment gets distributed and consumed, an adage well known to most Disney characters remains worth remembering: Be careful what you wish for.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/entertainment/streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_a-quiet-place-day-one-review", "text": "Like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d pries opens the door to a world with a host of possibilities, some of them \u2013 including the premise of a new prequel subtitled \u201cDay One\u201d \u2013 already touched upon in the two previous movies. Set in New York, the latest film begins from a slightly unexpected premise, but then efficiently spins it to yield additional horror while giving theater-goers every reason to keep their mouths shut. The 2021 sequel actually opened with a muscular flashback sequence to that moment when the grotesque, sound-sensitive alien invaders descended upon Earth, so the new film\u2019s tag line, \u201cExperience the day the world went quiet,\u201d reflects a bit of a conceptual echo. Introducing new characters, the main wrinkle in the new prequel \u2013 and it\u2019s a questionable one at first \u2013 involves telling the story from the perspective of Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a dying woman enduring hospice care with her cat, who serves as the de facto guide to all hell breaking loose. At a time when people are dying right and left, \u201cDay One\u201d thus uses a woman already close to death as the audience\u2019s surrogate. She interacts with various people along the way, but it\u2019s a fair stretch until she encounters the most significant one, Eric (Joseph Quinn, on a genre tear with \u201cStranger Things\u201d behind him and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d to come), who doesn\u2019t want to leave her side however much she tries \u2013 quietly \u2013 to chase him away. While the Emily Blunt- and John Krasinski-anchored family\u2019s sign-language fluency gave the original movie its gateway into an original-feeling twist on minimalist horror, this third film relies heavily on Nyong\u2019o\u2019s facial reactions, and it\u2019s hard to think of an actor who can say more with an expression. Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\u201cPig\u201d), who shares story credit with original director/producer Krasinski (whose summer dance card also includes \u201cIF\u201d), the film does let viewers see more of the horrifying creatures, although their lightning-quick attacks often keeps those images brief. There\u2019s also the matter of how the invaders manage to seemingly be everywhere at once, to the point where the slightest sound on screen provokes a sense of dread. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d takes advantage of those attributes, and even finds a way to use Sam\u2019s condition, somewhat awkwardly, to consider our humanity. If there\u2019s one clunky flourish, it\u2019s been clear going back to \u201cAlien\u201d that cats and sci-fi horror don\u2019t mix, and while her feline companion provides a periodic source of unpredictable tension, it\u2019s one of those devices that probably should have been left in the litter box. Unfortunately, everything that enjoys a modicum of success these days triggers talk of its own \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is no exception. Practically speaking, \u201cDay One\u201d takes a step toward demonstrating that this perilous post-invasion world offers no shortage of streets and hallways to tiptoe down, where nobody needs to ask \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d when they are greeted with silence. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/a-quiet-place-day-one-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_entertainment_vienna-billy-joel-popularity-cec", "text": "When Billy Joel released his fifth studio album, \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d in 1977, the song \u201cVienna\u201d flew mostly under the radar. It wasn\u2019t one of the four singles released in North America, merely a B-side to the hit \u201cJust the Way You Are.\u201d As the album catapulted Joel to critical and commercial success, \u201cVienna\u201d seemed destined to remain a deep cut from his discography. But over the years, the bluesy number endeared itself to listeners to become a cult favorite \u2014 it\u2019s now among Joel\u2019s top three streamed songs on Spotify alongside \u201cUptown Girl\u201d and \u201cPiano Man,\u201d and an official music video was just released this past April. The force behind the song\u2019s slow-burn resurgence appears to be, at least in part, teenage girls and women in their 20s and 30s. Across social media, young women wax poetic about the decades-old track and their emotional attachment to it. \u201cNo one understands a woman in her 20s the way billy joel did in 1977 when he wrote Vienna,\u201d one woman declared on TikTok. Another shared that the song inspired her to embark on a solo adventure to the Austrian capital. More than a few have gotten the song\u2019s lyrics and other \u201cVienna\u201d-inspired imagery tattooed on their bodies. Per one meme, \u201cgirlhood is sobbing to Vienna.\u201d Despite the fact that it was written nearly 50 years ago, \u201cVienna\u201d is resonant and relevant as ever for a generation of young women. Joel (who counts the track among his favorites) has theorized that the song\u2019s appeal to young women stems from its appearance in a pivotal scene in the 2004 rom-com \u201c13 Going on 30.\u201d The film, starring Jennifer Garner, tells the story of a disillusioned teenager who wants nothing more than to fast forward to adulthood \u2014 only to realize that it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. \u201cThat\u2019s a movie that was popular with girls, and girls are who most of the enthusiasm for the song comes from. Beyond that, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview with Vulture. \u201cIt\u2019s a coming-of-age song: \u2018Slow down you crazy child.\u2019 So I guess it resonates with younger people. It\u2019s a fun one to play.\u201d \u201cVienna\u201d is written from the perspective of someone older and wiser urging a young and ambitious dreamer to go easier on themselves. (\u201cSlow down, you\u2019re doing fine / You can\u2019t be everything you wanna be before your time.\u201d) It\u2019s a rejection of the rat race \u2014 a soothing reminder that life is long and it\u2019s okay to not have it all figured out. \u201cWe live in a society that\u2019s obsessed with fast paced living and \u2018grind culture\u2019. How much can you do and how fast can you do it?\u201d Shauna Murphy, a 22-year-old in Dublin, wrote in a message to CNN. \u201cAs young women, we put so much pressure on ourselves to perform so many roles in such a short timeframe that hearing Vienna play instantly reminds us that sometimes it\u2019s okay to slow down and take a breath. We\u2019re gonna be okay in the end.\u201d Mirelle Ortega, a 34-year-old writer and illustrator in Los Angeles, recalled being stopped in her tracks when she first heard the song during a summer home from college. At the time, she was anxious about her future, and the lyrics were exactly what she needed to hear. \u201cI don\u2019t know why but our late teens and early 20\u2019s tend to feel like the end of the world sometimes. We all feel a huge pressure to have it all figured out and there\u2019s this feeling that whatever path you pick will make or break you,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI think \u2018Vienna\u2019 perfectly articulates that that\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cVienna,\u201d as the song\u2019s hook goes, \u201cwaits for you.\u201d Joel\u2019s use of Vienna as a metaphor for the rest of one\u2019s life stems from an encounter in the city with his father. As the singer-songwriter has explained during performances and interviews, his parents separated when he was a child, and he was estranged from his father until the two reconnected in Vienna in his 20s. During that trip, a conversation they had made a lasting impression on him. \u201cWe were walking in the city and I remember seeing an old lady sweeping the street and I said \u2018Dad it\u2019s kind of sad that that poor old woman has to do that kind of work.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, she has a job, she feels useful, she has a place in our society,\u2019\u201d Joel explained in a 2008 interview with The Republican newspaper. \u201cI realized they don\u2019t throw old people away like we tend to do here in the States,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey allow for people who are aged to have a useful place in the scheme of things and I thought y\u2019know that\u2019s a good metaphor for someone my age to consider. You don\u2019t have to squeeze your whole life into your 20s and 30s trying to make it, trying to achieve that American dream, getting in the rat race and killing yourself. You have a whole life to live.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/entertainment/vienna-billy-joel-popularity-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_entertainment_house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-recap", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story discusses plot points from \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d Season 2, episode 5. While both sides absorb the fallout from the battle of Rook\u2019s Rest in episode 4, one message comes through loud and clear in \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u2019s\u201d latest chapter: the women in this patriarchal society must fight wars on two fronts. For Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy), the indignities come from her council of advisers, as well as her headstrong husband Daemon (Matt Smith), who continues to have really weird dreams while more brazenly plotting to personally acquire power. Rhaenyra articulates her predicament clearly at the end, complaining about how she had to stay prudent and apart from the war despite her own dragon-riding credentials, saying that she was \u201csending others to fight and be felled in my name,\u201d before concluding with a sense of determination, \u201cIf all else fails, it is I who must fight.\u201d Her counterpart in this civil war and one-time friend, Alicent (Olivia Cooke), faces a similar display of disrespect at home, after the attempted fratricide by Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) that left his brother, King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), a scorched and wheezing mess \u2013 nursing burns, broken bones and internal injuries. Aegon\u2019s condition calls for appointing a regent, as Alicent says, to serve in his stead \u201cuntil he recovers, or does not.\u201d Yet despite her realization that Aemond has developed into something of a psychopathic monster (those Targaryen kids do grow up fast) \u2013 telling Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), \u201cYou know what he is. What he has somehow become\u201d \u2013 the council chooses to elevate Aemond. What\u2019s a mother to do? In this case, feel angry and betrayed. \u201cWe have given the war to the dragons,\u201d Criston says flatly to the woman who regularly (if sneakily) shares his bed. \u201cA dragon rider should lead us.\u201d Of course, Criston engages in a misstep of his own at the outset, parading the slain dragon of the equally dead Rhaenys (Eve Best, we hardly knew ye) through the town, unsettling the common folk. That death also leaves her husband, Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), shattered and in mourning, as both sides grapple with their casualties. Beyond that, the fifth episode represents a bit of a breather \u2013 as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and now \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d tend to do after major conflicts \u2013 as the warring factions seek to secure support for their war efforts, with Daemon, for one, wrestling with the demands of diplomacy as opposed to his scorched-earth tactics. Speaking of scorched earth, there could be a lot more of it, as the closing sequence involves Rhaenyra strategizing with her son about how to neutralize Aemond and his massive dragon Vhagar. While dragon riding is a talent limited to the Targaryens, the two realize there are lots of wayward offshoots of the royal bloodline that could in theory be enlisted and turned into riders. \u201cA mad thought,\u201d the Queen muses, clearly intrigued by the idea. Then again, as Rhaenyra noted earlier in the hour, as a woman seeking to rule, \u201cThe path I walk has never been trod.\u201d Without clear footsteps to follow, in other words, she\u2019s going to have to blaze her own trail \u2013 and if that Targaryen-blood dragon-riding scheme comes to fruition, perhaps literally. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d airs Sunday nights on Max, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.

{"id": "2024_07_13_entertainment_faye-review-faye-dunaway", "text": "\u201cFaye,\u201d a documentary memoir of Faye Dunaway, begins with the \u201cChinatown\u201d star barking orders at her interviewer, saying, \u201cWe need to shoot. I\u2019m here now, come on.\u201d It\u2019s a perfect introduction to an actor who has worn the dreaded \u201cD\u201d word \u2013 \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cdiva,\u201d take your pick \u2013 throughout her career, in a film that serves as an unvarnished but appropriately laudatory tribute. Few stars shone brighter than Dunaway at the apex of her career, highlighted by a decade-long span that began with \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d \u2013 which helped usher in a new era of more edgy and ambitious filmmaking \u2013 followed by \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair,\u201d \u201cChinatown\u201d (which recently commemorated its 50th anniversary), \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d and her Oscar-winning role in the dark satire \u201cNetwork.\u201d At 90 minutes, \u201cFaye\u201d could have devoted the lion\u2019s share of its time to that era and still been worth watching. But director Laurent Bouzereau (\u201cNatalie Wood: What Remains Behind\u201d) obviously has to go back to Dunaway\u2019s upbringing, her personal life and the latter part of her career, punctuated by what she refers to as \u201cmistakes,\u201d from her much-lampooned portrayal of Joan Crawford in \u201cMommie Dearest\u201d to her dropped attempt to turn her lauded stage performance in \u201cMaster Class\u201d into a movie that she intended to direct. Now 83, Dunaway spills a bit of tea about her various relationships, from a romance with Marcello Mastroianni (prompting her to dump director Jerry Schatzberg, who laughs about losing a woman to the dashing Italian star) to her marriage to Terry O\u2019Neill, the photographer who snapped the iconic photo of her lounging by the pool the morning after winning the Oscar for \u201cNetwork\u201d in 1977. Their son, Liam O\u2019Neill, is also among those interviewed, along with Sharon Stone, who Dunaway befriended; and her \u201cBarfly\u201d co-star Mickey Rourke, who refers to her as \u201cmesmerizing.\u201d Dunaway\u2019s screen beauty, with a face made for close-ups, and abundant talent merely added fuel to her diva reputation, distilled into a memorable clip of Bette Davis telling \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host Johnny Carson that Dunaway was the one actor she wouldn\u2019t work with again. Yet as director James Gray, who worked with her on the 2000 movie \u201cThe Yards,\u201d notes in the film, the way Dunaway became characterized within the entertainment industry also represents \u201ca comment on how women are in some ways treated and judged on a very different scale than men.\u201d Of course, \u201cFaye\u201d provides enough anecdotal highlights that it\u2019s possible to enjoy strictly on that level, from Dunaway finally telling Jack Nicholson to go ahead and really slap her in a famous \u201cChinatown\u201d moment to her insistence on applying Blistex to her lips between scenes. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFaye\u201d allows its subject to be, or at least appear, as big, complicated and multifaceted as her life and career, in both the highs and lows, would suggest. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with anything here,\u201d Dunaway tells the interviewer during that setting-up exchange. But if the goal was creating a document that offers a reminder of and testament to her talent, she \u2013 and those who make the time for \u201cFaye\u201d \u2013 should be. \u201cFaye\u201d premieres July 13 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

Part of the problem is the perspective tilts heavily toward the Kidman character\u2019s daughter, Zara (Joey King), who works as an assistant to actor Chris Cole (Efron), best known for playing a superhero called Icarus Rush. To Zara\u2019s chagrin, he\u2019s prone to stereotypical excesses, sending her on menial errands like running to a store to buy him isolated whey protein. (If you have to ask, it\u2019s not for you.) Zara has watched Chris use and dump women, threatening to quit almost as often as he talks about firing her. Their latest spat brings him to the house she shares with her mom, Kidman\u2019s Brooke, a successful and conveniently widowed author. After some mild awkwardness, Chris and Brooke wind up in bed together, leaving her, as she says, \u201cstarting to feel things again.\u201d Zara is understandably horrified by the prospect of the two hooking up, prompting her mom to offer that their age difference is a mere 16 years, not 20 (which is more accurate in reality, but never mind), so maybe just May-September in calendar terms. Directed by Richard Lagravenese \u2013 whose most pertinent credit here might be adapting the screenplay for \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d \u2013 \u201cA Family Affair\u201d suffers from the wholesale self-absorption of all concerned, which makes the notion of this as some grand romance harder to swallow. Not that the director along with writer Carrie Solomon don\u2019t try, including a dinner scene with Zara\u2019s grandma (Kathy Bates, again underemployed) that works hard at humanizing Chris beyond just Efron\u2019s \u201cIron Claw\u201d-sculpted physique. While there are a few amusing lines scattered along the way (when Brooke says she\u2019s Australian, Chris asks if she knows Margot Robbie), the comedy largely fizzles beyond the initial introductions, and the romance \u2013 after that first encounter \u2013 doesn\u2019t come across as terribly convincing. That leaves some star charisma, but not enough chemistry, to propel this across the finish line, dragging the customary Hollywood cliches \u2013 and lots of musical montages, seemingly to fill out the running time \u2013 along with it. Granted, \u201cA Family Affair\u201d probably qualified as a win for Netflix as soon as Kidman and Efron signed on the dotted lines, at least in terms of the algorithm and minutes-watched totals their pairing will generate. Even setting the expectations bar at a modest height, though, the movie doesn\u2019t quite clear it \u2013 another case, in rom-com terms, where the idea of them, as a marquee matchup, proves superior to the execution. \u201cA Family Affair\u201d premieres June 28 on Netflix.

Stepping up in class in terms of casting, the film works best as an ode to the movies and grime of 1980s Hollywood, and a bit less as a mystery built around its driven starlet-in-waiting. That would be Goth\u2019s Maxine Minx, an adult-film actor who survived a rural massacre during a remote shoot in \u201cX,\u201d the roots of which were explored in the prequel \u201cPearl.\u201d Maxine is now in L.A. and trying to make a go of it in legit movies (\u201cActing is acting,\u201d she says confidently during her audition), even if said movie is a horror film that\u2019s provoking protests and charges of satanism outside the studio. While chasing that big break, repeating her mantra, \u201cI will not accept a life I do not deserve,\u201d Maxine also learns that somebody appears to be after her, having set a private detective (Kevin Bacon, boiling over the top) on her tail, dredging up memories of her past. That at least provides connective tissue to \u201cX,\u201d and motivations that might go beyond the title character being really, really unlucky in that way \u201cfinal girls\u201d often are. The danger also comes at a time of high alert in the city, since it\u2019s 1985, and the Night Stalker killer remains at large. Not that Maxine\u2019s porn pals seem particularly on edge as they scrape and claw, trying to meet people with the clout to advance their careers. In addition to Bacon, the supporting cast includes Halsey, Giancarlo Esposito, \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, and Bobby Cannavale and Michelle Monaghan as a pair of detectives eager to glean what Maxine knows about the crime spree surrounding her \u2013 which merely triggers her skepticism and can-do attitude, applying the same ruthless pursuit of stardom to her self-defense. Goth again turns her alter ego into a force of nature, but the film\u2019s simplest pleasures come in its evocation of the time, with songs like \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d and the hit from \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d as well as Angelyne billboards and nods to movies like \u201cDressed to Kill.\u201d Although the theatrical box office has enjoyed welcome signs of life this summer, horror has stayed a reliable staple since the pandemic began, thanks in part to the discount-bin quality of films like \u201cX\u201d and \u201cPearl,\u201d relative to aspiring blockbusters, as long as they deliver the requisite thrills. West mixes some wit in with the gore here, even if the payoff, alas, doesn\u2019t rise to the level of the buildup. By then, though, \u201cMaXXXine\u201d has delivered enough nostalgia regarding its genre to merit a walk down its alleys, and not incidentally, the showcase and sendoff that Goth\u2019s character deserves. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d premieres July 5 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far", "text": "As we hurtle headlong into summer, we\u2019re dully aware six months\u2019 worth of new content has already hit our streaming platforms and our feeds this year \u2013 and in some rare cases, even gotten us out of the house and into a movie theater. While consensus seems to be that a lot of what pop culture has brought forth thus far in 2024 has been a bit \u201cmeh,\u201d there have also been standouts, triumphs and attention-getting titles worth of celebrating. Here\u2019s our list of some the year\u2019s best performances and content so far: MOVIES Best (or, most chillingly effective) cameo - Jesse Plemons in \u2018Civil War\u2019 The Oscars \u201cconversation\u201d already includes \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star Plemons delivering a brief performance so menacing, it calls to minds the scant 24 minutes Anthony Hopkins spent on screen before clinching an Academy Award for \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d Plemons\u2019 demented \u201csoldier\u201d in a crumbled and war-torn version of the near-future US, dispensing life and death with callous disdain, more than drives home the point filmmaker Alex Garland was trying to make with his latest movie. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how \u201cCivil War\u201d star Kirsten Dunst \u2013 who is married to Plemons in real life \u2013 felt comfortable going home with him after shooting his scene. Best genre-defying comedy -\u00a0\u2018Problemista\u2019 Writer, director and actor Julio Torres is an exceptional cinematic voice who has actually been around for awhile, creating excellent content for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and series such as \u201cLos Espookys\u201d and the soon-to-be released \u201cFantasmas.\u201d \u201cProblemista,\u201d which won acclaim at several festivals in 2023, features Torres as a toy designer from El Salvador trying to find opportunities to unleash his creative vision in the US, while also figuring out a way to stay in the country. He runs into both expected roadblocks as well as ones that are frustratingly inane, like a poorly designed grant website with a broken drop-down menu that makes it impossible for anyone located outside of country to apply. With artfully realized details like that, \u201cProblemista\u201d does the remarkable job of remaining universally engaging while exploring a very specific and individual experience. Plus, Tilda Swinton turns in one of her best idiosyncratic and delightfully deranged performances opposite the gifted Torres. Best meet-cute -\u00a0\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Not since \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d has Anne Hathaway captured the zeitgeist like this, and we\u2019re here for it. In \u201cIdea,\u201d she has a run-in at Coachella with It-Boy Nicolas Galiztine (of \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d and \u201cMary & George\u201d fame) that is so silly, and so disarming, it\u2019s hard not to go along for the gender-flipped \u201cNotting Hill\u201d (plus a few age-gap years) that follows. Other reasons to watch include the music performance scenes (the fictional boy band in the film isn\u2019t so fictional in that it was essentially created for the movie and has actually released music) and Hathaway\u2019s character\u2019s positively enviable Los Angeles enclave. Best visuals\u00a0- The Harkonnens in \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 It\u2019s getting harder and harder to dazzle with a truly original vision on the silver screen, but Denis Villeneuve pulls it off in his epic sci-fi sequel, which had been drastically delayed for a variety of reasons but finally dawned in the theaters this past spring. The sequences depicting the villainous Harkonnens \u2013 mostly monochromatic and overexposed to create an off-putting yet hypnotic ambiance \u2013 simply look like nothing else, and succeed in imparting a foreboding and terrifically extraterrestrial feel. Actor Austin Butler\u2019s improvised kiss planted on his uncle Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) helps as well. Honorable mentions: Best sports-infused romance/romance-infused sports movie\u00a0- \u201cChallengers\u201d Best use of profanity -\u00a0Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley in \u201cWicked Little Letters\u201d Best music documentary\u00a0- \u201cIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\u201d Best horror film - \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d Best animated film\u00a0- \u201cOrion and the Dark\u201d TV Best production - \u2018Shogun\u2019 The series production of the year, FX\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d managed to create the second showstopping television event based on the acclaimed James Clavell novel, after the first series did way back in 1980. CNN\u2019s Brian Lowry wrote in his glowing review that the new show \u201cblends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.\u201d Best show (somewhat) inspired by real life\u00a0- \u2018Baby Reindeer\u2019 While \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is by no means an easy watch, Richard Gadd\u2019s (true to an extent, that will surely be battled over for some time) recounting of his experience with a stalker \u2013 and how a previous experience of abuse played into it \u2013 is ultimately gratifying for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Gadd\u2019s layered and vulnerable performance anchors the show, and serves as the perfect foil for the brilliant Jessica Gunning \u2013 who plays his increasingly menacing stalker Martha \u2013 to truly shine and chew scenery at the same time. Best visuals -\u00a0\u2018Ripley\u2019 In a very different way from the villainous Harkonnen family in \u201cDune\u201d \u2013 but still depicting a nefarious villain nonetheless \u2013 the black-and-white Netflix series \u201cRipley\u201d can draw you in at practically any juncture, with stunningly ornate stylistic details and seaside Italian locations that are gasp-inducing maybe partially because they lack color. You could take screenshots from almost any scene and frame them as fine art, and the show \u2013 an austere retelling of the Patricia Highsmith novel after Anthony Minghella\u2019s far more colorful (literally and figuratively) film from 1999 \u2013 has the beguiling ability to make your eyes crave its somehow comfortable, monochromatic simplicity when you\u2019re not watching it. Best sophomore season -\u00a0\u2018Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u2019 \u201cInterview\u201d has only improved on what\u2019s come before \u2013 its first season, as well as the 1994 Neil Jordan movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt \u2013 and continues to be one of the best-acted and best-written shows on TV, while also remaining the juiciest. Vamps have never been more compelling than the iterations of the Anne Rice characters depicted here. Alternating between notes that are tragic, beautiful and sometimes hilarious, it\u2019s got a bit of everything. Which means its no surprise that AMC announced a third season renewal just this week. \u2013 Scottie Andrew Best cameo -\u00a0Carrot Top on \u2018Hacks\u2019 When Mr. Top (real name Scott Thompson, who while you weren\u2019t looking has become a major fixture in Las Vegas) comes out on screen in the second episode of this well-received third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d double-takes abound as to whether that\u2019s \u201creally him.\u201d His commitment in the scene is top notch, and stick around for the post-show featurette to watch him take director notes and do great line readings. Honorable mentions go to Dierdre Hall playing herself, sort of, as Paul W. Downs\u2019 mother in the Christmas episode, along with Christopher Lloyd as her maybe-new paramour. \u201cHacks\u201d also enjoys featured guests J. Smith-Cameron from \u201cSuccession,\u201d who finally gives (great) face to Kathy \u2013 Deborah\u2019s detested and two-timing sister \u2013 and Helen Hunt as a ball-busting network exec.

Best album that\u2019s definitely not for everyone - Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018Only God Was Above Us\u2019 There are few immediately hummable songs on the new record that call to mind \u201cHarmony Hall\u201d off of their last album in 2019, and the instrumentation is rich and complex and strangely captivating, like the band wanted to stuff as many distinctive sounds into each song as they could.

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_sorry-not-sorry-documentary-louis-ck", "text": "What to do about the strange case of Louis C.K.? That question resides at the heart of \u201cSorry/Not Sorry,\u201d a documentary that poses thorny questions about what cultural sentence the comedian should have served for his sexual misconduct, unequal power dynamics, and how stardom contributed to people ignoring an \u201copen secret\u201d in the comedy community. Lest anyone have forgotten, Louis C.K. belatedly admitted to exposing himself and masturbating in front of women after a New York Times story detailed multiple allegations, initially losing deals and being shunned before returning to performing roughly nine months later. Produced by the Times and featuring several of its reporters, the film from directors Caroline Suh and Cara Mones focuses on three women \u2013 comics Jen Kirkman, Abby Schachner, and Megan Koester \u2013 who spoke out about what the last of that trio calls \u201can open secret\u201d in the comedy community. They and others address the reluctance of women to speak out in that male-dominated bastion, and the irony that the women who did come forward appeared to pay a higher price for simply telling the truth about Louis C.K.\u2019s behavior than he did. Having comics as the principal storytellers adds a level of humor and wit to the conversation, but there\u2019s a pointed side to all this as well, from Louis C.K.\u2019s self-serving characterization of events on stage to well-established performers Dave Chappelle and Bill Maher, who pride themselves on their subversive takes, and how they weighed in on the matter. At its core, though, are issues not easily remedied, including the fact that women trying to chart careers in comedy \u2013 a field in which they are a decided minority \u2013 didn\u2019t want to be perceived as complaining about someone with the power to influence their futures, as well as how other men in comedy processed (or more often, didn\u2019t) questions about someone many of them liked and admired. \u201cWhen it comes to telling the truth about one of our own, suddenly we shut up,\u201d notes comic Michael Ian Black, while TV producer Michael Schur \u2013 who worked with Louis C.K. on \u201cParks and Rec,\u201d and produced shows such as \u201cThe Good Place\u201d \u2013 says with the benefit of hindsight, \u201cThe fact that I thought it wasn\u2019t my problem is the problem.\u201d At the same time, \u201cSorry/Not Sorry\u201d grapples not just with the misbehavior, for lack of a better word, than the appropriate punishment, given the relatively brief period of time that Louis C.K. spent in comedy exile. \u201cHow long should somebody go without working?\u201d asks Noam Dworman, owner of New York City\u2019s Comedy Cellar, where Louis C.K. began his comeback, gradually moving up to larger venues and eventually arenas like Madison Square Garden. If there\u2019s no easy answer to that, \u201cSorry/Not Sorry\u201d takes issue with both the supposition that nobody was really victimized by Louis C.K.\u2019s actions and the mentality of first looking the other way amid what the comic initially dismissed as \u201crumors,\u201d then welcoming him back. Although Kirkman attributes much of that to stand-up culture \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019ve been socialized in this world where men get to treat women however they want,\u201d she says \u2013 the issue goes beyond that to broader inequality in the workplace and the fallout, or lack thereof, from the #MeToo movement. Louis C.K. declined to be interviewed for the film, but as clips show, he has turned the story, and the revelations about his \u201ckink,\u201d as he describes it, into a part of his act. Like much of his comedy, he finds humor and a sense of embarrassment in that; still, some will surely feel queasy watching \u201cSorry/Not Sorry,\u201d realizing that unlike the women featured discussing their experiences, he is, again, laughing all the way to the bank. \u201cSorry/Not Sorry\u201d premieres in select theaters and digitally on July 12.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/sorry-not-sorry-documentary-louis-ck/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_13_entertainment_shelley-duvall-legacy", "text": "In all of the coverage remembering late actress Shelley Duvall, who died this week at the age of 75, great attention has been paid to her prolonged absence from the spotlight after breakout hits in \u201970s and early \u201880s cinema. Most notably, she will be forever linked to her portrayal of Wendy Torrance, the fragile and tortured victim to Jack Nicholson\u2019s maniacal writer in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s iconic 1980 adaptation of the Stephen King classic \u201cThe Shining,\u201d who then ostensibly vanished from the public eye. Sadly, that victim identity was only reinforced in the mid-2010s, when Duvall appeared on an episode of \u201cDr. Phil\u201d that was deemed exploitative and highly problematic. But just like anyone else, movie stars \u2013 even reluctant ones, like Duvall \u2013 equal more than their last impressions, or their perceived shortcomings. It is unfortunate that Duvall\u2019s absence from the public sphere eventually overshadowed her gifts and talent. Much has been written about Duvall\u2019s fraught experience on the set of \u201cThe Shining,\u201d where she spent much of the grueling shoot \u2013 often 16-hour days, six days a week \u2013 worked up into such a state of hysteria, her body would physically rebel from the constant stress and crying. In 2021, one of the plethora of \u201cwhere-has-she-been-all-this-time?\u201d pieces was published in The Hollywood Reporter, in which Anjelica Huston \u2013 who was dating Nicholson at the time the film was shot \u2013 recalled how Duvall opted to live close by the isolated set on the outskirts of London, as opposed to renting a flat in town and commuting. \u201cNobody does that,\u201d said Huston at the time. \u201cYou go back and forth from London, even though you could get stuck in two-hour traffic going in and out. But Shelley did that for a good year and a half. She got herself an apartment and lived there because she was just terribly dedicated and didn\u2019t want to shortchange herself or anyone else by not giving over fully to her commitment.\u201d That commitment was apparent in the finished product, with Duvall\u2019s portrayal of Wendy \u2013 the gawkish and terrified wife of an alcoholic writer who comes undone as their family is shut in at a haunted Colorado hotel over a harsh winter \u2013 becoming a major reference point in pop culture. After \u201cThe Shining,\u201d Duvall went on to a handful of other successful projects, but none that would rise to the level of notoriety of that film or her oeuvre that came before it, notably her lauded work with filmmaker Robert Altman. Decades later, when Duvall appeared on the controversial \u201cDr. Phil\u201d episode with a ratings-bait title, the then 67-year-old actress made confusing claims and was apparently struggling with her mental health. The episode drew great backlash and ire from viewers and Hollywood luminaries alike, with Mia Farrow calling for protection of \u201cmentally ill people from TV talk show predators like @DrPhil\u201d on social media and Vivian Kubrick \u2013 the late Stanley Kubrick\u2019s daughter \u2013 labeling the display as \u201cappallingly cruel\u201d and \u201clurid entertainment.\u201d (Dr. Phil, for his part, never apologized for the episode and instead told CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, \u201cI don\u2019t regret what I did.\u201d He only allowed that the show was \u201cpromoted in a way that people thought was unbecoming.\u201d) Ultimately, the incident only fueled curiosity around Duvall, who as the New York Times pointed out earlier this year, retained a dedicated fan base. Her tenure as host of the 1980s Showtime anthology \u201cFaerie Tale Theatre\u201d \u2013 an early but solid hit in the nascent premium cable era, which lasted six seasons \u2013 had a huge impact on younger Gen Xers and Millennials, like this writer. The fantasy show presented classic fairytales in the form of playful yet engrossing episodes filmed on a soundstage, and attracted an incredible roster of talent \u2013 including Helen Mirren, James Earl Jones, Treat Williams, Terri Garr and Gena Rowlands, to name but a few, not to mention some impressive directing work from the likes of Francis Ford Coppola and Tim Burton. It was buoyed, however, by Duvall, whose unique charm and childlike whimsy as host and presenter of each tale was the perfect fairy dust. She also acted as a producer on the series. Not long after \u201cFaerie Tale,\u201d Duvall played Steve Martin\u2019s clever confidante Dixie in the winsome 1987 retelling of Cyrano de Bergerac, \u201cRoxanne.\u201d At one point in the comedy, she tells a riddle to Martin\u2019s lovestruck, large-nosed main character, asking, \u201cWhat can you sit on, sleep on, and brush your teeth with?\u201d As Martin plumbs his brain for something elusive as the answer, Duvall slowly and coyly provides it: \u201cA chair, a bed, and a toothbrush.\u201d \u201cSometimes, the answer is so obvious, that you don\u2019t see it,\u201d she continues. A reminder to perhaps not focus so much on her elusiveness, but on the legacy of Duvall\u2019s work  \u2013 which was there all along.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/entertainment/shelley-duvall-legacy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_beverly-hills-cop-axel-f-review-eddie-murphy", "text": "\u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d spawned a trio of movies, but more significantly, the 1984 film capped off a string of hits (after \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d and \u201cTrading Places\u201d) that launched Eddie Murphy into the movie-star stratosphere. As Murphy moves into the encores-for-streaming phase of his career (see \u201cComing 2 America\u201d), enter \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\u201d which features enough unapologetic nostalgia (cue the music) to power through its flat spots. The fact that the film is premiering via Netflix, as opposed to theaters, might warrant some second-guessing given the box-office numbers that the latest \u201cBad Boys\u201d sequel has delivered, but that\u2019s a debate for another day. From the get-go, the star appears up to the task as he slides back into a role to which he said goodbye 30 years ago, and introduced a decade before that. As with \u201cComing 2 America,\u201d \u201cAlex F\u201d uses a next-generation hook to get into the story and create the excuse to bring Murphy\u2019s Axel Foley from Detroit (after an introductory action sequence that goes on a bit too long) back to Beverly Hills, reuniting him with lots of familiar faces. In this case, he\u2019s summoned by Billy (Judge Reinhold) to help Axel\u2019s estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige, who followed \u201cHit the Floor\u201d with \u201cZola\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d), a lawyer representing a client who has triggered a warning to back off from some very bad people. Before you can say \u201cGet the f\u2014k outta here\u201d (which is, not surprisingly, said several times), Axel lands in L.A., cheerfully insisting, \u201cThey love me in Beverly Hills!\u201d Staying on brand, he quickly irks the local authorities as he sets about protecting Jane, while running afoul of a corrupt detective played by Kevin Bacon (one of two movies in which he appears this week, the other being \u201cMaXXXine\u201d). Axel also gets teamed up with a younger cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has some history with Jane, although frankly \u2013 other than \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s hilarious cameo as a Beverly Hills realtor \u2013 the newcomers don\u2019t stand much of a chance to register as holdovers like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and John Ashton join Reinhold in dropping by. In perhaps the wisest (and easiest) decision, first-time feature director Mark Molloy relies heavily on music associated with the original movies, from Harold Faltermeyer\u2019s electronic score to songs like \u201cThe Heat is On\u201d and \u201cNeutron Dance,\u201d augmented by a new one from Lil Nas X. In the early going, a younger colleague in Detroit points out that Axel continues to hit the streets at a time when \u201cguys your age\u201d are transitioning to desk jobs, which basically spells out the formulation here, and how Murphy effectively carries off the same mentality as his alter ego. \u201cAxel F\u201d only turns up the heat to a low simmer, but as breezy escapism goes, those armed with the proper attitude might find themselves doing the neutron dance, or a version of it, all over again. \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_fly-me-to-the-moon-review-scarlett-johansson-channing-tatum", "text": "After a run of movies awash in the romance of the space program like \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cFirst Man,\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d cleverly uses the Apollo 11 mission as the backdrop to an old-style romance. Less than weighty in the comedy part of its equation, the film largely works as a vehicle for Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, even without completely sticking the landing. The movie casts Johansson as a corporate marketing specialist, which is somewhat ironic given that its marketing campaign isn\u2019t as clear as it could or should be in terms of conveying what to expect. While the story does include a subplot about staging a fake version of the moon landing \u2013 orchestrated as a back-up plan by a shadowy government operative (Woody Harrelson, again serving as one of the president\u2019s men, echoing his role in \u201cWhite House Plumbers\u201d) with ties to the Nixon administration \u2013 the heart of the film resides in the chemistry between the leads. In classic fashion, they are of course instantly drawn to each other, creating the need to erect barriers in order to keep them apart. In that sense, this is less about conspiracy theories and reality \u2013 though there\u2019s definitely an element of that woven into it \u2013 than the tension between NASA\u2019s square-jawed launch director, Cole Davis (Tatum), and Johansson\u2019s Kelly Jones, who gets recruited to \u201csell the moon\u201d to a skeptical public, leveraging her knack for bending the truth in order to close the deal. Coming almost exactly 55 years after Neil Armstrong took that \u201cone giant leap\u201d onto the lunar surface, director Greg Berlanti and writer Rose Gilroy introduce a strain of cynicism well suited to our current moment, juxtaposing that with the soaring, can-do spirit of the Apollo program. There\u2019s a crowd-pleasing quality to the combination, even if any crowds might prove short lived, inasmuch as the film\u2019s theatrical prospects (before a date on Apple TV+) amount to serving as counter-programming to the blockbuster \u201cTwisters\u201d and \u201cDeadpool\u201d sequels soon to come. A prolific TV producer, Berlanti has tilted toward romance with his forays into movies, including \u201cLove, Simon\u201d and \u201cLife as We Know It.\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d occupies a higher orbit in its ambition and star power, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that his leads look pretty celestial, while bathing in the period costumes and music of the time. After an eclectic string of roles, Johansson carries a film that might have starred someone like Faye Dunaway during the era in which it\u2019s set (think \u201cNetwork\u201d), while Tatum gets put to better use than his most recent rom-coms, the third \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cThe Lost City,\u201d admittedly not a super-high bar. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d possesses appealing virtues consciously plucked from the past, then adorns them with modern baubles. Whether that will \u201csell the moon\u201d to the moviegoing public remains to be seen, but to borrow from the song that shares its title, the pitch isn\u2019t much more complicated than an invitation to come play among the stars. \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d premieres July 12 in US theaters.

In an interview with CNN conducted before the first movie\u2019s release, the Oscar-winner said he\u2019s been trying to get the film made for decades and had no concerns that the running time, or multiple installments, might be a turnoff to those with short attention spans. \u201cI make movies for people so that they won\u2019t be bored,\u201d Costner said at the time. \u201cI give them a taste of something in a different direction, which is probably why it\u2019s hard for me to get them made at first \u2018cause they\u2019re a little different.\u201d Costner reportedly sunk $38 million of his own money into the project.

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec", "text": "This year, two disparate, big-budget films will share a release date: One, an R-rated historical epic stacked with a starry cast of Oscar hopefuls. The other, a musical based on a beloved property with plenty of pink and a Billboard-friendly soundtrack. Sound familiar? With \u201cGladiator II\u201d and the first part of \u201cWicked\u201d sharing a release date, days before Thanksgiving, movie theaters are nearing their truest chance at another \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d a viral phenomenon that in 2023 drove audiences to the movie theater by the millions, leaving a massive mark in pop culture and at the box office. But what will we call it? \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal thinks \u201cGlicked\u201d (pronounced glick-id) is the portmanteau that suits the prospective double feature best. \u201c\u2019Wickiator\u2019 doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue, does it?\u201d he said in a new interview with Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI think the films couldn\u2019t be more polar opposite and kind of worked in that context previously, so fingers crossed people come out and see both films on opening weekend.\u201d But maybe we moviegoers (and Mescal) are getting ahead of ourselves. Tom Nunan, a lecturer at UCLA\u2019s School of Theater, Film and TV and the founder of the production company Bull\u2019s Eye Entertainment, isn\u2019t fully sold on \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d 2.0. Both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d were major films with astronomical hype from respected auteurs, but even the studios couldn\u2019t have predicted that audiences would make both films appointment viewing over the same weekend, he said. (\u201cBarbie\u201d was produced by Warner Bros., which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.) \u201cIt\u2019s good when studios release big titles simultaneously,\u201d Nunan told CNN. \u201cI do think that they feed off of each other \u2013\u2013\u00a0that level of excitement. I think all of those things work in both of these films\u2019 favor. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the lightning in a bottle that \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was.\u201d Stranger things have happened, though \u2013\u2013 plus, there\u2019s a \u201cStranger Things\u201d actor in the \u201cGladiator\u201d sequel, which might attract some younger audiences. But if \u201cGlicked\u201d wants to achieve \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d heights of success, the films have a few more hurdles to clear than the Oscar-winning hits of last summer. \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 and \u2018Wicked\u2019 need a fun portmanteau First things first \u2013\u2013\u00a0\u201dBarbenheimer\u201d had a killer portmanteau. If the studios behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d want to emulate the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, they might want to turn to the movie lovers who helped coin the term that turned last year\u2019s summer flicks into a double feature. The Columbia Journalism Review credits awards pundit Matt Neglia with using \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d first in April 2023, but it quickly spread across the internet wherever movie fans lurked. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d wasn\u2019t clunky, and there was never any question which films \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d referred to \u2014\u00a0the same cannot be said just yet of \u201cGlicked,\u201d \u201cWickiator\u201d or the even uglier \u201cGladicked.\u201d It should be noted that after the smashing success of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer, no release weekends have seen the same double-feature draw, though musings of \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d and \u201cGarfuriosa\u201d pairings did make the rounds online. Those were more jokes about how two seemingly incompatible films could reach the same audiences than genuine attempts at creating a viral trend \u2014\u00a0in no world does the \u00fcber-graphic \u201cSaw X\u201d pair well with the kid-friendly \u201cPaw Patrol: The Mighty Movie.\u201d For now, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d simply haven\u2019t dominated the cultural conversation yet in the same way \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d did. But there\u2019s still time \u2014\u00a0they don\u2019t hit theaters until November 22. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019s\u2019 appeal was mystery Part of the appeal of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was wanting to see it as soon as possible to join the cultural conversation about two of the biggest movies of the year. It helped that we knew so little about both films before their premieres, Nunan said. Aside from a few paparazzi shots of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling rollerblading through Venice Beach, we knew virtually nothing about \u201cBarbie\u201d before it came out. And \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d while based in history, was still a Christopher Nolan film, so its marketing was mostly mysterious and teased major moments without revealing too much of its majesty. But both films had been hyped for over a year before their releases, thanks to marketing that kept much of the secrets of both films but offered fans just enough to keep them excited. A well-timed trailer here and a smart social campaign there \u2013\u2013\u00a0like those \u201cBarbie\u201d headshots with the quippy captions or the ominous live countdown clocks used on billboards and in trailers for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013\u2013\u00a0only made fans more ravenous ahead of the release date, Nunan said. There\u2019s less mystery with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II.\u201d The former is one of the most popular musicals of the century and the fourth-longest running on Broadway \u2013\u2013\u00a0millions have already seen it onstage or read the novel upon which it\u2019s based, so there are fewer surprises in store for audiences, Nunan said. And though \u201cGladiator\u201d won best picture among other Oscars, it came out 24 years ago. \u201cNeither of these franchises are fresh to the audience,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cThey\u2019re both known entities versus the unlimited potential of \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019\u201d Familiarity and continuations of franchises decades later can work \u2014\u00a0\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d was the first huge success since Covid-19 kneecapped movie theaters and spoke to viewers beyond those who\u2019d seen the original \u201cTop Gun\u201d back in 1986, Nunan said. But whether audiences will seek out that nostalgia again is harder to predict. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 had an air of prestige Another \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d advantage was both films\u2019 sublime pairing of director and subject matter. Here was indie staple and Oscar nominee Greta Gerwig helming her biggest film yet about the country\u2019s most famous doll \u2013\u2013 even those less familiar with her work were eager to see whether she could pull off \u201cBarbie.\u201d (The consensus was that she did.) \u201cOppenheimer\u201d director Christopher Nolan also has a distinct style and a dedicated fanbase, which has cemented Nolan as a reliable box office draw, with six of his 12 films making between half a billion to over $1 billion worldwide. The best picture-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d almost cracked a billion. The \u201cartistic audacity\u201d that both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d promised was thrilling in its own right, Nunan said, and part of what drove the more hardcore film fans to the theater for repeat viewings. And that\u2019s the test for a true blockbuster, he said: Whether viewers find it worth it to return and pay to see the same film again and again. The critical and commercial track records for the directors behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are less consistent, Nunan said, which could make a difference in the cultural and box-office impact they have. The prolific Ridley Scott of \u201cGladiator II\u201d has made classics like \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cThelma and Louise.\u201d But his more recent films haven\u2019t \u201cmoved the needle\u201d like his earlier work, Nunan said. Last year\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d and 2021\u2019s \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d made decent money but earned middling reviews; 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Last Duel,\u201d though lauded, was declared a \u201cbomb\u201d by trade publications. \u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu is perhaps best known for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d which was a hit with audiences in 2018, though his last film, 2021\u2019s adaptation of the musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d was beset by Covid-era box office challenges. Musicals like \u2018Wicked\u2019 can be tough sells It will be a harder road for \u201cWicked\u201d to excel than \u201cBarbie\u201d before it, Nunan said \u2013\u2013\u00a0movie musicals are a tougher sell with audiences, even those adapted from popular properties. (See: \u201cCats\u201d flopping in 2019, even though it was based on one of the longest-running musicals of all time and featured the world-conquering superstar Taylor Swift.) \u201cI think the fact that \u2018Wicked\u2019 is a musical actually limits its long term box office appeal,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cWicked\u201d is also a full-fledged musical where \u201cBarbie\u201d was marketed as a comedy that happened to feature a few impactful musical numbers led by a game Ryan Gosling, and even those numbers were revealed much later in the pre-release campaign, he said. There are exceptions to the movie musical rule, though: Just this year, another musical based on familiar IP did solid numbers \u2014 \u201cMean Girls,\u201d a film adaptation of the Broadway musical based on the 2004 film, made over $100 million in theaters. \u2018Glicked\u2019 does have star power As with \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before them, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d have star power in spades. The Roman Empire-set epic has a cast full of \u201cinternet boyfriends,\u201d the men for whom countless fans have pined since their breakout performances: Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn, to name three. Mescal starred in the pandemic-era series \u201cNormal People\u201d and became an Oscar nominee for \u201cAftersun\u201d at 27; the seasoned Pascal reached new heights of heartthrobbery with HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and Quinn appeared in the most recent season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d one of the most-watched Netflix series of all time. Scott\u2019s upcoming film also boasts a star so stratospherically charismatic that the New York Times named him the greatest actor of the 21st century: Denzel Washington, who nearly runs away with the trailer. And \u201cWicked\u201d is anchored by one of the premier pop divas of our time, Ariana Grande, who plays Galinda (yes, Ga-linda), the blonde foil to Cynthia Erivo\u2019s green-skinned Elphaba. Grande hasn\u2019t played a major leading role in a film yet, and she\u2019s only appeared in cameos and bit parts over the last decade. But it\u2019s possible that star power doesn\u2019t play as large a role as it once did in getting butts in seats, Nunan said. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, who played crucial supporting roles in \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d starred in \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d earlier this spring, which faltered at the box office and was sent to VOD just weeks after it hit theaters. \u201cI don\u2019t know, with these blockbuster tentpole films, if the casting is as important as the movie itself,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the quality and execution of the film.\u201d He cited \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which featured several major stars in supporting roles, like Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey, Jr. Their inclusion in the cast maybe lent the film an air of prestige, but he\u2019s not sure that any of them were the sole reason people saw the film. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us went to see because Matt and Emily and Robert were in it, but it helped,\u201d he said. There was something alchemical about the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d moment of last summer that exceeded all predictions about how popular both films would prove. It might have been easy to assume that viewers of one film wouldn\u2019t want to see the other since they were so dissimilar, Nunan said, but \u201caudiences proved the studios wrong\u201d and went to see both. \u201cThat summer, \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was meeting on so many levels of special,\u201d he said. Some magic just can\u2019t be replicated, though there\u2019s still a few months for \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d\u00a0to drum up the same must-see prestige as the films that dominated the summer of 2023. What remains to be seen is whether fans who see the films as a double feature will wear gladiator skirts and witch hats to the theater.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_entertainment_hannah-gutierrez-reed-alec-baldwin-rust", "text": "The dramatic dismissal of the involuntary manslaughter case against actor Alec Baldwin over withheld evidence could mean the release of convicted \u201cRust\u201d movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed from a New Mexico state prison, legal experts say. Hannah Gutierrez Reed was\u00a0found guilty of involuntary manslaughter\u00a0and sentenced to 18 months in prison in March for the fatal shooting of cinematographer\u00a0Halyna Hutchins, who was killed by a live round fired from a prop gun that Baldwin held on the set of the western film in 2021. She\u2019s appealing her conviction. But the Baldwin case imploded on Friday \u2013 just two days after the trial began \u2013 with the sudden and shocking twists and turns of a nail-biting legal thriller. A judge ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. The ruling was in response to a motion to dismiss by the actor\u2019s attorneys, who argued the state did not share with them that a man had delivered to investigators a batch of unexamined ammunition purportedly connected to the case. \u201cGiven the egregious misconduct that led to the dismissal of Alec Baldwin\u2019s case, it is abundantly clear that Hannah Gutierrez-Reed\u2019s case must also be dismissed,\u201d New York defense lawyer Duncan Levin said via email. \u201cThe intentional withholding of crucial evidence by the state has compromised the integrity of the entire judicial process. Justice demands that Hannah\u2019s wrongful conviction be overturned immediately, ensuring that the legal system does not perpetuate this grave injustice.\u201d Immediately after the trial\u2019s stunning end, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney said he planned to file a motion for her release. \u201cI fully expect Hannah Gutierrez Reed to make the same argument for her conviction to be overturned,\u201d Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN. \u201cI think this case wasn\u2019t won by Alec Baldwin as much as it was lost by the prosecution. \u2026 This evidence is more exculpatory and exonerates Gutierrez Reed even more than Baldwin.\u201d The evidence in question first came to light on Thursday. A crime scene technician testified that a man had delivered a box of ammunition to the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office after Gutierrez Reed\u2019s conviction. Troy Teske, a retired cop and friend of the armorer\u2019s father, told investigators he believed the ammunition could be associated with the \u201cRust\u201d case, according to testimony by crime scene tech Marissa Poppell. But, Poppell told the jury, the bullets were catalogued separately from Baldwin\u2019s case and were not included in the \u201cRust\u201d case inventory or tested to see if they matched the lethal round. Baldwin\u2019s defense team argued prosecutors buried this evidence. His attorneys claimed in a motion the state \u201cunilaterally withheld\u201d evidence that could be favorable at his trial \u2013 a violation of the Brady rule, named after the\u00a01963 Brady v. Maryland case. The rule requires prosecutors \u201cto disclose\u00a0material, exculpatory information\u00a0in the government\u2019s possession to the defense,\u201d according to Cornell Law School. On Friday, the case crumbled: The judge sent the jury home early, presided over a chaotic hours-long hearing in which the lead prosecutor went from grilling witnesses to taking the stand herself and saw a co-special prosecutor abruptly resign. Finally, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case with prejudice \u2013 meaning it cannot be brought again. She called the withholding of evidence \u201cintentional and deliberate.\u201d \u201cThe jury has been sworn, jeopardy has attached, and this disclosure during the course of trial is so late that it undermines the defendant\u2019s preparation for trial,\u201d Marlowe Sommer said. \u201cThere is no way for the court to right this wrong.\u201d The \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cHunt for Red October\u201d star \u2013 who had\u00a0pleaded not guilty and could have faced up to 18 months in prison \u2013 cried as the decision was announced. He later hugged his wife Hilaria as court was excused for the day. On October 21, 2021, Baldwin was on the movie set practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 with a prop gun when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. Jason Bowles, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, told CNN Friday that he will seek freedom for his client. \u201cThe judge found intentional misconduct and we also have had the same failures in Hannah\u2019s case by the state. We will be moving for dismissal of Hannah\u2019s case,\u201d Bowles said. Sommer was also the judge in the armorer\u2019s trial. Her ruling regarding the failure to disclose the ammunition should carry significant weight in the Gutierrez Reed case, CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said. \u201cI think what you\u2019re going to see is a motion from her attorney giving the indication that when she was on trial, she did not have this information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cClearly, it was in the prosecution\u2019s control. Clearly, it was brought to the prosecutor\u2019s attention. And prosecutors don\u2019t get to make a unilateral decision as to whether something\u2019s relevant or important in the case. It\u2019s shared and then assessed and analyzed.\u201d  Rahmani, referring to Gutierrez Reed, said: \u201cI fully expect either the trial court or the appellate court to overturn that conviction. It won\u2019t just be Alec Baldwin who\u2019s a free man. Hannah Gutierrez Reed will go free as well. And it\u2019s really a tragedy to the victims in this case.\u201d CNN\u2019s John Campbell.
