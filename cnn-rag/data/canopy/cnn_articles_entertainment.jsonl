She is the founder of \u201cJust Elope,\u201d a Dallas-based \u201celopement and popup wedding specialists\u201d company. If she looks familiar, it\u2019s because she\u2019s served as an officiant at some high profile weddings, including that of rapper/TV personality Da Brat and entrepreneur Jesseca Dupart as part of their WE reality series \u201cBrat Loves Judy.\u201d She was also featured on Season 3 of Netflix\u2019s hit series \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Allen told CNN she and her now-husband Tavarous Allen were young and in a hurry to marry in 2010 before he was deployed in the military. \u201cHe said, \u2018We should get married before I leave,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\u201d she recalled, chuckling at the memory. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018The only thing that we can do is go to Vegas or go to City Hall. I do not want to get married at City Hall. We cannot afford to go to Vegas, so that\u2019s not an option.\u2019 And so I started looking online to see what I could find.\u201d What she found were no options in between, so the couple ended up getting married at City Hall which she now says was \u201cunderwhelming\u201d before her husband shipped out hours later. The lack of choices inspired Allen to start a business for other couples who \u2013 like she and her husband \u2013 had dreams of a special day that were bigger than their resources. Even those who plan a bigger wedding later deserve to make memories in the moment, she said. \u201cOne of the things that I always tell our couples when they say we\u2019re going to do something small now with a big wedding later, I always tell them, you gotta look at it like losing your virginity,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIf you lost your virginity in the back of a pickup truck and you had sex the next time in a hotel room, it does not change the fact that you lost it in the back of a pickup truck.\u201d That type of straight talk, as well as the attention to both detail and the desires of her clients, has helped Allen build a reputation that has led to her helping over 400 couples. It also led to her being enlisted to officiate over the potential wedding ceremony of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 3 contestants Sikiru \u201cSK\u201d Alagbada and Raven Ross (contestants \u201cdate\u201d without seeing each other and on their wedding day have the option to either wed or not on the show, and Alagbada opted not to). Allen enjoys helping put together weddings that can range from the $500 package her company offers to more elaborate affairs for brides like Jaqui Rice Gold, chief executive officer of G.O.A.T. Fuel and daughter of Hall of Fame football player Jerry Rice. \u201cI tell people our business is not for necessarily the budget buy, because she\u2019s a prime example of somebody that could have had a multimillion dollar wedding if she wanted to,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut she booked her package, paid her deposit, made her final payment 30 days before and used all of our references because we tell you where you should go to get your dress, hair, makeup and the rest.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/entertainment/jennifer-allen-celebrity-weddings-love-is-blind/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_entertainment_lost-abc-netflix", "text": "ABC was struggling to find hits in 2004 when the network introduced two of them: \u201cDesperate Housewives,\u201d a new take on a primetime soap opera; and \u201cLost,\u201d a sci-fi-tinged mystery that fast became a fan sensation, from its cryptic numbers to what really happened to that crashed plane and its passengers. Of the two, though, it was \u201cLost\u201d that fundamentally changed television and the relationship between the creative talent behind TV shows and the networks that carried them \u2013 fueling what might be called the novelization of television \u2013 not in the way the series began, but rather how it ended in 2010. The roots of that actually began several years earlier, when the show\u2019s executive producers, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, recognized that the twisty, mysterious series\u2019 ratings were beginning to suffer because of the open-ended nature of viewers\u2019 commitment. When would we get some answers, fans wanted to know. At their urging, in what Variety called a \u201cparadigm-shifting play,\u201d ABC allowed them to announce an official end date for the series, ordering 48 episodes over three seasons to complete the story. The announcement served notice that the series was indeed building toward something, that a payoff awaited those who were sinking all this time \u2013 and graduate-school-level thought and analysis \u2013 in the show, and what it all meant. Until then, the prevailing wisdom in television was, in essence, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. Series ran until the audience stopped watching them, not when the creators said, as if they were novelists who had reached the conclusion of the story. \u201cI think for story-based shows like \u2018Lost,\u2019 as opposed to franchise-based shows like \u2018ER\u2019 or \u2018CSI,\u2019 the audience wants to know when the story is going to be over,\u201d Cuse stated at the time, spelling out the novel comparison by adding, \u201cWhen J.K. Rowling announced that there would be seven \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 books, it gave the readers a clear sense of exactly what their investment would be. We want our audience to do the same.\u201d Producer J.J. Abrams, who co-created the series with Lindelof and Jeffrey Lieber, at the time called the decision \u201cthe right choice,\u201d crediting ABC for having \u201creal foresight and guts to make a call like this.\u201d Since then, arguably, a different kind of television has emerged and taken root, giving creative talent more latitude to decide the shelf life of their stories. That has included the growth of limited series that offer the promise of closure and finality, creating arcs with a clear beginning and end. Others followed that example, from \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d with its two-season conclusion, to \u201cStranger Things,\u201d to most recently \u201cThe Boys,\u201d which announced that superhero satire\u2019s fifth season will wrap up the story. That equation has made TV richer and more ambitious, as well as able to wrestle with different kinds of serialized storytelling. In the immediate aftermath of that, the children of \u201cLost\u201d \u2013 plentiful at first, as they always are when something unexpectedly succeeds \u2013 benefited from that appetite, as networks ordered more projects with mysteries baked into them, even if few of them could live up to its promise. Tellingly, even \u201cLost\u201d didn\u2019t stick the landing, yielding a finale that answered many of its questions but felt frustrating in its resolution. Knowing when to end isn\u2019t exactly the same as knowing how. By then, though, the show\u2019s legacy was secure. Bringing that full circle, all 121 episodes of the show are appropriately landing on Netflix, where they can be rediscovered \u2013 and binged in a more concentrated fashion \u2013 by those who don\u2019t have to wait years to see how it all ends. Welcome to the 2020s. The \u201cLost\u201d finale might not have conjured an ending worthy of all the hype. By then, though, it had helped point TV toward a new approach to telling stories, which, never mind the numbers (for the record, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42), might be the formula that really matters the most. \u201cLost\u201d premieres July 1 on Netflix in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/entertainment/lost-abc-netflix/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The complaint, filed in the\u00a0US\u00a0District Court for the Southern District of New York, also alleges\u00a0Combs forced English to\u00a0\u201cengage in prostitution and sex work\u201d between 2006 and 2009. The lawsuit marks the\u00a0ninth\u00a0against Combs since last November and the eighth directly accusing him of sexual assault.\u00a0One of the eight lawsuits, filed by former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, has been\u00a0settled. Another lawsuit\u00a0accused\u00a0his son Christian Combs of sexual assault, and Sean Combs is accused of aiding and abetting. \u201cNo matter how many lawsuits are filed it won\u2019t change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,\u201d Jonathan Davis, an attorney for Combs said in a statement when asked about English\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cWe live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court,\u201d the attorney added. English\u2019s lawsuit requests a jury trial and seeks\u00a0an undisclosed amount of punitive damages. Combs has vehemently denied claims from many of the civil suits but has not responded to all of the allegations. In December 2023, after four lawsuits had been filed against him,\u00a0Combs posted\u00a0a fierce denial on his social media, writing that \u201csickening allegations\u201d had been made by accusers \u201clooking for a quick payday.\u201d He added, \u201cLet me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.\u201d Federal investigators\u00a0are also preparing to bring accusers of Combs before a federal grand jury, two sources familiar with the probe previously told CNN \u2014 signaling the US Justice Department is moving toward potentially seeking an indictment of Combs.

The chosen title does have the advantage of evoking a movie, \u201cMan of a Thousand Faces,\u201d a biography of the silent-film star and horror staple Lon Chaney. It is also imprecise, or at best an estimate, since as the Times reported, the actual number of children fathered by Jonathan Jacob Meijer, a Dutch musician, \u201cis impossible to say,\u201d with a Dutch organization stating the total \u201ccould run to several hundred, even 1,000,\u201d while Meijer put the figure at \u201capproximately 250.\u201d Whatever the math, the bottom line of the story is certainly attention-getting: Meijer agreed to provide sperm to a number of families, outside of conventional donation channels as well as through traditional ones, leaving parents feeling misled and outraged, betrayed and defrauded, upon learning the truth. Meijer also traveled the world, providing donations in multiple countries, making a full count of the children with his DNA extraordinarily difficult to obtain. Lacking many options to take action, the parents finally went to court, seeking to prevent him from donating to anyone else. Produced by the makers of \u201cLover, Stalker, Killer,\u201d \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d begins in almost whimsical fashion, interviewing various parents \u2013 from single mothers to lesbian couples to a man who, after his second marriage, couldn\u2019t have his vasectomy reversed \u2013 who found Meijer online, liked the image he presented and availed themselves of his services. Eventually, though, enthusiasm gave way to rising anger and efforts to stop him, as well as plenty of questions, still largely speculative, about what motivated him and others to far exceed established donor guidelines. (Meijer declined to participate in the documentary but told the Times in 2021 that his goal was \u201cto help parents with realizing their dream.\u201d) Like so many of these sensational documentaries \u2013 including \u201cOur Father,\u201d a Netflix project about an Indiana fertility specialist who used his own sperm to inseminate patients, or HBO\u2019s \u201cBaby God\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d raises questions about the fertility industry, and its regulation, that go beyond individual cases to consider ethical and logistical concerns through an extreme lens. While the numbers might not be completely accurate, in terms of appealing to an audience weaned on sensational titles like \u201cThe Tinder Swindler\u201d and similar fare, this feels right on target. \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/entertainment/the-man-with-1000-kids-netflix-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

He was 89 years old. The news was confirmed by Towne\u2019s publicist Carri McClure, who said he died on Monday \u201cpeacefully at home surrounded by his loving family.\u201d No cause of death was provided. Towne won the Academy Award for best original screenplay for \u201cChinatown,\u201d which last month celebrated 50 years since being released. Towne enjoyed an enormously productive period in the 1970s, writing such films as \u201cShampoo,\u201d starring Warren Beatty, and \u201cThe Last Detail,\u201d also starring Nicholson. He was also well known as an accomplished script polisher and ghost writer, penning scenes for a number of movies on which he wasn\u2019t credited, including \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d Towne also cowrote the screenplay for \u201cThe Firm,\u201d starring Tom Cruise, and worked with the actor on the first two \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movies. Always in high demand, Towne wrote the \u201cChinatown\u201d sequel \u201cThe Two Jakes,\u201d directed by Nicholson, and served as a consulting producer on the Emmy-winning series \u201cMad Men.\u201d Additionally, he directed four films, including 1988\u2019s \u201cTequila Sunrise\u201d starring Kurt Russell, Michelle Pfeiffer and Mel Gibson. Towne wrote the screenplay for that film as well. He received a total of four Academy Award screenplay nominations, including three in a row for \u201cThe Last Detail,\u201d \u201cChinatown\u201d and \u201cShampoo.\u201d The last came for 1984\u2019s \u201cGreystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,\u201d although Towne disliked the film so much that he had his name removed and was credited as P.H. Vazak, which was the name of his dog. Born in Los Angeles, Towne said in an interview with Variety earlier this year, tied to the 50th anniversary of \u201cChinatown,\u201d that as a screenwriter he liked writing for a particular star, as opposed to working on a script without knowing who would be playing the key roles. \u201cHaving a real person to write for simply makes my task easier and more enjoyable,\u201d he said. A lifelong screenwriter hailed as a master of the craft, Towne also told Variety last month, regarding the changing trends and appetites of Hollywood and the viewing public, \u201cStorytelling doesn\u2019t stop simply because a culture uses different mechanisms. Audiences still want to believe. They\u2019re simply more sophisticated, they\u2019ve grown used to the medium of film so they\u2019re not so easily beguiled.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

The intrepid actor does, however, consider his role of Axel Foley in the \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d franchise to be one that stands out among the rest. \u201cBefore \u2018Beverly Hills Cop,\u2019 there had never been a movie that starred a Black man, a Black person, that was successful all around the world,\u201d Murphy said in a recent interview with Extra, pegged to the upcoming fourth installment of the movie series titled \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\u201d Murphy went on to say that \u201ceven still to this day, when Black folks, we make movies, most of the time they work in the States and outside of the country, they don\u2019t work.\u201d The Oscar-nominated actor mentioned his previous work in \u201cThe Nutty Professor\u201d and \u201cComing to America\u201d as examples of movies he starred in that were global hits, but said that \u201c\u2019Beverly Hills Cop\u2019 started it and started that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where you get Will (Smith) and The Rock, they do it now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2018Beverly Hills Cop\u2019 is the first one that did it.\u201d Capping on that worldwide love for the franchise, Murphy also confirmed that a fifth installment is currently in the works, and that the film\u2019s producer Jerry Bruckheimer is \u201cworking on the script.\u201d \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d first premiered in 1984 and became a career-defining role for Murphy. It earned an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay and spawned two sequels \u2013 1987\u2019s \u201cBeverly Hills Cop II\u201d and 1994\u2019s \u201cBeverly Hills Cop III\u201d \u2013 before the impending fourth entry.

Granted, the awards have come in a category in which the Hulu series doesn\u2019t really belong, but it remains TV\u2019s version of fine dining: big white plates with small but mouth-watering dollops of food on them. As noted, labeling the FX-produced program a comedy has more to do with award politicking than content, since the show merits that categorical designation less than almost any of the acclaimed series submitted on comedy ballots for award purposes, shows like \u201cBarry\u201d and \u201cNurse Jackie\u201d among them. Like the last streaming comedy awards darling, \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cThe Bear\u201d also manages to be very good and still feel a touch over-praised, perhaps in part because the adjectives thrown around to describe it understandably seek to match the volume of coverage devoted to it. The latest season\u2019s first episode nicely sets the table for the nine episodes to come, playing almost like a visual poem while reintroducing the characters. At Hulu\u2019s request, any spoiler-ish specifics need to be scarce, but series creator Christopher Storer (who directed seven of the new season\u2019s 10 installments) has the luxury of playing the long game, indulging in episodes devoted to individual players, while teasing out various threads without feeling compelled to pay everything off. The season\u2019s theme centers on the pursuit of dreams, both for chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and his able right hand Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), as they continue the process of transforming the restaurant into a fine-dining destination. Woven into that, given the recurring ghosts from Carmy\u2019s past, is the question of whether one must become a jerk to succeed in this business, contemplating distinctions between leading employees with a firm rein and a suffocating, soul-crushing one. The cast remains splendid and the storytelling moody and lyrical, in a way that both challenges the audience and rewards them for paying attention to small details. What \u201cThe Bear\u201d has lost is the element of surprise that greeted its arrival. By now there\u2019s less novelty in its fly-on-the-wall access to what goes on inside a kitchen, and once your leading man has become a marquee Calvin Klein model and high-level celebrity cameos (some new, others familiar) start piling up, it\u2019s harder to position the show as a plucky underdog. The world occupied by \u201cThe Bear\u201d is also a place where reviews matter very much, an attribute the Michelin-star-obsessed business of high-end restaurants shares with the awards-chasing strategies of streaming. At this point, though, the series has surely become review-proof, having earned the loyal patronage of those viewers happy to watch Storer and company spin plates, even during those meticulously prepared stretches, narratively speaking, when \u201cThe Bear\u201d is just spinning its wheels. \u201cThe Bear\u201d launched its third season June 26 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/the-bear-season-3-review-jeremy-allen-white/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The Chiefs player, who has been dating Swift for nearly a year, talked about how the moment came together on the latest episode of his New Heights podcast. Kelce said it was initially his idea to join the show at Wembley Stadium, recalling that he told Swift it would be \u201cfunny\u201d if he \u201crolled out on one of the bikes\u201d that dancers typically ride on stage during the 1989 portion of the show. Kelce said Swift laughed, but then asked him, \u201cWould you seriously be up for doing something like that?\u201d \u201cI was just like, \u2018What? I would love to do that. Are you kidding me? I\u2019ve seen the show enough \u2014 might as well put me to work here,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd sure enough, she found the perfect part of the show for me to come in.\u201d Kelce surprised the crowd in London last week when he appeared on stage in a tuxedo and top hat carrying Swift onstage in \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d era of the show. It happened on the third night of the London stops, after the brothers attended Swift\u2019s first two shows there. \u201cThere was no bike in case I ran into somebody else or hit one of the dancers or anything,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cIt was the safest option.\u201d Kelce said his silly dance on stage was inspired by one Jim Carey does in the movie \u201cDumb and Dumber.\u201d \u201cI always wanted to pull out this move, but I never knew like when I should pull it out where it made sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my favorite moves of all time!\u201d All said, Kelce called it an \u201chonor\u201d being on the stage with Swift and her dancers. \u201cIt was an absolute blast,\u201d he shared. \u201cIt was such a fun, playful part of the show and it was like the perfect time for me to go up there, just be a ham and have some fun, not only with [Swift]\u2026 but the crowd and really try and get everybody excited for the rest of the show.

{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_bridgerton-mixed-weight-couple-discussion", "text": "The fictional romance between Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) on Netflix\u2019s \u201cBridgerton\u201d continues to be the talk of TV, but not all of the discussion has pleased viewers. A recent Forbes piece about the series, penned by author and activist Virgie Tovar, has caused a stir for referring to the pairing as \u201cmixed-weight,\u201d putting focus on the characters\u2019 different body types in a way some have found sexist. Known by fans as \u201cPolin,\u201d the duo\u2019s romance this season has been eagerly awaited since the show first premiered in 2020, given that fans of the series (and the Julia Quinn novels that inspired the hit Netflix franchise) know that Penelope has secretly yearned to catch Colin\u2019s eye from the beginning. As celebrated as the pair is, Tovar\u2019s article acknowledges the problematic discussion the characters\u2019 romantic relationship has spurred. \u201cFor some, this romance is unsettling because it forces them to consider that humans are simply not governed by tidy, predictable rules,\u201d Tovar writes. \u201cIf this romance upsets you, it says more about how deeply you\u2019ve internalized fatphobia than it says about the bodies of the actors playing Penelope and Colin.\u201d The article has drawn mixed reaction, with some celebrating the discussion and others decrying terminology used therein. Writer and critic Zo\u00eb Rose Bryant shared on X, \u201cI find it interesting how there are countless fictional couples in film and television where the man weighs more than the woman but people didn\u2019t start writing articles about whatever the f\u2014k a \u2018mixed-weight romance\u2019 is until it was the other way around.\u201d Tovar said to CNN in a statement, \u201cI think this conversation is really important, as difficult as it might be.\u201d \u201cAs someone who\u2019s watched \u2018Bridgerton\u2019 from Season 1, I genuinely and instantly saw myself in Penelope. That isn\u2019t an emotion that can be contrived, and I wrote the piece from that place,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think there needs to be room for both the plus-size person who didn\u2019t see themselves reflected in Penelope and those of us who did. Neither of us is wrong. I think it\u2019s important to hear from the people who don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d Coughlan has said she was aware of the conversations being had about her plus-sized body after the first two seasons and \u201cspecifically asked for certain lines and moments to be included\u201d in the new season, which features racy sex scenes between her character and Newton\u2019s. \u201cThere\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m very naked on camera, and that was my idea, my choice,\u201d Coughlan added at the time.

{"id": "2024_06_26_entertainment_judy-garland-trolley-song-pride-cec", "text": "It was 1944 when the trolley first started to clang. \u201cThe Trolley Song,\u201d a second-act standout from the 1944 movie musical \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d was sung by Judy Garland in striking Technicolor. It was released back when gay was more commonly understood to mean \u201chappy,\u201d a rainbow was just a weather phenomenon and a trolley was just another mode of transportation. And yet it has found new life online nearly 80 years later as an unlikely anthem for LGBTQ Pride. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d has been making the rounds again this year among young queer people who can\u2019t resist the brassy gift of Garland\u2019s vocal performance, its campy, heightened atmosphere and its timeless fun. \u201cHappy pride month (sic) to Judy Garland in the trolley song. And also to the trolley,\u201d one person wrote on X. \u201cThere\u2019s no pride month without the trolley song,\u201d said another. Some hope \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d will be a featured lip-sync on the next season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d while others believe the song deserves to be released as several club-ready remixes. At least one person called it Garland\u2019s version of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s summer smash \u201cEspresso,\u201d a frothy single about a fling that\u2019s a staple on many Pride playlists. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is not the most obvious candidate for a Pride playlist. It lacks the overt LGBTQ imagery of \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d perhaps Garland\u2019s most famous song, or the appeal of Garland\u2019s live performances toward the end of her life, which were heavily attended by her gay fans. But a closer read reveals why it resonates with LGBTQ fans today. \u201cThe tempo, the lyrics, the onomatopoeia \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s all super gay,\u201d said Dave Karger, a Turner Classic Movies host who frequently presents movie musicals, including \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d on the channel. (CNN and TCM share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.) Patrick Kelleher, a social justice organizer in Ireland who\u2019s written about his relationship with Garland and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d has noticed it popping up more frequently in his online circles, even declaring it \u201cthis year\u2019s Pride anthem.\u201d It\u2019s thrilling, he said, that the song that\u2019s brightened his life for so many years is now bringing other young LGBTQ people the same joy. \u201cAs someone who has been obsessing over this song for more than a decade, I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s getting all this renewed attention,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cAnd honestly, if \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 came on at a Pride event, I think the crowd would go absolutely wild.\u201d It\u2019s a campy crowd-pleaser Though \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is a rollicking crowd-pleaser, the scene in which it takes place starts out with Garland in a huff. Her character, Esther Smith, is a lovestruck teenager in Missouri, months before the 1904 World\u2019s Fair. She begins the song somberly traipsing around the trolley, wondering why her love interest has not boarded with her. When she finally spots him running to catch the caboose, the song revs up as Esther\u2019s excitement grows. \u201c\u2018Clang, clang, clang\u2019 went the trolley, \u2018ding, ding, ding\u2019 went the bell, \u2018zing, zing, zing\u2019 went my heartstrings \u2014 from the moment I saw him, I fell!\u201d she sings, wide-eyed and moony. In her \u201chigh-starch collar\u201d and periwinkle gloves, her giddiness radiates off the screen. The song\u2019s age hasn\u2019t diminished its appeal. Paige Turner, a seasoned New York-based drag queen, has been performing \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d for 10 years. Every time she steps onstage in her own \u201chigh-starch collar\u201d and costume made to look like Esther\u2019s trolley outfit, she says her audience starts \u201cscreeching\u201d with glee. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018Oh my God, is she doing \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019? Oh my God, is she coming out like that?\u2019 And it\u2019s a familiarity you want to give people\u2026\u201d Turner told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s respectable camp.\u201d \u201cThe Trolley Song\u2019s\u201d campiness lies in its hyper-stylized, theatrical, exaggerated quality that tips into fantasy. Kelleher likened it to Cher\u2019s 1998 autotune fantasia \u201cBelieve\u201d but \u201csomehow even more gay.\u201d Like Cher\u2019s hit, \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is dripping in artifice. But Garland\u2019s earnest delivery cuts through what could be considered corny to deliver a classic. \u201cWhen you take the musical theatre leanings out, \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 isn\u2019t all that different to some of the big pop songs queer people have tended to gravitate towards in more recent years,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cThe song and the clip from the film that accompanies it are instantly iconic.\u201d It\u2019s upbeat and joyful \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis\u201d was one of Garland\u2019s signature songs even before her death. Culture writer and critic Manuel Betancourt, who wrote a 33 1/3 book on the seminal live album from 1962, \u201cJudy at Carnegie Hall,\u201d said that the song received an \u201corgiastic reaction\u201d from her audience when it appeared in her opening medley. The singer Rufus Wainwright has covered \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d at least twice \u2013\u2013 once in 2007, when he covered \u201cJudy at Carnegie Hall,\u201d and again in 2022 with his live album \u201cRufus Does Judy at Capitol Studios.\u201d Both are open-hearted homages to the diva and her 1960s live performances, which were embraced by her gay fans. Earlier this month, Wainwright shared a TikTok of himself singing the song once again, eyes closed in bliss. \u201cI have had the most fun ever in my life singing that song,\u201d Wainwright told CNN in an email. \u201cOnce you get on that trolley with Judy, there is no getting off. Same with your sexuality.\u201d \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is one of Garland\u2019s \u201cbest-known, truly upbeat and celebratory numbers,\u201d Karger said, which makes it especially fitting for a month meant to honor the LGBTQ community and its hard-won victories, though the work toward equality is still in progress. With its quick tempo and spirited delivery, Turner said \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d can make her \u201cforget that the world is a crappy place sometimes.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re almost running to catch up and get on the ride with her, and we feel a part of it,\u201d she said. It\u2019s gay history Dee Michel, author of \u201cFriends of Dorothy: Why Gay Boys and Gay Men Love \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019\u201d was mystified as to why young queer people are meme-ing an 80-year-old song and praising it as a Pride anthem. He posits that the young LGBTQ community might be taking history that is not necessarily rooted in fact (such as the myth that Garland\u2019s death kickstarted the Stonewall riots or that \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d is the inspiration for the Pride flag) because they want to feel closer to their community. According to Michel, these \u201cmyths\u201d can be powerful stories that a culture uses to \u201chelp explain their place in the universe.\u201d Without a monolithic gay history lesson or a one-size-fits-all cultural landscape to guide them, queer youth may choose to believe in \u201cfolklore\u201d about the gay archives, Michel said. \u201cThere\u2019s this drive to be part of gay history and part of gay culture and feel like there\u2019s something larger than you that you\u2019re participating in,\u201d Michel told CNN. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what folklore does.\u201d Believing in Garland\u2019s influence can mean believing in something comforting. \u201cWhether (the history) was true or not, it doesn\u2019t really matter to people, because they want it to be true and it makes sense to them,\u201d Michel said. And \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d and its rapturous response at Garland\u2019s concerts, attended by supportive gay fans, are a part of her legend as a gay icon. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d has been adopted by LGBTQ people since Garland first started singing it in concert. Jim Bailey, a legendary Garland impersonator, often performed \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d dressed for adoring crowds that included the likes of Princess Diana, King Charles and Garland\u2019s daughter Liza Minnelli. It\u2019s been covered by various gay men\u2019s choruses, including those in London and Los Angeles. The song was even included in a medley on an \u201cAll Stars\u201d season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d in a challenge inspired by Garland. Though Garland rarely publicly voiced her support for LGBTQ people, queer people for decades have gravitated toward her because she\u2019s a \u201cwoman of resilience\u201d who endured abuse and tragedy throughout her life and was still a consummate artist, said Turner, the drag performer. And maybe she\u2019s still inspiring a sense of belonging among young queer people who are jamming to \u201cThe Trolley Song,\u201d whether it\u2019s their first listen or the 100th replay. \u201cIf there are young people out there \u2026 who are putting \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 out, how fantastic is that?\u201d Turner said. No matter that \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is nearly 80 years old. It\u2019s a cultural artifact that\u2019s still ripe for discovery \u2013\u2013 and a certified banger. \u201cGay people simply have great taste and to have great taste is to love Judy,\u201d Karger said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/entertainment/judy-garland-trolley-song-pride-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_entertainment_a-family-affair-review-nicole-kidman-zac-efron", "text": "The \u201cOlder woman dates younger star\u201d concept is getting a workout lately, with \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d now followed by \u201cA Family Affair,\u201d which could easily be called \u201cThe Idea of My Movie-Star Boss Sleeping With My Mom.\u201d While the Nicole Kidman-Zac Efron pairing should provoke curiosity, the tired beats of this romantic (and only occasional) comedy don\u2019t rub together well enough to generate many sparks. Part of the problem is the perspective tilts heavily toward the Kidman character\u2019s daughter, Zara (Joey King), who works as an assistant to actor Chris Cole (Efron), best known for playing a superhero called Icarus Rush. To Zara\u2019s chagrin, he\u2019s prone to stereotypical excesses, sending her on menial errands like running to a store to buy him isolated whey protein. (If you have to ask, it\u2019s not for you.) Zara has watched Chris use and dump women, threatening to quit almost as often as he talks about firing her. Their latest spat brings him to the house she shares with her mom, Kidman\u2019s Brooke, a successful and conveniently widowed author. After some mild awkwardness, Chris and Brooke wind up in bed together, leaving her, as she says, \u201cstarting to feel things again.\u201d Zara is understandably horrified by the prospect of the two hooking up, prompting her mom to offer that their age difference is a mere 16 years, not 20 (which is more accurate in reality, but never mind), so maybe just May-September in calendar terms. Directed by Richard Lagravenese \u2013 whose most pertinent credit here might be adapting the screenplay for \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d \u2013 \u201cA Family Affair\u201d suffers from the wholesale self-absorption of all concerned, which makes the notion of this as some grand romance harder to swallow. Not that the director along with writer Carrie Solomon don\u2019t try, including a dinner scene with Zara\u2019s grandma (Kathy Bates, again underemployed) that works hard at humanizing Chris beyond just Efron\u2019s \u201cIron Claw\u201d-sculpted physique. While there are a few amusing lines scattered along the way (when Brooke says she\u2019s Australian, Chris asks if she knows Margot Robbie), the comedy largely fizzles beyond the initial introductions, and the romance \u2013 after that first encounter \u2013 doesn\u2019t come across as terribly convincing. That leaves some star charisma, but not enough chemistry, to propel this across the finish line, dragging the customary Hollywood cliches \u2013 and lots of musical montages, seemingly to fill out the running time \u2013 along with it.

The Oscar-winning actor was hospitalized in April 2023 for a health crisis while he was filming the Netflix film\u201cBack in Action\u201d in Atlanta.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_a-quiet-place-day-one-review", "text": "Like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d pries opens the door to a world with a host of possibilities, some of them \u2013 including the premise of a new prequel subtitled \u201cDay One\u201d \u2013 already touched upon in the two previous movies. Set in New York, the latest film begins from a slightly unexpected premise, but then efficiently spins it to yield additional horror while giving theater-goers every reason to keep their mouths shut. The 2021 sequel actually opened with a muscular flashback sequence to that moment when the grotesque, sound-sensitive alien invaders descended upon Earth, so the new film\u2019s tag line, \u201cExperience the day the world went quiet,\u201d reflects a bit of a conceptual echo. Introducing new characters, the main wrinkle in the new prequel \u2013 and it\u2019s a questionable one at first \u2013 involves telling the story from the perspective of Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a dying woman enduring hospice care with her cat, who serves as the de facto guide to all hell breaking loose. At a time when people are dying right and left, \u201cDay One\u201d thus uses a woman already close to death as the audience\u2019s surrogate. She interacts with various people along the way, but it\u2019s a fair stretch until she encounters the most significant one, Eric (Joseph Quinn, on a genre tear with \u201cStranger Things\u201d behind him and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d to come), who doesn\u2019t want to leave her side however much she tries \u2013 quietly \u2013 to chase him away. While the Emily Blunt- and John Krasinski-anchored family\u2019s sign-language fluency gave the original movie its gateway into an original-feeling twist on minimalist horror, this third film relies heavily on Nyong\u2019o\u2019s facial reactions, and it\u2019s hard to think of an actor who can say more with an expression. Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\u201cPig\u201d), who shares story credit with original director/producer Krasinski (whose summer dance card also includes \u201cIF\u201d), the film does let viewers see more of the horrifying creatures, although their lightning-quick attacks often keeps those images brief. There\u2019s also the matter of how the invaders manage to seemingly be everywhere at once, to the point where the slightest sound on screen provokes a sense of dread. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d takes advantage of those attributes, and even finds a way to use Sam\u2019s condition, somewhat awkwardly, to consider our humanity. If there\u2019s one clunky flourish, it\u2019s been clear going back to \u201cAlien\u201d that cats and sci-fi horror don\u2019t mix, and while her feline companion provides a periodic source of unpredictable tension, it\u2019s one of those devices that probably should have been left in the litter box. Unfortunately, everything that enjoys a modicum of success these days triggers talk of its own \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is no exception. Practically speaking, \u201cDay One\u201d takes a step toward demonstrating that this perilous post-invasion world offers no shortage of streets and hallways to tiptoe down, where nobody needs to ask \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d when they are greeted with silence. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters.

The Oscar-nominated actor and comedian \u2013 whose new film, \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d hits Netflix next week, was asked in an interview with the New York Times if he feels he\u2019s received unfair treatment from the press and his peers over the years. \u201cBack in the old days, they used to be relentless on me, and a lot of it was racist stuff,\u201d Murphy said. After mentioning how it \u201cwas a whole different world\u201d when he was coming up in the 1980s, Murphy brought up an instance \u201cwhen David Spade said that s-\u2013t about my career on \u2018SNL.\u2019\u201d The segment in question, from a December 1995 episode in which Spade did a year-in-review during \u201cHollywood Minute,\u201d included a picture of Murphy on which Spade commented, \u201cLook children, it\u2019s a falling star. Make a wish.\u201d Murphy told the Times the joke came after his film, \u201cVampire in Brooklyn,\u201d had flopped at the box office. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Yo, it\u2019s in-house! I\u2019m one of the family, and you\u2019re f-\u2013king with me like that?\u2019 It hurt my feelings like that,\u201d Murphy said. He rose to stardom on \u201cSNL\u201d as part of the core cast between 1980 and 1984, and is often cited as the reason the show was at one point saved from going off the air. \u201cThe producers thought it was OK to say that. All the people that have been on that show, you\u2019ve never heard nobody make no joke about anybody\u2019s career. Most people that get off that show, they don\u2019t go on and have these amazing careers. It was personal,\u201d Murphy later added. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Yo, how could you do that?\u2019 My career? Really? A joke about my career? So I thought that was a cheap shot. And it was kind of, I thought \u2013 I felt it was racist.\u201d Spade later wrote about receiving a phone call from an upset Murphy after the bit and feeling horrible about his \u201cstupid joke.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve come to see Eddie\u2019s point on this one, \u201d Spade wrote. \u201cEverybody in showbiz wants people to like them. That\u2019s how you get fans. But when you get reamed in a sketch or online or however, that s\u2014t staaaangs. And it can add up quickly.\u201d Murphy has mostly stayed away from the long-running NBC sketch show over the years, though he appeared briefly in the \u201cSNL\u201d 40th anniversary special in 2015 and returned as a host to much fanfare in 2019. \u201cIn the long run it\u2019s all good, worked out great.

The Walt Disney Co. has often found itself cast as a reluctant participant in the culture wars, yielding occasional calls for boycotts and proclamations the company has become \u201ctoo woke.\u201d Yet the explosive box-office success of \u201cInside Out 2\u201d provides necessary perspective about a vast audience that remains hungry for Disney content, certainly enough to generate a major hit. Granted, those who regularly rail against Disney \u2013 which was drawn into a political battle with Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, beginning in 2022 over the state\u2019s so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill \u2013 have sought to rationalize the performance of the Pixar sequel, insisting its plot doesn\u2019t toe the \u201cwoke\u201d line the way something like the studio\u2019s latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d series, \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d does. Notably, a review-bombing campaign has been waged against the latter, depressing its score on the critic-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes to almost comical levels. Look a little closer, though, and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d features an effortless emphasis on values like diversity and inclusion that have helped make Disney a target. The Disney unit behind it, Pixar, also enjoyed a less-ostentatious box-office win last summer with \u201cElemental,\u201d a movie that used an allegorical relationship between characters made up of fire and water to explore bigotry, the immigrant experience, and a love story about overcoming differences. Whatever the reason \u2013 and with the sequel coming nine years after the original, pent-up demand is surely a part \u2013 there\u2019s no denying \u201cInside Out 2\u2019s\u201d results, with the movie adding $100 million at the North American box office during its second weekend \u2013 a record for an animated film \u2013 bringing its domestic total to $355 million, eclipsing \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d as the year\u2019s top movie in just 10 days of release. Worldwide, the film\u2019s haul has ballooned to nearly $725 million. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d will almost surely join the increasingly rare list of $1 billion-plus grossers since the Covid outbreak, which consists of sequels to \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cJurassic World\u201d as well as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting Disney has consciously sought to shy away from engaging in political battles, with CEO Robert Iger, who rejoined the company in that capacity in 2022, telling CNBC in November, \u201c\u201cWe have to entertain first. It\u2019s not about messages.\u201d In essence, Iger simply stated the obvious: That Disney, like any major corporation, prioritizes its profits and stock price, which means trying not to alienate potential customers, no matter how eager some of them are to be offended. Disney employees represent another constituency, which offers some context regarding why former CEO Bob Chapek finally chose, belatedly and under pressure from them, to criticize Florida. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d certainly looks like a triumph for Iger\u2019s strategy, while still conveying messages in a more subtle (and for those seeking any opportunity to pounce, less inflammatory) manner. Indeed, summer 2024 is shaping up to be a banner one for Disney, with the superhero satire \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d expected to another major attraction when the film opens in July, catering to an R-rated crowd that underscores the demographic reach of its assorted assets. That doesn\u2019t mean those who have turned Disney\u2019s Mouse ears into targets will be less inclined to rail against something like \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d distorting what the \u201cStar Wars\u201d show does and doesn\u2019t do in the process. It\u2019s a reminder, though, that plenty of people still see in the Disney name the ideal of entertainment that they can share with loved ones, and that as long as the studio fulfills that implied contract, woke or otherwise, Mickey and friends won\u2019t be going broke anytime soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/entertainment/inside-out-2-box-office-disney-critics-woke/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Stepping up in class in terms of casting, the film works best as an ode to the movies and grime of 1980s Hollywood, and a bit less as a mystery built around its driven starlet-in-waiting. That would be Goth\u2019s Maxine Minx, an adult-film actor who survived a rural massacre during a remote shoot in \u201cX,\u201d the roots of which were explored in the prequel \u201cPearl.\u201d Maxine is now in L.A. and trying to make a go of it in legit movies (\u201cActing is acting,\u201d she says confidently during her audition), even if said movie is a horror film that\u2019s provoking protests and charges of satanism outside the studio. While chasing that big break, repeating her mantra, \u201cI will not accept a life I do not deserve,\u201d Maxine also learns that somebody appears to be after her, having set a private detective (Kevin Bacon, boiling over the top) on her tail, dredging up memories of her past. That at least provides connective tissue to \u201cX,\u201d and motivations that might go beyond the title character being really, really unlucky in that way \u201cfinal girls\u201d often are. The danger also comes at a time of high alert in the city, since it\u2019s 1985, and the Night Stalker killer remains at large. Not that Maxine\u2019s porn pals seem particularly on edge as they scrape and claw, trying to meet people with the clout to advance their careers. In addition to Bacon, the supporting cast includes Halsey, Giancarlo Esposito, \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, and Bobby Cannavale and Michelle Monaghan as a pair of detectives eager to glean what Maxine knows about the crime spree surrounding her \u2013 which merely triggers her skepticism and can-do attitude, applying the same ruthless pursuit of stardom to her self-defense. Goth again turns her alter ego into a force of nature, but the film\u2019s simplest pleasures come in its evocation of the time, with songs like \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d and the hit from \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d as well as Angelyne billboards and nods to movies like \u201cDressed to Kill.\u201d Although the theatrical box office has enjoyed welcome signs of life this summer, horror has stayed a reliable staple since the pandemic began, thanks in part to the discount-bin quality of films like \u201cX\u201d and \u201cPearl,\u201d relative to aspiring blockbusters, as long as they deliver the requisite thrills. West mixes some wit in with the gore here, even if the payoff, alas, doesn\u2019t rise to the level of the buildup. By then, though, \u201cMaXXXine\u201d has delivered enough nostalgia regarding its genre to merit a walk down its alleys, and not incidentally, the showcase and sendoff that Goth\u2019s character deserves. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d premieres July 5 in US theaters.

On Wednesday, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied two motions filed by Baldwin\u2019s legal team last week alleging prosecutors had improperly handled evidence procedures in the case. In a motion filed June 24, Baldwin\u2019s team had claimed evidence regarding the firearm used in the shooting was not properly disclosed to the defense, which impacted \u201cthe way Baldwin would have prepared for trial.\u201d In a second motion filed the same day, the actor\u2019s attorneys accused prosecutors of \u201ctrial by ambush\u201d by alleging they withheld thousands of evidence files until just weeks before trial. Separately, Baldwin\u2019s team had previously asked the court to exclude the testimony from two prosecution firearms experts. However, Marlowe Sommer ruled Wednesday that she is reserving a decision on that motion until it is determined whether they will actually be called to testify in court. Marlowe Sommer has denied repeated efforts by Baldwin\u2019s team to dismiss his indictment, including a past motion claiming destruction of evidence, and a motion that sought to throw out the case because the fatal shooting of Hutchins was an accident. Jury selection in Baldwin\u2019s trial is scheduled to start next Tuesday in Santa Fe.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/entertainment/alec-baldwin-go-to-trial-next-week-rust/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far", "text": "As we hurtle headlong into summer, we\u2019re dully aware six months\u2019 worth of new content has already hit our streaming platforms and our feeds this year \u2013 and in some rare cases, even gotten us out of the house and into a movie theater. While consensus seems to be that a lot of what pop culture has brought forth thus far in 2024 has been a bit \u201cmeh,\u201d there have also been standouts, triumphs and attention-getting titles worth of celebrating. Here\u2019s our list of some the year\u2019s best performances and content so far: MOVIES Best (or, most chillingly effective) cameo - Jesse Plemons in \u2018Civil War\u2019 The Oscars \u201cconversation\u201d already includes \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star Plemons delivering a brief performance so menacing, it calls to minds the scant 24 minutes Anthony Hopkins spent on screen before clinching an Academy Award for \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d Plemons\u2019 demented \u201csoldier\u201d in a crumbled and war-torn version of the near-future US, dispensing life and death with callous disdain, more than drives home the point filmmaker Alex Garland was trying to make with his latest movie. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how \u201cCivil War\u201d star Kirsten Dunst \u2013 who is married to Plemons in real life \u2013 felt comfortable going home with him after shooting his scene. Best genre-defying comedy -\u00a0\u2018Problemista\u2019 Writer, director and actor Julio Torres is an exceptional cinematic voice who has actually been around for awhile, creating excellent content for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and series such as \u201cLos Espookys\u201d and the soon-to-be released \u201cFantasmas.\u201d \u201cProblemista,\u201d which won acclaim at several festivals in 2023, features Torres as a toy designer from El Salvador trying to find opportunities to unleash his creative vision in the US, while also figuring out a way to stay in the country. He runs into both expected roadblocks as well as ones that are frustratingly inane, like a poorly designed grant website with a broken drop-down menu that makes it impossible for anyone located outside of country to apply. With artfully realized details like that, \u201cProblemista\u201d does the remarkable job of remaining universally engaging while exploring a very specific and individual experience. Plus, Tilda Swinton turns in one of her best idiosyncratic and delightfully deranged performances opposite the gifted Torres. Best meet-cute -\u00a0\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Not since \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d has Anne Hathaway captured the zeitgeist like this, and we\u2019re here for it. In \u201cIdea,\u201d she has a run-in at Coachella with It-Boy Nicolas Galiztine (of \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d and \u201cMary & George\u201d fame) that is so silly, and so disarming, it\u2019s hard not to go along for the gender-flipped \u201cNotting Hill\u201d (plus a few age-gap years) that follows. Other reasons to watch include the music performance scenes (the fictional boy band in the film isn\u2019t so fictional in that it was essentially created for the movie and has actually released music) and Hathaway\u2019s character\u2019s positively enviable Los Angeles enclave. Best visuals\u00a0- The Harkonnens in \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 It\u2019s getting harder and harder to dazzle with a truly original vision on the silver screen, but Denis Villeneuve pulls it off in his epic sci-fi sequel, which had been drastically delayed for a variety of reasons but finally dawned in the theaters this past spring. The sequences depicting the villainous Harkonnens \u2013 mostly monochromatic and overexposed to create an off-putting yet hypnotic ambiance \u2013 simply look like nothing else, and succeed in imparting a foreboding and terrifically extraterrestrial feel. Actor Austin Butler\u2019s improvised kiss planted on his uncle Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) helps as well. Honorable mentions: Best sports-infused romance/romance-infused sports movie\u00a0- \u201cChallengers\u201d Best use of profanity -\u00a0Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley in \u201cWicked Little Letters\u201d Best music documentary\u00a0- \u201cIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\u201d Best horror film - \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d Best animated film\u00a0- \u201cOrion and the Dark\u201d TV Best production - \u2018Shogun\u2019 The series production of the year, FX\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d managed to create the second showstopping television event based on the acclaimed James Clavell novel, after the first series did way back in 1980. CNN\u2019s Brian Lowry wrote in his glowing review that the new show \u201cblends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.\u201d Best show (somewhat) inspired by real life\u00a0- \u2018Baby Reindeer\u2019 While \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is by no means an easy watch, Richard Gadd\u2019s (true to an extent, that will surely be battled over for some time) recounting of his experience with a stalker \u2013 and how a previous experience of abuse played into it \u2013 is ultimately gratifying for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Gadd\u2019s layered and vulnerable performance anchors the show, and serves as the perfect foil for the brilliant Jessica Gunning \u2013 who plays his increasingly menacing stalker Martha \u2013 to truly shine and chew scenery at the same time. Best visuals -\u00a0\u2018Ripley\u2019 In a very different way from the villainous Harkonnen family in \u201cDune\u201d \u2013 but still depicting a nefarious villain nonetheless \u2013 the black-and-white Netflix series \u201cRipley\u201d can draw you in at practically any juncture, with stunningly ornate stylistic details and seaside Italian locations that are gasp-inducing maybe partially because they lack color. You could take screenshots from almost any scene and frame them as fine art, and the show \u2013 an austere retelling of the Patricia Highsmith novel after Anthony Minghella\u2019s far more colorful (literally and figuratively) film from 1999 \u2013 has the beguiling ability to make your eyes crave its somehow comfortable, monochromatic simplicity when you\u2019re not watching it. Best sophomore season -\u00a0\u2018Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u2019 \u201cInterview\u201d has only improved on what\u2019s come before \u2013 its first season, as well as the 1994 Neil Jordan movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt \u2013 and continues to be one of the best-acted and best-written shows on TV, while also remaining the juiciest. Vamps have never been more compelling than the iterations of the Anne Rice characters depicted here. Alternating between notes that are tragic, beautiful and sometimes hilarious, it\u2019s got a bit of everything. Which means its no surprise that AMC announced a third season renewal just this week. \u2013 Scottie Andrew Best cameo -\u00a0Carrot Top on \u2018Hacks\u2019 When Mr. Top (real name Scott Thompson, who while you weren\u2019t looking has become a major fixture in Las Vegas) comes out on screen in the second episode of this well-received third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d double-takes abound as to whether that\u2019s \u201creally him.\u201d His commitment in the scene is top notch, and stick around for the post-show featurette to watch him take director notes and do great line readings. Honorable mentions go to Dierdre Hall playing herself, sort of, as Paul W. Downs\u2019 mother in the Christmas episode, along with Christopher Lloyd as her maybe-new paramour. \u201cHacks\u201d also enjoys featured guests J. Smith-Cameron from \u201cSuccession,\u201d who finally gives (great) face to Kathy \u2013 Deborah\u2019s detested and two-timing sister \u2013 and Helen Hunt as a ball-busting network exec. Honorable mentions: Best documentary portrait of a living artist -\u00a0\u201cSteve! (Martin): A documentary in two pieces\u201d Best unabashed romance series -\u00a0\u201cOne Day\u201d Best mindless guilty summer reality obsession -\u00a0\u201cSummer House\u201d Best mystery - \u201cMonsieur Spade\u201d MUSIC Best musical genre reinvention - Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 A truly monocultural moment in music, Queen Bey\u2019s landmark eighth studio album took the old \u2013 like the Beatles\u2019 \u201cBlackbird\u201d and Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene\u201d \u2013 and made it new and vital again. It shined a light on both trailblazers and up-and-coming artists that normally aren\u2019t associated with the ever-changing genre that is \u201ccountry,\u201d while betraying a very personal story from Beyonc\u00e9 herself about her own experience in the music world as an artist of color. Best album that\u2019s definitely not for everyone - Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018Only God Was Above Us\u2019 There are few immediately hummable songs on the new record that call to mind \u201cHarmony Hall\u201d off of their last album in 2019, and the instrumentation is rich and complex and strangely captivating, like the band wanted to stuff as many distinctive sounds into each song as they could. And their trademark clever wordplay is very much on display in songs like \u201cGen-X Cops.\u201d \u2013 Brandon Griggs Best breakout - Chappell Roan While her debut album \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d was released late last year, Roan has been steadily gaining attention ever since \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 with viral performances at Coachella, the Governors Ball and Bonnaroo, along with a wonderful (and also very viral) set on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series in March. With a queer-centric performance style that is very drag-inspired, her latest single \u201cGood Luck Babe!\u201d epitomizes her fiercely independent, raw and authentic vibe. Plus, rock legend Elton John has already given his seal of approval. We\u2019re so in.  \u2013 Scottie Andrew and Alli Rosenbloom BOOKS \u2018Margo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u2019 by Rufi Thorpe Soon to be a TV series starring Elle Fanning, this novel \u2013 following a young, single, new mother with no job who joins OnlyFans and begins creating sexual content to stay afloat \u2013 toys with our perceptions of power and morality. What does it mean to be a good person, and who gets to decide? Over the course of the book, readers see Margo desperately trying to survive her situation, contending with the difficult \u2013 and sometimes unconventional \u2013 choices she makes in order to do so. \u2013 Leah Asmelash \u2018Sociopath: A Memoir\u2019 by Patric Gagne The release of \u201cRipley\u201d in April coincided with the arrival of the memoir\u00a0\u201cSociopath,\u201d\u00a0which offers a quite different case for demythologizing what it means to be a sociopath. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who\u2019s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and\u00a0argues that\u00a0the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed. \u2013 Sara Stewart PODCAST Best and most hilarious podcast about nothing in particular - \u2018The Bald and the Beautiful\u2019 The beloved queens from \u201cDrag Race\u201d Trixie and Katya blather on about nothing, and it\u2019s just everything. Their conversations get extremely raunchy and graphic, so be warned, but there are few funnier people on the planet than these two drag legends. \u2013 Scottie Andrew", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_entertainment_despicable-me-4-review-steve-carell", "text": "There\u2019s no mystery why they keep making \u201cDespicable Me\u201d movies \u2013 the last sequel, in 2017, raked in more than $1 billion worldwide \u2013 but why folks continue watching should be tested by the fourth edition (not including the \u201cMinions\u201d offshoots). A tired, disjointed medley of madcap visual gags, the animated film yields roughly as many legitimate laughs as can be counted on a Minion\u2019s three-digit hand. Babies remain the last vestige of scoundrels in sequel terms, so naturally the movie introduces a son to Gru (voiced as usual by Steve Carell) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig) who, semi-amusingly, can\u2019t stand his dad, screaming or acting up in some other way every time Gru picks him up. Gru remains in the do-gooder business, which begins with him tracking down a villain (and former villain-school classmate) named Maxime (Will Ferrell), who can turn into a kind of cockroach, which is every bit as appetizing as that sounds. The French-accented Maxime quickly escapes prison, forcing Gru and his brood to take refuge at a safe house under assumed identities. From there, \u201cDespicable Me\u201d does little more than kill time while family members try adjusting to their new surroundings, including Gru\u2019s dealings with a snotty neighbor voiced by Carell\u2019s chum Stephen Colbert, providing a sort-of animated reunion for \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and \u201cThe Ambiguously Gay Duo\u201d alumni. Despite the long lapse since \u201cMe 3,\u201d the film features lots of the obligatory Three Stooges-style gags involving the Minions, and the occasional excrement joke for the kids. The most promising wrinkle actually goes nowhere, with an enhanced quintet of Mega-Minions blessed with Fantastic Four-ish powers, an idea put to no real purpose. Whatever novelty existed when the franchise made its debut 14 years ago, the creative returns have diminished with each incarnation, if not the financial incentives. Although the success of \u201cInside Out 2\u201d speaks to a healthy appetite for animated sequels, the comparison between the two in their ambitions borders on night and day. One of the aforementioned laughs happens when the Minions change a diaper, carrying out the task with remarkable precision before launching the soiled item into the distance. After sitting through 90-some-odd minutes of \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d that process provides a handy metaphor for the disposable nature of the movie, leaving Universal and Illumination Studios to hope the memory has faded before they unleash another helping of this warmed-over Gru-el. \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d premieres July 3 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/entertainment/despicable-me-4-review-steve-carell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

As we ascend into Episode 3, we are graced with a revelatory reunion of our two star queens, some wisdom from the Queen Who Never Was and a bonus cameo from Milly Alcock \u2013 who briefly returns to reprise her Season 1 role as young Rhaenyra in one of Daemon\u2019s (Matt Smith) creepy visions. In the aftermath of the Cargyll assassination plot, Rhaenys (Eve Best) offers counsel to Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy). She\u2019s suspicious that hotter heads prevail on Team Green because Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) wouldn\u2019t have allowed the assassination attempt to be carried out. Rhaenys also tells Rhaenyra she thinks that Alicent (Olivia Cooke) would probably rather not go to war either and encourages her to meet with Alicent in person, as a last-ditch effort to avert a\u00a0war before\u00a0any blood is shed. Rhaenyra takes her advice and consults with Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno) \u2013 who now has a place on her court as a reward for saving her life \u2013 on Alicent\u2019s movements. \u201cIf war can be averted, it is my duty to avert it,\u201d Rhaenyra tells her. In disguise, Rhaenyra sneaks into King\u2019s Landing on a fishing boat and finds Alicent alone in the Sept. Rhaenyra tells a stunned Alicent that she\u2019s not surrendering, she\u2019s there because she just wants to \u201cuncover some path towards peace.\u201d They exchange words (and maybe some veiled remorse) about their houses killing each other\u2019s kin before Rhaenyra reminds Alicent that she\u2019s still usurping her rightful inheritance. Rhaenyra is steadfast that her father King Viserys reaffirmed she was to be his heir the night he died, but Alicent is still convinced that he \u201cchanged his mind\u201d in favor of King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) in his final breath. Alicent tells Rhaenyra the details of that conversation with King Viserys, which is what sparked this whole conflict in the first place, saying that Viserys was \u201cweary and hard to understand\u201d but spoke of her son as \u201cthe prince that was promised to unite the realm.\u201d This is a ding-ding-ding moment for Rhaenyra. Immediately she realizes that, in his near-death delirium, her late father spoke of the super-secretive Song of Ice and Fire. Rhaenyra tries to explain that he was referencing Aegon the Conqueror, not Alicent\u2019s now-King Aegon. \u201cThere\u2019s been a mistake,\u201d Rhaenyra urgently tells Alicent, pleading with her to help prevent the \u201cterrible war\u201d that\u2019s coming. But it\u2019s no use. \u201cIt\u2019s too late, Rhaenyra,\u201d Alicent says. Elsewhere in Westeros Rhaenys was the real winner of this episode, imbuing her wisdom upon Rhaenyra in a very mother-knows-best way, and we\u2019re here for it. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d airs Sunday nights on Max, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.

Once outfitted and incognito, he went to The Grove \u2013 one of the most visited and populous commercial centers in Los Angeles \u2013 and was thrilled to discover that \u201cnobody recognized\u201d him.

{"id": "2024_06_26_entertainment_marilyn-monroe-home-saved-from-demolition", "text": "The Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted on Wednesday to preserve Marilyn Monroe\u2019s Brentwood home, where the star lived and died, as a Historic-Cultural Monument, saving it from demolition. The vote ends a nearly year-long saga and effort to save the home from destruction. Last summer, the city\u2019s Department of Building and Safety issued a demolition permit for the home. The city council then unanimously approved\u00a0Councilwoman Traci\u00a0Park\u2019s emergency motion to block demolition and begin the process of designating the house as a historic building, CNN previously reported. Park represents the district where the house is located. This week\u2019s preservation vote was the final step in the process for designation, the city\u2019s planning department\u00a0told\u00a0CNN. The home\u2019s owners sued the city over the matter in May, claiming \u201cabuse of power.\u201d A motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the city council\u2019s vote to preserve the home was denied by a judge earlier this month, but the case remains ongoing and should be set for trial later this fall, according to Peter C. Sheridan of Glaser Weil Fink Howard Jordan & Shapiro LLP, an attorney representing the owners. During a speech in front of the council before the vote Wednesday, Park urged her colleagues to preserve the LA landmark. She referred to the home, like Monroe, as \u201ciconic.\u201d \u201cThere is likely no woman in history or culture who captures the imagination of the public the way Marilyn Monroe did. Even all these years later, her story still resonates and inspires many of us today,\u201d she said. \u201cTo lose this piece of history, the only home Marilyn Monroe ever owned, would be a devastating blow for historic preservation, and for a city where less than 3% of historic designations are associated with women\u2019s heritage.\u201d Park said that she did not take the matter lightly and that she has been in communication with nearby residents about their concerns over traffic and safety. She introduced another motion Wednesday to evaluate tour bus restrictions on the street and surrounding areas, she said. \u201cMy team and I have worked closely with the property owners to assess potentially moving the home to a place where the public might actually be able to visit and spend time,\u201d she said. \u201cI remain hopeful and committed to work with the property owners to see if this can be done in the future, but today, let\u2019s preserve this essential piece of LA\u2019s history and culture.\u201d Sheridan said in a statement that neither Park \u201cnor her staff have worked closely with the owners, throughout this process or anytime else, to relocate the house to allow for public access.\u201d \u201cIn fact, the opposite is true,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cMs. Park has ignored the fact that her constituents \u2013 civic and homeowner\u2019s groups in the community \u2013 are adamantly against the designation of the home. Ms. Park has also ignored that the City granted dozens of permits to over 14 different prior owners to change the home through numerous remodels, resulting in there being nothing left reflecting Ms. Monroe\u2019s brief time there 60 years ago.\u201d With the ongoing lawsuit, the homeowners are hoping that the court declares the entire process to save the home from demolition illegal, and directs the city to withdraw its designation, Sheridan said. The Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving historic places in the city, called Wednesday\u2019s vote a \u201csuccess.\u201d \u201cThis designation is proof that community advocacy WORKS,\u201d the organization said in an\u00a0Instagram post, thanking Park for her efforts. The Brentwood bungalow was built in 1929 and is valued at about $8 million, according to property records. Monroe lived there for just months before she died in 1962 at the age of 36, Park said. The pop culture icon died at the home after overdosing on barbiturates.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/entertainment/marilyn-monroe-home-saved-from-demolition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The prolific rapper dropped his \u201cNot Like Us\u201d music video on July 4 and it included some very important people to him. The song is part of what has become a very public feud between Lamar and Drake. Not only is there a scene featuring his fianc\u00e9e Whitney Alford and their two young children, but Lamar is also seen surrounded by a crowd of his fans who can be heard rapping along with him on his hit. Directed by the rapper along with Dave Free, it features cameos from several celebs associated with the West Coast, which is beloved by Lamar, a Compton native. They include NBA player DeMar DeRozan, who is also from Compton, and Tommy the Clown, known as the inventor of the krumping style of dance associated with the left coast. In the music video, Lamar offers multiple visual nods to Drake and his career including owls, which is the bird Drake uses for his OVO label. The video has been eagerly awaited especially by those who have followed the recent, fast and furious rap battle between Lamar and Drake. Both rappers, who are former collaborators, released multiple diss tracks, with \u201cNot Like Us\u201d becoming the most successful. Early on in the video, Lamar is seen doing push ups. Many believe it\u2019s a reference to Drake\u2019s single \u201cPush Ups,\u201d which was a response to Lamar\u2019s diss of him on the single, \u201cLike That,\u201d by Metro Boomin and Future. Even including his longtime love, Alford, and their children appears to be a nod to Drake\u2019s song, \u201cFamily Matters,\u201d in which Drake implied that Alford had cheated on Lamar. In his music video, Lamar and his family dance joyously and seemingly unbothered. \u201cNot Like Us\u201d debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 when it was released in May, according to Billboard and has been declared the \u201csong of the summer\u201d by many. Last month, Lamar performed the song five times at \u201cThe Pop Out: Ken & Friends\u201d show, a Juneteenth concert that was livestreamed on Twitch by Amazon Music.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/entertainment/kendrick-lamar-not-like-us-video/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_beverly-hills-cop-axel-f-review-eddie-murphy", "text": "\u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d spawned a trio of movies, but more significantly, the 1984 film capped off a string of hits (after \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d and \u201cTrading Places\u201d) that launched Eddie Murphy into the movie-star stratosphere. As Murphy moves into the encores-for-streaming phase of his career (see \u201cComing 2 America\u201d), enter \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\u201d which features enough unapologetic nostalgia (cue the music) to power through its flat spots. The fact that the film is premiering via Netflix, as opposed to theaters, might warrant some second-guessing given the box-office numbers that the latest \u201cBad Boys\u201d sequel has delivered, but that\u2019s a debate for another day. From the get-go, the star appears up to the task as he slides back into a role to which he said goodbye 30 years ago, and introduced a decade before that. As with \u201cComing 2 America,\u201d \u201cAlex F\u201d uses a next-generation hook to get into the story and create the excuse to bring Murphy\u2019s Axel Foley from Detroit (after an introductory action sequence that goes on a bit too long) back to Beverly Hills, reuniting him with lots of familiar faces. In this case, he\u2019s summoned by Billy (Judge Reinhold) to help Axel\u2019s estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige, who followed \u201cHit the Floor\u201d with \u201cZola\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d), a lawyer representing a client who has triggered a warning to back off from some very bad people. Before you can say \u201cGet the f\u2014k outta here\u201d (which is, not surprisingly, said several times), Axel lands in L.A., cheerfully insisting, \u201cThey love me in Beverly Hills!\u201d Staying on brand, he quickly irks the local authorities as he sets about protecting Jane, while running afoul of a corrupt detective played by Kevin Bacon (one of two movies in which he appears this week, the other being \u201cMaXXXine\u201d). Axel also gets teamed up with a younger cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has some history with Jane, although frankly \u2013 other than \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s hilarious cameo as a Beverly Hills realtor \u2013 the newcomers don\u2019t stand much of a chance to register as holdovers like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and John Ashton join Reinhold in dropping by. In perhaps the wisest (and easiest) decision, first-time feature director Mark Molloy relies heavily on music associated with the original movies, from Harold Faltermeyer\u2019s electronic score to songs like \u201cThe Heat is On\u201d and \u201cNeutron Dance,\u201d augmented by a new one from Lil Nas X. In the early going, a younger colleague in Detroit points out that Axel continues to hit the streets at a time when \u201cguys your age\u201d are transitioning to desk jobs, which basically spells out the formulation here, and how Murphy effectively carries off the same mentality as his alter ego. \u201cAxel F\u201d only turns up the heat to a low simmer, but as breezy escapism goes, those armed with the proper attitude might find themselves doing the neutron dance, or a version of it, all over again. \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/entertainment/beverly-hills-cop-axel-f-review-eddie-murphy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
