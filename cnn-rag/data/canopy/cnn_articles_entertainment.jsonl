{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far", "text": "As we hurtle headlong into summer, we\u2019re dully aware six months\u2019 worth of new content has already hit our streaming platforms and our feeds this year \u2013 and in some rare cases, even gotten us out of the house and into a movie theater. While consensus seems to be that a lot of what pop culture has brought forth thus far in 2024 has been a bit \u201cmeh,\u201d there have also been standouts, triumphs and attention-getting titles worth of celebrating. Here\u2019s our list of some the year\u2019s best performances and content so far: MOVIES Best (or, most chillingly effective) cameo - Jesse Plemons in \u2018Civil War\u2019 The Oscars \u201cconversation\u201d already includes \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star Plemons delivering a brief performance so menacing, it calls to minds the scant 24 minutes Anthony Hopkins spent on screen before clinching an Academy Award for \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d Plemons\u2019 demented \u201csoldier\u201d in a crumbled and war-torn version of the near-future US, dispensing life and death with callous disdain, more than drives home the point filmmaker Alex Garland was trying to make with his latest movie. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how \u201cCivil War\u201d star Kirsten Dunst \u2013 who is married to Plemons in real life \u2013 felt comfortable going home with him after shooting his scene. Best genre-defying comedy -\u00a0\u2018Problemista\u2019 Writer, director and actor Julio Torres is an exceptional cinematic voice who has actually been around for awhile, creating excellent content for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and series such as \u201cLos Espookys\u201d and the soon-to-be released \u201cFantasmas.\u201d \u201cProblemista,\u201d which won acclaim at several festivals in 2023, features Torres as a toy designer from El Salvador trying to find opportunities to unleash his creative vision in the US, while also figuring out a way to stay in the country. He runs into both expected roadblocks as well as ones that are frustratingly inane, like a poorly designed grant website with a broken drop-down menu that makes it impossible for anyone located outside of country to apply. With artfully realized details like that, \u201cProblemista\u201d does the remarkable job of remaining universally engaging while exploring a very specific and individual experience. Plus, Tilda Swinton turns in one of her best idiosyncratic and delightfully deranged performances opposite the gifted Torres. Best meet-cute -\u00a0\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Not since \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d has Anne Hathaway captured the zeitgeist like this, and we\u2019re here for it. In \u201cIdea,\u201d she has a run-in at Coachella with It-Boy Nicolas Galiztine (of \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d and \u201cMary & George\u201d fame) that is so silly, and so disarming, it\u2019s hard not to go along for the gender-flipped \u201cNotting Hill\u201d (plus a few age-gap years) that follows. Other reasons to watch include the music performance scenes (the fictional boy band in the film isn\u2019t so fictional in that it was essentially created for the movie and has actually released music) and Hathaway\u2019s character\u2019s positively enviable Los Angeles enclave. Best visuals\u00a0- The Harkonnens in \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 It\u2019s getting harder and harder to dazzle with a truly original vision on the silver screen, but Denis Villeneuve pulls it off in his epic sci-fi sequel, which had been drastically delayed for a variety of reasons but finally dawned in the theaters this past spring. The sequences depicting the villainous Harkonnens \u2013 mostly monochromatic and overexposed to create an off-putting yet hypnotic ambiance \u2013 simply look like nothing else, and succeed in imparting a foreboding and terrifically extraterrestrial feel. Actor Austin Butler\u2019s improvised kiss planted on his uncle Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) helps as well. Honorable mentions: Best sports-infused romance/romance-infused sports movie\u00a0- \u201cChallengers\u201d Best use of profanity -\u00a0Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley in \u201cWicked Little Letters\u201d Best music documentary\u00a0- \u201cIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\u201d Best horror film - \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d Best animated film\u00a0- \u201cOrion and the Dark\u201d TV Best production - \u2018Shogun\u2019 The series production of the year, FX\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d managed to create the second showstopping television event based on the acclaimed James Clavell novel, after the first series did way back in 1980. CNN\u2019s Brian Lowry wrote in his glowing review that the new show \u201cblends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.\u201d Best show (somewhat) inspired by real life\u00a0- \u2018Baby Reindeer\u2019 While \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is by no means an easy watch, Richard Gadd\u2019s (true to an extent, that will surely be battled over for some time) recounting of his experience with a stalker \u2013 and how a previous experience of abuse played into it \u2013 is ultimately gratifying for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Gadd\u2019s layered and vulnerable performance anchors the show, and serves as the perfect foil for the brilliant Jessica Gunning \u2013 who plays his increasingly menacing stalker Martha \u2013 to truly shine and chew scenery at the same time. Best visuals -\u00a0\u2018Ripley\u2019 In a very different way from the villainous Harkonnen family in \u201cDune\u201d \u2013 but still depicting a nefarious villain nonetheless \u2013 the black-and-white Netflix series \u201cRipley\u201d can draw you in at practically any juncture, with stunningly ornate stylistic details and seaside Italian locations that are gasp-inducing maybe partially because they lack color. You could take screenshots from almost any scene and frame them as fine art, and the show \u2013 an austere retelling of the Patricia Highsmith novel after Anthony Minghella\u2019s far more colorful (literally and figuratively) film from 1999 \u2013 has the beguiling ability to make your eyes crave its somehow comfortable, monochromatic simplicity when you\u2019re not watching it. Best sophomore season -\u00a0\u2018Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u2019 \u201cInterview\u201d has only improved on what\u2019s come before \u2013 its first season, as well as the 1994 Neil Jordan movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt \u2013 and continues to be one of the best-acted and best-written shows on TV, while also remaining the juiciest. Vamps have never been more compelling than the iterations of the Anne Rice characters depicted here. Alternating between notes that are tragic, beautiful and sometimes hilarious, it\u2019s got a bit of everything. Which means its no surprise that AMC announced a third season renewal just this week. \u2013 Scottie Andrew Best cameo -\u00a0Carrot Top on \u2018Hacks\u2019 When Mr. Top (real name Scott Thompson, who while you weren\u2019t looking has become a major fixture in Las Vegas) comes out on screen in the second episode of this well-received third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d double-takes abound as to whether that\u2019s \u201creally him.\u201d His commitment in the scene is top notch, and stick around for the post-show featurette to watch him take director notes and do great line readings. Honorable mentions go to Dierdre Hall playing herself, sort of, as Paul W. Downs\u2019 mother in the Christmas episode, along with Christopher Lloyd as her maybe-new paramour. \u201cHacks\u201d also enjoys featured guests J. Smith-Cameron from \u201cSuccession,\u201d who finally gives (great) face to Kathy \u2013 Deborah\u2019s detested and two-timing sister \u2013 and Helen Hunt as a ball-busting network exec. Honorable mentions: Best documentary portrait of a living artist -\u00a0\u201cSteve! (Martin): A documentary in two pieces\u201d Best unabashed romance series -\u00a0\u201cOne Day\u201d Best mindless guilty summer reality obsession -\u00a0\u201cSummer House\u201d Best mystery - \u201cMonsieur Spade\u201d MUSIC Best musical genre reinvention - Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 A truly monocultural moment in music, Queen Bey\u2019s landmark eighth studio album took the old \u2013 like the Beatles\u2019 \u201cBlackbird\u201d and Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene\u201d \u2013 and made it new and vital again. It shined a light on both trailblazers and up-and-coming artists that normally aren\u2019t associated with the ever-changing genre that is \u201ccountry,\u201d while betraying a very personal story from Beyonc\u00e9 herself about her own experience in the music world as an artist of color. Best album that\u2019s definitely not for everyone - Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018Only God Was Above Us\u2019 There are few immediately hummable songs on the new record that call to mind \u201cHarmony Hall\u201d off of their last album in 2019, and the instrumentation is rich and complex and strangely captivating, like the band wanted to stuff as many distinctive sounds into each song as they could. And their trademark clever wordplay is very much on display in songs like \u201cGen-X Cops.\u201d \u2013 Brandon Griggs Best breakout - Chappell Roan While her debut album \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d was released late last year, Roan has been steadily gaining attention ever since \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 with viral performances at Coachella, the Governors Ball and Bonnaroo, along with a wonderful (and also very viral) set on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series in March. With a queer-centric performance style that is very drag-inspired, her latest single \u201cGood Luck Babe!\u201d epitomizes her fiercely independent, raw and authentic vibe. Plus, rock legend Elton John has already given his seal of approval. We\u2019re so in.  \u2013 Scottie Andrew and Alli Rosenbloom BOOKS \u2018Margo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u2019 by Rufi Thorpe Soon to be a TV series starring Elle Fanning, this novel \u2013 following a young, single, new mother with no job who joins OnlyFans and begins creating sexual content to stay afloat \u2013 toys with our perceptions of power and morality. What does it mean to be a good person, and who gets to decide? Over the course of the book, readers see Margo desperately trying to survive her situation, contending with the difficult \u2013 and sometimes unconventional \u2013 choices she makes in order to do so. \u2013 Leah Asmelash \u2018Sociopath: A Memoir\u2019 by Patric Gagne The release of \u201cRipley\u201d in April coincided with the arrival of the memoir\u00a0\u201cSociopath,\u201d\u00a0which offers a quite different case for demythologizing what it means to be a sociopath. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who\u2019s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and\u00a0argues that\u00a0the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed. \u2013 Sara Stewart PODCAST Best and most hilarious podcast about nothing in particular - \u2018The Bald and the Beautiful\u2019 The beloved queens from \u201cDrag Race\u201d Trixie and Katya blather on about nothing, and it\u2019s just everything. Their conversations get extremely raunchy and graphic, so be warned, but there are few funnier people on the planet than these two drag legends. \u2013 Scottie Andrew", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_entertainment_jerry-ferrara-entourage-20th-anniversary", "text": "There are plenty of actors who want more than anything to leave the characters that made them famous behind, but Jerry Ferrara is not one of them. Twenty years after the debut of \u201cEntourage,\u201d the man who played Salvatore \u201cTurtle\u201d Assante smiles as he talks to CNN about where he thinks his character \u2013 who ended the series becoming pretty successful \u2013 might be today. \u201cEven though Turtle ended up being rich, I still think he\u2019s driving Vince around in the Escalade,\u201d Ferrara said. \u201cLike, that\u2019s just who they were. It wasn\u2019t so much, \u2018Well, now I have money, I don\u2019t have to drive you.\u2019 Those guys were family.\u201d A beloved family at that. HBO aired the first episode of \u201cEntourage\u201d on July 18, 2004, and the story of up-and-coming actor Vincent Chase \u2013 played by Adrian Grenier \u2013 navigating new stardom in Los Angeles with the help of his crew of buddies from his native New York felt very meta, given that it shot the cast into the celebrity stratosphere. The core cast of \u201cEntourage\u201d \u2013 Grenier, Ferrara, Kevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon and Jeremy Piven \u2013 became part of a golden age that helped make HBO (which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company) a powerhouse network, with critically acclaimed series including \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d \u201cDeadwood\u201d and \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cEntourage\u201d was loosely based on the life and career of rapper-turned-actor Mark Wahlberg, who served as one of the show\u2019s executive producers. Ferrara became beloved as Turtle, who in addition to being a childhood friend of Vincent, also served as his assistant and driver. That entailed Ferrara driving the crew around in an Escalade, which soon became almost synonymous with the show. The New York native said that while he had a driver\u2019s license when he landed the role on the show, \u201cI came from New York where you don\u2019t really need a car.\u201d Having to drive almost every episode initially helped to make Ferrara a better driver, as well as a fan of the Escalade. So it made sense that when Cadillac unveiled their 2025 refreshed model of the popular SUV, they would partner with Ferrara to spread the news. \u201cTwenty years goes by and you never know what things are going to stick, but that car, the Escalade was iconic. I always say it was like another character on the show, almost like another location,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had so many scenes where it\u2019s the four of us talking about whatever was happening in that episode and it was in the Escalade. The Escalade and Arnold the Dog are the two things that kind of transcended the show and have their own place in the \u2018Entourage\u2019 lore.\u201d For Ferrara, the show not only launched his career, but it also gave him lifelong friends because he says the brotherhood viewers saw among the cast absolutely transcended into real life. The actor is grateful for both the love people have for Turtle as well as how the character launched his career. These days, he\u2019s a busy young father of two young children who he\u2019s raising in his wife\u2019s hometown of Cleveland. But he hasn\u2019t left Hollywood behind, and still lands popular roles including playing attorney Joseph \u201cJoe\u201d Proctor on the hit Starz drama \u201cPower.\u201d As for \u201cEntourage\u201d \u2013 which ended after eight seasons in 2011, but had a movie in 2015 \u2013 Ferrara said he wouldn\u2019t shut the door on a possible reboot. \u201cI always said, \u2018Nah I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll happen,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned to never say never to anything because just when you do that, that\u2019s when the thing happens.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/entertainment/jerry-ferrara-entourage-20th-anniversary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_entertainment_carol-burnett-bob-newhart-tributes", "text": "One comedy giant saluted another this week after the passing of Bob Newhart, who died Thursday morning at the age of 94. Carol Burnett tweeted a fond farewell to the late star later on Thursday, sharing a black-and-white photo of the pair on a set in 1964. \u201cI had the great pleasure of working with Bob and being his friend,\u201d Burnett wrote in the caption. \u201cHe was as kind and nice as he was funny. He will be missed.\u201d Tributes poured in from many other collaborators and friends of Newhart, including \u201cElf\u201d director Jon Favreau. \u201cBob Newhart was a comedy icon.\u00a0His deadpan delivery was so infectious both on and off screen. I am grateful to have known him and will always treasure our collaboration,\u201d Favreau said in a statement shared with CNN on Friday. Several castmates from \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d also shared memories. Alongside a carousel of photos of the pair, Johnny Galecki wrote on his Instagram, \u201cIn one of his last emails to me, Bob requested that I stop telling people he\u2019s a \u2018nice guy.\u2019 Though I hate to disobey a hero, I must share that Bob was a wonderful man and I cherished my time with him.\u201d \u201cSafe passage, my friend,\u201d he added.

He was effortlessly professional, poised, hilarious and incredibly approachable. Working with Bob was working in the presence of a true comedy legend \u2013 the likes of whom we simply don\u2019t see anymore.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_a-quiet-place-day-one-review", "text": "Like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d pries opens the door to a world with a host of possibilities, some of them \u2013 including the premise of a new prequel subtitled \u201cDay One\u201d \u2013 already touched upon in the two previous movies. Set in New York, the latest film begins from a slightly unexpected premise, but then efficiently spins it to yield additional horror while giving theater-goers every reason to keep their mouths shut. The 2021 sequel actually opened with a muscular flashback sequence to that moment when the grotesque, sound-sensitive alien invaders descended upon Earth, so the new film\u2019s tag line, \u201cExperience the day the world went quiet,\u201d reflects a bit of a conceptual echo. Introducing new characters, the main wrinkle in the new prequel \u2013 and it\u2019s a questionable one at first \u2013 involves telling the story from the perspective of Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a dying woman enduring hospice care with her cat, who serves as the de facto guide to all hell breaking loose. At a time when people are dying right and left, \u201cDay One\u201d thus uses a woman already close to death as the audience\u2019s surrogate. She interacts with various people along the way, but it\u2019s a fair stretch until she encounters the most significant one, Eric (Joseph Quinn, on a genre tear with \u201cStranger Things\u201d behind him and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d to come), who doesn\u2019t want to leave her side however much she tries \u2013 quietly \u2013 to chase him away. While the Emily Blunt- and John Krasinski-anchored family\u2019s sign-language fluency gave the original movie its gateway into an original-feeling twist on minimalist horror, this third film relies heavily on Nyong\u2019o\u2019s facial reactions, and it\u2019s hard to think of an actor who can say more with an expression. Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\u201cPig\u201d), who shares story credit with original director/producer Krasinski (whose summer dance card also includes \u201cIF\u201d), the film does let viewers see more of the horrifying creatures, although their lightning-quick attacks often keeps those images brief. There\u2019s also the matter of how the invaders manage to seemingly be everywhere at once, to the point where the slightest sound on screen provokes a sense of dread. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d takes advantage of those attributes, and even finds a way to use Sam\u2019s condition, somewhat awkwardly, to consider our humanity. If there\u2019s one clunky flourish, it\u2019s been clear going back to \u201cAlien\u201d that cats and sci-fi horror don\u2019t mix, and while her feline companion provides a periodic source of unpredictable tension, it\u2019s one of those devices that probably should have been left in the litter box. Unfortunately, everything that enjoys a modicum of success these days triggers talk of its own \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is no exception. Practically speaking, \u201cDay One\u201d takes a step toward demonstrating that this perilous post-invasion world offers no shortage of streets and hallways to tiptoe down, where nobody needs to ask \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d when they are greeted with silence. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/a-quiet-place-day-one-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec", "text": "This year, two disparate, big-budget films will share a release date: One, an R-rated historical epic stacked with a starry cast of Oscar hopefuls. The other, a musical based on a beloved property with plenty of pink and a Billboard-friendly soundtrack. Sound familiar? With \u201cGladiator II\u201d and the first part of \u201cWicked\u201d sharing a release date, days before Thanksgiving, movie theaters are nearing their truest chance at another \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d a viral phenomenon that in 2023 drove audiences to the movie theater by the millions, leaving a massive mark in pop culture and at the box office. But what will we call it? \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal thinks \u201cGlicked\u201d (pronounced glick-id) is the portmanteau that suits the prospective double feature best. \u201c\u2019Wickiator\u2019 doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue, does it?\u201d he said in a new interview with Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI think the films couldn\u2019t be more polar opposite and kind of worked in that context previously, so fingers crossed people come out and see both films on opening weekend.\u201d But maybe we moviegoers (and Mescal) are getting ahead of ourselves. Tom Nunan, a lecturer at UCLA\u2019s School of Theater, Film and TV and the founder of the production company Bull\u2019s Eye Entertainment, isn\u2019t fully sold on \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d 2.0. Both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d were major films with astronomical hype from respected auteurs, but even the studios couldn\u2019t have predicted that audiences would make both films appointment viewing over the same weekend, he said. (\u201cBarbie\u201d was produced by Warner Bros., which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.) \u201cIt\u2019s good when studios release big titles simultaneously,\u201d Nunan told CNN. \u201cI do think that they feed off of each other \u2013\u2013\u00a0that level of excitement. I think all of those things work in both of these films\u2019 favor. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the lightning in a bottle that \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was.\u201d Stranger things have happened, though \u2013\u2013 plus, there\u2019s a \u201cStranger Things\u201d actor in the \u201cGladiator\u201d sequel, which might attract some younger audiences. But if \u201cGlicked\u201d wants to achieve \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d heights of success, the films have a few more hurdles to clear than the Oscar-winning hits of last summer. \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 and \u2018Wicked\u2019 need a fun portmanteau First things first \u2013\u2013\u00a0\u201dBarbenheimer\u201d had a killer portmanteau. If the studios behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d want to emulate the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, they might want to turn to the movie lovers who helped coin the term that turned last year\u2019s summer flicks into a double feature. The Columbia Journalism Review credits awards pundit Matt Neglia with using \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d first in April 2023, but it quickly spread across the internet wherever movie fans lurked. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d wasn\u2019t clunky, and there was never any question which films \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d referred to \u2014\u00a0the same cannot be said just yet of \u201cGlicked,\u201d \u201cWickiator\u201d or the even uglier \u201cGladicked.\u201d It should be noted that after the smashing success of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer, no release weekends have seen the same double-feature draw, though musings of \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d and \u201cGarfuriosa\u201d pairings did make the rounds online. Those were more jokes about how two seemingly incompatible films could reach the same audiences than genuine attempts at creating a viral trend \u2014\u00a0in no world does the \u00fcber-graphic \u201cSaw X\u201d pair well with the kid-friendly \u201cPaw Patrol: The Mighty Movie.\u201d For now, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d simply haven\u2019t dominated the cultural conversation yet in the same way \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d did. But there\u2019s still time \u2014\u00a0they don\u2019t hit theaters until November 22. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019s\u2019 appeal was mystery Part of the appeal of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was wanting to see it as soon as possible to join the cultural conversation about two of the biggest movies of the year. It helped that we knew so little about both films before their premieres, Nunan said. Aside from a few paparazzi shots of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling rollerblading through Venice Beach, we knew virtually nothing about \u201cBarbie\u201d before it came out. And \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d while based in history, was still a Christopher Nolan film, so its marketing was mostly mysterious and teased major moments without revealing too much of its majesty. But both films had been hyped for over a year before their releases, thanks to marketing that kept much of the secrets of both films but offered fans just enough to keep them excited. A well-timed trailer here and a smart social campaign there \u2013\u2013\u00a0like those \u201cBarbie\u201d headshots with the quippy captions or the ominous live countdown clocks used on billboards and in trailers for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013\u2013\u00a0only made fans more ravenous ahead of the release date, Nunan said. There\u2019s less mystery with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II.\u201d The former is one of the most popular musicals of the century and the fourth-longest running on Broadway \u2013\u2013\u00a0millions have already seen it onstage or read the novel upon which it\u2019s based, so there are fewer surprises in store for audiences, Nunan said. And though \u201cGladiator\u201d won best picture among other Oscars, it came out 24 years ago. \u201cNeither of these franchises are fresh to the audience,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cThey\u2019re both known entities versus the unlimited potential of \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019\u201d Familiarity and continuations of franchises decades later can work \u2014\u00a0\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d was the first huge success since Covid-19 kneecapped movie theaters and spoke to viewers beyond those who\u2019d seen the original \u201cTop Gun\u201d back in 1986, Nunan said. But whether audiences will seek out that nostalgia again is harder to predict. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 had an air of prestige Another \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d advantage was both films\u2019 sublime pairing of director and subject matter. Here was indie staple and Oscar nominee Greta Gerwig helming her biggest film yet about the country\u2019s most famous doll \u2013\u2013 even those less familiar with her work were eager to see whether she could pull off \u201cBarbie.\u201d (The consensus was that she did.) \u201cOppenheimer\u201d director Christopher Nolan also has a distinct style and a dedicated fanbase, which has cemented Nolan as a reliable box office draw, with six of his 12 films making between half a billion to over $1 billion worldwide. The best picture-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d almost cracked a billion. The \u201cartistic audacity\u201d that both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d promised was thrilling in its own right, Nunan said, and part of what drove the more hardcore film fans to the theater for repeat viewings. And that\u2019s the test for a true blockbuster, he said: Whether viewers find it worth it to return and pay to see the same film again and again. The critical and commercial track records for the directors behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are less consistent, Nunan said, which could make a difference in the cultural and box-office impact they have. The prolific Ridley Scott of \u201cGladiator II\u201d has made classics like \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cThelma and Louise.\u201d But his more recent films haven\u2019t \u201cmoved the needle\u201d like his earlier work, Nunan said. Last year\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d and 2021\u2019s \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d made decent money but earned middling reviews; 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Last Duel,\u201d though lauded, was declared a \u201cbomb\u201d by trade publications. \u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu is perhaps best known for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d which was a hit with audiences in 2018, though his last film, 2021\u2019s adaptation of the musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d was beset by Covid-era box office challenges. Musicals like \u2018Wicked\u2019 can be tough sells It will be a harder road for \u201cWicked\u201d to excel than \u201cBarbie\u201d before it, Nunan said \u2013\u2013\u00a0movie musicals are a tougher sell with audiences, even those adapted from popular properties. (See: \u201cCats\u201d flopping in 2019, even though it was based on one of the longest-running musicals of all time and featured the world-conquering superstar Taylor Swift.) \u201cI think the fact that \u2018Wicked\u2019 is a musical actually limits its long term box office appeal,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cWicked\u201d is also a full-fledged musical where \u201cBarbie\u201d was marketed as a comedy that happened to feature a few impactful musical numbers led by a game Ryan Gosling, and even those numbers were revealed much later in the pre-release campaign, he said. There are exceptions to the movie musical rule, though: Just this year, another musical based on familiar IP did solid numbers \u2014 \u201cMean Girls,\u201d a film adaptation of the Broadway musical based on the 2004 film, made over $100 million in theaters. \u2018Glicked\u2019 does have star power As with \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before them, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d have star power in spades. The Roman Empire-set epic has a cast full of \u201cinternet boyfriends,\u201d the men for whom countless fans have pined since their breakout performances: Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn, to name three. Mescal starred in the pandemic-era series \u201cNormal People\u201d and became an Oscar nominee for \u201cAftersun\u201d at 27; the seasoned Pascal reached new heights of heartthrobbery with HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and Quinn appeared in the most recent season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d one of the most-watched Netflix series of all time. Scott\u2019s upcoming film also boasts a star so stratospherically charismatic that the New York Times named him the greatest actor of the 21st century: Denzel Washington, who nearly runs away with the trailer. And \u201cWicked\u201d is anchored by one of the premier pop divas of our time, Ariana Grande, who plays Galinda (yes, Ga-linda), the blonde foil to Cynthia Erivo\u2019s green-skinned Elphaba. Grande hasn\u2019t played a major leading role in a film yet, and she\u2019s only appeared in cameos and bit parts over the last decade. But it\u2019s possible that star power doesn\u2019t play as large a role as it once did in getting butts in seats, Nunan said. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, who played crucial supporting roles in \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d starred in \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d earlier this spring, which faltered at the box office and was sent to VOD just weeks after it hit theaters. \u201cI don\u2019t know, with these blockbuster tentpole films, if the casting is as important as the movie itself,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the quality and execution of the film.\u201d He cited \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which featured several major stars in supporting roles, like Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey, Jr. Their inclusion in the cast maybe lent the film an air of prestige, but he\u2019s not sure that any of them were the sole reason people saw the film. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us went to see because Matt and Emily and Robert were in it, but it helped,\u201d he said. There was something alchemical about the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d moment of last summer that exceeded all predictions about how popular both films would prove. It might have been easy to assume that viewers of one film wouldn\u2019t want to see the other since they were so dissimilar, Nunan said, but \u201caudiences proved the studios wrong\u201d and went to see both. \u201cThat summer, \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was meeting on so many levels of special,\u201d he said. Some magic just can\u2019t be replicated, though there\u2019s still a few months for \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d\u00a0to drum up the same must-see prestige as the films that dominated the summer of 2023. What remains to be seen is whether fans who see the films as a double feature will wear gladiator skirts and witch hats to the theater.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_fly-me-to-the-moon-review-scarlett-johansson-channing-tatum", "text": "After a run of movies awash in the romance of the space program like \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cFirst Man,\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d cleverly uses the Apollo 11 mission as the backdrop to an old-style romance. Less than weighty in the comedy part of its equation, the film largely works as a vehicle for Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, even without completely sticking the landing. The movie casts Johansson as a corporate marketing specialist, which is somewhat ironic given that its marketing campaign isn\u2019t as clear as it could or should be in terms of conveying what to expect. While the story does include a subplot about staging a fake version of the moon landing \u2013 orchestrated as a back-up plan by a shadowy government operative (Woody Harrelson, again serving as one of the president\u2019s men, echoing his role in \u201cWhite House Plumbers\u201d) with ties to the Nixon administration \u2013 the heart of the film resides in the chemistry between the leads. In classic fashion, they are of course instantly drawn to each other, creating the need to erect barriers in order to keep them apart. In that sense, this is less about conspiracy theories and reality \u2013 though there\u2019s definitely an element of that woven into it \u2013 than the tension between NASA\u2019s square-jawed launch director, Cole Davis (Tatum), and Johansson\u2019s Kelly Jones, who gets recruited to \u201csell the moon\u201d to a skeptical public, leveraging her knack for bending the truth in order to close the deal. Coming almost exactly 55 years after Neil Armstrong took that \u201cone giant leap\u201d onto the lunar surface, director Greg Berlanti and writer Rose Gilroy introduce a strain of cynicism well suited to our current moment, juxtaposing that with the soaring, can-do spirit of the Apollo program. There\u2019s a crowd-pleasing quality to the combination, even if any crowds might prove short lived, inasmuch as the film\u2019s theatrical prospects (before a date on Apple TV+) amount to serving as counter-programming to the blockbuster \u201cTwisters\u201d and \u201cDeadpool\u201d sequels soon to come. A prolific TV producer, Berlanti has tilted toward romance with his forays into movies, including \u201cLove, Simon\u201d and \u201cLife as We Know It.\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d occupies a higher orbit in its ambition and star power, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that his leads look pretty celestial, while bathing in the period costumes and music of the time. After an eclectic string of roles, Johansson carries a film that might have starred someone like Faye Dunaway during the era in which it\u2019s set (think \u201cNetwork\u201d), while Tatum gets put to better use than his most recent rom-coms, the third \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cThe Lost City,\u201d admittedly not a super-high bar. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d possesses appealing virtues consciously plucked from the past, then adorns them with modern baubles. Whether that will \u201csell the moon\u201d to the moviegoing public remains to be seen, but to borrow from the song that shares its title, the pitch isn\u2019t much more complicated than an invitation to come play among the stars. \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d premieres July 12 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.

They shared that she was living with a rare, progressive disease known as corticobasal degeneration (CBD). The condition causes an increasing number of brain cells to become damaged and die over time, causing worsening problems with movement, speech, memory and swallowing, according to the UK\u2019s National Health Service website. Currently, no treatment has been shown to stop its progression. \u201cShe chose not to make this news public so that she could deal with her condition in private and spend her remaining time with her children and grandchildren,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cTo all her friends, colleagues, and fans, thank you for all the support you showed her over the years. Our mom wanted to be remembered by how she was: the legendary Queen of Martial Arts\u2026 a versatile, award-winning actress whose film and television career spanned over six decades, not only in Asia but internationally as well,\u201d the statement continues. Born in Shanghai in 1946, Cheng trained in ballet while at school before moving to Hong Kong as a teenager. She then enrolled in a performing arts training course at film production company Shaw Brothers Studio, a pioneer of the kung fu film genre, according to the website Hong Kong Movie Database (HKMDB). This led Cheng to establish her acting career in Shaw Brothers films, such as 1964 historical drama \u201cThe Last Woman of Shang,\u201d in which she played a dancer, and 1964 romance \u201cLover\u2019s Rock\u201d (\u201cQing ren shi\u201d). Her breakthrough role came two years later, when she starred as a skilled martial artist in action crime classic \u201cCome Drink with Me.\u201d Cheng later married, moving to the United States in 1971. She and her husband had four children but eventually divorced. She moved back to Hong Kong in the 1990s, according to HKMDB, before starring in the Oscar-winning 2000 action adventure \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d in which she played villainous fighter Jade Fox. \u201cI\u2019m always up for a fight,\u201d Cheng told Time Out magazine in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating. I\u2019ve always been an active person, so when I got a chance to act out fight scenes, I was happy to oblige.\u201d Her final role was the matchmaker in the 2020 live-action movie \u201cMulan.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/entertainment/cheng-pei-pei-queen-actress-dies-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

I\u2019m here now, come on.\u201d It\u2019s a perfect introduction to an actor who has worn the dreaded \u201cD\u201d word \u2013 \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cdiva,\u201d take your pick \u2013 throughout her career, in a film that serves as an unvarnished but appropriately laudatory tribute. Few stars shone brighter than Dunaway at the apex of her career, highlighted by a decade-long span that began with \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d \u2013 which helped usher in a new era of more edgy and ambitious filmmaking \u2013 followed by \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair,\u201d \u201cChinatown\u201d (which recently commemorated its 50th anniversary), \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d and her Oscar-winning role in the dark satire \u201cNetwork.\u201d At 90 minutes, \u201cFaye\u201d could have devoted the lion\u2019s share of its time to that era and still been worth watching. But director Laurent Bouzereau (\u201cNatalie Wood: What Remains Behind\u201d) obviously has to go back to Dunaway\u2019s upbringing, her personal life and the latter part of her career, punctuated by what she refers to as \u201cmistakes,\u201d from her much-lampooned portrayal of Joan Crawford in \u201cMommie Dearest\u201d to her dropped attempt to turn her lauded stage performance in \u201cMaster Class\u201d into a movie that she intended to direct. Now 83, Dunaway spills a bit of tea about her various relationships, from a romance with Marcello Mastroianni (prompting her to dump director Jerry Schatzberg, who laughs about losing a woman to the dashing Italian star) to her marriage to Terry O\u2019Neill, the photographer who snapped the iconic photo of her lounging by the pool the morning after winning the Oscar for \u201cNetwork\u201d in 1977. Their son, Liam O\u2019Neill, is also among those interviewed, along with Sharon Stone, who Dunaway befriended; and her \u201cBarfly\u201d co-star Mickey Rourke, who refers to her as \u201cmesmerizing.\u201d Dunaway\u2019s screen beauty, with a face made for close-ups, and abundant talent merely added fuel to her diva reputation, distilled into a memorable clip of Bette Davis telling \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host Johnny Carson that Dunaway was the one actor she wouldn\u2019t work with again. Yet as director James Gray, who worked with her on the 2000 movie \u201cThe Yards,\u201d notes in the film, the way Dunaway became characterized within the entertainment industry also represents \u201ca comment on how women are in some ways treated and judged on a very different scale than men.\u201d Of course, \u201cFaye\u201d provides enough anecdotal highlights that it\u2019s possible to enjoy strictly on that level, from Dunaway finally telling Jack Nicholson to go ahead and really slap her in a famous \u201cChinatown\u201d moment to her insistence on applying Blistex to her lips between scenes. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFaye\u201d allows its subject to be, or at least appear, as big, complicated and multifaceted as her life and career, in both the highs and lows, would suggest. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with anything here,\u201d Dunaway tells the interviewer during that setting-up exchange. But if the goal was creating a document that offers a reminder of and testament to her talent, she \u2013 and those who make the time for \u201cFaye\u201d \u2013 should be. \u201cFaye\u201d premieres July 13 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

He was 94. Digney said Newhart died in Los Angeles on Thursday morning after a series of short illnesses. He called the star\u2019s passing an \u201cend of an era in comedy.\u201d Over the course of five decades, Newhart\u2019s popularity rarely waned, whether it was as the recording star of the comedy album \u201cThe Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart\u201d (the first comedy album to win the Grammy for album of the year), the lead in two top-rated television sitcoms, or a supporting actor in movies including \u201cCatch-22\u201d (in which he played the timid Maj. Major), \u201cCold Turkey\u201d and \u201cElf.\u201d He remains best known for the television shows, \u201cThe Bob Newhart Show\u201d (1972-78) and \u201cNewhart\u201d (1982-90), both of which were built around his persona as a reasonable man put-upon by crazies. Finding success Born George Robert Newhart in Oak Park, Illinois on September 5, 1929, Newhart was originally an accountant and advertising copywriter. In 2022, he mused about his time as an accountant, joking, \u201cin my case, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s amazing that a bad accountant could become a comedian.\u201d He added that \u201cthere\u2019s\u00a0something\u00a0about\u00a0numbers and\u00a0music\u00a0and\u00a0comedy,\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0not\u00a0sure\u00a0what\u00a0it\u00a0is,\u201d going on to mention some comedy contemporaries that has an interest in music like he did. He first rose to fame with his comedy album, 1960\u2019s \u201cThe Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.\u201d The album was a phenomenon of its time and one of the best-selling albums of the year. It was No. 1 for 14 weeks on Billboard\u2019s album chart and a multiple Grammy Award-winner, beating out Frank Sinatra, Harry Belafonte and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole for album of the year. He also hit No. 1 with the follow-up, \u201cThe Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!\u201d \u201cThe Bob Newhart Show\u201d debuted in 1972. (This is not to be confused with his Peabody and Emmy Award-winning variety show of the same name that aired for one season beginning in 1961.) He played a Chicago psychologist, Bob Hartley, who ministered to a host of eccentric patients. In \u201cNewhart,\u201d he took on the role of Vermont innkeeper Dick Loudon, who tried to maintain his sanity while surrounded by comical locals. In both cases, his characters found refuge with their wives, played by Suzanne Pleshette in \u201cThe Bob Newhart Show\u201d and Mary Frann in \u201cNewhart.\u201d The latter show\u2019s finale remains one of the most famous in television history.\u00a0In the final \u201cNewhart\u201d episode, Newhart\u2019s town is purchased by a Japanese millionaire. Golfers at a new course regularly batter the inn with their drives, and one day \u2013 in the midst of an argument with townspeople \u2013 Newhart is hit by a golf ball. After a quick fade to black, he awakens\u2026 as Hartley, his character from \u201cThe Bob Newhart Show,\u201d in bed with Pleshette. \u201cHoney, wake up! You won\u2019t believe the dream I just had,\u201d he tells her, to uproarious audience laughter. \u201cThat was my wife Ginny\u2019s idea,\u201d Newhart explained to Parade magazine in 2013. \u201cShe said, \u2018You should end the show by waking up in bed with Emily and explain a dream you had about owning an inn in Vermont.\u2019 We used it!\u201d The actor was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for his \u201cNewhart\u201d series three times in the outstanding lead actor category. He didn\u2019t win an individual acting Emmy until 2013, when he was recognized in the outstanding guest actor category for his portrayal of Professor Proton on \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d He was nominated for a total of nine Emmys throughout the course of his career. Newhart was a frequent guest on the era\u2019s variety and talk shows, and a regular fill-in host on the \u201cTonight Show,\u201d switching out for his friend Johnny Carson 87 times. Newhart never really retired, continuing to make television appearances in recent years on \u201cBig Bang\u201d and \u201cYoung Sheldon,\u201d along with \u201cHot in Cleveland\u201d and \u201cThe Librarians.\u201d Other film work from the star included turns in \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d and \u201cIn & Out.\u201d A late-career Christmas present His performance as Papa Elf in the 2003 beloved Christmas comedy \u201cElf,\u201d Newhart believed, \u201coutranks, by far, any role I may have ever played,\u201d he shared in an email interview with CNN last fall on the occasion of the film\u2019s 20th anniversary. \u201cMy agent sent me the script and I fell in love with it,\u201d he said, later adding that he told his wife that the movie was \u201cgoing to be another \u2018Miracle on 34th\u00a0Street,\u2019 where people watch it every year.\u201d \u201cIn my opinion, there has not been anything like it in the interim,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople wanted to believe in it. \u2026 People need that charming, wonderful thing about the Christmas spirit and its way of powering the sleigh.\u201d The actor and comedian was inducted into the\u00a0Television Hall of Fame\u00a0in 1993, and has had his material added to the collection of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History.

He turned to music. \u201cIt completely saved me,\u201d Tasjan told CNN\u2019s Randi Kaye in a recent interview. \u201cThere was that feeling of just like, man, I don\u2019t know, like anyone at my high school who\u2019s gay or you know anything like that\u2026. being able to listen to, um, a record like Poses by Rufus Wainwright or something like that, you know, it allowed me to live fully in as myself, even if it was just in my bedroom with my headphones on for the night.\u201d The grammy-nominated Tasjan recently released his fifth studio album called \u201cStellar Evolution,\u201d a deeply personal work. One song, titled \u201cNightmare,\u201d tells the story of a boy Tasjan remembered from high school in Albany Ohio, who was teased and then reported for putting makeup on in his car. Tasjan regrets not standing up for him at the time, fearing he would be ostracized by association. \u201cI wrote that song so that I could sing it every night and remind myself of the importance of not being afraid of who we are and remembering that oftentimes is our real strength,\u201d Tasjan, who identifies as bisexual, reflected. \u201cThat\u2019s the genuine experience that I\u2019m having as a human being, whose love is not dependent on, you know, somebody\u2019s specific gender,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just feels very instinctual to me, to just fall in love with people.\u201d As an artist and an advocate, Tasjan has his work cut out for him. He lives in Nashville Tennessee, a state that in recent years has passed numerous pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation with more proposed. Since 2015, more than 21 laws targeting LGBTQ rights or existence have been passed in Tennessee, according to the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that advocates for equality for LGBTQ communities. He describes the current political scene in Tennessee as \u201ctotally haywire\u201d and suggests some lawmakers are \u201ctrying to make it illegal to be a gay person.\u201d As a rising singer-songwriter, Tasjan sees himself as someone who can help shape today\u2019s culture. His LGBTQ-advocacy work in Tennessee, along with his music, is part of that. He hopes to help bridge divides during this fraught time in our culture. \u201cAt this stage, it\u2019s really about using your music and message to build a platform of visibility, and then using that platform of visibility to sort of lead by example\u2026just put the kind of energy and art out into the world that\u2019s a reflection of what you\u2019d like to see back,\u201d Tasjan told CNN. His music is his way of reaching out to others like him. \u201cI really had the experience growing up as a young person, feeling afraid of who I was and what that would mean if I were to say that out loud to somebody,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe kids that are growing up in the Midwest like I did, you know, who don\u2019t have a person in their life that they can relate to about who they are, can see someone like me, hear my story and know what I\u2019ve been through and know that there\u2019s another side to that, that you can come out of, and that you can find your community and find your people and be okay,\u201d Tasjan said. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s especially important right now at a time when there is so much dehumanization happening across the board. \u201c Tasjan sees similarities between himself and some songwriters in the \u201960s and \u201870s, like Bob Dylan, as well as other artists from today. \u201cThis is the road that we have built as artists in the modern era,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that artists like Childish Gambino, Chappell Roan and Lady Gaga, they\u2019re modern day protest singers, you know, and I, and I feel right in line with that.\u201d Tasjan believes \u201cprotest music,\u201d as he calls it, \u201cis the soundtrack of our time.\u201d \u201cPeople are relating to these songs and shows coming up to me afterwards, sometimes in tears, because they just really needed to hear that message,\u201d Tasjan said. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, as a songwriter, that\u2019s what I want to create, the songs that people need to hear.\u201c", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/entertainment/aaron-lee-tasjan-advocacy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

If convicted, they each face up to 20 years in prison on each count, the release said. Kingston, 34, whose real name is Kisean Anderson, and his mother, Janice Turner, 61, were\u00a0arrested in May\u00a0on fraud\u00a0and theft-related charges after a SWAT team raided\u00a0Kingston\u2019s\u00a0home.

{"id": "2024_07_17_entertainment_twisters-review-glen-powell", "text": "Landing somewhere between sequel and reboot, \u201cTwisters\u201d introduces new characters and an extra letter to the 1996 disaster movie but not much else, leaving its stars stranded in a vehicle with roughly the weight of a stiff breeze. Impressive visual effects only go so far, though they at least provide a necessary distraction to the heightened awareness of climate change baked into the premise. After \u201cAnyone But You\u201d and \u201cHit Man,\u201d Glen Powell serves as the biggest marketing come-on beyond the chance to see wanton destruction, but despite opportunities to flash that million-dollar smile, it\u2019s not really his movie. The core story, rather, belongs to Daisy Edgar-Jones (\u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d), playing the brilliant scientist lured back into the storm-chasing game after a tragic setback. Edgar-Jones\u2019 Kate Carter has taken refuge in New York after pursuing potentially groundbreaking research for the Tornado Tamer Project, an attempt to do the original movie\u2019s premise one better by actually employing state-of-the-art technology to reduce massive tornadoes. Those perilous efforts have lain dormant, however, when she\u2019s approached by former colleague Javi (Anthony Ramos), who has found well-heeled sponsorship for his own storm-measuring device, flanked by an associate (\u201cSuperman\u201d-to-be David Corenswet) who gives off a decided \u201cDon\u2019t trust that dude\u201d vibe. Back in the field, Kate encounters Tyler Owens (Powell), a rambunctious tornado \u201cwrangler\u201d who cashes in chasing storms and posting the content he films to his popular YouTube channel. Yet while there\u2019s tension between her altruistic focus on science and his commodification of disasters, underscored by the neophytes with whom they cross paths, in this kind of movie handsome clouds tend to have silver linings. After earning well-deserved praise for the character-driven independent film \u201cMinari,\u201d director Lee Isaac Chung tackles this major-studio assignment without bringing anything particularly distinctive to it, relying a little too much on how good his leads look wet and sweaty. That extends to the posse of supporting players in Kate/Javi and Tyler\u2019s respective camps, which try to match the zany daredevil antics associated with the earlier film but generally fall short. Indeed, the notably clever moments prove few and far between, from a reference to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to a sequence involving a movie theater, which a cynic might see as a metaphor for the stormy state of the industry. As noted, the most salient wrinkle isn\u2019t particularly helpful in viewing the movie as light escapism \u2013 namely, illustrating the devastating impact of tornadoes on communities, and an increase in extreme weather that has become more alarming and dire as filtered through our news-saturated culture. (\u201cTwister,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting, premiered the same year that Fox News and MSNBC signed on.) Frankly, this \u201cTwister\u201d revisitation might have been better served by following the old title with an exclamation point instead of an \u201cS.\u201d Either way, the assignment of replicating the first movie\u2019s appeal would have presented a challenge, but \u201cTwisters\u201d makes that task harder due to headwinds entirely of its own making. \u201cTwisters\u201d premieres July 19 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_07_18_entertainment_twister-generation-of-storm-chasers", "text": "When it comes to influential films in the world of climate research and weather reporting, few (if any) can hold a candle to \u201cTwister,\u201d Jan de Bont\u2019s epic action movie that has spawned a sequel blowing through theaters this weekend. When the film came out in 1996, Dr. Elizabeth Smith, then not quite 6 years old, went to the theater to see it with her parents \u201cand I apparently lost my mind about it and became obsessed,\u201d she told CNN in an email interview. When it came out on VHS, she remembers \u201cwatching it over-and-over-and-over the way some kids watched things like \u2018The Little Mermaid.\u2019\u201d Smith, who keeps an enamel pin of the \u201cTwister\u201d VHS on the lanyard she wears at work, is now a research meteorologist at NOAA\u2019s National Severe Storms Laboratory \u2013 an organization that even gets a mention in the de Bont film. \u201cI also remember certain concepts really imprinting on me,\u201d she told CNN of \u201cTwister\u2019s\u201d impact. \u201cSpecifically in the early chase scenes, Jo and Bill (Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton) are in the truck, and they recognize mammatus clouds in the sky overhead. They indicate that this is an omen for bad things to come. I have very clear memories of plastering my face to the backseat window watching, just in case the mammatus appeared so I would be READY.\u201d Many took their interest in the subject one step further, with enrollment in undergraduate weather research and meteorology programs seeing a notable bump. Academic research articles on these trends sometimes refer to this as the \u201cTwister Effect.\u201d \u201cA few years after \u2018Twister,\u2019 enrollment numbers at (the University of Oklahoma\u2019s) School of Meteorology \u2013 applications doubled,\u201d Dr. Harold E. Brooks, an affiliate professor at the university and senior research scientist at NSSL, said. Brooks \u2013 who served as a technical advisor on \u201cTwister\u201d \u2013 also pointed to the film\u2019s impact felt outside of the US, in places like Finland that didn\u2019t have research and data collection for extreme storms like tornadoes until the release of that movie. CNN weather reporter Brandon Miller is also among those who got sucked into the meteorology field by \u201cTwister.\u201d He remembers seeing the movie as a child with his father, who was a weather-enthusiast. \u201cHe loved the weather and he and I would always go outside and watch big storms together when I was a kid,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI was obsessed with weather and tornadoes were my favorite type of weather, and back then there wasn\u2019t much of an opportunity to consume that type of content \u2013 so I just remember being in awe of the entire thing.\u201d For Smith, the legacy of the original \u201cTwister\u201d is a complicated one. Her line of work closely mirrors that of Hunt\u2019s character Jo Harding in the first film and she will often find herself hauling scientific instruments in the bed of a pickup or a tow-behind trailer. Noting that she is \u201cunfortunately, one of very few women doing this professionally,\u201d Smith described how \u201cit is not uncommon for people, both colleagues and strangers at a truck stop, to jokingly call me \u2018Jo\u2019 while I\u2019m working that way.\u201d \u201cThat brings up some complicated stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWas it impressive that films like \u2018Twister\u2019 and \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 (featuring Laura Dern as a paleobotanist) were showcasing women scientists almost 30 years ago? Yes! But in reality Jo\u2019s storyline is still reduced to a he-gets-the-girl in the end plot \u2013 wet tank tops and all.\u201d Expectations are running high for \u201cTwisters,\u201d the Lee Isaac Chung-directed new installment which is coming out this week and stars Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell. To the generation of storm chasers who largely dedicated their lives to the science of weather because of the 1996 movie, the hope is that the new entry will get more than a few things right. Safety and science matter For starters, experts hope safety will be emphasized amid all the gasp-inducing (and very windy) set-pieces. \u201cWeather is fascinating and it is beautiful, but it is also dangerous, I really hope this movie can balance all of that,\u201d Miller said. When it comes to chasing storms, the danger is twofold: there\u2019s the considerable risk posed by the extreme weather itself, as well as the dangers from too many chasers \u2013 formally trained meteorologists and otherwise \u2013 pursuing the same weather pattern, oftentimes on the same road. \u201cI am interested to see how they handle the concept of \u2018chaser convergence\u2019 and the explosion of popularity chasing has seen over recent years,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIn the first film there were really just the two teams on the roads (and they still almost collided!).\u201d Smith added that she\u2019s \u201cnervous about the massive amount of attention this will certainly bring to chasing.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, chasing is hard to do well and even harder to do well, safely,\u201d she said. Rebecca Kopelman, chief meteorologist at Iowa\u2019s News Now, echoed the sentiment. \u201cThis could potentially create more dangerous conditions in the climate of storm chasing,\u201d she said of the new movie. \u201cUnfortunately some people have gotten hurt storm chasing and it\u2019s become a more popular hobby with more and more people going out on especially on the more elevated severe risk days.\u201d Miller said the original movie \u201cgave rise to a wave of \u2018armchair\u2019 storm chasers,\u201d and mentioned how the new movie could do the same, but exponentially. \u201cThe biggest difference is nowadays everything is much more accessible to the layperson. From the radar data on your phone, to hi-res cameras and YouTube and social influencers, it can be a deadly combination when you get untrained people in the field chasing the dangerous storms trying to get the closest, craziest footage,\u201d he observed. Kopelman, who is featured on Discovery\u2019s new In the Eye of the Storm series covering derecho superstorms, added that she hopes \u201cTwisters\u201d highlights the scientific importance of storm chasing and not just doing it for the thrill.\u201d (Discovery, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) \u201cIt\u2019s still very much a need because we can\u2019t confirm tornadoes solely based on radar all of the time,\u201d she said. Smith also hopes the movie gets people excited not only about the storms themselves, but the research and science behind them. \u201cI am very excited at the prospect for people of all ages to get excited about science. There is a new opportunity for future meteorologists to bud, but not just meteorologists and not just kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a chance for all sorts of people to recognize in new ways that the natural world around them is dynamic and engaging.\u201d She added: \u201cSomething like this can be a watershed moment for kids to choose science classes, people to get curious about museums, and more. That is something to be excited about no matter what is in the movie.\u201d \u201cTwisters\u201d premieres in theaters on July 19. It is presented by Warner Bros., which like CNN is a part of Warner Bros. Discovery.

{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_beverly-hills-cop-axel-f-review-eddie-murphy", "text": "\u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d spawned a trio of movies, but more significantly, the 1984 film capped off a string of hits (after \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d and \u201cTrading Places\u201d) that launched Eddie Murphy into the movie-star stratosphere. As Murphy moves into the encores-for-streaming phase of his career (see \u201cComing 2 America\u201d), enter \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\u201d which features enough unapologetic nostalgia (cue the music) to power through its flat spots. The fact that the film is premiering via Netflix, as opposed to theaters, might warrant some second-guessing given the box-office numbers that the latest \u201cBad Boys\u201d sequel has delivered, but that\u2019s a debate for another day. From the get-go, the star appears up to the task as he slides back into a role to which he said goodbye 30 years ago, and introduced a decade before that. As with \u201cComing 2 America,\u201d \u201cAlex F\u201d uses a next-generation hook to get into the story and create the excuse to bring Murphy\u2019s Axel Foley from Detroit (after an introductory action sequence that goes on a bit too long) back to Beverly Hills, reuniting him with lots of familiar faces. In this case, he\u2019s summoned by Billy (Judge Reinhold) to help Axel\u2019s estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige, who followed \u201cHit the Floor\u201d with \u201cZola\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d), a lawyer representing a client who has triggered a warning to back off from some very bad people. Before you can say \u201cGet the f\u2014k outta here\u201d (which is, not surprisingly, said several times), Axel lands in L.A., cheerfully insisting, \u201cThey love me in Beverly Hills!\u201d Staying on brand, he quickly irks the local authorities as he sets about protecting Jane, while running afoul of a corrupt detective played by Kevin Bacon (one of two movies in which he appears this week, the other being \u201cMaXXXine\u201d). Axel also gets teamed up with a younger cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has some history with Jane, although frankly \u2013 other than \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s hilarious cameo as a Beverly Hills realtor \u2013 the newcomers don\u2019t stand much of a chance to register as holdovers like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and John Ashton join Reinhold in dropping by. In perhaps the wisest (and easiest) decision, first-time feature director Mark Molloy relies heavily on music associated with the original movies, from Harold Faltermeyer\u2019s electronic score to songs like \u201cThe Heat is On\u201d and \u201cNeutron Dance,\u201d augmented by a new one from Lil Nas X. In the early going, a younger colleague in Detroit points out that Axel continues to hit the streets at a time when \u201cguys your age\u201d are transitioning to desk jobs, which basically spells out the formulation here, and how Murphy effectively carries off the same mentality as his alter ego. \u201cAxel F\u201d only turns up the heat to a low simmer, but as breezy escapism goes, those armed with the proper attitude might find themselves doing the neutron dance, or a version of it, all over again. \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.

But there have been moments where we\u2019ve been able to talk about things.\u201d She debuted \u201cLet\u2019s Be Clear\u201d in December 2023, roughly six months after she had announced cancer had spread to her brain. In some instances, the platform was a place to reflect on her career and her memorable roles. Other episodes focused on her treatment and prognosis during informative conversations with members of her care team. Doherty discussed her surgeries, medications and difficult decisions along the way. \u201cI don\u2019t have many people that I talk to cancer about,\u201d she told her oncologist, Dr. Lawrence Piro, in one episode. \u201cFor me, I talk to you about cancer because I think you\u2019re qualified to talk to me about cancer.\u201d Doherty may have leaned on professionals for advice about her own case, but didn\u2019t hesitate to stretch her hand out to those going through similar circumstances. Actress Olivia Munn, who earlier this year shared her own breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent double mastectomy, said she and Doherty \u201cbonded through a shared battle and a desire to help other women.\u201d \u201cLooking back on the last text she sent me just a couple months ago, she asked how I was doing and if she could do anything for me,\u201d Munn wrote on Instagram. \u201cTrue to form, Shannen was offering her support even though she was in the final stage of fighting this horrific disease. Cancer is really f***ing scary and Shannen faced it with such dignity, strength and grace.\u201d In that episode with Dr. Piro, Doherty encouraged listeners to advocate for themselves. \u201cMost of the time, a lot of patients feel as if they don\u2019t have the right to ask for a better doctor or to change doctors, or they\u2019re scared their insurance won\u2019t cover a new doctor or feel like they can\u2019t change doctors,\u201d she said. Piro affirmed: \u201cEveryone deserves world-class health care\u2026also a world-class patient experience because if you get, even if you get great care, if you get PTSD trying to get care, then the quality if your life is not good at all.\u201d Quality of life was a focus of Doherty\u2019s in her final months. \u201cI\u2019m not the person who likes to give up very easily,\u201d she said in June. \u201cI just don\u2019t want my sickness to last that long.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/entertainment/shannen-doherty-cancer-advocacy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_entertainment_twisters-film-interviews-climate-change", "text": "Like its titular tornados, \u201cTwisters\u201d blasts through a lot in its 122-minute runtime. A summer blockbuster with a surprising amount of brains to match Glen Powell\u2019s brawn, it features subplots that are signs of the times \u2013 disaster capitalists; the Faustian bargain between scientists and financiers \u2013 and a deluge of imagery portraying lives and livelihoods threatened by nature\u2019s awesome power. But two words you won\u2019t hear from any of its characters are \u201cclimate change.\u201d \u201cI just wanted to make sure that with the movie, we don\u2019t ever feel like (it) is putting forward any message,\u201d director Lee Isaac Chung explained in an interview with CNN. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like films are meant to be message-oriented.\u201d To his credit, there is some scientific justification for the omission, too. Generally, scientists are the least certain about the connection between tornadoes and climate change as it\u2019s unclear how warming temperatures are changing storms themselves or the outbreaks. However, evidence is growing\u00a0of the potential impact of planet-warming pollution. Recent studies have showed rotating, supercell thunderstorms that produce tornadoes are becoming more frequent in parts of the US outside so-called Tornado Alley, including in the Southeast and Midwest. They are also becoming more frequent in seasons that aren\u2019t the traditional severe storm season, and\u00a0recent December outbreaks\u00a0have proved particularly deadly. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen tornadoes like this before,\u201d says Javi, Anthony Ramos\u2019 entrepreneurial storm chaser, in one scene. He goes on to convince old friend Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) to join his research team, promising \u201cWe can save lives.\u201d In the film, ever-more destructive tornados carve up increasingly urbanized areas of Oklahoma. \u201cI think what we are doing is showing the reality of what\u2019s happening on the ground \u2026 we don\u2019t shy away from saying that things are changing,\u201d Lee added. He name-checked Maura Tierney\u2019s character Cathy, mother of Kate, as a voice for all this. Cathy, a local farmer, gripes that storms and floods are becoming more frequent, and the price of wheat more expensive, while stopping short of citing climate change. \u201cI wanted to make sure that we are never creating a feeling that we\u2019re preaching a message, because that\u2019s certainly not what I think cinema should be about,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI think it should be a reflection of the world.\u201d If it is cinema\u2019s M.O. to show not tell, then Lee has the prerogative to show us what he wants \u2013 like a tornado ripping through a power station, sucking up the ensuing fire and setting the sky ablaze. However, for a film populated by scientists and clued-in citizens to not mention climate change is a little like the twisters themselves: there\u2019s a hole at the center. Nevertheless, this was a personal and earnest endeavor for the director, who built upon a screenplay by Mark L. Smith (\u201cThe Revenant\u201d) and story by Joseph Kosinski (\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d). Lee was raised on a farm in western Arkansas, just across the border with Oklahoma. His upbringing (which he drew on for 2020\u2019s \u201cMinari\u201d) included an early run-in with a tornado, when he was forced to seek refuge in a car as his family didn\u2019t have a storm shelter. \u201cWhen you have brushes with extreme weather as a child, anything that feels larger than life and dangerous \u2026 (leaves) a very big imprint,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sense of awe and wonder was something that I really wanted to preserve in this film \u2013 that it\u2019s not just a summer blockbuster about running from tornadoes and hiding away,\u201d he added. \u201cI wanted to make sure that we\u2019re also revering and honoring the beauty of that power.\u201d \u2018Everybody wants the cow\u2019 For Lee, an avowed fan of the original \u201cTwister\u201d (1996), entering this world was a dream come true. \u201cThat film made that research and science feel like an adventure in many ways. That\u2019s what I wanted this film to do,\u201d he explained. But while he peppers a few loving homages to Jan de Bont\u2019s blockbuster in his own movie, he stopped short of one: the flying cow. \u201cEverybody wants the cow,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey think they want the cow. But I promise you, you would be disappointed if there was a cow.\u201d \u201cAny time I talk to anyone about that original \u2018Twisters\u2019 they would say, \u2018Oh yeah, the big flying cow movie.\u2019 I felt like I would hate to make a movie, update it, and just hear, \u2018Oh yes, you made the new flying cow movie.\u2019 So that was it \u2013 that was the decision.\u201d The production got more than it bargained for, shooting on location during tornado season in spring 2023. \u201cBeing in Oklahoma, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Ramos. \u201cThere were days where the sun was out, (the) sky was blue, clear, and then boom. The clouds, they just descend upon you, and then the wind starts blowing, and you\u2019re like, what is happening now?!\u201d \u201cMaking a \u2018Twisters\u2019 movie in Tornado Alley during storm season, tornado season, it\u2019s kind of perfect. It really rubbed off on this movie,\u201d said Powell. \u201cIt\u2019s this very specific place in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cEverybody that lives there has kind of pride in the weather. Everybody talks like a meteorologist, everybody\u2019s weirdly just so knowledgeable about what\u2019s happening and how it\u2019s happening.\u201d Powell plays the charming Tyler Owens, a scoundrel with a heart of gold chasing tornados for social media clicks and adjacent revenue. Some of the extras in the movie were genuine storm chasers, leading to some real-life bonding. \u201cWe\u2019re on some group threads with a bunch of storm chasers, which is a delight,\u201d said Powell. \u201cWe get text messages sometimes from our friends in Oklahoma. They\u2019re like, \u2018We got something brewing down here! Get down here and come chase!\u2019\u201d Still, Lee would rather pump the breaks on encouraging any more hobbyists to hit the road. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want this film to inspire a bunch of people to just pile into their cars and pickup trucks and chase a tornado, because that would lead to a lot of dangerous activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping \u2026 if anyone\u2019s interested in chasing a tornado, they just watch \u2018Twisters\u2019 again.\u201d \u201cTwisters\u201d premieres in UK theaters on July 17 and US theaters on July 19.

{"id": "2024_07_08_entertainment_streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros", "text": "Streaming appears poised to undergo what some have called \u201cThe Great Re-Bundling,\u201d with services merging, combining or forming alliances that will essentially reconstruct the cable \u201cbundle\u201d that consumers relied upon for decades. While that makes sense for studios eager to offer \u201cmore robust and streamlined content,\u201d as Disney CEO Bob Iger said earlier this year, subscribers have every reason to wonder \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?,\u201d and if all these high-stakes corporate announcements will really benefit them. Will it make access to at-home viewing options cheaper? More plentiful? Easier to navigate and find what you want? Less of a chore to manage in terms of juggling multiple subscriptions? That\u2019s the goal, but honestly, we can\u2019t really know. The latest news to ripple through the streaming front involved reports Paramount, prior to moving forward on its merger with Skydance, looking to combine its Paramount+ with another service. Max, the HBO-centered provider from CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery, was among those cited as potential partners. Such an arrangement would follow the formal announcement in February of Venu Sports, a joint sports offering consisting of Disney\u2019s ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros.; Disney\u2019s intra-studio attempt to create a mega-service to subscribers who ante up for its trio of services: Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+; and Disney\u2019s collaboration plan with Warner Bros. on a bundle consisting of Disney+, Max and Hulu. The advantages for the companies, as they seek to compete with Netflix and the tech giants (Amazon and Apple foremost among them) that have helped crowd the streaming waters, aren\u2019t certain, but the objectives seem clear, beginning with the hope these combined or consolidated services will reduce churn \u2013 that is, people signing up and cancelling and signing up again. What has become increasingly obvious, though, is for all the knocks on cable, starting with the fact consumers paid for lots of channels they never watched, its one-stop-shopping approach eliminated some of the challenges springing up now. That old system worked because the \u201cbundle\u201d actually created a mechanism to financially support a vast number of choices serving various tastes. Simply put, paying for ESPN if you don\u2019t like sports, or CNN and MSNBC if you don\u2019t watch news, might have been irritating, but those millions of cable subscriptions spread out the revenue in a way that made dozens and dozens of channels available and affordable. The dream of a more a la carte system, where you pay for what you watch, has turned out to elusive, primarily because there\u2019s no way \u2013 at least yet \u2013 to adopt that where the cost doesn\u2019t become onerous, and maybe even prohibitive, for many consumers. Unwinding the bundle by \u201ccord cutting\u201d on cable subscriptions might have felt good, but in terms of the industry\u2019s economics, that shift opened Pandora\u2019s box. While Disney or Paramount\u2019s profits need not concern consumers, the ability of those companies to produce and present TV shows and movies people want to see does. After cutting the cord, stitching it back together in a different form through re-bundling comes with question marks, and risks. Just ask newspapers that once delivered a physical bundle that landed on people\u2019s doorsteps before the digital age upended their business model. The promises made by executives like Iger, who called Venu \u201ca major win for sports fans,\u201d might very well work out. In theory, consumers could indeed be spared some of the \u201cannoyance and decision-making,\u201d as Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle wrote, associated with keeping track of a half-dozen streaming services, adding that\u2019s \u201cwhy so many consumers prefer things like all-inclusive vacations, and why bundling is a common business practice.\u201d Still, when it comes to implementing structural changes in how entertainment gets distributed and consumed, an adage well known to most Disney characters remains worth remembering: Be careful what you wish for.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/entertainment/streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

And the actor and writer has made one in deciding to retire his musical alter ego, Childish Gambino. \u201cIt\u2019s not fulfilling,\u201d he told the New York Times in a recent interview. \u201cI just felt like I didn\u2019t need to build in this way anymore.\u201d The Grammy-award winner said he\u2019s doing it after the release of his sixth album, \u201cBando Stone & the New World,\u201d scheduled for Friday. Not that his music career has come easy. Glover has been open in the past about trying to find his tribe in both comedy and music. Recently, while presenting at the BET Awards, he noted that he has the same amount of BET Awards - one- as singer, Sam Smith, who is white. Glover talked to the New York Times about clashing over the marking and promotion of his music with the then head of the label that put out his first three albums. \u201cI used to get so mad at what he was doing that I would have stress dreams where I went into his record company with a bat and just bashed all the windows,\u201d Glover said. His single \u201cRedbone\u201d burst on the scene after his critically acclaim series \u201cAtlanta\u201d debuted in 2016 and he won his first Grammy. Two years later, his song \u201cThis Is America\u201d became a protest anthem and won him multiple Grammys, including song and record of the year. Around that same time, Glover both lost his father and welcomed his second child, something that made him more reflective. \u201cI\u2019m not 25 anymore, standing in front of a boulder like, \u2018This has to move,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou give what you can, but there\u2019s beauty everywhere in every moment. You don\u2019t have to build it. You don\u2019t have to search for it.\u201d With so many projects, including acting and his production company, Glover said he doesn\u2019t have the time to put in the work to make music up to his standards. He does have some thoughts, however, on defining success for what could be his final Gambino album. \u201cSuccess to me is, honestly, being able to put out a wide-scale album that I would listen to,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this album, I really wanted to be able to play big rooms and have big, anthemic songs that fill those rooms, so that people feel a sense of togetherness.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/entertainment/donald-glover-retiring-childish-gambino/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_entertainment_house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-recap", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story discusses plot points from \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d Season 2, episode 5. While both sides absorb the fallout from the battle of Rook\u2019s Rest in episode 4, one message comes through loud and clear in \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u2019s\u201d latest chapter: the women in this patriarchal society must fight wars on two fronts. For Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy), the indignities come from her council of advisers, as well as her headstrong husband Daemon (Matt Smith), who continues to have really weird dreams while more brazenly plotting to personally acquire power. Rhaenyra articulates her predicament clearly at the end, complaining about how she had to stay prudent and apart from the war despite her own dragon-riding credentials, saying that she was \u201csending others to fight and be felled in my name,\u201d before concluding with a sense of determination, \u201cIf all else fails, it is I who must fight.\u201d Her counterpart in this civil war and one-time friend, Alicent (Olivia Cooke), faces a similar display of disrespect at home, after the attempted fratricide by Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) that left his brother, King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), a scorched and wheezing mess \u2013 nursing burns, broken bones and internal injuries. Aegon\u2019s condition calls for appointing a regent, as Alicent says, to serve in his stead \u201cuntil he recovers, or does not.\u201d Yet despite her realization that Aemond has developed into something of a psychopathic monster (those Targaryen kids do grow up fast) \u2013 telling Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), \u201cYou know what he is. What he has somehow become\u201d \u2013 the council chooses to elevate Aemond. What\u2019s a mother to do? In this case, feel angry and betrayed. \u201cWe have given the war to the dragons,\u201d Criston says flatly to the woman who regularly (if sneakily) shares his bed. \u201cA dragon rider should lead us.\u201d Of course, Criston engages in a misstep of his own at the outset, parading the slain dragon of the equally dead Rhaenys (Eve Best, we hardly knew ye) through the town, unsettling the common folk. That death also leaves her husband, Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), shattered and in mourning, as both sides grapple with their casualties. Beyond that, the fifth episode represents a bit of a breather \u2013 as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and now \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d tend to do after major conflicts \u2013 as the warring factions seek to secure support for their war efforts, with Daemon, for one, wrestling with the demands of diplomacy as opposed to his scorched-earth tactics. Speaking of scorched earth, there could be a lot more of it, as the closing sequence involves Rhaenyra strategizing with her son about how to neutralize Aemond and his massive dragon Vhagar. While dragon riding is a talent limited to the Targaryens, the two realize there are lots of wayward offshoots of the royal bloodline that could in theory be enlisted and turned into riders. \u201cA mad thought,\u201d the Queen muses, clearly intrigued by the idea. Then again, as Rhaenyra noted earlier in the hour, as a woman seeking to rule, \u201cThe path I walk has never been trod.\u201d Without clear footsteps to follow, in other words, she\u2019s going to have to blaze her own trail \u2013 and if that Targaryen-blood dragon-riding scheme comes to fruition, perhaps literally. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d airs Sunday nights on Max, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.
