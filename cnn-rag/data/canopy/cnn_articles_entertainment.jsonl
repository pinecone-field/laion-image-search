{"id": "2024_07_17_entertainment_twisters-review-glen-powell", "text": "Landing somewhere between sequel and reboot, \u201cTwisters\u201d introduces new characters and an extra letter to the 1996 disaster movie but not much else, leaving its stars stranded in a vehicle with roughly the weight of a stiff breeze. Impressive visual effects only go so far, though they at least provide a necessary distraction to the heightened awareness of climate change baked into the premise. After \u201cAnyone But You\u201d and \u201cHit Man,\u201d Glen Powell serves as the biggest marketing come-on beyond the chance to see wanton destruction, but despite opportunities to flash that million-dollar smile, it\u2019s not really his movie. The core story, rather, belongs to Daisy Edgar-Jones (\u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d), playing the brilliant scientist lured back into the storm-chasing game after a tragic setback. Edgar-Jones\u2019 Kate Carter has taken refuge in New York after pursuing potentially groundbreaking research for the Tornado Tamer Project, an attempt to do the original movie\u2019s premise one better by actually employing state-of-the-art technology to reduce massive tornadoes. Those perilous efforts have lain dormant, however, when she\u2019s approached by former colleague Javi (Anthony Ramos), who has found well-heeled sponsorship for his own storm-measuring device, flanked by an associate (\u201cSuperman\u201d-to-be David Corenswet) who gives off a decided \u201cDon\u2019t trust that dude\u201d vibe. Back in the field, Kate encounters Tyler Owens (Powell), a rambunctious tornado \u201cwrangler\u201d who cashes in chasing storms and posting the content he films to his popular YouTube channel. Yet while there\u2019s tension between her altruistic focus on science and his commodification of disasters, underscored by the neophytes with whom they cross paths, in this kind of movie handsome clouds tend to have silver linings. After earning well-deserved praise for the character-driven independent film \u201cMinari,\u201d director Lee Isaac Chung tackles this major-studio assignment without bringing anything particularly distinctive to it, relying a little too much on how good his leads look wet and sweaty. That extends to the posse of supporting players in Kate/Javi and Tyler\u2019s respective camps, which try to match the zany daredevil antics associated with the earlier film but generally fall short. Indeed, the notably clever moments prove few and far between, from a reference to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to a sequence involving a movie theater, which a cynic might see as a metaphor for the stormy state of the industry. As noted, the most salient wrinkle isn\u2019t particularly helpful in viewing the movie as light escapism \u2013 namely, illustrating the devastating impact of tornadoes on communities, and an increase in extreme weather that has become more alarming and dire as filtered through our news-saturated culture. (\u201cTwister,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting, premiered the same year that Fox News and MSNBC signed on.) Frankly, this \u201cTwister\u201d revisitation might have been better served by following the old title with an exclamation point instead of an \u201cS.\u201d Either way, the assignment of replicating the first movie\u2019s appeal would have presented a challenge, but \u201cTwisters\u201d makes that task harder due to headwinds entirely of its own making. \u201cTwisters\u201d premieres July 19 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/entertainment/twisters-review-glen-powell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far", "text": "As we hurtle headlong into summer, we\u2019re dully aware six months\u2019 worth of new content has already hit our streaming platforms and our feeds this year \u2013 and in some rare cases, even gotten us out of the house and into a movie theater. While consensus seems to be that a lot of what pop culture has brought forth thus far in 2024 has been a bit \u201cmeh,\u201d there have also been standouts, triumphs and attention-getting titles worth of celebrating. Here\u2019s our list of some the year\u2019s best performances and content so far: MOVIES Best (or, most chillingly effective) cameo - Jesse Plemons in \u2018Civil War\u2019 The Oscars \u201cconversation\u201d already includes \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star Plemons delivering a brief performance so menacing, it calls to minds the scant 24 minutes Anthony Hopkins spent on screen before clinching an Academy Award for \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d Plemons\u2019 demented \u201csoldier\u201d in a crumbled and war-torn version of the near-future US, dispensing life and death with callous disdain, more than drives home the point filmmaker Alex Garland was trying to make with his latest movie. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how \u201cCivil War\u201d star Kirsten Dunst \u2013 who is married to Plemons in real life \u2013 felt comfortable going home with him after shooting his scene. Best genre-defying comedy -\u00a0\u2018Problemista\u2019 Writer, director and actor Julio Torres is an exceptional cinematic voice who has actually been around for awhile, creating excellent content for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and series such as \u201cLos Espookys\u201d and the soon-to-be released \u201cFantasmas.\u201d \u201cProblemista,\u201d which won acclaim at several festivals in 2023, features Torres as a toy designer from El Salvador trying to find opportunities to unleash his creative vision in the US, while also figuring out a way to stay in the country. He runs into both expected roadblocks as well as ones that are frustratingly inane, like a poorly designed grant website with a broken drop-down menu that makes it impossible for anyone located outside of country to apply. With artfully realized details like that, \u201cProblemista\u201d does the remarkable job of remaining universally engaging while exploring a very specific and individual experience. Plus, Tilda Swinton turns in one of her best idiosyncratic and delightfully deranged performances opposite the gifted Torres. Best meet-cute -\u00a0\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Not since \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d has Anne Hathaway captured the zeitgeist like this, and we\u2019re here for it. In \u201cIdea,\u201d she has a run-in at Coachella with It-Boy Nicolas Galiztine (of \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d and \u201cMary & George\u201d fame) that is so silly, and so disarming, it\u2019s hard not to go along for the gender-flipped \u201cNotting Hill\u201d (plus a few age-gap years) that follows. Other reasons to watch include the music performance scenes (the fictional boy band in the film isn\u2019t so fictional in that it was essentially created for the movie and has actually released music) and Hathaway\u2019s character\u2019s positively enviable Los Angeles enclave. Best visuals\u00a0- The Harkonnens in \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 It\u2019s getting harder and harder to dazzle with a truly original vision on the silver screen, but Denis Villeneuve pulls it off in his epic sci-fi sequel, which had been drastically delayed for a variety of reasons but finally dawned in the theaters this past spring. The sequences depicting the villainous Harkonnens \u2013 mostly monochromatic and overexposed to create an off-putting yet hypnotic ambiance \u2013 simply look like nothing else, and succeed in imparting a foreboding and terrifically extraterrestrial feel. Actor Austin Butler\u2019s improvised kiss planted on his uncle Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) helps as well. Honorable mentions: Best sports-infused romance/romance-infused sports movie\u00a0- \u201cChallengers\u201d Best use of profanity -\u00a0Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley in \u201cWicked Little Letters\u201d Best music documentary\u00a0- \u201cIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\u201d Best horror film - \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d Best animated film\u00a0- \u201cOrion and the Dark\u201d TV Best production - \u2018Shogun\u2019 The series production of the year, FX\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d managed to create the second showstopping television event based on the acclaimed James Clavell novel, after the first series did way back in 1980. CNN\u2019s Brian Lowry wrote in his glowing review that the new show \u201cblends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.\u201d Best show (somewhat) inspired by real life\u00a0- \u2018Baby Reindeer\u2019 While \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is by no means an easy watch, Richard Gadd\u2019s (true to an extent, that will surely be battled over for some time) recounting of his experience with a stalker \u2013 and how a previous experience of abuse played into it \u2013 is ultimately gratifying for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Gadd\u2019s layered and vulnerable performance anchors the show, and serves as the perfect foil for the brilliant Jessica Gunning \u2013 who plays his increasingly menacing stalker Martha \u2013 to truly shine and chew scenery at the same time. Best visuals -\u00a0\u2018Ripley\u2019 In a very different way from the villainous Harkonnen family in \u201cDune\u201d \u2013 but still depicting a nefarious villain nonetheless \u2013 the black-and-white Netflix series \u201cRipley\u201d can draw you in at practically any juncture, with stunningly ornate stylistic details and seaside Italian locations that are gasp-inducing maybe partially because they lack color. You could take screenshots from almost any scene and frame them as fine art, and the show \u2013 an austere retelling of the Patricia Highsmith novel after Anthony Minghella\u2019s far more colorful (literally and figuratively) film from 1999 \u2013 has the beguiling ability to make your eyes crave its somehow comfortable, monochromatic simplicity when you\u2019re not watching it. Best sophomore season -\u00a0\u2018Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u2019 \u201cInterview\u201d has only improved on what\u2019s come before \u2013 its first season, as well as the 1994 Neil Jordan movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt \u2013 and continues to be one of the best-acted and best-written shows on TV, while also remaining the juiciest. Vamps have never been more compelling than the iterations of the Anne Rice characters depicted here. Alternating between notes that are tragic, beautiful and sometimes hilarious, it\u2019s got a bit of everything. Which means its no surprise that AMC announced a third season renewal just this week. \u2013 Scottie Andrew Best cameo -\u00a0Carrot Top on \u2018Hacks\u2019 When Mr. Top (real name Scott Thompson, who while you weren\u2019t looking has become a major fixture in Las Vegas) comes out on screen in the second episode of this well-received third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d double-takes abound as to whether that\u2019s \u201creally him.\u201d His commitment in the scene is top notch, and stick around for the post-show featurette to watch him take director notes and do great line readings. Honorable mentions go to Dierdre Hall playing herself, sort of, as Paul W. Downs\u2019 mother in the Christmas episode, along with Christopher Lloyd as her maybe-new paramour. \u201cHacks\u201d also enjoys featured guests J. Smith-Cameron from \u201cSuccession,\u201d who finally gives (great) face to Kathy \u2013 Deborah\u2019s detested and two-timing sister \u2013 and Helen Hunt as a ball-busting network exec. Honorable mentions: Best documentary portrait of a living artist -\u00a0\u201cSteve! (Martin): A documentary in two pieces\u201d Best unabashed romance series -\u00a0\u201cOne Day\u201d Best mindless guilty summer reality obsession -\u00a0\u201cSummer House\u201d Best mystery - \u201cMonsieur Spade\u201d MUSIC Best musical genre reinvention - Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 A truly monocultural moment in music, Queen Bey\u2019s landmark eighth studio album took the old \u2013 like the Beatles\u2019 \u201cBlackbird\u201d and Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene\u201d \u2013 and made it new and vital again. It shined a light on both trailblazers and up-and-coming artists that normally aren\u2019t associated with the ever-changing genre that is \u201ccountry,\u201d while betraying a very personal story from Beyonc\u00e9 herself about her own experience in the music world as an artist of color. Best album that\u2019s definitely not for everyone - Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018Only God Was Above Us\u2019 There are few immediately hummable songs on the new record that call to mind \u201cHarmony Hall\u201d off of their last album in 2019, and the instrumentation is rich and complex and strangely captivating, like the band wanted to stuff as many distinctive sounds into each song as they could. And their trademark clever wordplay is very much on display in songs like \u201cGen-X Cops.\u201d \u2013 Brandon Griggs Best breakout - Chappell Roan While her debut album \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d was released late last year, Roan has been steadily gaining attention ever since \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 with viral performances at Coachella, the Governors Ball and Bonnaroo, along with a wonderful (and also very viral) set on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series in March. With a queer-centric performance style that is very drag-inspired, her latest single \u201cGood Luck Babe!\u201d epitomizes her fiercely independent, raw and authentic vibe. Plus, rock legend Elton John has already given his seal of approval. We\u2019re so in.  \u2013 Scottie Andrew and Alli Rosenbloom BOOKS \u2018Margo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u2019 by Rufi Thorpe Soon to be a TV series starring Elle Fanning, this novel \u2013 following a young, single, new mother with no job who joins OnlyFans and begins creating sexual content to stay afloat \u2013 toys with our perceptions of power and morality. What does it mean to be a good person, and who gets to decide? Over the course of the book, readers see Margo desperately trying to survive her situation, contending with the difficult \u2013 and sometimes unconventional \u2013 choices she makes in order to do so. \u2013 Leah Asmelash \u2018Sociopath: A Memoir\u2019 by Patric Gagne The release of \u201cRipley\u201d in April coincided with the arrival of the memoir\u00a0\u201cSociopath,\u201d\u00a0which offers a quite different case for demythologizing what it means to be a sociopath. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who\u2019s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and\u00a0argues that\u00a0the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed. \u2013 Sara Stewart PODCAST Best and most hilarious podcast about nothing in particular - \u2018The Bald and the Beautiful\u2019 The beloved queens from \u201cDrag Race\u201d Trixie and Katya blather on about nothing, and it\u2019s just everything. Their conversations get extremely raunchy and graphic, so be warned, but there are few funnier people on the planet than these two drag legends. \u2013 Scottie Andrew", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_16_entertainment_twisters-film-interviews-climate-change", "text": "Like its titular tornados, \u201cTwisters\u201d blasts through a lot in its 122-minute runtime. A summer blockbuster with a surprising amount of brains to match Glen Powell\u2019s brawn, it features subplots that are signs of the times \u2013 disaster capitalists; the Faustian bargain between scientists and financiers \u2013 and a deluge of imagery portraying lives and livelihoods threatened by nature\u2019s awesome power. But two words you won\u2019t hear from any of its characters are \u201cclimate change.\u201d \u201cI just wanted to make sure that with the movie, we don\u2019t ever feel like (it) is putting forward any message,\u201d director Lee Isaac Chung explained in an interview with CNN. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like films are meant to be message-oriented.\u201d To his credit, there is some scientific justification for the omission, too. Generally, scientists are the least certain about the connection between tornadoes and climate change as it\u2019s unclear how warming temperatures are changing storms themselves or the outbreaks. However, evidence is growing\u00a0of the potential impact of planet-warming pollution. Recent studies have showed rotating, supercell thunderstorms that produce tornadoes are becoming more frequent in parts of the US outside so-called Tornado Alley, including in the Southeast and Midwest. They are also becoming more frequent in seasons that aren\u2019t the traditional severe storm season, and\u00a0recent December outbreaks\u00a0have proved particularly deadly. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen tornadoes like this before,\u201d says Javi, Anthony Ramos\u2019 entrepreneurial storm chaser, in one scene. He goes on to convince old friend Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) to join his research team, promising \u201cWe can save lives.\u201d In the film, ever-more destructive tornados carve up increasingly urbanized areas of Oklahoma. \u201cI think what we are doing is showing the reality of what\u2019s happening on the ground \u2026 we don\u2019t shy away from saying that things are changing,\u201d Lee added. He name-checked Maura Tierney\u2019s character Cathy, mother of Kate, as a voice for all this. Cathy, a local farmer, gripes that storms and floods are becoming more frequent, and the price of wheat more expensive, while stopping short of citing climate change. \u201cI wanted to make sure that we are never creating a feeling that we\u2019re preaching a message, because that\u2019s certainly not what I think cinema should be about,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI think it should be a reflection of the world.\u201d If it is cinema\u2019s M.O. to show not tell, then Lee has the prerogative to show us what he wants \u2013 like a tornado ripping through a power station, sucking up the ensuing fire and setting the sky ablaze. However, for a film populated by scientists and clued-in citizens to not mention climate change is a little like the twisters themselves: there\u2019s a hole at the center. Nevertheless, this was a personal and earnest endeavor for the director, who built upon a screenplay by Mark L. Smith (\u201cThe Revenant\u201d) and story by Joseph Kosinski (\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d). Lee was raised on a farm in western Arkansas, just across the border with Oklahoma. His upbringing (which he drew on for 2020\u2019s \u201cMinari\u201d) included an early run-in with a tornado, when he was forced to seek refuge in a car as his family didn\u2019t have a storm shelter. \u201cWhen you have brushes with extreme weather as a child, anything that feels larger than life and dangerous \u2026 (leaves) a very big imprint,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sense of awe and wonder was something that I really wanted to preserve in this film \u2013 that it\u2019s not just a summer blockbuster about running from tornadoes and hiding away,\u201d he added. \u201cI wanted to make sure that we\u2019re also revering and honoring the beauty of that power.\u201d \u2018Everybody wants the cow\u2019 For Lee, an avowed fan of the original \u201cTwister\u201d (1996), entering this world was a dream come true. \u201cThat film made that research and science feel like an adventure in many ways. That\u2019s what I wanted this film to do,\u201d he explained. But while he peppers a few loving homages to Jan de Bont\u2019s blockbuster in his own movie, he stopped short of one: the flying cow. \u201cEverybody wants the cow,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey think they want the cow. But I promise you, you would be disappointed if there was a cow.\u201d \u201cAny time I talk to anyone about that original \u2018Twisters\u2019 they would say, \u2018Oh yeah, the big flying cow movie.\u2019 I felt like I would hate to make a movie, update it, and just hear, \u2018Oh yes, you made the new flying cow movie.\u2019 So that was it \u2013 that was the decision.\u201d The production got more than it bargained for, shooting on location during tornado season in spring 2023. \u201cBeing in Oklahoma, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Ramos. \u201cThere were days where the sun was out, (the) sky was blue, clear, and then boom. The clouds, they just descend upon you, and then the wind starts blowing, and you\u2019re like, what is happening now?!\u201d \u201cMaking a \u2018Twisters\u2019 movie in Tornado Alley during storm season, tornado season, it\u2019s kind of perfect. It really rubbed off on this movie,\u201d said Powell. \u201cIt\u2019s this very specific place in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cEverybody that lives there has kind of pride in the weather. Everybody talks like a meteorologist, everybody\u2019s weirdly just so knowledgeable about what\u2019s happening and how it\u2019s happening.\u201d Powell plays the charming Tyler Owens, a scoundrel with a heart of gold chasing tornados for social media clicks and adjacent revenue. Some of the extras in the movie were genuine storm chasers, leading to some real-life bonding. \u201cWe\u2019re on some group threads with a bunch of storm chasers, which is a delight,\u201d said Powell. \u201cWe get text messages sometimes from our friends in Oklahoma. They\u2019re like, \u2018We got something brewing down here! Get down here and come chase!\u2019\u201d Still, Lee would rather pump the breaks on encouraging any more hobbyists to hit the road. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want this film to inspire a bunch of people to just pile into their cars and pickup trucks and chase a tornado, because that would lead to a lot of dangerous activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping \u2026 if anyone\u2019s interested in chasing a tornado, they just watch \u2018Twisters\u2019 again.\u201d \u201cTwisters\u201d premieres in UK theaters on July 17 and US theaters on July 19.

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec", "text": "This year, two disparate, big-budget films will share a release date: One, an R-rated historical epic stacked with a starry cast of Oscar hopefuls. The other, a musical based on a beloved property with plenty of pink and a Billboard-friendly soundtrack. Sound familiar? With \u201cGladiator II\u201d and the first part of \u201cWicked\u201d sharing a release date, days before Thanksgiving, movie theaters are nearing their truest chance at another \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d a viral phenomenon that in 2023 drove audiences to the movie theater by the millions, leaving a massive mark in pop culture and at the box office. But what will we call it? \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal thinks \u201cGlicked\u201d (pronounced glick-id) is the portmanteau that suits the prospective double feature best. \u201c\u2019Wickiator\u2019 doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue, does it?\u201d he said in a new interview with Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI think the films couldn\u2019t be more polar opposite and kind of worked in that context previously, so fingers crossed people come out and see both films on opening weekend.\u201d But maybe we moviegoers (and Mescal) are getting ahead of ourselves. Tom Nunan, a lecturer at UCLA\u2019s School of Theater, Film and TV and the founder of the production company Bull\u2019s Eye Entertainment, isn\u2019t fully sold on \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d 2.0. Both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d were major films with astronomical hype from respected auteurs, but even the studios couldn\u2019t have predicted that audiences would make both films appointment viewing over the same weekend, he said. (\u201cBarbie\u201d was produced by Warner Bros., which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.) \u201cIt\u2019s good when studios release big titles simultaneously,\u201d Nunan told CNN. \u201cI do think that they feed off of each other \u2013\u2013\u00a0that level of excitement. I think all of those things work in both of these films\u2019 favor. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the lightning in a bottle that \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was.\u201d Stranger things have happened, though \u2013\u2013 plus, there\u2019s a \u201cStranger Things\u201d actor in the \u201cGladiator\u201d sequel, which might attract some younger audiences. But if \u201cGlicked\u201d wants to achieve \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d heights of success, the films have a few more hurdles to clear than the Oscar-winning hits of last summer. \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 and \u2018Wicked\u2019 need a fun portmanteau First things first \u2013\u2013\u00a0\u201dBarbenheimer\u201d had a killer portmanteau. If the studios behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d want to emulate the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, they might want to turn to the movie lovers who helped coin the term that turned last year\u2019s summer flicks into a double feature. The Columbia Journalism Review credits awards pundit Matt Neglia with using \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d first in April 2023, but it quickly spread across the internet wherever movie fans lurked. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d wasn\u2019t clunky, and there was never any question which films \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d referred to \u2014\u00a0the same cannot be said just yet of \u201cGlicked,\u201d \u201cWickiator\u201d or the even uglier \u201cGladicked.\u201d It should be noted that after the smashing success of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer, no release weekends have seen the same double-feature draw, though musings of \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d and \u201cGarfuriosa\u201d pairings did make the rounds online. Those were more jokes about how two seemingly incompatible films could reach the same audiences than genuine attempts at creating a viral trend \u2014\u00a0in no world does the \u00fcber-graphic \u201cSaw X\u201d pair well with the kid-friendly \u201cPaw Patrol: The Mighty Movie.\u201d For now, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d simply haven\u2019t dominated the cultural conversation yet in the same way \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d did. But there\u2019s still time \u2014\u00a0they don\u2019t hit theaters until November 22. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019s\u2019 appeal was mystery Part of the appeal of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was wanting to see it as soon as possible to join the cultural conversation about two of the biggest movies of the year. It helped that we knew so little about both films before their premieres, Nunan said. Aside from a few paparazzi shots of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling rollerblading through Venice Beach, we knew virtually nothing about \u201cBarbie\u201d before it came out. And \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d while based in history, was still a Christopher Nolan film, so its marketing was mostly mysterious and teased major moments without revealing too much of its majesty. But both films had been hyped for over a year before their releases, thanks to marketing that kept much of the secrets of both films but offered fans just enough to keep them excited. A well-timed trailer here and a smart social campaign there \u2013\u2013\u00a0like those \u201cBarbie\u201d headshots with the quippy captions or the ominous live countdown clocks used on billboards and in trailers for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013\u2013\u00a0only made fans more ravenous ahead of the release date, Nunan said. There\u2019s less mystery with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II.\u201d The former is one of the most popular musicals of the century and the fourth-longest running on Broadway \u2013\u2013\u00a0millions have already seen it onstage or read the novel upon which it\u2019s based, so there are fewer surprises in store for audiences, Nunan said. And though \u201cGladiator\u201d won best picture among other Oscars, it came out 24 years ago. \u201cNeither of these franchises are fresh to the audience,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cThey\u2019re both known entities versus the unlimited potential of \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019\u201d Familiarity and continuations of franchises decades later can work \u2014\u00a0\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d was the first huge success since Covid-19 kneecapped movie theaters and spoke to viewers beyond those who\u2019d seen the original \u201cTop Gun\u201d back in 1986, Nunan said. But whether audiences will seek out that nostalgia again is harder to predict. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 had an air of prestige Another \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d advantage was both films\u2019 sublime pairing of director and subject matter. Here was indie staple and Oscar nominee Greta Gerwig helming her biggest film yet about the country\u2019s most famous doll \u2013\u2013 even those less familiar with her work were eager to see whether she could pull off \u201cBarbie.\u201d (The consensus was that she did.) \u201cOppenheimer\u201d director Christopher Nolan also has a distinct style and a dedicated fanbase, which has cemented Nolan as a reliable box office draw, with six of his 12 films making between half a billion to over $1 billion worldwide. The best picture-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d almost cracked a billion. The \u201cartistic audacity\u201d that both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d promised was thrilling in its own right, Nunan said, and part of what drove the more hardcore film fans to the theater for repeat viewings. And that\u2019s the test for a true blockbuster, he said: Whether viewers find it worth it to return and pay to see the same film again and again. The critical and commercial track records for the directors behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are less consistent, Nunan said, which could make a difference in the cultural and box-office impact they have. The prolific Ridley Scott of \u201cGladiator II\u201d has made classics like \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cThelma and Louise.\u201d But his more recent films haven\u2019t \u201cmoved the needle\u201d like his earlier work, Nunan said. Last year\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d and 2021\u2019s \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d made decent money but earned middling reviews; 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Last Duel,\u201d though lauded, was declared a \u201cbomb\u201d by trade publications. \u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu is perhaps best known for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d which was a hit with audiences in 2018, though his last film, 2021\u2019s adaptation of the musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d was beset by Covid-era box office challenges. Musicals like \u2018Wicked\u2019 can be tough sells It will be a harder road for \u201cWicked\u201d to excel than \u201cBarbie\u201d before it, Nunan said \u2013\u2013\u00a0movie musicals are a tougher sell with audiences, even those adapted from popular properties. (See: \u201cCats\u201d flopping in 2019, even though it was based on one of the longest-running musicals of all time and featured the world-conquering superstar Taylor Swift.) \u201cI think the fact that \u2018Wicked\u2019 is a musical actually limits its long term box office appeal,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cWicked\u201d is also a full-fledged musical where \u201cBarbie\u201d was marketed as a comedy that happened to feature a few impactful musical numbers led by a game Ryan Gosling, and even those numbers were revealed much later in the pre-release campaign, he said. There are exceptions to the movie musical rule, though: Just this year, another musical based on familiar IP did solid numbers \u2014 \u201cMean Girls,\u201d a film adaptation of the Broadway musical based on the 2004 film, made over $100 million in theaters. \u2018Glicked\u2019 does have star power As with \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before them, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d have star power in spades. The Roman Empire-set epic has a cast full of \u201cinternet boyfriends,\u201d the men for whom countless fans have pined since their breakout performances: Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn, to name three. Mescal starred in the pandemic-era series \u201cNormal People\u201d and became an Oscar nominee for \u201cAftersun\u201d at 27; the seasoned Pascal reached new heights of heartthrobbery with HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and Quinn appeared in the most recent season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d one of the most-watched Netflix series of all time. Scott\u2019s upcoming film also boasts a star so stratospherically charismatic that the New York Times named him the greatest actor of the 21st century: Denzel Washington, who nearly runs away with the trailer. And \u201cWicked\u201d is anchored by one of the premier pop divas of our time, Ariana Grande, who plays Galinda (yes, Ga-linda), the blonde foil to Cynthia Erivo\u2019s green-skinned Elphaba. Grande hasn\u2019t played a major leading role in a film yet, and she\u2019s only appeared in cameos and bit parts over the last decade. But it\u2019s possible that star power doesn\u2019t play as large a role as it once did in getting butts in seats, Nunan said. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, who played crucial supporting roles in \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d starred in \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d earlier this spring, which faltered at the box office and was sent to VOD just weeks after it hit theaters. \u201cI don\u2019t know, with these blockbuster tentpole films, if the casting is as important as the movie itself,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the quality and execution of the film.\u201d He cited \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which featured several major stars in supporting roles, like Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey, Jr. Their inclusion in the cast maybe lent the film an air of prestige, but he\u2019s not sure that any of them were the sole reason people saw the film. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us went to see because Matt and Emily and Robert were in it, but it helped,\u201d he said. There was something alchemical about the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d moment of last summer that exceeded all predictions about how popular both films would prove. It might have been easy to assume that viewers of one film wouldn\u2019t want to see the other since they were so dissimilar, Nunan said, but \u201caudiences proved the studios wrong\u201d and went to see both. \u201cThat summer, \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was meeting on so many levels of special,\u201d he said. Some magic just can\u2019t be replicated, though there\u2019s still a few months for \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d\u00a0to drum up the same must-see prestige as the films that dominated the summer of 2023. What remains to be seen is whether fans who see the films as a double feature will wear gladiator skirts and witch hats to the theater.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_entertainment_disillusioned-with-biden-hollywood-is-now-energized-by-kamala-harris", "text": "After weeks of disarray, the Democratic Party finally faced a welcome problem: Too many celebrities were calling. Following an uncharacteristic dry spell of celebrity support for President Joe Biden that had persisted for months as he sought a second term, Hollywood has been reignited in full force and is ready to back the party\u2019s new presumptive nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, as she fights against former President Donald Trump. \u201cMy phone is blowing up,\u201d a source close to the Harris campaign told CNN of the sudden influx of Hollywood calls. \u201cI don\u2019t even have time to answer my phone.\u201d One celebrity publicist told CNN that campaign managers are \u201ctypically begging\u201d talent representatives to get their clients to participate in politics, but said that over the past 48 hours since Biden stepped aside and endorsed Harris, it\u2019s nearly impossible to get through to the White House. \u201cUsually I\u2019m asking my clients,\u201d another celebrity publicist said. \u201cNobody had to ask. People were like, \u2018What do I do, and how do I help?\u2019\u201d The mood over the past few days in Hollywood has completely shifted from a long blackout period where celebrities were reluctant to publicly support the president, recognizing that neither candidate \u2013 Biden or Trump \u2013 were particularly popular and could potentially alienate their fanbases. Even before Biden\u2019s disastrous June 27 performance at the CNN presidential debate, numerous Hollywood and DC sources told CNN that the Biden campaign was\u00a0struggling to obtain celebrity support\u00a0in a polarized world. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realized how worried they were until they had hope,\u201d said one Democratic strategist with deep ties in the entertainment industry. For Hollywood, Harris is that hope. Hollywood\u2019s biggest political moment since Obama A handful of entertainment professionals, all involved with fundraising efforts or talent representation, told CNN that Hollywood is energized by Harris and sees her as a viable candidate who is the right messenger at the right time. Plans for Harris\u2019 first presidential fundraiser in Los Angeles are already underway, a source said, adding that multiple television, film and music executives have already raised their hand to host an event. A briefing for the entertainment industry has been scheduled this week, according to a Zoom invitation from the Harris 2024 Campaign Entertainment Surrogates, which was shared with CNN by a top agent who plans to attend. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen so many people that I know here and elsewhere so enlivened by a moment in politics since Obama\u2019s original convention speech,\u201d producer Greg Berlanti told CNN. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s selfless act, combined with the kind of change and optimism and turning of the page that Kamala represents has reengaged so many people I know in this election and they are ready to fight for so many of the values that VP Harris has been fighting for her whole career.\u201d Berlanti \u2013 the creator of shows like \u201cEverwood\u201d and You,\u201d and the director of Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum\u2019s new film, \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d \u2013 has hosted Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff in his home during the Biden-Harris administration. He\u2019s one of many Hollywood power players who have already been acquainted with Harris and supported her political career from her 2016 Senate run to her 2020 presidential run to her current role as vice president. Harris, a California native, has longstanding relationships within the entertainment industry and has garnered public support this week from the likes of Shonda Rhimes, Jessica Alba, Cher, Spike Lee, Viola Davis, Amy Schumer, Kerry Washington and Lynda Carter, who posted a photo of Harris in front of a \u201cWonder Woman\u201d mural \u2013 likely\u00a0a nod to what will be her historic run as the first\u00a0Black woman and the first Asian American\u00a0leading\u00a0a major party ticket. George Clooney, who loudly called for Biden\u2019s exit,\u00a0endorsed Harris, first telling CNN he is \u201cexcited to do whatever we can to support Vice President Harris in her historic quest.\u201d Harris also appears to have the support of one of the biggest stars in the world: Beyonc\u00e9, who, CNN exclusively reported,\u00a0gave Harris permission\u00a0to use her anthem \u201cFreedom\u201d as a campaign song, although she has not made an official endorsement. \u201cWe\u2019re back to where we were before, and that\u2019s powerful,\u201d a political strategist who is working with A-list stars this election season, told CNN. \u201cIt would have been fair to say that this very strong element of celebrity endorsements in the political cycle was on the sidelines, but they all put on their jerseys and are ready to go.\u201d \u201cThey love the president and have so much respect for them,\u201d this individual added. \u201cBut there is clearly a different energy.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing unprecedented enthusiasm for VP Harris in every corner of our country,\u201d Laura Brounstein, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, told CNN. \u201cShe has been a leading voice on the issues that really matter to all Americans, including the need to restore our reproductive rights, protecting unions, and addressing climate change. It\u2019s encouraging that her message is resonating in Hollywood, Milwaukee and across the country.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ll do a lot better than Hulk Hogan\u2019 While plans for next month\u2019s Democratic National Convention are still in the early stages, according to a source close to the Harris campaign, several Hollywood publicists and agents told CNN the DNC will be star-studded with one source sharing that conversations with an A-list pop star are currently underway about a possible performance. \u201cNobody was going,\u201d a publicity executive said about the DNC with Biden atop of the ticket. But now? \u201cThe billboard at convention will look a lot more robust from the artist community now than it would have \u2014 and that\u2019s an understatement. I don\u2019t know how you grade almost nothing to full support, but we\u2019ll do a lot better than Hulk Hogan.\u201d Hogan was one of Trump\u2019s few Hollywood supporters who showed up at the Republican National Convention last week to endorse the former president, along with UFC chief Dana White; model Amber Rose; reality star Savannah Chrisley; Kid Rock, who performed on the final night of the convention, and country star Jason Aldean who sat alongside Trump in the VIP box at the RNC. If celebrity endorsements were a gauge to win the race, Harris would win in a landslide. But Trump, whose poll numbers far outsized Biden in several swing states, partly leading to Biden\u2019s withdrawal, has never been well-liked in Hollywood, and he has used that to his advantage. Though Trump is a billionaire ex-reality star, part of his appeal to many voters is criticizing wealthy celebrities for, what he says, is being out of touch with reality. As the nature of celebrity influence is changing, it remains to be seen if star power will move the needle this election cycle. It didn\u2019t in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton. This year, perhaps the most important group of voters to target is young Americans who, quite frankly, don\u2019t care much about Hollywood stars like Clooney. At 81 years old, Biden struggled to garner Gen Z support, but Harris has rapidly gotten the attention of the TikTok generation, thanks to British pop star Charli XCX, whose\u00a0\u201cKamala IS brat\u201d tweet\u00a0ignited a social media firestorm and propelled the vice president into the stratosphere of internet culture. Whether the fascination with Harris on TikTok will translate into first-time voters showing up to the polls is unclear. But so far, the support from Young Hollywood is promising with some of the most influential stars on the planet, including Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato, posting photos of Harris alongside a link to encourage their hundreds of millions of followers to register to vote. (Lovato, who sang at Biden\u2019s 2021 inauguration, hadn\u2019t said anything about Biden this cycle \u2013 but on Sunday, the singer quickly took to Instagram to share her endorsement of Harris.) Hollywood braces for a tough race ahead In the first 24 hours after Biden bowed out, Harris broke fundraising records, hauling in a staggering $81 million in a single day, according to her campaign. But money and TikToks aren\u2019t votes. Even with the overwhelming support from leaders in the Democratic Party, grassroots organizations and Hollywood, every individual who spoke with CNN acknowledged that the race against Trump won\u2019t be easy. \u201cEveryone understands that this will be a real fight,\u201d a Democratic strategist said. \u201cBut even if Kamala loses \u2014 which is a distinct possibility \u2013 it\u2019s going to help our down-ballot candidates. There will be increased enthusiasm for the House and Senate because of Kamala.\u201d That enthusiasm was evident on Sunday, just hours after Biden stepped down and endorsed Harris when the group Win With Black Women organized an impromptu call that garnered nearly 45,000 Black women and raised $1.5 million in three hours. \u201cBlack women in entertainment, Black women in media, Black women in tech will be out like never before,\u201d said SiriusXM host Bevy Smith, who attended Sunday night\u2019s Zoom and says the call was full of actors, directors, producers, media figures and political stars. \u201cBlack women turned Georgia blue. Now that we have one of our own? Please. We have one job to do \u2014 and it\u2019s to elect Kamala Harris.\u201d Political strategists who spoke to CNN believe the campaign will market Harris around her stark differences from Trump, rather than lean into the historic nature of her run, as a woman of color who can break barriers. \u201cPeople are very excited to see her out there, and they love the narrative of the prosecutor against the felon,\u201d one strategist said. Strategically marketing Harris over the next few weeks will be crucial, according to an agent who is in frequent communication with top donors across the business. \u201cThere is a race that is on over the next couple of weeks of who will be able to define her nationally \u2014 the Democrats or Trump. If they\u2019re able to do it before we can, I think she\u2019s going to have a very tough time,\u201d the agent said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough race,\u201d the agent added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be dark and nasty. That\u2019s what our politics have become \u2013 but we can\u2019t let that us stop us because the stakes are too high.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/entertainment/disillusioned-with-biden-hollywood-is-now-energized-by-kamala-harris/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_a-quiet-place-day-one-review", "text": "Like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d pries opens the door to a world with a host of possibilities, some of them \u2013 including the premise of a new prequel subtitled \u201cDay One\u201d \u2013 already touched upon in the two previous movies. Set in New York, the latest film begins from a slightly unexpected premise, but then efficiently spins it to yield additional horror while giving theater-goers every reason to keep their mouths shut. The 2021 sequel actually opened with a muscular flashback sequence to that moment when the grotesque, sound-sensitive alien invaders descended upon Earth, so the new film\u2019s tag line, \u201cExperience the day the world went quiet,\u201d reflects a bit of a conceptual echo. Introducing new characters, the main wrinkle in the new prequel \u2013 and it\u2019s a questionable one at first \u2013 involves telling the story from the perspective of Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a dying woman enduring hospice care with her cat, who serves as the de facto guide to all hell breaking loose. At a time when people are dying right and left, \u201cDay One\u201d thus uses a woman already close to death as the audience\u2019s surrogate. She interacts with various people along the way, but it\u2019s a fair stretch until she encounters the most significant one, Eric (Joseph Quinn, on a genre tear with \u201cStranger Things\u201d behind him and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d to come), who doesn\u2019t want to leave her side however much she tries \u2013 quietly \u2013 to chase him away. While the Emily Blunt- and John Krasinski-anchored family\u2019s sign-language fluency gave the original movie its gateway into an original-feeling twist on minimalist horror, this third film relies heavily on Nyong\u2019o\u2019s facial reactions, and it\u2019s hard to think of an actor who can say more with an expression. Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\u201cPig\u201d), who shares story credit with original director/producer Krasinski (whose summer dance card also includes \u201cIF\u201d), the film does let viewers see more of the horrifying creatures, although their lightning-quick attacks often keeps those images brief. There\u2019s also the matter of how the invaders manage to seemingly be everywhere at once, to the point where the slightest sound on screen provokes a sense of dread. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d takes advantage of those attributes, and even finds a way to use Sam\u2019s condition, somewhat awkwardly, to consider our humanity. If there\u2019s one clunky flourish, it\u2019s been clear going back to \u201cAlien\u201d that cats and sci-fi horror don\u2019t mix, and while her feline companion provides a periodic source of unpredictable tension, it\u2019s one of those devices that probably should have been left in the litter box. Unfortunately, everything that enjoys a modicum of success these days triggers talk of its own \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is no exception. Practically speaking, \u201cDay One\u201d takes a step toward demonstrating that this perilous post-invasion world offers no shortage of streets and hallways to tiptoe down, where nobody needs to ask \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d when they are greeted with silence. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/a-quiet-place-day-one-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

British pop singer Charli XCX has entered the virtual chat, posting \u201ckamala IS brat\u201d on X on Sunday. If you don\u2019t understand what that means, you are both not alone and in a safe space. Welcome to \u201cBratology 101.\u201d What is a \u2018brat?\u2019 \u201cBrat\u201d is less a noun than it is a concept, though it is also a thing. The title of Charli XCX\u2019s sixth studio album, she envisions a \u201cbrat\u201d as someone who has a \u201cpack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things some times,\u201d she explained in a video shared on TikTok. \u201cWho feels like herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it\u2019s brat. You\u2019re brat. That\u2019s brat.\u201d Many theorize that it is the antithesis to the \u201cclean\u201d and \u201chighly groomed\u201d aspect so often on display by social media influencers. There is even a \u201cbrat\u201d color, a very specific shade of chartreuse, which the internet has all but declared as the color of the summer. The singer made it her album color and has explained that it\u2019s \u201ckind of the idea of making something like quite disgusting and turning it into this thing you know people are going to look at quite a lot and think about and ask, you know, why that green?\u201d Team Harris\u2019 response Harris\u2019 camp responded in a way that signaled to the internet they understood the compliment and are embracing it. Those visiting the official Kamala HQ account on X, which links to her official site, are met with a background photo in the \u201cbrat\u201d green color and the vice president\u2019s name in the same font as sported on Charli XCX\u2019s album. Gen Z voters If Harris secures the Democratic nomination, she\u2019ll be working for every vote in the race against former President Donald Trump. Younger voters could prove essential to the outcome of the 2024 election. David Hogg, a 24-year-old activist and co-founder of the March for Our Lives movement formed after a mass shooting while he was a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, shared Charli XCX\u2019s post on Sunday. \u201cThe amount this single tweet may have just done for the youth vote is not insignificant,\u201d Hogg wrote. Gen Z not only grew up on the internet, but they have also shown they know how to use social media to organize to push for change. Soon after President Biden endorsed Harris, the internet was flooded with meme photos and videos of everything from Harris dancing to coconut trees. That latter came to be thanks to remarks Harris gave in May 2023 during a swearing-in ceremony of commissioners at an initiative focused on expanding educational opportunities for the Hispanic community. Harris spoke about \u201ca difference between equality and equity\u201d and personalized it with a family story. \u201cNone of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother used to \u2013 she would give us a hard time sometimes \u2013 and she would say to us, \u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\u2019\u201d The internet responded with coconut memes that again gained traction on Sunday as a way to show support. The Harris campaign returned the sentiment with a line on the Harris HQ X account that reads: \u201cProviding context.\u201d Some have complained that even if the coconut memes are well meaning, they might also be perceived as racist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/entertainment/charli-xcx-kamala-harris-brat-meme/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Fakir died of heart failure in Detroit on Monday, surrounded by his wife Piper and loved ones, according to a statement provided by a spokesperson for the family. \u201cOur hearts are heavy as we mourn the loss of a trailblazer, icon and music legend who, through his 70-year music career, touched the lives of so many as he continued to tour until the end of 2023, and officially retired this year,\u201d his family statement read. \u201cAs the last living founding member of the iconic The Four Tops music group, we find solace in Duke\u2019s legacy living on through his music for generations to come.\u201d Fakir was the last surviving original member of the quartet, which was known for songs like \u201cI Can\u2019t Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\u201d and \u201cReach Out I\u2019ll Be There.\u201d The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. Born in Detroit, Fakir developed a love of music as a teen while performing with his local church and school choirs, according to a 2012 interview with NPR. In high school, he began to play music with his future Four Tops band members Levi Stubbs, Renaldo \u201cObie\u201d Benson and Lawrence Payton. In 1954, they formed the first iteration of their band in Detroit called the Four Aims, according to a Motown Museum biography of the group. They later changed their name to the Four Tops and were signed to Motown Records in 1964 by famed record executive Berry Gordy, the biography read. \u201c[O]nce we started singing, our whole perspective of life changed,\u201d Fakir said in a 2022 interview with The Detroit News. \u201cWe just started looking at the beauty of life and traveling and being able to sing to the world and making people happy.\u201d Their big break came in 1964 when they released \u201cBaby I Need Your Loving,\u201d a song that Rolling Stone listed among the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and still makes appearances in pop culture despite being released decades ago. With Fakir singing tenor, the quartet followed up with their 1965 hit \u201cI Can\u2019t Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch),\u201d which became the band\u2019s first No. 1 hit song. The Four Tops are also known for songs like \u201cReach Out I\u2019ll Be There,\u201d released in 1966, and other tracks like \u201cIt\u2019s the Same Old Song,\u201d \u201cShake Me, Wake Me (When It\u2019s Over)\u201d and \u201cStanding in the Shadows of Love.\u201d The quartet performed together for over forty years. In the 1970s, they released their hit song \u201cAin\u2019t No Woman (Like The One I\u2019ve Got)\u201d and went on to release several more studio albums together in the decades that followed. \u201cWe loved each other, we loved singing with each other, we loved making music, we loved entertaining people, and we realized we can make people happy,\u201d Fakir said in 2022 of his late bandmates in the 2022 interview.

{"id": "2024_07_18_entertainment_twister-generation-of-storm-chasers", "text": "When it comes to influential films in the world of climate research and weather reporting, few (if any) can hold a candle to \u201cTwister,\u201d Jan de Bont\u2019s epic action movie that has spawned a sequel blowing through theaters this weekend. When the film came out in 1996, Dr. Elizabeth Smith, then not quite 6 years old, went to the theater to see it with her parents \u201cand I apparently lost my mind about it and became obsessed,\u201d she told CNN in an email interview. When it came out on VHS, she remembers \u201cwatching it over-and-over-and-over the way some kids watched things like \u2018The Little Mermaid.\u2019\u201d Smith, who keeps an enamel pin of the \u201cTwister\u201d VHS on the lanyard she wears at work, is now a research meteorologist at NOAA\u2019s National Severe Storms Laboratory \u2013 an organization that even gets a mention in the de Bont film. \u201cI also remember certain concepts really imprinting on me,\u201d she told CNN of \u201cTwister\u2019s\u201d impact. \u201cSpecifically in the early chase scenes, Jo and Bill (Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton) are in the truck, and they recognize mammatus clouds in the sky overhead. They indicate that this is an omen for bad things to come. I have very clear memories of plastering my face to the backseat window watching, just in case the mammatus appeared so I would be READY.\u201d Many took their interest in the subject one step further, with enrollment in undergraduate weather research and meteorology programs seeing a notable bump. Academic research articles on these trends sometimes refer to this as the \u201cTwister Effect.\u201d \u201cA few years after \u2018Twister,\u2019 enrollment numbers at (the University of Oklahoma\u2019s) School of Meteorology \u2013 applications doubled,\u201d Dr. Harold E. Brooks, an affiliate professor at the university and senior research scientist at NSSL, said. Brooks \u2013 who served as a technical advisor on \u201cTwister\u201d \u2013 also pointed to the film\u2019s impact felt outside of the US, in places like Finland that didn\u2019t have research and data collection for extreme storms like tornadoes until the release of that movie. CNN weather reporter Brandon Miller is also among those who got sucked into the meteorology field by \u201cTwister.\u201d He remembers seeing the movie as a child with his father, who was a weather-enthusiast. \u201cHe loved the weather and he and I would always go outside and watch big storms together when I was a kid,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI was obsessed with weather and tornadoes were my favorite type of weather, and back then there wasn\u2019t much of an opportunity to consume that type of content \u2013 so I just remember being in awe of the entire thing.\u201d For Smith, the legacy of the original \u201cTwister\u201d is a complicated one. Her line of work closely mirrors that of Hunt\u2019s character Jo Harding in the first film and she will often find herself hauling scientific instruments in the bed of a pickup or a tow-behind trailer. Noting that she is \u201cunfortunately, one of very few women doing this professionally,\u201d Smith described how \u201cit is not uncommon for people, both colleagues and strangers at a truck stop, to jokingly call me \u2018Jo\u2019 while I\u2019m working that way.\u201d \u201cThat brings up some complicated stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWas it impressive that films like \u2018Twister\u2019 and \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 (featuring Laura Dern as a paleobotanist) were showcasing women scientists almost 30 years ago? Yes! But in reality Jo\u2019s storyline is still reduced to a he-gets-the-girl in the end plot \u2013 wet tank tops and all.\u201d Expectations are running high for \u201cTwisters,\u201d the Lee Isaac Chung-directed new installment which is coming out this week and stars Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell. To the generation of storm chasers who largely dedicated their lives to the science of weather because of the 1996 movie, the hope is that the new entry will get more than a few things right. Safety and science matter For starters, experts hope safety will be emphasized amid all the gasp-inducing (and very windy) set-pieces. \u201cWeather is fascinating and it is beautiful, but it is also dangerous, I really hope this movie can balance all of that,\u201d Miller said. When it comes to chasing storms, the danger is twofold: there\u2019s the considerable risk posed by the extreme weather itself, as well as the dangers from too many chasers \u2013 formally trained meteorologists and otherwise \u2013 pursuing the same weather pattern, oftentimes on the same road. \u201cI am interested to see how they handle the concept of \u2018chaser convergence\u2019 and the explosion of popularity chasing has seen over recent years,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIn the first film there were really just the two teams on the roads (and they still almost collided!).\u201d Smith added that she\u2019s \u201cnervous about the massive amount of attention this will certainly bring to chasing.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, chasing is hard to do well and even harder to do well, safely,\u201d she said. Rebecca Kopelman, chief meteorologist at Iowa\u2019s News Now, echoed the sentiment. \u201cThis could potentially create more dangerous conditions in the climate of storm chasing,\u201d she said of the new movie. \u201cUnfortunately some people have gotten hurt storm chasing and it\u2019s become a more popular hobby with more and more people going out on especially on the more elevated severe risk days.\u201d Miller said the original movie \u201cgave rise to a wave of \u2018armchair\u2019 storm chasers,\u201d and mentioned how the new movie could do the same, but exponentially. \u201cThe biggest difference is nowadays everything is much more accessible to the layperson. From the radar data on your phone, to hi-res cameras and YouTube and social influencers, it can be a deadly combination when you get untrained people in the field chasing the dangerous storms trying to get the closest, craziest footage,\u201d he observed. Kopelman, who is featured on Discovery\u2019s new In the Eye of the Storm series covering derecho superstorms, added that she hopes \u201cTwisters\u201d highlights the scientific importance of storm chasing and not just doing it for the thrill.\u201d (Discovery, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) \u201cIt\u2019s still very much a need because we can\u2019t confirm tornadoes solely based on radar all of the time,\u201d she said. Smith also hopes the movie gets people excited not only about the storms themselves, but the research and science behind them. \u201cI am very excited at the prospect for people of all ages to get excited about science. There is a new opportunity for future meteorologists to bud, but not just meteorologists and not just kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a chance for all sorts of people to recognize in new ways that the natural world around them is dynamic and engaging.\u201d She added: \u201cSomething like this can be a watershed moment for kids to choose science classes, people to get curious about museums, and more. That is something to be excited about no matter what is in the movie.\u201d \u201cTwisters\u201d premieres in theaters on July 19. It is presented by Warner Bros., which like CNN is a part of Warner Bros. Discovery.

While Beyonc\u00e9 has not officially endorsed Harris in the day since President Joe Biden announced he would not seek a second term,\u00a0granting her permission to use \u201cFreedom\u201d as a campaign song indicates that\u00a0Harris has the superstar\u2019s support.

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_fly-me-to-the-moon-review-scarlett-johansson-channing-tatum", "text": "After a run of movies awash in the romance of the space program like \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cFirst Man,\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d cleverly uses the Apollo 11 mission as the backdrop to an old-style romance. Less than weighty in the comedy part of its equation, the film largely works as a vehicle for Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, even without completely sticking the landing. The movie casts Johansson as a corporate marketing specialist, which is somewhat ironic given that its marketing campaign isn\u2019t as clear as it could or should be in terms of conveying what to expect. While the story does include a subplot about staging a fake version of the moon landing \u2013 orchestrated as a back-up plan by a shadowy government operative (Woody Harrelson, again serving as one of the president\u2019s men, echoing his role in \u201cWhite House Plumbers\u201d) with ties to the Nixon administration \u2013 the heart of the film resides in the chemistry between the leads. In classic fashion, they are of course instantly drawn to each other, creating the need to erect barriers in order to keep them apart. In that sense, this is less about conspiracy theories and reality \u2013 though there\u2019s definitely an element of that woven into it \u2013 than the tension between NASA\u2019s square-jawed launch director, Cole Davis (Tatum), and Johansson\u2019s Kelly Jones, who gets recruited to \u201csell the moon\u201d to a skeptical public, leveraging her knack for bending the truth in order to close the deal. Coming almost exactly 55 years after Neil Armstrong took that \u201cone giant leap\u201d onto the lunar surface, director Greg Berlanti and writer Rose Gilroy introduce a strain of cynicism well suited to our current moment, juxtaposing that with the soaring, can-do spirit of the Apollo program. There\u2019s a crowd-pleasing quality to the combination, even if any crowds might prove short lived, inasmuch as the film\u2019s theatrical prospects (before a date on Apple TV+) amount to serving as counter-programming to the blockbuster \u201cTwisters\u201d and \u201cDeadpool\u201d sequels soon to come. A prolific TV producer, Berlanti has tilted toward romance with his forays into movies, including \u201cLove, Simon\u201d and \u201cLife as We Know It.\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d occupies a higher orbit in its ambition and star power, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that his leads look pretty celestial, while bathing in the period costumes and music of the time. After an eclectic string of roles, Johansson carries a film that might have starred someone like Faye Dunaway during the era in which it\u2019s set (think \u201cNetwork\u201d), while Tatum gets put to better use than his most recent rom-coms, the third \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cThe Lost City,\u201d admittedly not a super-high bar. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d possesses appealing virtues consciously plucked from the past, then adorns them with modern baubles. Whether that will \u201csell the moon\u201d to the moviegoing public remains to be seen, but to borrow from the song that shares its title, the pitch isn\u2019t much more complicated than an invitation to come play among the stars. \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d premieres July 12 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_07_23_entertainment_deadpool-and-wolverine-review-ryan-reynolds-hugh-jackman", "text": "Like its predecessors, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is loud, proudly vulgar and repeatedly shatters the fourth wall with gleeful naughtiness. Yet beneath the outlandishness, half-dozen belly laughs and nerd-centric beats resides sweet nostalgia for the last quarter-century of superhero movies, while demonstrating that Marvel Studios possesses the power to laugh at itself. Marvel\u2019s stewardship of Deadpool comes courtesy of what was once 20th Century Fox, which controlled the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises before Disney acquired the studio and reintegrated them into the Marvel fold. As such, the third film, offering the enormously media-friendly re-pairing of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman and their on- and off-screen bromance, serves as a valentine to the movies that Fox produced, adding up to an unusually expensive diversion to delight the midnight-screening crowd at Comic-Con. Beyond that, Reynolds\u2019 motor-mouthed Deadpool, the sword-wielding anti-hero who matches Wolverine\u2019s astonishing healing abilities, takes frequent aim at Marvel, and its highly uneven track record in the five years since the studio peaked with \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d The fact that \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d appears destined to provide the Disney unit with its first enormous hit in that time merely reinforces the point Marvel needed some kind of reset, although how far this franchise can be milked beyond its very particular niche remains to be seen. Without descending into spoilers, \u201cDeadpool\u201d revives Jackman\u2019s Wolverine after his 2017 sendoff in \u201cLogan\u201d thanks to another detour into the multiverse, where Marvel\u2019s cinematic universe has risked becoming dense to the point of convoluted. Still, unlike some of the movies and streaming series that have leveraged those infinite possibilities, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d ceaselessly mocks the absurdities associated with them, yielding some extremely funny visual gags, cameos and one-liners that indicate whether Marvel and its mastermind Kevin Feige embrace the criticisms, they have certainly heard them. The grudging combination of Deadpool and the ever-irritable Wolverine \u2013 finally adorned in his signature comic-book garb \u2013 seeking to save the former\u2019s timeline creates the backbone for a classic buddy comedy, just with a tremendous amount of carnage, including the increasingly pointless fights between two guys who can hurt each other without accomplishing much more than that. Perhaps that\u2019s why the action \u2013 and definitely the plot \u2013 play second fiddle to the rambunctiousness of the comedy, where nothing (except maybe cocaine) seems off limits, including random jokes about Jackman\u2019s busy career as a song-and-dance man and his real-life divorce. The cameos don\u2019t disappoint, although perhaps the two most significant roles beyond the central duo go to a pair of Brits fresh off prestige dramas: \u201cSuccession\u2019s\u201d Matthew Macfadyen and \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Emma Corrin. Ultimately, though, the title really says it all, with director Shawn Levy (one of five credited writers, along with Reynolds) operating as the ringmaster for a wild circus of comic-book lore and obscure movie references that will surely reward repeated viewing down the road. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d leans hard into its R rating, although as noted, the closing credits reveal its sentimental side. Just from a marketing standpoint, the promotional campaign has benefited enormously from Reynolds and Jackman\u2019s playful relationship, which, if there\u2019s any acting involved, should qualify for the public-relations version of an Academy Award. Ultimately, the movie can boast an all-too-rare quality for aspiring blockbusters: It\u2019s just plain fun. Chalk it up as one of those rare experiences where audiences should derive as much enjoyment from watching the film as its leads appeared to have had making it, in a way that mostly, if not entirely, lives up to the hype. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premieres July 26 in US theaters.

After the loss of Rhaenys (Eve Best) and the dragon Meleys, the priority for Rhaenyra is to find another dragonrider to add to her team. Among the unclaimed are Seasmoke \u2013 Rhaenyra\u2019s late husband Laenor Velaryon\u2019s (John Macmillan) dragon \u2013 plus Silverwing and Vermithor, among others. Jacaerys (Harry Collett) and Rhaenyra\u2019s seemingly genius plan to deep dive into the Targaryen family tree to find a suitable dragonrider to claim the unclaimed dragons turns into a fatal disaster. They determine that Ser Steffon Darklyn (Anthony Flanagan) is their best bet and he takes on the dangerous task with pride, but it turns out that Steffon and Seasmoke are not a match \u2013 made clear by the gray-shaded dragon when it barbecues Steffon instead of serving him. Seasmoke does eventually find its rider this week, though, with Corlys Velaryon\u2019s (Steven Toussaint) illegitimate son Addam of Hull (Clinton Liberty) being the chosen one. Speaking of Corlys, the Sea Snake accepts Rhaeynra\u2019s offer to be her Hand, a pairing that seems like it\u2019ll be favorable for Team Black. He\u2019s the first to show up to her small council meeting, donning his new hardware, and appears ready to serve. It\u2019s a win for Rhaenyra to have Corlys by her side, but she\u2019s still challenged by her annoying small council who believes she can\u2019t win this war without Daemon. Even Jacaerys expresses such doubt to his mother. \u201cIt is my fault I think that you have forgotten to fear me,\u201d Rhaenyra says, after slapping a member of her small council who chided her. Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno), however, believes that Rhaenyra has the guts to win the war without Daemon. She not only helps Rhaenyra carry out a successful plan to turn the small folk of King\u2019s Landing against the Greens, but she also gives her Queen the encouragement she needs when she reveals the origin of her scars in a moving speech. Rhaenyra and Mysaria then embrace for a hug\u2026 which then turns into a steamy, passionate kiss that we honestly did not see coming. Daemon, meanwhile, is having an identity crisis of his own as he continues to wade through the worst acid trip of his life over at Harrenhal. He is growing increasingly paranoid and disturbed by his haunting visions, the latest one being an emotional reunion with his brother, the late King Viserys (Paddy Considine). Paired with his frustration that he\u2019s failing to procure the support of the River Lords, he turns to his own tormenter Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) for help. \u201cDo nothing now,\u201d she tells Daemon. \u201cIn a few days time, the winds will shift.\u201d Elsewhere in Westeros The one person who is not having an identity crisis is Prince Regent Aemond, whose confidence as his brother\u2019s fill-in king has outgrown the massive size of his own dragon. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d airs Sunday nights on Max, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.

{"id": "2024_07_21_entertainment_barbie-one-year-anniversary-cec", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 If anything especially notable happened between late July and December of last year, I can\u2019t remember it. All I know is pink. I was too busy spending my time with \u201cBarbie.\u201d I\u2019ve seen the film upwards of 20 times since it premiered on July 21, 2023. Half of those viewings were in theaters with packed, enthusiastic crowds bedecked in pinks of all shades. It was sublime. Watching \u201cBarbie\u201d so much defined the back half of my 2023. It was a reliable escape and a consistently good time, a cultural link I shared with nearly everyone in my life and almost something like an identity I could choose myself. I\u2019ve found no such \u201cBarbie\u201d-level cinematic event in 2024. And we could surely use it: This summer is decidedly bleak. The political climate is apocalyptic. It\u2019s too hot to do almost anything other than go to the movies. Revisiting \u201cBarbie\u201d a year on, I realized I love the film less than the phenomenon. The summer of \u201cBarbie\u201d was one of my happiest, when I felt truly connected to my fellow humans. Watching the film now only makes me miss my time in Barbie Land, before everything got real. Seeing \u2018Barbie\u2019 with a crowd made me feel connected I had so badly wanted it to be good. From the moment \u201cBarbie\u201d was announced, I was hopeful that the film would deliver, and every development I could find on this mysterious film only made me more eager: The first photo of Ryan Gosling as Ken, looking like a bleach-blond, claymation version of himself; seemingly incongruous casting announcements for Will Ferrell, half the cast of \u201cSex Education,\u201d John Cena; paparazzi shots of Margot Robbie crying on a curb in a pink cowgirl ensemble. What would this film be? I excitedly watched as social media jokes about a \u201cBarbie\u201d-\u201dOppenheimer\u201d double feature (\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d) turned into an actual event people started to buy tickets for. I wrote a primer for how to best watch the two films together while obsessively searching for interviews, promos, behind-the-scenes sneak peeks \u2014\u00a0anything that would quench my \u201cBarbie\u201d thirst. Finally, the day before it hit theaters, I squeezed into a crowded screening for employees of Warner Bros. Discovery (parent company of both Warner Bros., which released \u201cBarbie,\u201d and CNN). I loved it so much that I watched it again, twice, that Saturday, bookending my sole viewing of \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d (Sorry, Nolan.) Nearly everyone in the showings for both films was in a shade of pink. And then I just kept watching. I took my partner, parents and various friends to see it on different occasions, hoping to hear them laugh when Ken tossed Barbie\u2019s \u201cIce Capades pretty practice suit and dazzling show skirt\u201d off the side of her dream house or sniff back tears when Barbie walked into her human life for the first time. And I saw it a few times by myself, too, finally comfortable to be alone in a movie theater because it didn\u2019t feel lonely. There\u2019s so much to love: An obscure joke about Pavement frontman Stephen Malkmus, Issa Rae\u2019s pronunciation of \u201cThe God-FA-ther,\u201d little fake seagulls dangling over the Barbie Land beach\u2019s hard sand, the heartbreaking recognition that passes across Robbie\u2019s face when her Barbie knows she no longer belongs in her plastic world. But I loved \u201cBarbie\u201d mostly because watching it over and over, always with packed houses, made me feel like the one who was becoming more human. \u201cBarbie\u201d is a movie about being a woman but even more about being a person \u2014\u00a0wanting to belong in the world, even when that world is routinely cruel and unsympathetic and brings feelings out of you that are perplexing and disturbing. The real world shreds up all the plans you had for your life, takes the guileless optimism of your youth and melts it like a plastic doll in a hot car. It sometimes turns you into Depression Barbie. \u201cBarbie\u201d makes it look easy to rebuild yourself amid depression \u2014\u00a0it just takes a rousing speech from America Ferrara and her bratty tween daughter who\u2019s starting to come around on the doll she earlier declared a fascist. But forcing yourself to reclaim your place in that cruel world is perhaps the toughest and most essential step in no longer being Depression Barbie. Watching \u201cBarbie\u201d again and again nudged me out of an isolation I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d imposed. Sitting in a totally packed theater for the first time, really, since the pandemic started, surrounded by people of all ages waiting to be transported and greeting each other with \u201cHi, Barbie\u201d \u2014 I would\u2019ve considered it cringeworthy once, but I got onboard. \u201cBarbie\u201d became a point of connection I could share with everyone in my life, from new friends to my hairdresser to bartenders. If I didn\u2019t have anything to say, I could always talk about \u201cBarbie.\u201d We could discuss whether we thought Ferrara\u2019s second-act monologue was a reductive distillation of feminism 101. Whether there was too much Ken in a film called \u201cBarbie.\u201d Whether it was any good at all. Maybe they\u2019d watch it again or maybe they\u2019d write it off forever, but they always had something to say. Rewatching \u2018Barbie\u2019 in 2024 is bittersweet Watching \u201cBarbie\u201d became a habit. I got sick in September, conveniently, the same day \u201cBarbie\u201d became available to purchase on demand. I watched it on a loop throughout my sickness, falling asleep to Helen Mirren\u2019s narrator and waking up to \u201cHandler-comma-Barbara\u201d signing in at her gynecologist\u2019s office. I threw it on often in October to prepare for my Halloween costume: I was dressing up as the bespectacled little girl in the film\u2019s Kubrickian prologue who smashes her baby doll to bits after she lays eyes on Robbie\u2019s plastic princess for the first time. And I watched it twice on Christmas Day, once with director Greta Gerwig\u2019s commentary and later the theatrical cut with my begrudging grandfather. I had a feeling that everyone around me was starting to feel \u201cBarbie\u201d fatigue. Once Gosling finished his dazzling Oscars performance of \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken,\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d fever officially ended. I never wanted it to. But when you constantly watch and rewatch something, its contents eventually stop mattering or registering altogether \u2014\u00a0the script and plotting and performances all melt together into a comforting soup you\u2019ve slurped so many times that you can\u2019t really taste it anymore. So I put \u201cBarbie\u201d away for a while, shocking friends who\u2019d come to know me as the preeminent \u201cBarbie\u201d fan of the Atlanta area. (Surely, I joked, I had contributed to its billion-dollar box office with all my repeat viewings.) When I rewatched it last week for the first time in months, by myself, I was struck by how bittersweet it all felt. There is no film equivalent this year for \u201cBarbie,\u201d no cultural phenomenon through which to form a connection, no matter how contrived. I am feeling more isolated from my fellow humans this year than last, and no movie theater trip has quite made up for that \u2014 even at a showing for this year\u2019s great box office success, \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d the audience was muted, resigned. I miss it. Watching \u201cBarbie\u201d now makes me wistful for the first few times I saw it (minus the incessant trailers for \u201cGran Turismo,\u201d remember those?) and felt like I belonged just by sitting in the audience. It\u2019s a movie, and I\u2019m an adult. It didn\u2019t teach me anything I didn\u2019t know about being a woman or human. But it was something I could wholeheartedly love, this silly movie that brought people together, in love or in hate, to the air-conditioned movie theater in the middle of the summer and gave us a Matchbox Twenty musical interlude. Maybe there won\u2019t be another \u201cBarbie\u201d-level event for a long time, one that dominates the cultural conversation for months, drives all kinds of moviegoers to the theater to experience the pink fantasia for themselves and drowns out real-world darkness. But we\u2019ll always have our \u201cBarbie\u201d summer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/entertainment/barbie-one-year-anniversary-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_beverly-hills-cop-axel-f-review-eddie-murphy", "text": "\u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d spawned a trio of movies, but more significantly, the 1984 film capped off a string of hits (after \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d and \u201cTrading Places\u201d) that launched Eddie Murphy into the movie-star stratosphere. As Murphy moves into the encores-for-streaming phase of his career (see \u201cComing 2 America\u201d), enter \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\u201d which features enough unapologetic nostalgia (cue the music) to power through its flat spots. The fact that the film is premiering via Netflix, as opposed to theaters, might warrant some second-guessing given the box-office numbers that the latest \u201cBad Boys\u201d sequel has delivered, but that\u2019s a debate for another day. From the get-go, the star appears up to the task as he slides back into a role to which he said goodbye 30 years ago, and introduced a decade before that. As with \u201cComing 2 America,\u201d \u201cAlex F\u201d uses a next-generation hook to get into the story and create the excuse to bring Murphy\u2019s Axel Foley from Detroit (after an introductory action sequence that goes on a bit too long) back to Beverly Hills, reuniting him with lots of familiar faces. In this case, he\u2019s summoned by Billy (Judge Reinhold) to help Axel\u2019s estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige, who followed \u201cHit the Floor\u201d with \u201cZola\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d), a lawyer representing a client who has triggered a warning to back off from some very bad people. Before you can say \u201cGet the f\u2014k outta here\u201d (which is, not surprisingly, said several times), Axel lands in L.A., cheerfully insisting, \u201cThey love me in Beverly Hills!\u201d Staying on brand, he quickly irks the local authorities as he sets about protecting Jane, while running afoul of a corrupt detective played by Kevin Bacon (one of two movies in which he appears this week, the other being \u201cMaXXXine\u201d). Axel also gets teamed up with a younger cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has some history with Jane, although frankly \u2013 other than \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s hilarious cameo as a Beverly Hills realtor \u2013 the newcomers don\u2019t stand much of a chance to register as holdovers like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and John Ashton join Reinhold in dropping by. In perhaps the wisest (and easiest) decision, first-time feature director Mark Molloy relies heavily on music associated with the original movies, from Harold Faltermeyer\u2019s electronic score to songs like \u201cThe Heat is On\u201d and \u201cNeutron Dance,\u201d augmented by a new one from Lil Nas X. In the early going, a younger colleague in Detroit points out that Axel continues to hit the streets at a time when \u201cguys your age\u201d are transitioning to desk jobs, which basically spells out the formulation here, and how Murphy effectively carries off the same mentality as his alter ego. \u201cAxel F\u201d only turns up the heat to a low simmer, but as breezy escapism goes, those armed with the proper attitude might find themselves doing the neutron dance, or a version of it, all over again. \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.

{"id": "2024_07_13_entertainment_faye-review-faye-dunaway", "text": "\u201cFaye,\u201d a documentary memoir of Faye Dunaway, begins with the \u201cChinatown\u201d star barking orders at her interviewer, saying, \u201cWe need to shoot. I\u2019m here now, come on.\u201d It\u2019s a perfect introduction to an actor who has worn the dreaded \u201cD\u201d word \u2013 \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cdiva,\u201d take your pick \u2013 throughout her career, in a film that serves as an unvarnished but appropriately laudatory tribute. Few stars shone brighter than Dunaway at the apex of her career, highlighted by a decade-long span that began with \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d \u2013 which helped usher in a new era of more edgy and ambitious filmmaking \u2013 followed by \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair,\u201d \u201cChinatown\u201d (which recently commemorated its 50th anniversary), \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d and her Oscar-winning role in the dark satire \u201cNetwork.\u201d At 90 minutes, \u201cFaye\u201d could have devoted the lion\u2019s share of its time to that era and still been worth watching. But director Laurent Bouzereau (\u201cNatalie Wood: What Remains Behind\u201d) obviously has to go back to Dunaway\u2019s upbringing, her personal life and the latter part of her career, punctuated by what she refers to as \u201cmistakes,\u201d from her much-lampooned portrayal of Joan Crawford in \u201cMommie Dearest\u201d to her dropped attempt to turn her lauded stage performance in \u201cMaster Class\u201d into a movie that she intended to direct. Now 83, Dunaway spills a bit of tea about her various relationships, from a romance with Marcello Mastroianni (prompting her to dump director Jerry Schatzberg, who laughs about losing a woman to the dashing Italian star) to her marriage to Terry O\u2019Neill, the photographer who snapped the iconic photo of her lounging by the pool the morning after winning the Oscar for \u201cNetwork\u201d in 1977. Their son, Liam O\u2019Neill, is also among those interviewed, along with Sharon Stone, who Dunaway befriended; and her \u201cBarfly\u201d co-star Mickey Rourke, who refers to her as \u201cmesmerizing.\u201d Dunaway\u2019s screen beauty, with a face made for close-ups, and abundant talent merely added fuel to her diva reputation, distilled into a memorable clip of Bette Davis telling \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host Johnny Carson that Dunaway was the one actor she wouldn\u2019t work with again. Yet as director James Gray, who worked with her on the 2000 movie \u201cThe Yards,\u201d notes in the film, the way Dunaway became characterized within the entertainment industry also represents \u201ca comment on how women are in some ways treated and judged on a very different scale than men.\u201d Of course, \u201cFaye\u201d provides enough anecdotal highlights that it\u2019s possible to enjoy strictly on that level, from Dunaway finally telling Jack Nicholson to go ahead and really slap her in a famous \u201cChinatown\u201d moment to her insistence on applying Blistex to her lips between scenes. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFaye\u201d allows its subject to be, or at least appear, as big, complicated and multifaceted as her life and career, in both the highs and lows, would suggest. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with anything here,\u201d Dunaway tells the interviewer during that setting-up exchange.
