In the drama category, \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d had the most nominations this year with 25. The all-time record of 32 nominations, held by HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d since 2016, remains unbroken. HBO is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company. Some past favorites, including \u201cSuccession\u201d and \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d were not in contention this year, but \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d became the new \u201clegacy shows\u201d with multiple nominations.

{"id": "2024_07_17_entertainment_strictly-come-dancing-contestants-chaperone-abuse-allegations-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "\u201cStrictly Come Dancing,\u201d Britain\u2019s version of the hit TV show \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d announced that chaperones will accompany celebrities when training with their professional dance partners, after two of its dancers left following allegations of abuse. The BBC, which produces the show, also announced in a statement Tuesday that it has created two new roles specifically \u201cdedicated to welfare support\u201d for the celebrities and dancers and it will \u201cdeliver further training for the production team and crew.\u201d These changes come after two dancers \u2013 Giovanni Pernice and Graziano di Prima \u2013 left the popular show following complaints from their celebrity partners about their training methods when rehearsing for each weekly episode, in which couples dance in front of a live studio audience and hope to avoid elimination via a public vote. Actress Amanda Abbington, who partnered Pernice for the 2023 season last fall, told Britain\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper that her appearance on \u201cStrictly Come Dancing\u201d and its aftermath has been the \u201cworst experience \u2026 and horrible.\u201d \u201cWhen I\u2019m in a rehearsal room I make sure that it\u2019s a nice place where everyone feels safe and feels like they\u2019re having a nice time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that courtesy wasn\u2019t extended to me.\u201d The BBC directed CNN to Tuesday\u2019s statement when asked for a response to Abbington\u2019s reported comments. Abbington quit the show in October because of \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d she said at the time. Top London law firm Carter-Ruck confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that it is representing her but declined to comment further. Pernice has repeatedly denied Abbington\u2019s allegations, calling them \u201cfalse\u201d and rejecting \u201cany suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour,\u201d in two statements posted on Instagram. \u201cI am cooperating fully with the ongoing BBC investigation, which will determine the truth. As requested, I have stayed silent, but I am looking forward to the conclusion of the investigation and ultimately clearing my name,\u201d he added. During its 20-year run, the BBC show has become a British cultural touchstone, spawning a US version and routinely posting high ratings even as live TV has struggled to attract viewers. But the crisis surrounding it deepened on Saturday when another professional dancer, Di Prima, was forced to leave the show over events he says \u201che deeply regrets.\u201d \u201cMy intense passion and determination to win might have affected my training regime,\u201d he said on Instagram. \u201cRespecting the BBC HR process, I understand it\u2019s best for the show that I step away.\u201d As media reports emerged afterward that the BBC had uncovered videos of incidents involving reality star and TV host Zara McDermott, who was his partner last season, she released a statement on her Instagram story saying that those videos \u201care incredibly distressing to watch.\u201d \u201cI have wrestled with the fear of opening up \u2013 I was scared about public backlash, I was scared about my future, I was scared of victim shaming,\u201d she said in a statement that was widely reported by local media outlets. \u201cBut after a lot of conversations with those I love, I\u2019ve gained the strength to face those fears, and when asked to speak to the BBC, I spoke candidly about my time on the show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing-contestants-chaperone-abuse-allegations-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_15_entertainment_shannen-doherty-cancer-advocacy", "text": "For all the things that Shannen Doherty had to fight for over the years \u2013 from her reputation to her health \u2013 it was clear in what would be one of the final episodes of her podcast that the actress was putting everything into the battle for her life. In an episode of \u201cLet\u2019s Be Clear\u201d that was published on June 23, the \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210\u201d star gave her listeners a tough update: She was going to resume chemotherapy treatment. Still, she offered a bit of positivity with the bitter pill that is stage IV cancer. \u201cSo for the first time in a couple of months I feel hopeful because there are so many more protocols now,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I was hopeful, but I was still getting prepared. Now, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t need to be prepared, I need to go on vacation. I need to go on a boat again and explore places!\u2019\u201d She closed the episode saying, \u201cI can tell you I\u2019m not going anywhere right now.\u201d Doherty died Sunday at age 53, according to a statement from her publicist. An actress who rose from what TV Guide dubbed in the \u201990s the \u201cyouth-quake\u201d era of television, she carried a reputation for being outspoken on sets in a time when any self-advocacy by a young woman resulted in her being labeled \u201cdifficult.\u201d But Doherty\u2019s determination would serve her well in the role she took on in recent years: A voice of authority and advocacy in the cancer community. She first disclosed her breast cancer diagnosis in 2015 and kept well-wishers up to date on her treatment, announcing her remission in 2017, and, ultimately, a return of her cancer in 2020. Doherty\u2019s vulnerable and candid disclosures were humanizing for a figure once painted by tabloid media as a rebellious figure with a penchant for departing high-profile acting roles (See: \u201c90210\u201d and \u201cCharmed\u201d) amid controversy. \u201cI have felt misunderstood my whole life,\u201d Doherty told People in 2020. \u201cThe only difference is that now I\u2019m OK with it. But there have been moments where we\u2019ve been able to talk about things.\u201d She debuted \u201cLet\u2019s Be Clear\u201d in December 2023, roughly six months after she had announced cancer had spread to her brain. In some instances, the platform was a place to reflect on her career and her memorable roles. Other episodes focused on her treatment and prognosis during informative conversations with members of her care team. Doherty discussed her surgeries, medications and difficult decisions along the way. \u201cI don\u2019t have many people that I talk to cancer about,\u201d she told her oncologist, Dr. Lawrence Piro, in one episode. \u201cFor me, I talk to you about cancer because I think you\u2019re qualified to talk to me about cancer.\u201d Doherty may have leaned on professionals for advice about her own case, but didn\u2019t hesitate to stretch her hand out to those going through similar circumstances. Actress Olivia Munn, who earlier this year shared her own breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent double mastectomy, said she and Doherty \u201cbonded through a shared battle and a desire to help other women.\u201d \u201cLooking back on the last text she sent me just a couple months ago, she asked how I was doing and if she could do anything for me,\u201d Munn wrote on Instagram. \u201cTrue to form, Shannen was offering her support even though she was in the final stage of fighting this horrific disease. Cancer is really f***ing scary and Shannen faced it with such dignity, strength and grace.\u201d In that episode with Dr. Piro, Doherty encouraged listeners to advocate for themselves. \u201cMost of the time, a lot of patients feel as if they don\u2019t have the right to ask for a better doctor or to change doctors, or they\u2019re scared their insurance won\u2019t cover a new doctor or feel like they can\u2019t change doctors,\u201d she said. Piro affirmed: \u201cEveryone deserves world-class health care\u2026also a world-class patient experience because if you get, even if you get great care, if you get PTSD trying to get care, then the quality if your life is not good at all.\u201d Quality of life was a focus of Doherty\u2019s in her final months. \u201cI\u2019m not the person who likes to give up very easily,\u201d she said in June. \u201cI just don\u2019t want my sickness to last that long.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/entertainment/shannen-doherty-cancer-advocacy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The singer has reportedly said she\u2019s taking a major break from the music scene. \u201cMy tank is quite empty at the minute,\u201d she told German broadcaster ZDF in a recently shared interview. \u201cI don\u2019t have any plans for new music at all.\u201d Adele gave the interview ahead of a 10-date residency in Munich. She\u2019s planning on  stepping away from the spotlight when her run is over. \u201cI want a big break after this and I think I want to do other creative things, just for a little while,\u201d she told the outlet. Adele also talked about her feeling about being a celebrity. \u201cI don\u2019t like being famous,\u201d she said. \u201cI love that I get to make music all the time.\u201d Adele has retreated from the music scene to refuel her creativity in the past. Her debut album, \u201c19,\u201d was released in 2008, while the follow-up, the critically acclaimed \u201c21,\u201d came out three years later.

{"id": "2024_07_16_entertainment_tenacious-d-trump-assassination-attempt-backlash-scli-intl", "text": "Jack Black\u2019s comedy rock band Tenacious D has canceled its remaining tour dates after band member Kyle Gass sparked a backlash with an apparent joke about Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump. Footage posted on social media from the band\u2019s concert in Sydney on Sunday showed Black presenting Gass with a birthday cake\u00a0onstage\u00a0and telling him to \u201cmake a wish.\u201d Gass responded: \u201cDon\u2019t miss Trump next time.\u201d The exchange prompted a call from one Australian lawmaker for the band to be deported from the country. In a statement to CNN on Tuesday, Black said he was \u201cblindsided by what was said at the show.\u201d \u201cI would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold. I am grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.\u201d Gass apologized for the comment in a post on Instagram on Tuesday. \u201cThe line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake. I don\u2019t condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone,\u201d wrote Gass. \u201cWhat happened was a tragedy, and I\u2019m incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgement. I profoundly apologize to those I\u2019ve let down and truly regret any pain I\u2019ve caused.\u201d Gass has since been dropped by his Hollywood talent representative. His agent, Michael Greene of Greene Talent, told CNN that he has parted ways with Gass, but he did not provide additional comment. Band members Black and Gass had been due to play in the city of Newcastle, New South Wales, on Tuesday, but promoter Frontier Touring announced that the show had been \u201cpostponed\u201d in an Instagram post earlier on Tuesday. Tenacious D was scheduled to perform in Brisbane on Thursday, before heading to Melbourne and Adelaide, and then onto New Zealand and the US. Backlash While some commenters interpreted the exchange as a joke, Australian senator Ralph Babet said that the pair \u201cshould be immediately removed from the country\u201d in a statement posted on X. \u201cTo advocate and or wish for the assassination of a President is egregious, disgusting, filthy, evil, and not acceptable in any way, shape or form,\u201d said Babet. \u201cThis was not a joke, he was deadly serious when he wished for the death of the President.\u201d \u201cI call on the prime minister Anthony Albanese to join me in denouncing Tenacious D, Jack Black and band member Kyle Gass, and I call on the immigration minister Andrew Giles to revoke their visas and deport them immediately,\u201d Babet said on Tuesday. \u201cAnything less than a deportation is an endorsement of the shooting and the attempted assassination of Donald J Trump,\u201d he said. Australian radio host Kyle Sandilands also criticized the band. \u201cI will not be participating in any future Tenacious D interviews,\u201d he said. Tenacious D have previously appeared on the Kyle & Jackie O \u201cIn the Morning\u201d show on KIIS radio. On Saturday, US President Joe Biden condemned political violence in the wake of the shooting. \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of\u00a0violence \u2013 it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cWe cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.\u201d This story has been updated.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far", "text": "As we hurtle headlong into summer, we\u2019re dully aware six months\u2019 worth of new content has already hit our streaming platforms and our feeds this year \u2013 and in some rare cases, even gotten us out of the house and into a movie theater. While consensus seems to be that a lot of what pop culture has brought forth thus far in 2024 has been a bit \u201cmeh,\u201d there have also been standouts, triumphs and attention-getting titles worth of celebrating. Here\u2019s our list of some the year\u2019s best performances and content so far: MOVIES Best (or, most chillingly effective) cameo - Jesse Plemons in \u2018Civil War\u2019 The Oscars \u201cconversation\u201d already includes \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star Plemons delivering a brief performance so menacing, it calls to minds the scant 24 minutes Anthony Hopkins spent on screen before clinching an Academy Award for \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d Plemons\u2019 demented \u201csoldier\u201d in a crumbled and war-torn version of the near-future US, dispensing life and death with callous disdain, more than drives home the point filmmaker Alex Garland was trying to make with his latest movie. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how \u201cCivil War\u201d star Kirsten Dunst \u2013 who is married to Plemons in real life \u2013 felt comfortable going home with him after shooting his scene. Best genre-defying comedy -\u00a0\u2018Problemista\u2019 Writer, director and actor Julio Torres is an exceptional cinematic voice who has actually been around for awhile, creating excellent content for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and series such as \u201cLos Espookys\u201d and the soon-to-be released \u201cFantasmas.\u201d \u201cProblemista,\u201d which won acclaim at several festivals in 2023, features Torres as a toy designer from El Salvador trying to find opportunities to unleash his creative vision in the US, while also figuring out a way to stay in the country. He runs into both expected roadblocks as well as ones that are frustratingly inane, like a poorly designed grant website with a broken drop-down menu that makes it impossible for anyone located outside of country to apply. With artfully realized details like that, \u201cProblemista\u201d does the remarkable job of remaining universally engaging while exploring a very specific and individual experience. Plus, Tilda Swinton turns in one of her best idiosyncratic and delightfully deranged performances opposite the gifted Torres. Best meet-cute -\u00a0\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Not since \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d has Anne Hathaway captured the zeitgeist like this, and we\u2019re here for it. In \u201cIdea,\u201d she has a run-in at Coachella with It-Boy Nicolas Galiztine (of \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d and \u201cMary & George\u201d fame) that is so silly, and so disarming, it\u2019s hard not to go along for the gender-flipped \u201cNotting Hill\u201d (plus a few age-gap years) that follows. Other reasons to watch include the music performance scenes (the fictional boy band in the film isn\u2019t so fictional in that it was essentially created for the movie and has actually released music) and Hathaway\u2019s character\u2019s positively enviable Los Angeles enclave. Best visuals\u00a0- The Harkonnens in \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 It\u2019s getting harder and harder to dazzle with a truly original vision on the silver screen, but Denis Villeneuve pulls it off in his epic sci-fi sequel, which had been drastically delayed for a variety of reasons but finally dawned in the theaters this past spring. The sequences depicting the villainous Harkonnens \u2013 mostly monochromatic and overexposed to create an off-putting yet hypnotic ambiance \u2013 simply look like nothing else, and succeed in imparting a foreboding and terrifically extraterrestrial feel. Actor Austin Butler\u2019s improvised kiss planted on his uncle Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) helps as well. Honorable mentions: Best sports-infused romance/romance-infused sports movie\u00a0- \u201cChallengers\u201d Best use of profanity -\u00a0Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley in \u201cWicked Little Letters\u201d Best music documentary\u00a0- \u201cIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\u201d Best horror film - \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d Best animated film\u00a0- \u201cOrion and the Dark\u201d TV Best production - \u2018Shogun\u2019 The series production of the year, FX\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d managed to create the second showstopping television event based on the acclaimed James Clavell novel, after the first series did way back in 1980. CNN\u2019s Brian Lowry wrote in his glowing review that the new show \u201cblends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.\u201d Best show (somewhat) inspired by real life\u00a0- \u2018Baby Reindeer\u2019 While \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is by no means an easy watch, Richard Gadd\u2019s (true to an extent, that will surely be battled over for some time) recounting of his experience with a stalker \u2013 and how a previous experience of abuse played into it \u2013 is ultimately gratifying for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Gadd\u2019s layered and vulnerable performance anchors the show, and serves as the perfect foil for the brilliant Jessica Gunning \u2013 who plays his increasingly menacing stalker Martha \u2013 to truly shine and chew scenery at the same time. Best visuals -\u00a0\u2018Ripley\u2019 In a very different way from the villainous Harkonnen family in \u201cDune\u201d \u2013 but still depicting a nefarious villain nonetheless \u2013 the black-and-white Netflix series \u201cRipley\u201d can draw you in at practically any juncture, with stunningly ornate stylistic details and seaside Italian locations that are gasp-inducing maybe partially because they lack color. You could take screenshots from almost any scene and frame them as fine art, and the show \u2013 an austere retelling of the Patricia Highsmith novel after Anthony Minghella\u2019s far more colorful (literally and figuratively) film from 1999 \u2013 has the beguiling ability to make your eyes crave its somehow comfortable, monochromatic simplicity when you\u2019re not watching it. Best sophomore season -\u00a0\u2018Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u2019 \u201cInterview\u201d has only improved on what\u2019s come before \u2013 its first season, as well as the 1994 Neil Jordan movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt \u2013 and continues to be one of the best-acted and best-written shows on TV, while also remaining the juiciest. Vamps have never been more compelling than the iterations of the Anne Rice characters depicted here. Alternating between notes that are tragic, beautiful and sometimes hilarious, it\u2019s got a bit of everything. Which means its no surprise that AMC announced a third season renewal just this week. \u2013 Scottie Andrew Best cameo -\u00a0Carrot Top on \u2018Hacks\u2019 When Mr. Top (real name Scott Thompson, who while you weren\u2019t looking has become a major fixture in Las Vegas) comes out on screen in the second episode of this well-received third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d double-takes abound as to whether that\u2019s \u201creally him.\u201d His commitment in the scene is top notch, and stick around for the post-show featurette to watch him take director notes and do great line readings. Honorable mentions go to Dierdre Hall playing herself, sort of, as Paul W. Downs\u2019 mother in the Christmas episode, along with Christopher Lloyd as her maybe-new paramour. \u201cHacks\u201d also enjoys featured guests J. Smith-Cameron from \u201cSuccession,\u201d who finally gives (great) face to Kathy \u2013 Deborah\u2019s detested and two-timing sister \u2013 and Helen Hunt as a ball-busting network exec.

It shined a light on both trailblazers and up-and-coming artists that normally aren\u2019t associated with the ever-changing genre that is \u201ccountry,\u201d while betraying a very personal story from Beyonc\u00e9 herself about her own experience in the music world as an artist of color. Best album that\u2019s definitely not for everyone - Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018Only God Was Above Us\u2019 There are few immediately hummable songs on the new record that call to mind \u201cHarmony Hall\u201d off of their last album in 2019, and the instrumentation is rich and complex and strangely captivating, like the band wanted to stuff as many distinctive sounds into each song as they could. And their trademark clever wordplay is very much on display in songs like \u201cGen-X Cops.\u201d \u2013 Brandon Griggs Best breakout - Chappell Roan While her debut album \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d was released late last year, Roan has been steadily gaining attention ever since \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 with viral performances at Coachella, the Governors Ball and Bonnaroo, along with a wonderful (and also very viral) set on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series in March. With a queer-centric performance style that is very drag-inspired, her latest single \u201cGood Luck Babe!\u201d epitomizes her fiercely independent, raw and authentic vibe. Plus, rock legend Elton John has already given his seal of approval. We\u2019re so in.  \u2013 Scottie Andrew and Alli Rosenbloom BOOKS \u2018Margo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u2019 by Rufi Thorpe Soon to be a TV series starring Elle Fanning, this novel \u2013 following a young, single, new mother with no job who joins OnlyFans and begins creating sexual content to stay afloat \u2013 toys with our perceptions of power and morality. What does it mean to be a good person, and who gets to decide? Over the course of the book, readers see Margo desperately trying to survive her situation, contending with the difficult \u2013 and sometimes unconventional \u2013 choices she makes in order to do so. \u2013 Leah Asmelash \u2018Sociopath: A Memoir\u2019 by Patric Gagne The release of \u201cRipley\u201d in April coincided with the arrival of the memoir\u00a0\u201cSociopath,\u201d\u00a0which offers a quite different case for demythologizing what it means to be a sociopath. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who\u2019s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and\u00a0argues that\u00a0the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed. \u2013 Sara Stewart PODCAST Best and most hilarious podcast about nothing in particular - \u2018The Bald and the Beautiful\u2019 The beloved queens from \u201cDrag Race\u201d Trixie and Katya blather on about nothing, and it\u2019s just everything.

While both sides absorb the fallout from the battle of Rook\u2019s Rest in episode 4, one message comes through loud and clear in \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u2019s\u201d latest chapter: the women in this patriarchal society must fight wars on two fronts. For Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy), the indignities come from her council of advisers, as well as her headstrong husband Daemon (Matt Smith), who continues to have really weird dreams while more brazenly plotting to personally acquire power. Rhaenyra articulates her predicament clearly at the end, complaining about how she had to stay prudent and apart from the war despite her own dragon-riding credentials, saying that she was \u201csending others to fight and be felled in my name,\u201d before concluding with a sense of determination, \u201cIf all else fails, it is I who must fight.\u201d Her counterpart in this civil war and one-time friend, Alicent (Olivia Cooke), faces a similar display of disrespect at home, after the attempted fratricide by Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) that left his brother, King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), a scorched and wheezing mess \u2013 nursing burns, broken bones and internal injuries. Aegon\u2019s condition calls for appointing a regent, as Alicent says, to serve in his stead \u201cuntil he recovers, or does not.\u201d Yet despite her realization that Aemond has developed into something of a psychopathic monster (those Targaryen kids do grow up fast) \u2013 telling Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), \u201cYou know what he is. What he has somehow become\u201d \u2013 the council chooses to elevate Aemond. What\u2019s a mother to do? In this case, feel angry and betrayed. \u201cWe have given the war to the dragons,\u201d Criston says flatly to the woman who regularly (if sneakily) shares his bed. \u201cA dragon rider should lead us.\u201d Of course, Criston engages in a misstep of his own at the outset, parading the slain dragon of the equally dead Rhaenys (Eve Best, we hardly knew ye) through the town, unsettling the common folk. That death also leaves her husband, Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), shattered and in mourning, as both sides grapple with their casualties. Beyond that, the fifth episode represents a bit of a breather \u2013 as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and now \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d tend to do after major conflicts \u2013 as the warring factions seek to secure support for their war efforts, with Daemon, for one, wrestling with the demands of diplomacy as opposed to his scorched-earth tactics. Speaking of scorched earth, there could be a lot more of it, as the closing sequence involves Rhaenyra strategizing with her son about how to neutralize Aemond and his massive dragon Vhagar. While dragon riding is a talent limited to the Targaryens, the two realize there are lots of wayward offshoots of the royal bloodline that could in theory be enlisted and turned into riders. \u201cA mad thought,\u201d the Queen muses, clearly intrigued by the idea. Then again, as Rhaenyra noted earlier in the hour, as a woman seeking to rule, \u201cThe path I walk has never been trod.\u201d Without clear footsteps to follow, in other words, she\u2019s going to have to blaze her own trail \u2013 and if that Targaryen-blood dragon-riding scheme comes to fruition, perhaps literally. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d airs Sunday nights on Max, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.

Pitt\u2019s attorneys, in a separate filing, called the request \u201coppressive and harassing\u201d and\u00a0claim\u00a0in their initial opposition motion that he\u00a0\u201cvoluntarily offered to produce documents sufficient to show\u00a0everything\u00a0that occurred on the flight that precipitated the ex-couple\u2019s divorce .\u201d \u201cJolie, however, rejected Pitt\u2019s compromise and moved to compel his communications with third parties \u2014 including his most trusted advisors \u2014 about such sensitive issues as the therapy he voluntarily undertook after the flight incident in an effort to better himself, \u2018drug and alcohol testing\u2019 he has allegedly undergone, his alleged \u2018overuse or abuse of alcohol,\u2019 and other actions taken in the aftermath of the flight.\u201d When reached for comment on the filing, Paul Murphy, Jolie\u2019s attorney, described potential evidence around Pitt\u2019s 2021 request for a non-disclosure agreement in his failed proposal to buy her share of the winery as \u201dcentral to these proceedings.\u201d \u201cWe are not at all surprised Mr. Pitt is afraid to turn over the documents demonstrating these facts. While Angelina again asks Mr. Pitt to end the fighting and finally put their family on a clear path toward healing, unless Mr. Pitt withdraws his lawsuit, Angelina has no choice but to obtain the evidence necessary to prove his allegations wrong,\u201d Murphy told CNN in a statement on Wednesday. Pitt and Jolie have been locked in a fraught web of legal proceedings since 2016. While the two were declared legally single 2019, their divorce\u00a0is not yet finalized. Details surrounding the circumstances of the private plane incident emerged in August 2022, when a heavily redacted FBI report, provided to CNN by a source at the time,\u00a0revealed\u00a0that Jolie had accused Pitt of physically assaulting her and verbally abusing their children while they were aboard the private jet, traveling to the US from France. Pitt became the center of a\u00a0probe\u00a0related to the incident but was never arrested or charged, according to an FBI\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time. Their fight over the Miravel property began in February 2022, when Pitt sued Jolie and her former company, Nouvel LLC, over what he claimed was the \u201cunlawful\u201d sale of her stake in Miraval, acquired by the couple in 2008. Pitt\u2019s lawsuit alleged that he and Jolie had agreed when they purchased the winery that neither would sell without the other\u2019s consent. According to a subsequent 2023 court filing, attorneys for Pitt called Jolie\u2019s sale\u00a0\u201cvindictive\u201d\u00a0after an \u201cadverse custody ruling.\u201d A\u00a0countersuit\u00a0filed by Nouvel LLC in September 2022 accused Pitt of \u201cwaging a vindictive war against\u201d Jolie and claimed that there was never any such agreement. The countersuit alleges that Jolie attempted to sell her share of the winery to Pitt but the deal fell apart over a provision in a non-disclosure agreement \u201cdesigned to prohibit Jolie from publicly speaking about the events that had led to the breakdown of their marriage.\u201d Jolie sold Nouvel LLC and its stake in the winery to Tenute del Mondo, a subsidiary of Stoli Group, controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler, in October 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/entertainment/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-miraval/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_entertainment_twisters-film-interviews-climate-change", "text": "Like its titular tornados, \u201cTwisters\u201d blasts through a lot in its 122-minute runtime. A summer blockbuster with a surprising amount of brains to match Glen Powell\u2019s brawn, it features subplots that are signs of the times \u2013 disaster capitalists; the Faustian bargain between scientists and financiers \u2013 and a deluge of imagery portraying lives and livelihoods threatened by nature\u2019s awesome power. But two words you won\u2019t hear from any of its characters are \u201cclimate change.\u201d \u201cI just wanted to make sure that with the movie, we don\u2019t ever feel like (it) is putting forward any message,\u201d director Lee Isaac Chung explained in an interview with CNN. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like films are meant to be message-oriented.\u201d To his credit, there is some scientific justification for the omission, too. Generally, scientists are the least certain about the connection between tornadoes and climate change as it\u2019s unclear how warming temperatures are changing storms themselves or the outbreaks. However, evidence is growing\u00a0of the potential impact of planet-warming pollution. Recent studies have showed rotating, supercell thunderstorms that produce tornadoes are becoming more frequent in parts of the US outside so-called Tornado Alley, including in the Southeast and Midwest. They are also becoming more frequent in seasons that aren\u2019t the traditional severe storm season, and\u00a0recent December outbreaks\u00a0have proved particularly deadly. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen tornadoes like this before,\u201d says Javi, Anthony Ramos\u2019 entrepreneurial storm chaser, in one scene. He goes on to convince old friend Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) to join his research team, promising \u201cWe can save lives.\u201d In the film, ever-more destructive tornados carve up increasingly urbanized areas of Oklahoma. \u201cI think what we are doing is showing the reality of what\u2019s happening on the ground \u2026 we don\u2019t shy away from saying that things are changing,\u201d Lee added. He name-checked Maura Tierney\u2019s character Cathy, mother of Kate, as a voice for all this. Cathy, a local farmer, gripes that storms and floods are becoming more frequent, and the price of wheat more expensive, while stopping short of citing climate change. \u201cI wanted to make sure that we are never creating a feeling that we\u2019re preaching a message, because that\u2019s certainly not what I think cinema should be about,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI think it should be a reflection of the world.\u201d If it is cinema\u2019s M.O. to show not tell, then Lee has the prerogative to show us what he wants \u2013 like a tornado ripping through a power station, sucking up the ensuing fire and setting the sky ablaze. However, for a film populated by scientists and clued-in citizens to not mention climate change is a little like the twisters themselves: there\u2019s a hole at the center. Nevertheless, this was a personal and earnest endeavor for the director, who built upon a screenplay by Mark L. Smith (\u201cThe Revenant\u201d) and story by Joseph Kosinski (\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d). Lee was raised on a farm in western Arkansas, just across the border with Oklahoma. His upbringing (which he drew on for 2020\u2019s \u201cMinari\u201d) included an early run-in with a tornado, when he was forced to seek refuge in a car as his family didn\u2019t have a storm shelter. \u201cWhen you have brushes with extreme weather as a child, anything that feels larger than life and dangerous \u2026 (leaves) a very big imprint,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sense of awe and wonder was something that I really wanted to preserve in this film \u2013 that it\u2019s not just a summer blockbuster about running from tornadoes and hiding away,\u201d he added. \u201cI wanted to make sure that we\u2019re also revering and honoring the beauty of that power.\u201d \u2018Everybody wants the cow\u2019 For Lee, an avowed fan of the original \u201cTwister\u201d (1996), entering this world was a dream come true. \u201cThat film made that research and science feel like an adventure in many ways. That\u2019s what I wanted this film to do,\u201d he explained. But while he peppers a few loving homages to Jan de Bont\u2019s blockbuster in his own movie, he stopped short of one: the flying cow. \u201cEverybody wants the cow,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey think they want the cow. But I promise you, you would be disappointed if there was a cow.\u201d \u201cAny time I talk to anyone about that original \u2018Twisters\u2019 they would say, \u2018Oh yeah, the big flying cow movie.\u2019 I felt like I would hate to make a movie, update it, and just hear, \u2018Oh yes, you made the new flying cow movie.\u2019 So that was it \u2013 that was the decision.\u201d The production got more than it bargained for, shooting on location during tornado season in spring 2023. \u201cBeing in Oklahoma, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Ramos. \u201cThere were days where the sun was out, (the) sky was blue, clear, and then boom. The clouds, they just descend upon you, and then the wind starts blowing, and you\u2019re like, what is happening now?!\u201d \u201cMaking a \u2018Twisters\u2019 movie in Tornado Alley during storm season, tornado season, it\u2019s kind of perfect. It really rubbed off on this movie,\u201d said Powell. \u201cIt\u2019s this very specific place in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cEverybody that lives there has kind of pride in the weather. Everybody talks like a meteorologist, everybody\u2019s weirdly just so knowledgeable about what\u2019s happening and how it\u2019s happening.\u201d Powell plays the charming Tyler Owens, a scoundrel with a heart of gold chasing tornados for social media clicks and adjacent revenue. Some of the extras in the movie were genuine storm chasers, leading to some real-life bonding. \u201cWe\u2019re on some group threads with a bunch of storm chasers, which is a delight,\u201d said Powell. \u201cWe get text messages sometimes from our friends in Oklahoma. They\u2019re like, \u2018We got something brewing down here! Get down here and come chase!\u2019\u201d Still, Lee would rather pump the breaks on encouraging any more hobbyists to hit the road. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want this film to inspire a bunch of people to just pile into their cars and pickup trucks and chase a tornado, because that would lead to a lot of dangerous activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping \u2026 if anyone\u2019s interested in chasing a tornado, they just watch \u2018Twisters\u2019 again.\u201d \u201cTwisters\u201d premieres in UK theaters on July 17 and US theaters on July 19.

{"id": "2024_07_17_entertainment_twisters-review-glen-powell", "text": "Landing somewhere between sequel and reboot, \u201cTwisters\u201d introduces new characters and an extra letter to the 1996 disaster movie but not much else, leaving its stars stranded in a vehicle with roughly the weight of a stiff breeze. Impressive visual effects only go so far, though they at least provide a necessary distraction to the heightened awareness of climate change baked into the premise. After \u201cAnyone But You\u201d and \u201cHit Man,\u201d Glen Powell serves as the biggest marketing come-on beyond the chance to see wanton destruction, but despite opportunities to flash that million-dollar smile, it\u2019s not really his movie. The core story, rather, belongs to Daisy Edgar-Jones (\u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d), playing the brilliant scientist lured back into the storm-chasing game after a tragic setback. Edgar-Jones\u2019 Kate Carter has taken refuge in New York after pursuing potentially groundbreaking research for the Tornado Tamer Project, an attempt to do the original movie\u2019s premise one better by actually employing state-of-the-art technology to reduce massive tornadoes. Those perilous efforts have lain dormant, however, when she\u2019s approached by former colleague Javi (Anthony Ramos), who has found well-heeled sponsorship for his own storm-measuring device, flanked by an associate (\u201cSuperman\u201d-to-be David Corenswet) who gives off a decided \u201cDon\u2019t trust that dude\u201d vibe. Back in the field, Kate encounters Tyler Owens (Powell), a rambunctious tornado \u201cwrangler\u201d who cashes in chasing storms and posting the content he films to his popular YouTube channel. Yet while there\u2019s tension between her altruistic focus on science and his commodification of disasters, underscored by the neophytes with whom they cross paths, in this kind of movie handsome clouds tend to have silver linings. After earning well-deserved praise for the character-driven independent film \u201cMinari,\u201d director Lee Isaac Chung tackles this major-studio assignment without bringing anything particularly distinctive to it, relying a little too much on how good his leads look wet and sweaty. That extends to the posse of supporting players in Kate/Javi and Tyler\u2019s respective camps, which try to match the zany daredevil antics associated with the earlier film but generally fall short. Indeed, the notably clever moments prove few and far between, from a reference to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to a sequence involving a movie theater, which a cynic might see as a metaphor for the stormy state of the industry. As noted, the most salient wrinkle isn\u2019t particularly helpful in viewing the movie as light escapism \u2013 namely, illustrating the devastating impact of tornadoes on communities, and an increase in extreme weather that has become more alarming and dire as filtered through our news-saturated culture. (\u201cTwister,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting, premiered the same year that Fox News and MSNBC signed on.) Frankly, this \u201cTwister\u201d revisitation might have been better served by following the old title with an exclamation point instead of an \u201cS.\u201d Either way, the assignment of replicating the first movie\u2019s appeal would have presented a challenge, but \u201cTwisters\u201d makes that task harder due to headwinds entirely of its own making. \u201cTwisters\u201d premieres July 19 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/entertainment/twisters-review-glen-powell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_fly-me-to-the-moon-review-scarlett-johansson-channing-tatum", "text": "After a run of movies awash in the romance of the space program like \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cFirst Man,\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d cleverly uses the Apollo 11 mission as the backdrop to an old-style romance. Less than weighty in the comedy part of its equation, the film largely works as a vehicle for Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, even without completely sticking the landing. The movie casts Johansson as a corporate marketing specialist, which is somewhat ironic given that its marketing campaign isn\u2019t as clear as it could or should be in terms of conveying what to expect. While the story does include a subplot about staging a fake version of the moon landing \u2013 orchestrated as a back-up plan by a shadowy government operative (Woody Harrelson, again serving as one of the president\u2019s men, echoing his role in \u201cWhite House Plumbers\u201d) with ties to the Nixon administration \u2013 the heart of the film resides in the chemistry between the leads. In classic fashion, they are of course instantly drawn to each other, creating the need to erect barriers in order to keep them apart. In that sense, this is less about conspiracy theories and reality \u2013 though there\u2019s definitely an element of that woven into it \u2013 than the tension between NASA\u2019s square-jawed launch director, Cole Davis (Tatum), and Johansson\u2019s Kelly Jones, who gets recruited to \u201csell the moon\u201d to a skeptical public, leveraging her knack for bending the truth in order to close the deal. Coming almost exactly 55 years after Neil Armstrong took that \u201cone giant leap\u201d onto the lunar surface, director Greg Berlanti and writer Rose Gilroy introduce a strain of cynicism well suited to our current moment, juxtaposing that with the soaring, can-do spirit of the Apollo program. There\u2019s a crowd-pleasing quality to the combination, even if any crowds might prove short lived, inasmuch as the film\u2019s theatrical prospects (before a date on Apple TV+) amount to serving as counter-programming to the blockbuster \u201cTwisters\u201d and \u201cDeadpool\u201d sequels soon to come. A prolific TV producer, Berlanti has tilted toward romance with his forays into movies, including \u201cLove, Simon\u201d and \u201cLife as We Know It.\u201d \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d occupies a higher orbit in its ambition and star power, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that his leads look pretty celestial, while bathing in the period costumes and music of the time. After an eclectic string of roles, Johansson carries a film that might have starred someone like Faye Dunaway during the era in which it\u2019s set (think \u201cNetwork\u201d), while Tatum gets put to better use than his most recent rom-coms, the third \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cThe Lost City,\u201d admittedly not a super-high bar. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d possesses appealing virtues consciously plucked from the past, then adorns them with modern baubles. Whether that will \u201csell the moon\u201d to the moviegoing public remains to be seen, but to borrow from the song that shares its title, the pitch isn\u2019t much more complicated than an invitation to come play among the stars. \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d premieres July 12 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_07_13_entertainment_faye-review-faye-dunaway", "text": "\u201cFaye,\u201d a documentary memoir of Faye Dunaway, begins with the \u201cChinatown\u201d star barking orders at her interviewer, saying, \u201cWe need to shoot. I\u2019m here now, come on.\u201d It\u2019s a perfect introduction to an actor who has worn the dreaded \u201cD\u201d word \u2013 \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cdiva,\u201d take your pick \u2013 throughout her career, in a film that serves as an unvarnished but appropriately laudatory tribute. Few stars shone brighter than Dunaway at the apex of her career, highlighted by a decade-long span that began with \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d \u2013 which helped usher in a new era of more edgy and ambitious filmmaking \u2013 followed by \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair,\u201d \u201cChinatown\u201d (which recently commemorated its 50th anniversary), \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d and her Oscar-winning role in the dark satire \u201cNetwork.\u201d At 90 minutes, \u201cFaye\u201d could have devoted the lion\u2019s share of its time to that era and still been worth watching. But director Laurent Bouzereau (\u201cNatalie Wood: What Remains Behind\u201d) obviously has to go back to Dunaway\u2019s upbringing, her personal life and the latter part of her career, punctuated by what she refers to as \u201cmistakes,\u201d from her much-lampooned portrayal of Joan Crawford in \u201cMommie Dearest\u201d to her dropped attempt to turn her lauded stage performance in \u201cMaster Class\u201d into a movie that she intended to direct. Now 83, Dunaway spills a bit of tea about her various relationships, from a romance with Marcello Mastroianni (prompting her to dump director Jerry Schatzberg, who laughs about losing a woman to the dashing Italian star) to her marriage to Terry O\u2019Neill, the photographer who snapped the iconic photo of her lounging by the pool the morning after winning the Oscar for \u201cNetwork\u201d in 1977. Their son, Liam O\u2019Neill, is also among those interviewed, along with Sharon Stone, who Dunaway befriended; and her \u201cBarfly\u201d co-star Mickey Rourke, who refers to her as \u201cmesmerizing.\u201d Dunaway\u2019s screen beauty, with a face made for close-ups, and abundant talent merely added fuel to her diva reputation, distilled into a memorable clip of Bette Davis telling \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host Johnny Carson that Dunaway was the one actor she wouldn\u2019t work with again. Yet as director James Gray, who worked with her on the 2000 movie \u201cThe Yards,\u201d notes in the film, the way Dunaway became characterized within the entertainment industry also represents \u201ca comment on how women are in some ways treated and judged on a very different scale than men.\u201d Of course, \u201cFaye\u201d provides enough anecdotal highlights that it\u2019s possible to enjoy strictly on that level, from Dunaway finally telling Jack Nicholson to go ahead and really slap her in a famous \u201cChinatown\u201d moment to her insistence on applying Blistex to her lips between scenes. Perhaps foremost, \u201cFaye\u201d allows its subject to be, or at least appear, as big, complicated and multifaceted as her life and career, in both the highs and lows, would suggest. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with anything here,\u201d Dunaway tells the interviewer during that setting-up exchange. But if the goal was creating a document that offers a reminder of and testament to her talent, she \u2013 and those who make the time for \u201cFaye\u201d \u2013 should be. \u201cFaye\u201d premieres July 13 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/entertainment/faye-review-faye-dunaway/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_entertainment_vienna-billy-joel-popularity-cec", "text": "When Billy Joel released his fifth studio album, \u201cThe Stranger,\u201d in 1977, the song \u201cVienna\u201d flew mostly under the radar. It wasn\u2019t one of the four singles released in North America, merely a B-side to the hit \u201cJust the Way You Are.\u201d As the album catapulted Joel to critical and commercial success, \u201cVienna\u201d seemed destined to remain a deep cut from his discography. But over the years, the bluesy number endeared itself to listeners to become a cult favorite \u2014 it\u2019s now among Joel\u2019s top three streamed songs on Spotify alongside \u201cUptown Girl\u201d and \u201cPiano Man,\u201d and an official music video was just released this past April. The force behind the song\u2019s slow-burn resurgence appears to be, at least in part, teenage girls and women in their 20s and 30s. Across social media, young women wax poetic about the decades-old track and their emotional attachment to it. \u201cNo one understands a woman in her 20s the way billy joel did in 1977 when he wrote Vienna,\u201d one woman declared on TikTok. Another shared that the song inspired her to embark on a solo adventure to the Austrian capital. More than a few have gotten the song\u2019s lyrics and other \u201cVienna\u201d-inspired imagery tattooed on their bodies. Per one meme, \u201cgirlhood is sobbing to Vienna.\u201d Despite the fact that it was written nearly 50 years ago, \u201cVienna\u201d is resonant and relevant as ever for a generation of young women. Joel (who counts the track among his favorites) has theorized that the song\u2019s appeal to young women stems from its appearance in a pivotal scene in the 2004 rom-com \u201c13 Going on 30.\u201d The film, starring Jennifer Garner, tells the story of a disillusioned teenager who wants nothing more than to fast forward to adulthood \u2014 only to realize that it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. \u201cThat\u2019s a movie that was popular with girls, and girls are who most of the enthusiasm for the song comes from. Beyond that, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview with Vulture. \u201cIt\u2019s a coming-of-age song: \u2018Slow down you crazy child.\u2019 So I guess it resonates with younger people. It\u2019s a fun one to play.\u201d \u201cVienna\u201d is written from the perspective of someone older and wiser urging a young and ambitious dreamer to go easier on themselves. (\u201cSlow down, you\u2019re doing fine / You can\u2019t be everything you wanna be before your time.\u201d) It\u2019s a rejection of the rat race \u2014 a soothing reminder that life is long and it\u2019s okay to not have it all figured out. \u201cWe live in a society that\u2019s obsessed with fast paced living and \u2018grind culture\u2019. How much can you do and how fast can you do it?\u201d Shauna Murphy, a 22-year-old in Dublin, wrote in a message to CNN. \u201cAs young women, we put so much pressure on ourselves to perform so many roles in such a short timeframe that hearing Vienna play instantly reminds us that sometimes it\u2019s okay to slow down and take a breath. We\u2019re gonna be okay in the end.\u201d Mirelle Ortega, a 34-year-old writer and illustrator in Los Angeles, recalled being stopped in her tracks when she first heard the song during a summer home from college. At the time, she was anxious about her future, and the lyrics were exactly what she needed to hear. \u201cI don\u2019t know why but our late teens and early 20\u2019s tend to feel like the end of the world sometimes. We all feel a huge pressure to have it all figured out and there\u2019s this feeling that whatever path you pick will make or break you,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI think \u2018Vienna\u2019 perfectly articulates that that\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cVienna,\u201d as the song\u2019s hook goes, \u201cwaits for you.\u201d Joel\u2019s use of Vienna as a metaphor for the rest of one\u2019s life stems from an encounter in the city with his father. As the singer-songwriter has explained during performances and interviews, his parents separated when he was a child, and he was estranged from his father until the two reconnected in Vienna in his 20s. During that trip, a conversation they had made a lasting impression on him. \u201cWe were walking in the city and I remember seeing an old lady sweeping the street and I said \u2018Dad it\u2019s kind of sad that that poor old woman has to do that kind of work.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, she has a job, she feels useful, she has a place in our society,\u2019\u201d Joel explained in a 2008 interview with The Republican newspaper. \u201cI realized they don\u2019t throw old people away like we tend to do here in the States,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey allow for people who are aged to have a useful place in the scheme of things and I thought y\u2019know that\u2019s a good metaphor for someone my age to consider. You don\u2019t have to squeeze your whole life into your 20s and 30s trying to make it, trying to achieve that American dream, getting in the rat race and killing yourself. You have a whole life to live.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/entertainment/vienna-billy-joel-popularity-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

On Tuesday, Andress posted a statement on her verified social media account writing, \u201cI\u2019m not going to bulls**t y\u2019all, I was drunk last night.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat was not me last night. I apologize to MLB, all the fans and this country I love so much for that rendition.\u201d She ended the note saying she would \u201clet y\u2019all know how rehab is I hear it\u2019s super fun.\u201d Like Roseanne Barr\u2019s performance at a 1990 San Diego Padres vs. Cincinnati Reds game and Fergie at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game, people have had a great deal to say about Andress\u2019s rendition. Here\u2019s more about the singer: Reality TV Andress had her first brush with fame when she performed in the second season of the NBC a capella singing competition \u201cThe Sing-Off\u201d as a part of the group known as Pitch Slapped in 2010. The group was eliminated early on, but Andress returned to the show the next season as part of the group Delilah. That season of the series was famously won by the group Pentatonix. She\u2019s now a country singer Andress debuted her first album, \u201cLady Like,\u201d in 2020. It reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Emerging Artists chart. A year prior, her single \u201cMore Hearts Than Mine\u201d hit the Billboard Hot 100. She landed back on that chart in 2021, thanks to the single \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d with Sam Hunt. Grammy nominations Andress was nominated for the best new artist Grammy in 2021, though she ultimately lost to rapper Megan Thee Stallion. \u201cLady Like\u201d was also nominated for best country album, while her song \u201cMore Hearts Than Mine\u201d was nominated for best country song. Two years later, \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d scored a best country duo/group performance Grammy nomination. Latest work Her most recent album, \u201cGood Person,\u201d released in 2022. Andress shared on social media this week that she was \u201cso stoked\u201d to announce her new single \u201cColorado 9,\u201d which releases next week. She also announced two shows, one in Nashville on July 17 and one in Denver on July 24. Both shows have been cancelled as of Tuesday, Andress\u2019 representatives told CNN. \u201cThank you for being here for me even though I\u2019ve been living under a rock,\u201d Andress wrote. \u201cY\u2019all are the best and I can\u2019t wait to see you at my shows (stay tuned for more show announcements soon).\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/entertainment/ingrid-andress-national-anthem/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_a-quiet-place-day-one-review", "text": "Like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d pries opens the door to a world with a host of possibilities, some of them \u2013 including the premise of a new prequel subtitled \u201cDay One\u201d \u2013 already touched upon in the two previous movies. Set in New York, the latest film begins from a slightly unexpected premise, but then efficiently spins it to yield additional horror while giving theater-goers every reason to keep their mouths shut. The 2021 sequel actually opened with a muscular flashback sequence to that moment when the grotesque, sound-sensitive alien invaders descended upon Earth, so the new film\u2019s tag line, \u201cExperience the day the world went quiet,\u201d reflects a bit of a conceptual echo. Introducing new characters, the main wrinkle in the new prequel \u2013 and it\u2019s a questionable one at first \u2013 involves telling the story from the perspective of Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a dying woman enduring hospice care with her cat, who serves as the de facto guide to all hell breaking loose. At a time when people are dying right and left, \u201cDay One\u201d thus uses a woman already close to death as the audience\u2019s surrogate. She interacts with various people along the way, but it\u2019s a fair stretch until she encounters the most significant one, Eric (Joseph Quinn, on a genre tear with \u201cStranger Things\u201d behind him and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d to come), who doesn\u2019t want to leave her side however much she tries \u2013 quietly \u2013 to chase him away. While the Emily Blunt- and John Krasinski-anchored family\u2019s sign-language fluency gave the original movie its gateway into an original-feeling twist on minimalist horror, this third film relies heavily on Nyong\u2019o\u2019s facial reactions, and it\u2019s hard to think of an actor who can say more with an expression. Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\u201cPig\u201d), who shares story credit with original director/producer Krasinski (whose summer dance card also includes \u201cIF\u201d), the film does let viewers see more of the horrifying creatures, although their lightning-quick attacks often keeps those images brief. There\u2019s also the matter of how the invaders manage to seemingly be everywhere at once, to the point where the slightest sound on screen provokes a sense of dread. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d takes advantage of those attributes, and even finds a way to use Sam\u2019s condition, somewhat awkwardly, to consider our humanity. If there\u2019s one clunky flourish, it\u2019s been clear going back to \u201cAlien\u201d that cats and sci-fi horror don\u2019t mix, and while her feline companion provides a periodic source of unpredictable tension, it\u2019s one of those devices that probably should have been left in the litter box. Unfortunately, everything that enjoys a modicum of success these days triggers talk of its own \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is no exception. Practically speaking, \u201cDay One\u201d takes a step toward demonstrating that this perilous post-invasion world offers no shortage of streets and hallways to tiptoe down, where nobody needs to ask \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d when they are greeted with silence. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/a-quiet-place-day-one-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_entertainment_gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec", "text": "This year, two disparate, big-budget films will share a release date: One, an R-rated historical epic stacked with a starry cast of Oscar hopefuls. The other, a musical based on a beloved property with plenty of pink and a Billboard-friendly soundtrack. Sound familiar? With \u201cGladiator II\u201d and the first part of \u201cWicked\u201d sharing a release date, days before Thanksgiving, movie theaters are nearing their truest chance at another \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d a viral phenomenon that in 2023 drove audiences to the movie theater by the millions, leaving a massive mark in pop culture and at the box office. But what will we call it? \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal thinks \u201cGlicked\u201d (pronounced glick-id) is the portmanteau that suits the prospective double feature best. \u201c\u2019Wickiator\u2019 doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue, does it?\u201d he said in a new interview with Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI think the films couldn\u2019t be more polar opposite and kind of worked in that context previously, so fingers crossed people come out and see both films on opening weekend.\u201d But maybe we moviegoers (and Mescal) are getting ahead of ourselves. Tom Nunan, a lecturer at UCLA\u2019s School of Theater, Film and TV and the founder of the production company Bull\u2019s Eye Entertainment, isn\u2019t fully sold on \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d 2.0. Both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d were major films with astronomical hype from respected auteurs, but even the studios couldn\u2019t have predicted that audiences would make both films appointment viewing over the same weekend, he said. (\u201cBarbie\u201d was produced by Warner Bros., which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.) \u201cIt\u2019s good when studios release big titles simultaneously,\u201d Nunan told CNN. \u201cI do think that they feed off of each other \u2013\u2013\u00a0that level of excitement. I think all of those things work in both of these films\u2019 favor. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the lightning in a bottle that \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was.\u201d Stranger things have happened, though \u2013\u2013 plus, there\u2019s a \u201cStranger Things\u201d actor in the \u201cGladiator\u201d sequel, which might attract some younger audiences. But if \u201cGlicked\u201d wants to achieve \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d heights of success, the films have a few more hurdles to clear than the Oscar-winning hits of last summer. \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 and \u2018Wicked\u2019 need a fun portmanteau First things first \u2013\u2013\u00a0\u201dBarbenheimer\u201d had a killer portmanteau. If the studios behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d want to emulate the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, they might want to turn to the movie lovers who helped coin the term that turned last year\u2019s summer flicks into a double feature. The Columbia Journalism Review credits awards pundit Matt Neglia with using \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d first in April 2023, but it quickly spread across the internet wherever movie fans lurked. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d wasn\u2019t clunky, and there was never any question which films \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d referred to \u2014\u00a0the same cannot be said just yet of \u201cGlicked,\u201d \u201cWickiator\u201d or the even uglier \u201cGladicked.\u201d It should be noted that after the smashing success of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer, no release weekends have seen the same double-feature draw, though musings of \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d and \u201cGarfuriosa\u201d pairings did make the rounds online. Those were more jokes about how two seemingly incompatible films could reach the same audiences than genuine attempts at creating a viral trend \u2014\u00a0in no world does the \u00fcber-graphic \u201cSaw X\u201d pair well with the kid-friendly \u201cPaw Patrol: The Mighty Movie.\u201d For now, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d simply haven\u2019t dominated the cultural conversation yet in the same way \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d did. But there\u2019s still time \u2014\u00a0they don\u2019t hit theaters until November 22. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019s\u2019 appeal was mystery Part of the appeal of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was wanting to see it as soon as possible to join the cultural conversation about two of the biggest movies of the year. It helped that we knew so little about both films before their premieres, Nunan said. Aside from a few paparazzi shots of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling rollerblading through Venice Beach, we knew virtually nothing about \u201cBarbie\u201d before it came out. And \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d while based in history, was still a Christopher Nolan film, so its marketing was mostly mysterious and teased major moments without revealing too much of its majesty. But both films had been hyped for over a year before their releases, thanks to marketing that kept much of the secrets of both films but offered fans just enough to keep them excited. A well-timed trailer here and a smart social campaign there \u2013\u2013\u00a0like those \u201cBarbie\u201d headshots with the quippy captions or the ominous live countdown clocks used on billboards and in trailers for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013\u2013\u00a0only made fans more ravenous ahead of the release date, Nunan said. There\u2019s less mystery with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II.\u201d The former is one of the most popular musicals of the century and the fourth-longest running on Broadway \u2013\u2013\u00a0millions have already seen it onstage or read the novel upon which it\u2019s based, so there are fewer surprises in store for audiences, Nunan said. And though \u201cGladiator\u201d won best picture among other Oscars, it came out 24 years ago. \u201cNeither of these franchises are fresh to the audience,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cThey\u2019re both known entities versus the unlimited potential of \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019\u201d Familiarity and continuations of franchises decades later can work \u2014\u00a0\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d was the first huge success since Covid-19 kneecapped movie theaters and spoke to viewers beyond those who\u2019d seen the original \u201cTop Gun\u201d back in 1986, Nunan said. But whether audiences will seek out that nostalgia again is harder to predict. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 had an air of prestige Another \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d advantage was both films\u2019 sublime pairing of director and subject matter. Here was indie staple and Oscar nominee Greta Gerwig helming her biggest film yet about the country\u2019s most famous doll \u2013\u2013 even those less familiar with her work were eager to see whether she could pull off \u201cBarbie.\u201d (The consensus was that she did.) \u201cOppenheimer\u201d director Christopher Nolan also has a distinct style and a dedicated fanbase, which has cemented Nolan as a reliable box office draw, with six of his 12 films making between half a billion to over $1 billion worldwide. The best picture-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d almost cracked a billion. The \u201cartistic audacity\u201d that both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d promised was thrilling in its own right, Nunan said, and part of what drove the more hardcore film fans to the theater for repeat viewings. And that\u2019s the test for a true blockbuster, he said: Whether viewers find it worth it to return and pay to see the same film again and again. The critical and commercial track records for the directors behind \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are less consistent, Nunan said, which could make a difference in the cultural and box-office impact they have. The prolific Ridley Scott of \u201cGladiator II\u201d has made classics like \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cThelma and Louise.\u201d But his more recent films haven\u2019t \u201cmoved the needle\u201d like his earlier work, Nunan said. Last year\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d and 2021\u2019s \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d made decent money but earned middling reviews; 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Last Duel,\u201d though lauded, was declared a \u201cbomb\u201d by trade publications. \u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu is perhaps best known for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d which was a hit with audiences in 2018, though his last film, 2021\u2019s adaptation of the musical \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d was beset by Covid-era box office challenges. Musicals like \u2018Wicked\u2019 can be tough sells It will be a harder road for \u201cWicked\u201d to excel than \u201cBarbie\u201d before it, Nunan said \u2013\u2013\u00a0movie musicals are a tougher sell with audiences, even those adapted from popular properties. (See: \u201cCats\u201d flopping in 2019, even though it was based on one of the longest-running musicals of all time and featured the world-conquering superstar Taylor Swift.) \u201cI think the fact that \u2018Wicked\u2019 is a musical actually limits its long term box office appeal,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cWicked\u201d is also a full-fledged musical where \u201cBarbie\u201d was marketed as a comedy that happened to feature a few impactful musical numbers led by a game Ryan Gosling, and even those numbers were revealed much later in the pre-release campaign, he said. There are exceptions to the movie musical rule, though: Just this year, another musical based on familiar IP did solid numbers \u2014 \u201cMean Girls,\u201d a film adaptation of the Broadway musical based on the 2004 film, made over $100 million in theaters. \u2018Glicked\u2019 does have star power As with \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d before them, \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d have star power in spades. The Roman Empire-set epic has a cast full of \u201cinternet boyfriends,\u201d the men for whom countless fans have pined since their breakout performances: Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn, to name three. Mescal starred in the pandemic-era series \u201cNormal People\u201d and became an Oscar nominee for \u201cAftersun\u201d at 27; the seasoned Pascal reached new heights of heartthrobbery with HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and Quinn appeared in the most recent season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d one of the most-watched Netflix series of all time. Scott\u2019s upcoming film also boasts a star so stratospherically charismatic that the New York Times named him the greatest actor of the 21st century: Denzel Washington, who nearly runs away with the trailer. And \u201cWicked\u201d is anchored by one of the premier pop divas of our time, Ariana Grande, who plays Galinda (yes, Ga-linda), the blonde foil to Cynthia Erivo\u2019s green-skinned Elphaba. Grande hasn\u2019t played a major leading role in a film yet, and she\u2019s only appeared in cameos and bit parts over the last decade. But it\u2019s possible that star power doesn\u2019t play as large a role as it once did in getting butts in seats, Nunan said. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, who played crucial supporting roles in \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d starred in \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d earlier this spring, which faltered at the box office and was sent to VOD just weeks after it hit theaters. \u201cI don\u2019t know, with these blockbuster tentpole films, if the casting is as important as the movie itself,\u201d Nunan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the quality and execution of the film.\u201d He cited \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which featured several major stars in supporting roles, like Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey, Jr. Their inclusion in the cast maybe lent the film an air of prestige, but he\u2019s not sure that any of them were the sole reason people saw the film. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us went to see because Matt and Emily and Robert were in it, but it helped,\u201d he said. There was something alchemical about the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d moment of last summer that exceeded all predictions about how popular both films would prove. It might have been easy to assume that viewers of one film wouldn\u2019t want to see the other since they were so dissimilar, Nunan said, but \u201caudiences proved the studios wrong\u201d and went to see both. \u201cThat summer, \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was meeting on so many levels of special,\u201d he said. Some magic just can\u2019t be replicated, though there\u2019s still a few months for \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d\u00a0to drum up the same must-see prestige as the films that dominated the summer of 2023. What remains to be seen is whether fans who see the films as a double feature will wear gladiator skirts and witch hats to the theater.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/gladiator-ii-wicked-barbenheimer-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_entertainment_streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros", "text": "Streaming appears poised to undergo what some have called \u201cThe Great Re-Bundling,\u201d with services merging, combining or forming alliances that will essentially reconstruct the cable \u201cbundle\u201d that consumers relied upon for decades. While that makes sense for studios eager to offer \u201cmore robust and streamlined content,\u201d as Disney CEO Bob Iger said earlier this year, subscribers have every reason to wonder \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?,\u201d and if all these high-stakes corporate announcements will really benefit them. Will it make access to at-home viewing options cheaper? More plentiful? Easier to navigate and find what you want? Less of a chore to manage in terms of juggling multiple subscriptions? That\u2019s the goal, but honestly, we can\u2019t really know. The latest news to ripple through the streaming front involved reports Paramount, prior to moving forward on its merger with Skydance, looking to combine its Paramount+ with another service. Max, the HBO-centered provider from CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery, was among those cited as potential partners. Such an arrangement would follow the formal announcement in February of Venu Sports, a joint sports offering consisting of Disney\u2019s ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros.; Disney\u2019s intra-studio attempt to create a mega-service to subscribers who ante up for its trio of services: Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+; and Disney\u2019s collaboration plan with Warner Bros. on a bundle consisting of Disney+, Max and Hulu. The advantages for the companies, as they seek to compete with Netflix and the tech giants (Amazon and Apple foremost among them) that have helped crowd the streaming waters, aren\u2019t certain, but the objectives seem clear, beginning with the hope these combined or consolidated services will reduce churn \u2013 that is, people signing up and cancelling and signing up again. What has become increasingly obvious, though, is for all the knocks on cable, starting with the fact consumers paid for lots of channels they never watched, its one-stop-shopping approach eliminated some of the challenges springing up now. That old system worked because the \u201cbundle\u201d actually created a mechanism to financially support a vast number of choices serving various tastes. Simply put, paying for ESPN if you don\u2019t like sports, or CNN and MSNBC if you don\u2019t watch news, might have been irritating, but those millions of cable subscriptions spread out the revenue in a way that made dozens and dozens of channels available and affordable. The dream of a more a la carte system, where you pay for what you watch, has turned out to elusive, primarily because there\u2019s no way \u2013 at least yet \u2013 to adopt that where the cost doesn\u2019t become onerous, and maybe even prohibitive, for many consumers. Unwinding the bundle by \u201ccord cutting\u201d on cable subscriptions might have felt good, but in terms of the industry\u2019s economics, that shift opened Pandora\u2019s box. While Disney or Paramount\u2019s profits need not concern consumers, the ability of those companies to produce and present TV shows and movies people want to see does. After cutting the cord, stitching it back together in a different form through re-bundling comes with question marks, and risks. Just ask newspapers that once delivered a physical bundle that landed on people\u2019s doorsteps before the digital age upended their business model. The promises made by executives like Iger, who called Venu \u201ca major win for sports fans,\u201d might very well work out. In theory, consumers could indeed be spared some of the \u201cannoyance and decision-making,\u201d as Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle wrote, associated with keeping track of a half-dozen streaming services, adding that\u2019s \u201cwhy so many consumers prefer things like all-inclusive vacations, and why bundling is a common business practice.\u201d Still, when it comes to implementing structural changes in how entertainment gets distributed and consumed, an adage well known to most Disney characters remains worth remembering: Be careful what you wish for.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/entertainment/streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_beverly-hills-cop-axel-f-review-eddie-murphy", "text": "\u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d spawned a trio of movies, but more significantly, the 1984 film capped off a string of hits (after \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d and \u201cTrading Places\u201d) that launched Eddie Murphy into the movie-star stratosphere. As Murphy moves into the encores-for-streaming phase of his career (see \u201cComing 2 America\u201d), enter \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\u201d which features enough unapologetic nostalgia (cue the music) to power through its flat spots. The fact that the film is premiering via Netflix, as opposed to theaters, might warrant some second-guessing given the box-office numbers that the latest \u201cBad Boys\u201d sequel has delivered, but that\u2019s a debate for another day. From the get-go, the star appears up to the task as he slides back into a role to which he said goodbye 30 years ago, and introduced a decade before that. As with \u201cComing 2 America,\u201d \u201cAlex F\u201d uses a next-generation hook to get into the story and create the excuse to bring Murphy\u2019s Axel Foley from Detroit (after an introductory action sequence that goes on a bit too long) back to Beverly Hills, reuniting him with lots of familiar faces. In this case, he\u2019s summoned by Billy (Judge Reinhold) to help Axel\u2019s estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige, who followed \u201cHit the Floor\u201d with \u201cZola\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d), a lawyer representing a client who has triggered a warning to back off from some very bad people. Before you can say \u201cGet the f\u2014k outta here\u201d (which is, not surprisingly, said several times), Axel lands in L.A., cheerfully insisting, \u201cThey love me in Beverly Hills!\u201d Staying on brand, he quickly irks the local authorities as he sets about protecting Jane, while running afoul of a corrupt detective played by Kevin Bacon (one of two movies in which he appears this week, the other being \u201cMaXXXine\u201d). Axel also gets teamed up with a younger cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has some history with Jane, although frankly \u2013 other than \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s hilarious cameo as a Beverly Hills realtor \u2013 the newcomers don\u2019t stand much of a chance to register as holdovers like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and John Ashton join Reinhold in dropping by. In perhaps the wisest (and easiest) decision, first-time feature director Mark Molloy relies heavily on music associated with the original movies, from Harold Faltermeyer\u2019s electronic score to songs like \u201cThe Heat is On\u201d and \u201cNeutron Dance,\u201d augmented by a new one from Lil Nas X. In the early going, a younger colleague in Detroit points out that Axel continues to hit the streets at a time when \u201cguys your age\u201d are transitioning to desk jobs, which basically spells out the formulation here, and how Murphy effectively carries off the same mentality as his alter ego. \u201cAxel F\u201d only turns up the heat to a low simmer, but as breezy escapism goes, those armed with the proper attitude might find themselves doing the neutron dance, or a version of it, all over again. \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.

{"id": "2024_07_15_entertainment_whoopi-goldberg-disneyland-ashes", "text": "Whoopi Goldberg wanted her late mother to spend eternity in one of her favorite places. \u201cThe View\u201d host is a well-known fan of Disney, and, during an interview on \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d last week, she revealed that her mother Emma Harris, who died in 2010, also loved spending time at Disney parks. So much so, Goldberg said she scattered some of her mother\u2019s ashes on the \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d attraction at Disneyland. \u201cNo one should do this,\u201d Goldberg told Meyers about her decision. \u201cMy mother loved Disneyland, and so we took her to Disneyland. She loved \u2018Small World,\u2019\u201d she added. Goldberg, who was inducted as a Disney Legend in 2017, said she did inform the park after the fact because it occurred to her it may have been dangerous. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t want ashes just floating around,\u201d she said. Goldberg is right. Spreading human ashes on the properties is strictly prohibited and unlawful, but that hasn\u2019t stopped other fans of Disney parks from trying to honor their loved ones in a similar way. In 2018, The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported that when someone spreads ashes at Disneyland or Disney World, it is given a code \u201cHEPA cleanup,\u201d or unofficially and informally a \u201cCode Grandma.\u201d The incidents, which the Journal estimated happened monthly, are considered biohazards and that have caused rides to be shut down for cleaning.
