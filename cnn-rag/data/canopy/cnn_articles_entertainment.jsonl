She needn\u2019t worry. Smart\u2019s pitch-perfect performance as Vance has earned her rave reviews and two Emmy Awards for lead actress in a comedy series. When Wallace asked if Smart modeled her performance on any comedians, she said she knew she had make her comedic delivery her own. \u201cI mean, you know actors, we\u2019re monkey see monkey do. We\u2019re good mimics, but I didn\u2019t want to pick one specific person and try to do them because I knew it had to be my own style,\u201d Smart said. \u201cIt had to come from me and my sense of humor and timing and things like that. And I\u2019ve always liked watching comedians, so it\u2019s one of my favorite parts of the show that I get to do standup now.\u201d The third season of \u201cHacks\u201d finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. In the series and in reality, the seats are still predominately held by men. Smart shared her thoughts why it remains harder for female comedians to break through. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really interesting topic,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s still this prevailing feeling that women aren\u2019t really as funny as men or that they shouldn\u2019t be off color and things like that. And I have mixed feelings about it. Because obviously playing Deborah, you know, and I know, certainly Deborah\u2019s philosophy about it is that that\u2019s not true.\u201d Season 3 of \u201cHacks\u201d is currently airing on HBO and streaming on Max, which like CNN is part of Warner Bros. Discovery.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_back-to-black-review-marisa-abela-amy-winehouse", "text": "The tragic arc of Amy Winehouse\u2019s brief life and nova-like career creates built-in problems for a biography of the singer, which doesn\u2019t dampen the knockout performance by Marisa Abela in \u201cBack to Black,\u201d capturing the talent, rage and self-destructiveness that defined her. Thin as biopics go, the power of Abela\u2019s portrayal elevates the film, providing a poignance and strength that\u2019s the clearest motivation to go, go, go. Indeed, Winehouse\u2019s stratospheric rise and paparazzi-plagued stardom lean in the direction of a fairly one-dimensional story, as she falls head over heels for the troubled Blake (Jack O\u2019Connell), entering into a relationship that combines passion, excess and toxicity in roughly equal measure. At the same time, she\u2019s making her mark as a songwriter and singer, though her fondness for drink (and Blake\u2019s dalliances with drugs) goes hand in hand with that \u2013 tendencies that provoke less concern than they seemingly should from her father (Eddie Marsan) and colorful grandmother (Lesley Manville), a one-time jazz singer who isn\u2019t above telling tales out of school about the likes of Tony Bennett. Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (whose credits include the John Lennon biopic \u201cNowhere Boy\u201d as well as \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d) from a script by Matt Greenhalgh, \u201cBack to Black\u201d tilts too heavily toward Winehouse\u2019s personal struggles at the expense of her musical triumphs. Then again, as constructed here, the two went hand in hand, with the lyrics to songs like \u201cBack to Black\u201d and \u201cRehab\u201d directly addressing her addictions to her relationship with Blake and alcohol. Having appeared in the HBO series \u201cIndustry,\u201d Abela pulls off this remarkably challenging character both musically and dramatically, in a way that isn\u2019t necessarily sympathetic \u2013 to the extent Winehouse is often the author of her own troubles \u2013 but rather, magnetic. Ill-equipped for the demands of fame, she achieved it with sheer ferocity and talent, becoming the sort of commodity where the train\u2019s moving too fast to slow down much for warning signs. Of course, just making a movie about Winehouse invites charges of exploiting her tragic end at age 27 as opposed to celebrating her talent, but that\u2019s an issue that can be laid at the feet of any number of gone-too-soon musical biographies, from \u201cThe Doors\u201d to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d (The recent \u201cBob Marley: One Love\u201d was notably made with the blessing and participation of his family and felt like a licensed product.) In terms of capturing what animated Winehouse, the blinding star power that Abela emits here ultimately justifies the exercise. As for whether that means seeing \u201cBack to Black\u201d now in a theater or later at home, it\u2019s the kind of small-boned movie that, unlike its subject, doesn\u2019t quite have the feel of a headliner. \u201cBack to Black\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters.

Nicely played by the leads, this tale of a 40-year-old woman swept off her feet by a 20-something boy-band star amounts to playing the genre\u2019s hits while following all the same old steps. Destined for Amazon, it\u2019s a competent date-night or gals\u2019-night movie for those who don\u2019t want to leave the house \u2013 Chardonnay optional, but recommended \u2013 which makes practical sense, landing as it does in a middle ground that has struggled at the box office. Cheated on and left by her husband, Sol\u00e9ne (Hathaway) is a successful art-gallery owner who gets roped at the last-minute into squiring her teenage daughter and the kid\u2019s friends to Coachella, where her ex has purchased a meet-and-greet experience with the members of August Moon, whose following might lean more toward the tween crowd. A reluctant attendee, Sol\u00e9ne has the ultimate meet-cute moment with band member Hayes (Galitzine, of \u201cMary & George\u201d and \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d renown), stumbling into his trailer thinking it\u2019s the restroom. After some awkward banter and obvious chemistry \u2013 which with the benefit of hindsight is about as good as the movie gets \u2013 Hayes shows up unexpectedly (by her, that is) at Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s gallery, telling her shyly, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t meet people like you very often.\u201d For a pop star, he\u2019s an endearingly sensitive soul, which doesn\u2019t do much to quell her reticence, due both to their age gap and his fame. Romance and complications ensue, with writer-director Michael Showalter (\u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and \u201cSpoiler Alert,\u201d sharing script credit with Jennifer Westfeldt) adapting Robinne Lee\u2019s novel in part by relying on the customary montages to handle some of the heavy lifting. If only the garnishes were a little less tired, including the prying paparazzi and Reid Scott as Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s no-right-to-be-bent-out-of-shape ex. All that really leaves, then, is the interplay between Hathaway and Galitzine, with the latter (starring in his second Amazon movie in a year\u2019s time about a romance complicated by fame) performing double duty on the songs. The problem is however well they might work in terms of rooting for them as a couple, it\u2019s hard to avoid the very real issue that the world he inhabits and indeed people in general can be pretty lousy. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d will likely be most satisfying for those who choose not to sweat the details, enjoying the scenery and fantasy wrapped up in it. Think of it as one of those movies that really reinforces the adage there are no new ideas, just fresh versions of old ones set to different beats. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d premieres May 2 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.

{"id": "2024_05_03_entertainment_unfrosted-review-jerry-seinfeld", "text": "Jerry Seinfeld waited this long for his directing debut, which makes the choice of \u201cUnfrosted,\u201d a silly lark of a comedy, somewhat perplexing. Far from a passion project, this Netflix film distinctly feels \u2013 as one of its writers says in the production notes \u2013 like a punchline in search of a movie, built on a soggy parade of sugary cameos that doesn\u2019t provide much snap, crackle and pop. Charitably, \u201cUnfrosted\u201d serves as a disjointed send-up of the 1960s, using a war between cereal companies \u2013 and the idea that for kids watching TV during those years, \u201cBattle Creek, Michigan\u201d seemed like a magical place \u2013 as its backbone. In that sense the ostensible plot, involving a race to develop what became the Pop-Tart, is really more a point of entry than a true recipe. Sharing script credit with a trio of writers (two of them \u201cSeinfeld\u201d alums, as well as collaborators on the animated \u201cBee Movie\u201d), Seinfeld more than anything seems to have wanted to make a modern-day Marx Brothers movie, where the gags fly fast and furious. That includes plenty of lines made funny by hindsight, like someone reading a newspaper in the early \u201860s and saying, \u201cVietnam, now that seems like a good idea.\u201d The problem is mastering that sort of tone is a lot harder than Groucho and company made it look. Sneaking in a bunch of old-movie references (\u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d among them), or jokes about John F. Kennedy (Bill Burr) being a philanderer, might provoke a chuckle or two in Seinfeld\u2019s demo, but the free-associating, madcap pacing feels like overkill in a way that gets old awfully fast. A fictionalized story with a tiny grain of truth, \u201cUnfrosted\u201d focuses on Seinfeld\u2019s Bob Cabana, an executive at Kellogg\u2019s who is horrified to discover that rival Post, and its scheming chief executive Marjorie Post (Amy Schumer), might be on the verge of marketing a breakfast pastry that could revolutionize the business. Determined to level the playing field, Bob enlists a former colleague (Melissa McCarthy) to join the effort to thwart Post, as the two embark on what amounts to a pop-culture tour of the 1960s. While some of those digressions are clever, most come across as arbitrary and odd, veering off course to include gags about everything from the space program to fitness guru Jack LaLanne. Of all the casting surprises, one stands head and shoulders above the rest (you\u2019ll know it when you see it), but that moment mainly highlights what \u201cUnfrosted\u201d could have been had the movie been able to sustain that. While it\u2019s possible to get into the nostalgic spirit, the question Seinfeld doesn\u2019t bother trying to address is \u201cWhy?,\u201d or at least, why now? Perhaps curiosity about the whole directing thing simply got the better of him, but it\u2019s a self-indulgent exercise, informed by a sense that Netflix would have said \u201cyes\u201d to anything he pitched them. (Seinfeld does include one sweet wrinkle, naming a character \u201cRick Ludwin\u201d after the late NBC executive who ordered \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d) In promoting the film, Seinfeld recently lamented the current state of TV comedy, so it\u2019s not surprising he\u2019d be drawn to the past. Still, while \u201cUnfrosted\u201d isn\u2019t wholly unfunny (or at least, not consistently so) it is, more than anything, just plain unnecessary. \u201cUnfrosted\u201d premieres May 3 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/entertainment/unfrosted-review-jerry-seinfeld/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Fortunately, the third round (after a \u201cQueen Charlotte\u201d detour) has the highly sympathetic Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) at its core, adding some additional sweetness to the formula. For the uninitiated, poor Penelope has spent two seasons secretly moonlighting as the acid-tongued gossip Lady Whistledown (still voiced by Julie Andrews, because, well, Julie Andrews!), using her access to the coming and goings and romances among the elite to greatly irritate many (the queen foremost among them) while titillating them at the same time. Penelope has channeled her creative energies in this direction in part because of her skepticism that she\u2019ll ever find a match for herself, a process made no easier by her infatuation with Colin (Luke Newton), the latest of the seemingly endless parade of dashing Bridgerton progeny to brave the matrimonial dance. (There\u2019s a praying mantis quality to Bridgertons, since while mating doesn\u2019t lead to death, they do tend to lose their heads and then mostly disappear.) As usual, there are complications and hurdles thrown at Colin and Penelope, including the latter finding a new potential suitor after experiencing the disgrace of having Colin\u2019s gallant efforts to help her find a match exposed. The whole interlude prompts him to begin grasping his own complicated feelings, although in keeping with its Jane Austen-flecked roots, the course of true love never runs smoothly. To their credit, the producers juggle a few extra balls (debutante and otherwise) this time around, including subplots involving Colin\u2019s sister Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and even the family matriarch Violet (Ruth Gemmell), which, given the contortions surrounding the central duo, come across as prudent distractions. Frankly, the level of heat generated by \u201cBridgerton\u201d still remains something of a mystery, not because the show isn\u2019t well done \u2013 possessing the customary trappings for which producer Shonda Rhimes is known \u2013 but simply because everything about it feels so familiar to anyone who ever watched \u201cMasterpiece Theater,\u201d other than a bit more latitude when it comes to the ripping and removal of bodices and the clever use of contemporary music. Give some credit to the casting and, more pragmatically, the strength of Netflix as a platform relative to the more rarefied homes for such fare. Underscoring the show\u2019s value, the service will divide the eight-episode season into two drops, emulating its strategy with shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d to lengthen its hold on viewers beyond an instant binge. If the storytelling has already begun to feel a trifle tired, Coughlan\u2019s vulnerability (and the semi-adorable note that she has asked for an edited version to show her parents) provides a welcome infusion. By sustaining and indeed replenishing those soap-opera qualities, the series seems likely to exhaust its roster of marriage-eligible Bridgertons before Netflix will need to find some buzzworthy new bauble to beguile those who have bought into this world. \u201cBridgerton\u201d begins its third season May 16 on Netflix, with the second half to premiere on June 13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/bridgerton-season-3-review-penelope-colin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

That series, which ran from 2014 to 2019, has a cult following, as does Buteau\u2019s recently renewed Netflix series \u201cSurvival of the Thickest\u201d based on her book of essays of the same title. Suffice it to say with two such funny performers working together, not to mention the other cast members including Hasan Minhaj, Oliver Platt and John Carroll Lynch, it was a rollicking good time on the \u201cBabes\u201d set. \u201cWe were cracking up, like crying,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cMy co-writer Josh Rabinowitz famously during the plumber scene laughed so hard he smacked his head on his chair. He like injured his forehead, we were laughing so hard.\u201d Shooting in 25 days, with Buteau only being available to film for 15, heightened both the tension and the hilarity, they said, and Glazer confirmed that some of the best of those funny moments are being put together as extras for streaming. Director Pamela Adlon, best known for her starring role on acclaimed series \u201cBetter Things,\u201d said it was challenging getting the project done in such a short period of time. Yet the timing couldn\u2019t have been better given that she had just wrapped the final season of her show. Plus, the script really spoke to her, she told CNN. \u201cI read it and it was emotional besides all the comedy. And there was an edginess to it,\u201d Adlon said. \u201cAll those things have to go together for me to really respond to something. I gotta have the dark, I gotta have the funny, I gotta have the heart. It\u2019s gotta hit you in the gut to make you feel, make you cry, but then you gotta have a little light.\u201d Glazer should be proud to know that, as she said she, Rabinowitz and their producer Susie Fox worked really hard to mine their own life experiences as parents to craft a relatable script. \u201cIt was really important for us to have something so funny, but to balance it with heart and emotional heft,\u201d she said. \u201cThose were our guideposts.\u201d \u201cBabes\u201d is in theaters Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/entertainment/ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_bodkin-review-will-forte-obama", "text": "The latest Netflix project falling under the Obamas\u2019 production deal, \u201cBodkin\u201d initially possesses an intriguing \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d-like vibe with a touch of \u201cLocal Hero,\u201d the classic 1983 film about a young executive dispatched to a Scottish village. Here, it\u2019s an American podcaster invading a quirky Irish town, nosing around a cold case that yields a steadily diminishing drip from this Irish spring. Said podcaster Gilbert (Will Forte) comes with his share of baggage, as does Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), the investigative reporter grudgingly assigned to accompany him. They\u2019re joined by Emmy (Robyn Cara), a bright-eyed young researcher who looks up to Dove, which doesn\u2019t make the more seasoned journalist\u2019s treatment of her any less frosty. Indeed, Dove makes clear she feels like she\u2019s slumming in pandering to this request (order, actually) from her bosses to squire Gilbert through his mission, at least until they begin to chip away at the layers surrounding what might have happened to three people who disappeared a quarter-century earlier. As with \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and \u201cLocal Hero,\u201d there\u2019s an odd quaintness to the town Gilbert finds charming, but as is so often the case, the cheery exterior for tourists and rubes hides a darker underbelly. That includes guardedness toward outsiders that introduces a pinch of \u201cAn American Werewolf in London\u201d into the stew as well. Gilbert approaches the whole exercise from a very different perspective than Dove, who becomes engaged by the prospect of cracking the case, while he simply wants to put on a good show, prompting her to liken his work less to journalism than pornography. \u201cHe thinks Ireland is some kind of Disneyland,\u201d she grumbles, which is understandable given the \u201cDarby O\u2019Gill and the Little People\u201d setting, with even more heavy drinking and pounding hangovers. Forte is happily more subdued than he often tends to be, but Gilbert is still a reluctant sleuth, which makes Dove (played with a nicely crusty edge by Cullen, an Irish actor) the true driver of this story. Over the seven episodes, that arc becomes increasingly convoluted and a trifle far-fetched \u2013 not fatal flaws, but not helpful ones either. The Obamas\u2019 Higher Ground production company has become a prolific supplier to Netflix, from movies like \u201cLeave the World Behind\u201d to award-winning documentaries. Created by Jez Scharf, \u201cBodkin\u201d represents a low-key addition to that slate, but still makes for a passable binge; still, what looks like a distinctive show gradually blends into its saturated genre \u2013 less a commentary on true-crime podcasts than a reminder that even with series that start out well, there\u2019s not always a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. \u201cBodkin\u201d premieres May 9 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/bodkin-review-will-forte-obama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_tattooist-of-auschwitz-review", "text": "Something as simple as a framing device elevates \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d \u2013 which stands out from a host of recent Holocaust tales \u2013 thanks in part to Harvey Keitel, starring as the elderly Lale Sokolov who recounts his remarkable story of life in a concentration camp to an unlikely interviewer. Jumping around in time, this British production captures the horror of that experience while finding notes of grace in its narrator\u2019s survival. That\u2019s in part because this six-part series is at its core a love story, unfolding under the most horrible of circumstances. Assigned to tattoo identification numbers on the arms of other prisoners, the the young Lale, or Lali (\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u2019s\u201d Jonah Hauer-King, who lost a noticeable amount of weight for the role), meets Gita (Polish actress Anna Pr\u00f3chniak) while in the camps, becoming almost instantly smitten. \u201cI want you to live to be an old man,\u201d Gita tells him at one point, a wish that seems all the more tenuous as he deals with the sadistic guards, while she grapples with illness and those around them keep meeting terrible ends. Their interactions take place tenderly against a backdrop of pain, suffering and the constant threat of quick and arbitrary death, which leads the elder Lali to be haunted by visions of those he knew and lost. In a stark device, the victims (and in some instances, perpetrators) appear to Lali, like photographs etched in his mind, as he grapples with those memories and feelings of survivor\u2019s guilt. His story pours out, gradually, to aspiring author Heather Morris (\u201cYellowjackets\u201d star Melanie Lynskey), who is understandably overwhelmed by this flood of memories. \u201cI haven\u2019t got long,\u201d Lali tells her, fueling her commitment to ensure his story gets told. As noted, there have been several recent productions dealing with similar material, including Netflix\u2019s \u201cAll the Light We Cannot See\u201d and Hulu\u2019s \u201cWe Were the Lucky Ones.\u201d On top of that, the 80th anniversary of D-Day is prompting an onslaught of documentary fare devoted to World War II. Nevertheless, \u201cTattooist of Auschwitz\u201d stands apart from the crowd, thanks in part to the quality of its performances, not just by documenting the barbarity of the Nazis but the sprigs of humanity that managed to bloom during the darkest of times. Featuring a new song from Barbra Streisand, the series closes with footage of the real Sokolov being interviewed. Those clips drive the point home, in a way that demonstrates why even for those resistant to sitting through another Holocaust drama, there ought to be room for a really good one. \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d premieres May 2 on Peacock.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/tattooist-of-auschwitz-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_entertainment_ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review", "text": "Less than a year after Hulu\u2019s Ashley Madison documentary, Netflix settles for seconds with \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal,\u201d a three-part British production that has the advantage of feeling like roughly four documentaries in one. Part business meltdown, part crime mystery, part media critique, and part \u201ctales of Ashley Madison,\u201d it\u2019s a look at the married-people hookup site that\u2019s plenty salacious and definitely not monotonous. Founded on the theory that a surprising number of married people were signing up for dating sites, Ashley Madison (taken from two popular girl names) began with the slogan \u201cWhen monogamy becomes monotony\u201d before its evolution under CEO Noel Biderman to the more in-your-face line, \u201cLife is short. Have an affair.\u201d Yet while the company enjoyed explosive subscriber growth, and Biderman became media catnip by making the rounds subjecting himself to the righteous indignation of (mostly outraged) TV interviewers, the dirty secret was that Ashley Madison hadn\u2019t taken the promised steps to protect its data, leaving itself vulnerable to a 2015 hack that exposed thousands of clients. \u201cIt was like gambling with people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Evan Back, a sales executive and strategist who is one of the former employees interviewed. In one respect, director Toby Paton approaches the new docuseries in a manner that\u2019s very much of a piece with the daytime-TV mentality Biderman successfully exploited at the time from a marketing standpoint, working off the theory that there was no such thing as bad publicity for a site offering the prospect of adulterous hookups made easy. \u201cAshley Madison\u201d thus spends a lot of time chronicling a few specific soap-opera-worthy tales of lives that were upended when the hacked information went public, such as the fallout for Sam Rader, a Dallas area Christian vlogger who had secretly signed up, and his wife, Nia. At the same time, the docuseries both builds a kind of strange suspense toward the hack, on multiple levels, while providing a pointed media dissection of the voyeurism, with a touch of schadenfreude often masquerading as journalism that made this story so irresistible. As the cherry on top, Paton also devotes a portion of the series to the investigation into the hackers, self-identified as The Impact Team, which didn\u2019t behave like most corporate hackers in the way it presented its demands, leaving lingering questions and speculation regarding its motives. Put all that together, and \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\u201d lives up \u2013 or perhaps better, down \u2013 to its name. Like the ad said, life is short when it comes to committing to another docuseries. Still, people will no doubt be willing to take the leap for a story with such delicious \u201cThere but for the grace of God\u2026\u201d overtones. \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\u201d premieres May 15 in Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/entertainment/ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review", "text": "Seven years after a trilogy that ended with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d didn\u2019t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it\u2019s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity \u2013 the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren \u2013 the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What\u2019s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) \u2013 an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom \u2013 attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (\u201cThe Witcher\u2019s\u201d Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing \u201cThe Planet of the Apes\u201d but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run. Hollywood blockbusters aren\u2019t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these \u201cApes\u201d prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don\u2019t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it\u2019s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d premieres May 10 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_15_entertainment_wicked-trailer-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo", "text": "\u201cAre people born wicked?\u201d It certainly seems like Glinda \u2013 as played by Ariana Grande \u2013 might be in the latest trailer for the movie spectacle based on the Broadway musical (which, in turn, is based on the bestselling book by Gregory Maguire). At first glance, the trailer released on Wednesday is a glorious dance of color and a symphony of two of the most revered musical voices in the business, that of Grande and Oscar-nominee and Tony-winner Cynthia Erivo. Watch the preview again, however, and you notice the nuanced performances, with Grande\u2019s Glinda seeming to be a bit pricklier than the Glindas we\u2019ve seen on stage portrayed by actors like the bubbly Kristin Chenoweth \u2013 who originated the role on Broadway. Assigned to be roommates, Glinda brings her new green friend Elphaba (Erivo) to her pink-drenched room in the trailer. The clip even highlights a particularly salty moment when Glinda quips that she would give away a decidedly ugly hat \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t \u201chate anybody that much\u201d \u2013 subsequently entrusting it to Elphaba. It\u2019s just one of the moments that suggest a bit more mean girl energy than simply \u201cpopular\u201d energy from the Good Witch of the North. Later on in the trailer, Elphaba\u2019s notably strong powers are exposed, much to Glinda\u2019s chagrin, leading headmistress Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) to take notice and tell Elphaba, \u201cYou\u2019re the one the Wizard has been waiting for.\u201d Elphaba brings Glinda along when she is summoned to the Emerald City to meet the powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum), and it is here that they both begin to realize that, as Elphaba says, \u201cSomething bad is happening in Oz.\u201d \u201cThe best way to bring folks together is to give them a real good enemy,\u201d the Wizard says, in a nod to some of the more political tones that suggest director Jon M. Chu\u2019s cinematic retelling (over two parts) of a notoriously digestible Broadway musical will, perhaps, not shy away from highlighting the darker themes explored in the book. Examples of that come in shots of disturbing propaganda imagery painting Elphaba as somebody to fear, including a large, scary banner of Elphaba draped over a building and a giant wooden effigy of her set on fire in the town square. As the \u201cWicked\u201d story goes, Glinda eventually does establish a sisterly bond with Elphaba, and that becomes clear in the trailer. But it\u2019s Elphaba\u2019s character arc that is the most compelling when Erivo\u2019s chilling rendition of \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d rings out at the end of the preview. As Elphaba takes flight on her broomstick, she says, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Wizard,\u201d she continues, \u201cwho should be afraid of me.\u201d The hotly anticipated two-part \u201cWicked\u201d movie is a cinematic adaptation of the famed Broadway musical, which is a prequel to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d It tells an alternate version of events in Oz before Dorothy\u2019s arrival, exploring how Glinda and Elphaba\u2019s \u201cunlikely but profound friendship\u201d evolves as their lives take different paths, according to an official synopsis. \u201cTheir extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d the synopsis reads. Jonathan Bailey, Bowen Yang, Ethan Slater and Peter Dinklage, among others, round out the ensemble cast. \u201cWicked: Part 1\u201d will fly into theaters on November 27. \u201cWicked: Part 2\u201d will follow in late 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/entertainment/wicked-trailer-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_if-review-ryan-reynolds-john-krasinski", "text": "Occasionally a movie gets misleadingly marketed for understandable reasons, and so it is with \u201cIF,\u201d a sweetly sentimental film from writer-director John Krasinski that the ads make look like a madcap romp. The best parts should strike a mildly receptive chord with parents while potentially boring younger kids, a prescription that could subject the movie\u2019s imaginary friends to a harsh reality once audiences in summer-movie mode get a good look at it. After his breakout success with \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (whose delayed prequel will arrive in June), Krasinski shifts toward a PG-rated movie built around animated characters, infused with a family-friendly vibe. Yet it\u2019s no accident that the classic James Stewart movie \u201cHarvey\u201d at one point plays on the TV, since \u201cIF\u201d seeks the same whimsical tone, while owing perhaps its strongest debt to the 1995 film adaptation of \u201cA Little Princess\u201d \u2013 which also focuses on a young girl dealing with grief, loss and uncertainty \u2013 brightened by detours into the fantastic. Bea (Cailey Fleming, delivering a splendid anchoring performance after growing up among \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) has already lost her mom, and now her dad (Krasinski) is hospitalized as he awaits heart surgery. Forced to stay with her grandma (Fiona Shaw), Bea discovers a neighbor (Ryan Reynolds in kinder, gentler mode) who works to find new homes for imaginary friends (or IFs) whose kids have grown up and forgotten them. The imaginary friends, not surprisingly, turn out to be an eclectic and colorful lot, featuring a wide assortment of celebrity voices, among them Krasinski\u2019s wife, Emily Blunt, and the late Louis Gossett Jr. The most prominent imaginary pair each have notable connections to other cast members: Krasinski\u2019s \u201cThe Office\u201d co-star Steve Carell, whose needy Blue bears a too-strong resemblance to McDonald\u2019s Grimace; and Blossom, voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who produced \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d which co-starred Shaw. As Bea states at the outset, she no longer considers herself a kid given what she\u2019s endured, which makes the dual mission pretty overt \u2013 not just finding kids to go with these eccentric monsters, but helping the girl rediscover the wonders of childhood. In that latter regard, Krasinski conjures some touching, lovely moments, although they coexist awkwardly with the imperative to wring laughs and sight gags out of the computer-generated characters, which, however impressively they\u2019re rendered, has the effect of flattening the movie. In one respect, it\u2019s admirable that Krasinski would try to parlay whatever clout he\u2019s amassed into something more heartfelt, but that approach might have fared better by sparing the demands and expectations that go with lining up all those big names, lavish premieres, colorful character posters and marketing tie-ins.

{"id": "2024_05_13_entertainment_drew-barrymore-pets", "text": "Ask Drew Barrymore what breed of dog she would be were a canine and she doesn\u2019t even hesitate to answer. \u201cCorgi,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cNo question.\u201d And why a corgi? \u201cWell, my daughters and I love their fluffy butts,\u201d she said. \u201cI relate to the tiny legs and they\u2019re just so cute.\u201d The actor, producer and daytime talk show host is a pet mom to quite a crew: two dogs, four cats, a bearded dragon, a fish and a snake named Cecil, but with the \u201cc\u201d pronounced like a hard \u201cs\u201d as a snake would hiss. Barrymore adores animals. She said she wept the most writing her memoir \u201cWildflower\u201d when she shared a story about her beloved dog, Flossie, who lived to be almost 17. So, it made sense for Barrymore to partner with Ring for a new campaign announced Monday. \u201cRing Pet Portraits\u201d invites pet parents to join the company in raising funds for animal shelters in need by sharing their favorite pet videos and pictures. When people share a pet video or photo post on Instagram or TikTok using #RingPets through June 14, Ring will make a donation to support ASPCA\u00a0and local animal shelters across the US. Barrymore even filmed a commercial with her dog, Douglas, in support of the campaign (Jeremy, her bearded dragon, makes a cameo) in which she has to explain to her pup that she can\u2019t submit his photo because he\u2019s a \u201cnepo puppy.\u201d She recently lost her golden retriever, Lucy, a month ago, an experience Barrymore said \u201cwas so hard.\u201d \u201cThe whole show built like a memorial wall to her, which was so sweet. \u2018cause everyone in the building was so affected,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we all started in Covid, we weren\u2019t allowed to have guests or people. So, I would bring the dogs and they just made everything feel so much safer and cozier.\u201d Barrymore has been connected to animals almost since the beginning. She began her acting career as an infant and her first commercial was for a Purina puppy chow when she was a toddler. As a young adult she shared her home with cats and now as a 49 year-old mother of two young daughters her pets are a big part of the family. \u201cThere\u2019s just this like, unspoken relationship that you have this connection, this constant companion, this love that is just so profound,\u201d Barrymore said. \u201cMy dogs sleep in my bed with me and so do my cats and it makes me feel like a whole human being.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I won\u2019t sleep with my friends,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m weird about sharing a bed, but with my kids and animals, I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d She joked that she could have used a Ring camera on set as Lucy loved to wander around her daytime talk show. \u201cWe use cameras to watch babies. I certainly had many, many baby monitors,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God. Between the two kids. I felt like I was wrapped up in baby monitor cords. So yes, I\u2019m like, this totally makes sense.\u201d And while she loves the family she\u2019s built, Barrymore said she\u2019s not anxious to grow it. \u201cAfter we lost Lucy, the girls were like, we should get another dog for Douglas,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, another dog for Douglas will be my undoing. I can\u2019t do it right now.  I think it\u2019ll be a minute.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/entertainment/drew-barrymore-pets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_entertainment_star-wars-phantom-menace-turns-25", "text": "The teeth-gnashing aspects of \u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d have been chewed upon for a quarter century, from Watto to Anakin Skywalker\u2019s Midi-chlorian count (and miracle birth) to almost everyone\u2019s favorite punching bag, Jar Jar Binks. Yet as the movie that kicked off George Lucas\u2019 prequel trilogy hits theaters to commemorate its 25th anniversary for the de facto \u201cStar Wars\u201d holiday May the Fourth, let\u2019s accentuate the positive by identifying a half-dozen things the film, and the franchise\u2019s patriarch, got decidedly right. Each of these elements have echoed through \u201cStar Wars\u201d lore, and in most instances been put to better use elsewhere (in sequels, the various animated series overseen by Dave Filoni and the recent live-action ones, like \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\u201d) than they were in the original film. Think of them as creative building blocks, which overcame clunkier parts of the script and awkward performances to influence the rest of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d timeline. They\u2019re presented here in ascending order of significance: 6. The Emperor\u2019s long game. The idea that Palpatine/Darth Sidious (played by Ian McDiarmid) would spend years undermining the Republic from the inside got a bit wonky, but it created a fertile backdrop for how the Sith could outmaneuver the Jedi. 5. The digital effects. Admittedly, this was a bit of a mixed bag, since Lucas\u2019 emphasis on the visual components seemed to come at the expense of paying attention to the acting and performances, and in ways to overwhelm them. Yet he credibly moved the bar forward in terms of digital effects and design, which paid off in the scale of the action sequences. 4. Mace Windu. Samuel L. Jackson didn\u2019t have much to do in this first movie, but the Jedi master became a vital part of the mythology and had opportunities to demonstrate his power later (perhaps foremost in the animated \u201cThe Clone Wars\u201d), while padding the actor\u2019s formidable resume when it comes to appearing in blockbuster franchises. 3. Darth Maul. As played by Ray Park, the mostly silent Sith apprentice represents one of the most visually striking characters introduced over the course of the entire series \u2013 including that way-cool double-sided lightsaber \u2013 so much so that Filoni went to great lengths to revive him after what certainly appeared to be a glass-half-empty exit at the end of \u201cPhantom Menace.\u201d 2. Casting Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. Although Lucas tilted the plot toward Darth Vader\u2019s origin story, finding the young Obi-Wan Kenobi was a major challenge, and McGregor gave the first trilogy dramatic ballast even in its weaker moments, as did Neeson as his master. Those qualities were underscored by their brief reunion in the recent Disney+ series. 1. The lightsaber duels. In the original trilogy, lightsaber duels were essentially just basic sword fights, with a few acrobatic maneuvers and uses of telekinesis. The battle between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan \u2013 set to composer John Williams\u2019 evocative \u201cDuel of the Fates,\u201d one of his finest musical contributions in a long line of them \u2013 lifted that to dazzling heights, not only in the use of \u201cForce\u201d abilities as an organic form of fighting but through the choreography and physicality. (Give much credit for the latter to Park, who put his experience as a martial artist and stunt double to excellent use.) Every lightsaber fight since then \u2013 including the memorable image of Yoda energetically leaping around in \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d and \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d \u2013 has built upon the framework that sequence established. It\u2019s also likely a key reason why \u201cStar Wars\u201d has continued to flourish as parents pass it on to their kids. Not everything in \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d aged well, but that climactic duel is one of those scenes that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. \u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d will play in select theaters beginning May 3.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/entertainment/star-wars-phantom-menace-turns-25/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling", "text": "Superhero movies have seen better days at the box office, but an action-comedy based on a 1980s TV show still feels like an unlikely candidate to kick off the summer. Buoyed by the lure of what Ryan Gosling can do for a post-\u201cBarbie\u201d encore (or Ken-core), \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d is too flat in the early going to fully meet that challenge, rallying toward the end without reaching the heights required to make a really big splash. At its best, director David Leitch (\u201cDeadpool 2\u201d) has served up a movie defined by its love for the movies, and specifically, the stunt work where he cut his professional teeth before shifting into the big chair. In that sense, the TV series that starred Lee Majors (a show most memorable for its theme song, which is featured) creates a very loose template to set up a vehicle about a stuntman whose troubles spill off the screen into real life, forcing him to put his skills to use dealing with real bad guys. Getting there requires some buildup, with Gosling\u2019s Colt Seavers introduced serving as the stunt double for a typically self-absorbed star, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), while becoming involved with Jody (Emily Blunt), a fellow member of the crew. An accident derails Colt\u2019s plans and indeed life, and time passes before he\u2019s called out of retirement by Gail (\u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham), the fast-talking, troubleshooting producer on all of Ryder\u2019s films. Of course, he\u2019d probably stay safely at home if the space epic in question didn\u2019t mark Jody\u2019s directing debut, offering the prospect of a reunion that, naturally, doesn\u2019t go as smoothly as he hoped. There are also hidden reasons for the renewed interest in Colt, which has to do with offscreen shenanigans and Ryder becoming involved with some nefarious characters. That forces Colt into what amounts to private-eye mode, using his movie-trained skills to get himself both into and out of perilous situations. Setting all that up, including the romance, results in some arid stretches between the elaborate stunts, which are ultimately the main source of \u201cThe Fall Guy\u2019s\u201d appeal and certainly its comedy. Gosling imbues Colt with a goofy charm and amusing neediness, but the underlying premise was a trifle strained even back in the Reagan era, and putting the whole thing on steroids for the movies doesn\u2019t completely address those issues. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d thus stands out primarily for smaller moments and wrinkles, such as Colt\u2019s boss (Winston Duke) constantly quoting movie lines to him, Taylor-Johnson sounding a whole lot like Matthew McConaughey, and a stunt dog trained to respond to French, including an especially juvenile command. Perhaps foremost, \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d feels burdened by the weight of expectations and its positioning as a major blockbuster when the movie really operates as a light-hearted ode to the unknown stuntman, in a way that\u2019s basically just amiably OK. Gosling has broad shoulders, but trying to make it anything more than that is, even for him, a heavy lift. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d premieres May 3 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_15_entertainment_golden-bachelorette-joan-vassos", "text": "A longtime viewer of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d franchise and a true believer in the show\u2019s ability to help people find and meet their match, newly minted Golden Bachelorette Joan Vassos saw an ad seeking contestants for \u201cThe Golden Bachelor\u201d as a sign she should apply. \u201cI would love to say one of my kids did it and they thought it\u2019d be perfect, but I did it on my own,\u201d Vassos told CNN in her first interview, recalling when she filled out her application form for \u201cThe Golden Bachelor,\u201d which starred 72-year-old widower Gerry Turner, who dated more than 20 women on national TV \u2013 including Vassos. Vassos, a 61-year-old Maryland school administrator, remembers the night she applied for the show. Her husband of 32 years had passed away two years prior, and she had not yet been ready to date again. She was at a restaurant with a friend, and realized she wanted to put herself out there. \u201cI did not want to spend my life alone, so I knew that I had to take action, but my heart wasn\u2019t there at all,\u201d Vassos said. \u201cI was saying to my friend, \u2018How in the world do you date now? Look around this restaurant. Everybody here is a couple. Everybody my age is married. All my friends are married.\u201d When Vassos got home from dinner, she saw the casting call on TV for the new reality series about finding love in the second part of your life. \u201cI was like, \u2018The universe is talking to me,\u2019\u201d Vassos said. On \u201cThe Golden Bachelor,\u201d Vassos, who has four grown children and two grandchildren, was a fan-favorite who formed an early connection with Turner. But her time on the inaugural season was cut short when she made the decision to leave the show to return home to her family. Now, Vassos has been selected to star in the first season of \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette,\u201d a female-fronted spinoff that will feature Vassos dating men in their fifties through seventies. With nothing to lose and ready for love after healing from loss, Vassos told CNN about what she hopes to achieve on her televised journey when \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette\u201d premieres this fall on ABC. From life in \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d mansion to debunking ageist tropes \u2013 and her thoughts on Turner\u2019s three-month marriage and subsequent divorce \u2013 here are key takeaways from CNN\u2019s conversation with Vassos. The\u00a0women of \u201cThe Golden Bachelor\u201d formed a sisterhood \u201cI remember the first night I walked into the mansion, and I was really nervous because I didn\u2019t really know how Bachelor Nation was going to portray us \u2013 we\u2019re going to look like foolish older people dating \u2013 I was just a little apprehensive. I walked into this room and I met all these lovely women and it was the first time since my husband had passed away that I felt like I was in a room with people that were just like me. They were single women in their sixties and seventies, and we all were looking for love. It\u2019s not necessarily like a very dignified thing that you\u2019re doing at this age. It\u2019s kind of awkward honestly, so it was so comforting to be like \u2013 we were instant friends.\u201d Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist\u2019s split after a three-month marriage surprised Vassos \u201cI loved watching their journey. I saw them fall in love. I believed just, like \u2013 they did that. They were like the perfect couple. I applaud that they jumped into this process with both feet and they were ready to find love and they knew what true love was. They both had it in their previous lives. So, I applaud them for doing that and I also applaud them when they discovered it wasn\u2019t perfect. That they called it quits and it\u2019s not the end of the world, and we have to let them live their journey and follow their hearts and it wasn\u2019t right for them. I did not see it coming. They\u2019re still good friends. I\u2019m good friends with both of them.\u201d Her four kids all want her to find love. Making out on TV, not so much \u201cMy first and third children are very into this. They think it\u2019s really fun and like, what a cool experience for mom. My daughter Erica and my son Luke are a little, like a little cringey. Like, \u2018Don\u2019t kiss a guy on TV. This is gonna be really embarrassing. My friends are watching.\u2019 But overall, all of them want me to find love.\u201d She wants to redefine what it means to be in your sixties \u201cI think there\u2019s cultures in the world that revere the older people and they think that they have knowledge and they have this experience of life, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s super true in our society. So, I think (\u201cThe Golden Bachelor\u201d) showed the side of, we\u2019re not old. We don\u2019t have canes. Some people on the show had hearing aids, but nobody could even see they had them. Growing old now is very different. We were all very fit, we exercised, we shared great stories about raising our kids and we learned so much from each other. There\u2019s a lot of knowledge that we have inside of us because we\u2019ve lived life. In our culture, I feel like growing old is not a dignified thing. You\u2019re just supposed to kind of fade in the back, take a backseat to the next generation. I\u2019m hoping that we change that a little bit. We\u2019re still fun and energetic and we know how to use our phones.\u201d She will never move away from her family for a man \u201cThat was\u00a0actually the\u00a0first question that Gary asked me.\u00a0We sat down for the first time together and he said, \u2018You live in\u00a0Maryland,\u00a0I live in Indiana.\u00a0How do you see something like this working?\u2019 \u2026 My answer to him was \u2013 and it still is my answer \u2013 I think you almost\u00a0have to\u00a0live a dual life. I\u2019ll never leave my family.\u00a0They are the most\u00a0important people\u00a0in the world to me obviously, and I would expect that to be the same for the person that I end up with because  family is so important to me, that would have to be a key part of their personality. You have to be willing to \u2026 travel and be with that person and maybe spend a couple of months or a couple of weeks at a time \u2026 and then maybe eventually, you figure out a destination that would work for you and your families or have another house where everybody gets together.\u201d She wants ABC to greenlight \u201cGolden Bachelor in Paradise\u201d \u201cOh, my gosh.\u00a0I\u00a0want to be on it!\u00a0Hopefully,\u00a0I\u2019ll have a husband and not (be) eligible. I would love it.\u00a0And I know the women that I was on the season with would be so much fun on \u2018Bachelor In Paradise.\u2019 I think if it does happen that Susan (Noles) should be the bartender. She should step in. She\u2019s Wells (Adams), right? That\u2019d be great. But I think she\u2019s going to want to be on it as a contestant. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to work. Maybe I\u2019ll be the Wells! I\u2019ve got to take a bartending lesson.\u201d She\u2019s hoping to find her life partner on \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette\u201d \u2013 but isn\u2019t rushing into marriage \u201cIf it ends up in engagement, I\u2019m open to that.\u00a0I do believe this process works.\u00a0I\u2019ve seen it work for so many couples on \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 so\u00a0I believe in the process. If\u00a0it ends up in engagement, that\u2019s great. If\u00a0it ends up in, you and I are\u00a0going to\u00a0get to know each other better in the outside world, that\u2019s perfect also.\u00a0I probably won\u2019t rush into a marriage right away \u2013\u00a0and not only because of what happened with Gerry and Theresa. I think it takes some time to really get to know somebody. Out\u00a0in the wild, in the real world, you need to spend some time there.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/entertainment/golden-bachelorette-joan-vassos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_entertainment_chris-pine-acne", "text": "Chris Pine had to have a thick skin coming up in Hollywood amid a struggle with acne early on in his career In a recent episode of the \u201cHappy Sad Confused\u201d podcast, Pine said that he had \u201cawful skin\u201d as a teenager and after college and took issue with the fact that acne can sometimes be regarded as something only teenagers go through. In his case, he said, it was \u201ctremendously debilitating and really seriously emotionally incapacitating.\u201d \u201cIt was one of the most traumatic points of my life but it is my story,\u201d he said. The discussion was prompted by the podcast\u2019s host Josh Horowitz asking Pine how he felt about comments that \u201cThe O.C.\u201d casting director Patrick Rush made last year in Alan Sepinwall\u2019s 2023 book \u201cWelcome to The O.C.: The Oral History.\u201d In it, Rush revealed that Pine read for the role of Ryan Atwood for the series, but that his \u201creally bad skin\u201d at the time, to Rush, was \u201cinsurmountable.\u201d The role of Atwood ultimately went to actor Ben McKenzie, who starred in the series during its run from 2003 to 2007. Pine candidly said that he felt like Rush \u201cdidn\u2019t have to talk about it\u201d in the book. \u201cI can understand that they wanted to have pretty people doing pretty things and bad acne is not a key,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m grateful for not having landed that\u2026 but I\u2019m alright.\u201d Pine, of course, is more than alright. He went on to have a successful career in Hollywood starring as Captain Kirk in the rebooted \u201cStar Trek\u201d franchise and appearing in critically-acclaimed films like \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling\u201d and \u201cHell or High Water.\u201d He said will never forget the struggle he went through to get to this point. \u201cI know how depressing it can be and the kind of depths of sorrow it can drag you to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a brighter day.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/entertainment/chris-pine-acne/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Her sharp quips about the former NFL quarterback gained her thousands of new followers on Instagram and a hilarious appearance on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show.\u201d Glaser, however, is taking it all in stride. She\u2019s been doing standup long enough to know the ups and downs of the entertainment industry. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like when are people gonna get it? I\u2019m not one of those people. I always feel like I kind of am getting what I deserve. I\u2019m not someone who\u2019s been waiting for this my whole life,\u201d Glaser told CNN in an interview this week. \u201cI mean, obviously this has been the goal to be beloved on this kind of scale, but it\u2019s also scary because when it comes on fast like this, you know, this kind of enthusiasm for someone lasts for a moment but can go away pretty quickly.\u201d Glaser said she knew Brady\u2019s \u201cGreatest Roast of All Time\u201d would land with viewers. \u201cI knew it was a home run and I knew that the event would be special because it was live,\u201d she said. \u201cI had hoped it would be number one on Netflix and that there would be viral moments, but I didn\u2019t think that I would be a big part of all that discussion.\u201d As the roast got closer, Glaser was ran her Brady jokes in up to four sets a night in Los Angeles, \u201cjumping from club to club.\u201d \u201cWorking with a team of writers, we would work during the day and then we would write in between shows and treat it like I was hosting an award show,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way I would do it if I got asked to host the Oscars, like it\u2019s that big of a deal. So, I took it really seriously.\u201d Glaser also took her preparations seriously for her new special, \u201cSomeday You\u2019ll Die.\u201d In it, she covers substantive topics like having kids, body image and death, but promises fans both old and new will find plenty of laughs, too. \u201cIt\u2019s just a look at my life right now as I\u2019m approaching 40 and all my friends are having kids and starting families, getting married. I don\u2019t really have any of that,\u201d she said. \u201c[The special explores] how I suffer with depression, despite the fact that my life is great, my fear of death, my longing for it at times, [with] really hard jokes in between.\u201d Glaser describes her new work as \u201chonest, raw, really tight comedy,\u201d two years in the making. \u201cSomeday You\u2019ll Die\u201d debuts May 11 on Max, which like CNN is part of Warner Bros.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_kevin-spacey-fights-for-career", "text": "Kevin Spacey is pushing back on the \u201crush to judgment\u201d against him and is being backed by some big names as he seeks to reclaim his acting career. Sharon Stone and Liam Neeson issued statements of support for Spacey in a story by The Telegraph. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see Kevin back at work,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe is a genius. He is so elegant and fun, generous to a fault and knows more about our craft than most of us ever will.\u201d Neeson said, \u201cKevin is a good man and a man of character.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s sensitive, articulate and non-judgmental, with a terrific sense of humour,\u201d Neeson added. \u201cHe is also one of our finest artists in the theatre and on camera. Personally speaking, our industry needs him and misses him greatly.\u201d In the interview with the publication, Spacey talked about the public fallout he experienced after fellow actor Anthony Rapp alleged in 2017 that Spacey had made a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was then 14 and Spacey was 26. As other allegations of abuse followed, Netflix cut ties with Spacey on the series \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and his scenes in the Ridley Scott film \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d were re-shot by the late Christopher Plummer. \u201cMy life was finished in four days,\u201d he told The Telegraph. The timing of the interview comes after the release of \u201cKevin Spacey Unmasked,\u201d a two-part docuseries that examines Spacey\u2019s career and subsequent fall over the allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The project was produced by the UK\u2019s Channel 4 and is streaming on Max and Investigation Discovery. (CNN, Max and Investigation Discovery share a parent company.) Spacey has denied the allegations he described in a statement on X as \u201canonymized and non-specific\u201d and criticized Channel 4 for giving him insufficient time to respond. \u201cI will not sit back and be attacked by a dying network\u2019s one-sided \u2018documentary\u2019 about me in their desperate attempt for ratings. There\u2019s a proper channel to handle allegations against me and it\u2019s not Channel 4,\u201d Spacey wrote. \u201cEach time I have been given the time and a proper forum to defend myself, the allegations have failed under scrutiny and I have been exonerated.\u201d CNN reached out to Channel 4 for comment and received the following statement via email: \u201cSpacey Unmasked is an important film exploring the balance of power and inappropriate behaviour in a work environment, aiming to give a voice to those who have previously been unable to speak out.\u201d Spacey was cleared of charges of sexual assault in a UK trial tied to allegations ranging from 2004 to 2013, when he served as artistic director at the Old Vic theater in London. In 2002, a New York jury found him not liable in a civil suit brought against him by Rapp. Spacey told The Telegraph there has been \u201cincredible progress\u201d made as a result of the #MeToo movement, but believes some who have been accused of wrongdoing are not given the \u201copportunity to actually have a fair shot at being able to prove that either something didn\u2019t happen or there are circumstances that make it questionable.\u201d Corporations, he said, \u201cput themselves in a situation where they now had to behave in the same way toward anyone who was accused of anything.\u201d \u201cIf the companies that I had an incredible partnership with had stood up and said, \u2018We hear you and we take allegations seriously and we\u2019re going to investigate this. And when we discover what the truth is, we\u2019re going to tell you how we\u2019re going to react.\u2019 But, instead, they publicly divorced themselves from me and said that they would never work with me again before a single question had been asked,\u201d Spacey said. \u201cCertainly, when Netflix did that, and we\u2019d had an enormous success together, people must have thought, \u2018Well, they must have the dirt on him.\u2019 So then everyone else decided to react punitively toward me. And all I ever wanted was for people to ask questions and investigate. And I am well aware that that did not happen.\u201d CNN has reached out to Netflix for comment. Spacey has won two Academy Awards, for his roles in 1995\u2019s \u201cThe Usual Suspects\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cAmerican Beauty.\u201d He has two upcoming projects in pre-production, according to IMDb.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/kevin-spacey-fights-for-career/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_04_25_entertainment_challengers-review-zendaya", "text": "In tennis, \u201clove\u201d means nothing. Love also has little to do with \u201cChallengers,\u201d which uses the sport as the backdrop to serve up an elaborate, non-linear psychological triangle that proves twisty and enticing for much of the match, before double faulting by whiffing on the ending. Seduction and sex are again at the heart of this film from \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d director Luca Guadagnino, who also throws in twists of fate, paths not taken and \u2013 in the case of the central character played by Zendaya \u2013 a burning desire to win and exercise control over those around her, exploring how that elite-athlete mentality bleeds into her personal life. The framing device is a singles match between Art (\u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d Mike Faist), a decorated superstar who might be nearing the end, at least in his mind, of his tournament-winning career; and Patrick (\u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Josh O\u2019Connor), who arrives at the off-the-beaten-track tournament where they end up facing off in a run-down car that, his finances being what they are, doubles as his hotel room. Flashing back 13 years, we discover that the two were bosom pals as junior tennis players when they first set their eyes \u2013 springing out of their heads almost cartoon-like \u2013 on Tashi (Zendaya), a rising star whose game provokes as much lust from them as her striking looks. Back in the present, Tashi is Art\u2019s wife and coach, having lost her own career to a devastating knee injury. Yet it\u2019s pretty obvious that she\u2019s living through him \u2013 he addresses the point overtly, saying, \u201cI\u2019m playing for both of us\u201d \u2013 which only makes how she wound up with him, as well as the outcome of Art and Patrick\u2019s (very) protracted match, more intriguing. While sexual tension plays a central role in the movie (and certainly the marketing of it), \u201cChallengers\u201d is as much about blurring the lines between sex and the seductive power of big-time sports, with winning and success as the ultimate aphrodisiac. Add to that the two boys/men being pretty transparent about what they want, Tashi remains a source of mystery, in part because of the unscheduled detour her career has been forced to take. After his fine young cannibals romance \u201cBones and All,\u201d Guadagnino, working from a script by playwright Justin Kuritzkes, occupies more conventional and commercial territory here, while doing all he can to sex up how he films the tennis sequences. Despite the zooming angles and whizzing balls, there\u2019s no escaping the sheer abundance of those scenes, especially for anyone who has never sat through an entire US Open or Wimbledon final. Even using the sport as a metaphor, \u201cChallengers\u201d might become a bit of a challenge for those who show up eager to see the principals sweat for different reasons. Because she\u2019s playing more complicated angles, Zendaya\u2019s Tashi is the most interesting character as well as a source of frustration. Then again, the details regarding all three of the key figures stay somewhat vague thanks in part to the structure, though all are prone to the occasional racket-mangling tantrum. While the build-up proves effective, the payoff simply feels too precious, in a way that\u2019s particularly unsatisfying. That misstep doesn\u2019t invalidate sitting through this otherwise neatly choreographed match, but in tennis terms, it\u2019s the kind of unforced error that prevents Guadagnino\u2019s latest film from ranking as an unqualified winner. \u201cChallengers\u201d premieres April 26 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/25/entertainment/challengers-review-zendaya/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_08_entertainment_dark-matter-review-joel-edgerton", "text": "\u201cDark Matter\u201d takes another plunge into the madness of multiverses, operating on a more cerebral and down-to-earth level than the superhero epics that have explored it, from the \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d sequel to \u201cThe Flash.\u201d After an intriguing start, though, this Apple TV+ series merely sheds additional light on the difficulties of this narrative conceit, in what becomes a rather tedious contemplation of choices and roads not taken. Adapted by author Blake Crouch (whose page-to-TV credits include \u201cWayward Pines\u201d) from his novel, the story centers on Jason Dessen (\u201cThe Boys in the Boat\u2019s\u201d Joel Edgerton, living out the actorly dream of playing multiple versions of the same character), a physicist/professor seemingly living an idyllic life with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and teenage son (Oakes Fegley, who in his even-younger days fought \u201cThe War With Grandpa\u201d). Suddenly, Jason is not only abducted but replaced by a version of himself, having conjured a box that allows him to navigate between multiverses and an infinite assortment of possibilities, altered \u2013 sometimes dramatically, others almost imperceptibly \u2013 by individual choices and pivotal moments. Why this has happened \u2013 and what Jason can do to reclaim his life \u2013 presents what is at first an intriguing mystery, as well as a rumination on how one decision here or there can change our personal trajectory and relationships, coupled with broader questions of what the future might collectively hold. Once all that is established, though, \u201cDark Matter\u201d becomes less provocative over the course of its nine episodes, while embarking on a perhaps unavoidable series of tangents and detours that don\u2019t accomplish much more than killing time as Jason tries to work his way back home. The main problem, which nags at this entire subgenre of science fiction, is the sense that nothing really matters, since every new door/chapter \u2013 with doors that literally lead into alternate universes \u2013 feels as if it\u2019s just a step away from being rewritten or undone. As those scenarios and \u201cwhat ifs\u201d pile up, Jason\u2019s plight becomes as disorienting for the viewer as it is for him. \u201cDark Matter\u201d also has an overtly sentimental side in its rumination on what\u2019s important in life, which skews the story more toward Jason\u2019s particular journey than the jaw-dropping implications of what this portal to parallel worlds means (or could mean) for humanity. Apple has gambled on several ambitious science fiction projects of varying scope and scale, yielding mixed results, including \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d \u201cInvasion,\u201d \u201cConstellation,\u201d \u201cFoundation,\u201d \u201cSeverance\u201d (the true standout on this list) and \u201cSilo.\u201d \u201cDark Matter\u201d falls somewhere in the middle of that pack, which is to say, you ultimately won\u2019t miss all that much if you leave this door closed. \u201cDark Matter\u201d premieres May 8 on Apple TV+.

{"id": "2024_05_10_entertainment_interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review", "text": "After a dazzling first season, \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d moves in a lower-key mode through its second, a perhaps inevitable byproduct of Lestat\u2019s diminished role. Yet this AMC adaptation of Anne Rice\u2019s books remains a tasty trip through history and geography, having changed venues from New Orleans to Europe and the \u201cOld World Vampires\u201d on the prowl there. Although the logistics of an ageless vampire child weren\u2019t cited as the cause, the new season brings one major change, with Delainey Hayles sliding seamlessly into the role of Claudia (replacing Bailey Bass). Trapped forever in her youthful form, she accompanies Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) on his travels, and often drives the narrative with her desire for community. As for Lestat (Sam Reid), the conclusion of Season 1 largely confines his appearances to what\u2019s going on in Louis\u2019 head and flashbacks, though the nature of the show makes that a more effortless process than most. Indeed, despite the challenging task of turning Rice\u2019s books into an open-ended series, the framing device \u2013 as Louis and Armand (Assad Zaman) walk their human interviewer, Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian), through their bloody past \u2013 provides an opportunity to take off in all sorts of interesting directions and digressions. There\u2019s also some new blood (heh heh), as Claudia falls in with the Theatre des Vampires, whose leading man Santiago (Ben Daniels) brings an additional sense of menace as well as theatricality to the proceedings. A separate strand also beefs up Molloy\u2019s thread and backstory, including details about his earlier life that inform the perilous line he\u2019s walking in becoming Louis\u2019 skeptical biographer, with good reason to question what details his immortal subjects might be conspicuously omitting. Through the six episodes previewed, the story proceeds at a languid, almost dream-like pace, and while there\u2019s perhaps a little too much vampire theater, its contours remain engrossing in ways the 1994 movie wasn\u2019t, despite the starry pairing of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Thirty years have passed since then, but the series has still managed the difficult feat of putting its own distinctive stamp on the source material and justifying the vote of confidence AMC gave it by ordering a second season ahead of the first\u2019s debut. While vampires might have seemed like a no-brainer next step after AMC\u2019s long reliance on zombies, this version of \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d has found the right resting place, and the creative team has sunk its teeth into a concept that, against the odds, appears to be aging remarkably well. \u201cAnne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u201d begins its second season May 12 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC and AMC+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The doc will look into the band\u2019s pre-tour preparation process, follow them throughout their travels as they perform in front of tens of thousands of concertgoers and feature \u201cfly-on-the-wall footage of band rehearsals and special moments backstage,\u201d the release read. Viewers will also hear from Springsteen himself and see him develop \u201cthe story he wants to tell with this tour\u2019s setlist \u2013 interspersed with rare archival clips of The E Street Band, underscoring themes of life, loss, mortality and community.\u201d The film was directed by Springsteen\u2019s longtime collaborator, award-winning director Thom Zimny, who previously worked with the \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d singer on his \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d show. Springsteen and the E Street Band kicked off their most recent tour in February of 2023. In September, the 74-year-old rock legend announced he had to reschedule over 20 shows as he recovered from \u201cpeptic ulcer disease.\u201d The band is currently performing the international leg of their tour, which is slated to conclude in November. One of the most celebrated rock musicians in the modern era, Springsteen is known for hits like \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.,\u201d \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d and \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d among many others. \u201cRoad Diary\u201d will debut in October, with an exact air date yet to be announced.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/entertainment/bruce-springsteen-documentary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish", "text": "Billie Eilish has always done things her own way. Whether it be releasing her 2016 viral hit \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d onto Soundcloud, a DIY music streaming site, or writing and recording her record-breaking debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u201d with her collaborator and brother Finneas O\u2019Connell in her childhood bedroom, Eilish, 22, has never been shy about straying from industry norms \u2013 and it seems to be working well for the two-time Oscar-winner. With her third studio album \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d which drops on Friday, she\u2019s remained consistent. The sound of the album is sure to be a surprise to all, because Eilish intentionally chose to not release a single prior to launching the album \u2013 again, a rather unorthodox move. \u201cI wanna give it to you all at once,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram page last month when announcing the album. Her 2019 debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,\u201d along with 2021\u2019s \u201cHappier Than Ever\u201d and the new record, were all co-written and produced by O\u2019Connell. It follows Eilish and O\u2019Connell\u2019s Oscar win in March for their original song for the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie,\u00a0\u201cWhat Was I Made For,\u201d which was one of 2023\u2019s biggest hits. The duo previously won the Oscar for original song in 2022 for \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d However \u201cHard and Soft\u201d sounds, which we shall soon find out, Eilish hinted in an interview with Rolling Stone last month that she found herself harkening back to her roots with this record, bringing to mind a time in Eilish\u2019s musical journey where she first set her own precedent for being in control. \u201cI feel like this album is me,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a character. It feels like the \u2018When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u2019 version of me. It feels like my youth and who I was as a kid.\u201d Her penchant for bucking the norm is continuing into her plans for her upcoming \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d tour, which kicks off in Baltimore this fall. Eilish is choosing to skirt scalpers by restricting ticket transfers for those purchasing tickets to her shows. \u201cThe tour wants to give fans, not scalpers, the best chance to buy tickets at face value. To make this possible, they have chosen to use Ticketmaster\u2019s Face Value Exchange,\u201d Ticketmaster\u2019s Eilish ticket page reads. It further notes that if fans can\u2019t attend shows in the US or Canada that they\u2019ve purchased tickets for, they have the option to resell them at face value. The move comes nearly two years after the fervor surrounding the purchase of tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour crashed the Ticketmaster site, resulting in fans not having access to tickets, scalpers trying to resell the tickets at ungodly prices and a subsequent congressional hearing. Eilish was clearly paying attention and appears to be one of the only major mainstream artists to adapt, in hopes of preventing scalpers being able to hawk tickets at exorbitant resale fees. And with \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d Eilish is also trying to stand out and apart in the industry with her effort to protect something else she\u2019s historically passionate about: the environment. The \u201cBad Guy\u201d singer made waves when she lamented in a March interview with Billboard about the \u201cwasteful\u201d practice of releasing a multitude of album variants which, in turn, \u201cgets them more money.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so wasteful, and it\u2019s irritating to me that we\u2019re still at a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much about making money \u2013 and it\u2019s all your favorite artists doing that s\u2014,\u201d she said at the time. To back up her complaint, Eilish posted a manifesto on her website describing her sustainability plan for the release of \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d after announcing the album. She wrote that she will only release eight vinyl variants \u201ceach on the same day, containing the same track-listing across the board\u201d \u2013 to remove the incentive for die-hard fans who would purchase all the variants for any differing bonus tracks \u2013 \u201cand all produced with the most sustainable practices available.\u201d Environmental sustainability has remained at the forefront for Eilish to the current moment, as on her Instagram stories on Wednesday, she included sustainable transport plans to her New York album listening event. Perhaps emboldened by the two Oscars or nine Grammys that she\u2019s won, or the fact that her first two albums have hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the young entertainer has a proven track record of success doing things her way. And why should she change now, if it\u2019s working?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

During the show, which was hosted by comedian Kevin Hart and livestreamed on Netflix on May 5, Brady was roasted about his divorce from Brazilian supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, his appearance, his two retirements,\u00a0\u201cDeflategate\u201d\u00a0and his\u00a0FTX investment, among many other sore topics. Speaking on an episode of \u201cThe Pivot Podcast\u201d with Fred Taylor, Ryan Clark and Channing Crowder, released Tuesday, Brady said the jokes about his divorce had not gone down well with his family. \u201cI loved when the jokes were about me. I thought they were so fun,\u2019 he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way that it affected my kids.\u201d Brady and B\u00fcndchen\u2019s divorce provided a lot of roast-fodder throughout the night, with Brady frequently shown sipping his drink when it was mentioned. The former couple, who have two children together \u2013 Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11 \u2013 jointly\u00a0announced\u00a0in October 2022 they were parting ways. Brady said he had a moment of realization that the roast hadn\u2019t turned out the way he thought it would. \u201cIt was the bittersweet aspect of when you\u2019re doing something you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize I wouldn\u2019t do that again because of the way it affected actually the people I care about the most in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you\u2019re na\u00efve,\u201d added Brady. \u201cIt\u2019s a good lesson for me as a parent, I\u2019m gonna be a better parent as I go forward because of it.\u201d Brady had a remarkable 23-year career as the NFL\u2019s leading quarterback, winning seven Super Bowl rings \u2013 six with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He is also a five-time Super Bowl MVP and won three NFL MVP awards. He first announced his retirement in February 2022. He ended up reversing his decision and returned to the field for one more season with the Bucs before officially retiring last year. At the end of the roast, Brady finally had the chance to defend himself, saying people had asked him why he agreed to do the event. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI can take all the hits. I would have done this earlier but I\u2019ve been too busy winning championships.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/entertainment/tom-brady-roast-regrets-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
