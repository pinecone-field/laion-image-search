It starred Steve Carell, John Krasinksi, Jenna Fischer, Mindy Kaling, Rainn Wilson and BJ Novak, among many others. Many cast members became household names following the widespread and early success of the series, which won five Emmys throughout its run. Like its predecessor starring Gervais, the series followed a mockumentary-style format with cast members breaking the fourth wall as a crew followed staffers around an office, capturing tedious day-to-day tasks, office romances and at-times outlandish behavior. It is not yet known if any previous cast members will make cameos in the Peacock series, which is set to begin production in July.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/entertainment/the-office-newspaper-peacock/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_entertainment_dark-matter-review-joel-edgerton", "text": "\u201cDark Matter\u201d takes another plunge into the madness of multiverses, operating on a more cerebral and down-to-earth level than the superhero epics that have explored it, from the \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d sequel to \u201cThe Flash.\u201d After an intriguing start, though, this Apple TV+ series merely sheds additional light on the difficulties of this narrative conceit, in what becomes a rather tedious contemplation of choices and roads not taken. Adapted by author Blake Crouch (whose page-to-TV credits include \u201cWayward Pines\u201d) from his novel, the story centers on Jason Dessen (\u201cThe Boys in the Boat\u2019s\u201d Joel Edgerton, living out the actorly dream of playing multiple versions of the same character), a physicist/professor seemingly living an idyllic life with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and teenage son (Oakes Fegley, who in his even-younger days fought \u201cThe War With Grandpa\u201d). Suddenly, Jason is not only abducted but replaced by a version of himself, having conjured a box that allows him to navigate between multiverses and an infinite assortment of possibilities, altered \u2013 sometimes dramatically, others almost imperceptibly \u2013 by individual choices and pivotal moments. Why this has happened \u2013 and what Jason can do to reclaim his life \u2013 presents what is at first an intriguing mystery, as well as a rumination on how one decision here or there can change our personal trajectory and relationships, coupled with broader questions of what the future might collectively hold. Once all that is established, though, \u201cDark Matter\u201d becomes less provocative over the course of its nine episodes, while embarking on a perhaps unavoidable series of tangents and detours that don\u2019t accomplish much more than killing time as Jason tries to work his way back home. The main problem, which nags at this entire subgenre of science fiction, is the sense that nothing really matters, since every new door/chapter \u2013 with doors that literally lead into alternate universes \u2013 feels as if it\u2019s just a step away from being rewritten or undone. As those scenarios and \u201cwhat ifs\u201d pile up, Jason\u2019s plight becomes as disorienting for the viewer as it is for him. \u201cDark Matter\u201d also has an overtly sentimental side in its rumination on what\u2019s important in life, which skews the story more toward Jason\u2019s particular journey than the jaw-dropping implications of what this portal to parallel worlds means (or could mean) for humanity. Apple has gambled on several ambitious science fiction projects of varying scope and scale, yielding mixed results, including \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d \u201cInvasion,\u201d \u201cConstellation,\u201d \u201cFoundation,\u201d \u201cSeverance\u201d (the true standout on this list) and \u201cSilo.\u201d \u201cDark Matter\u201d falls somewhere in the middle of that pack, which is to say, you ultimately won\u2019t miss all that much if you leave this door closed. \u201cDark Matter\u201d premieres May 8 on Apple TV+.

The images of the US turned into a war-torn country provides a sobering dystopian backdrop for an action movie that works on that level, without lingering in the mind as long as it could or should have. Indeed, Garland might be known for cerebral sci-fi films like \u201cEx Machina\u201d and \u201cAnnihilation,\u201d but \u201cCivil War\u201d goes in a different direction, fueled by a sense of danger around every bend in the road. A quartet of journalists brave the trip \u2013 in a vehicle labeled \u201cPRESS\u201d in big letters \u2013 heading from New York to Washington, D.C., where the White House and a president (Nick Offerman, briefly) who has bombed his own citizens is under siege by something known as the Western Forces. The journalists include two world-weary types, the widely traveled combat photographer Lee (Kirsten Dunst) and reporter Joel (Wagner Moura, of \u201cNarcos\u201d renown), as well as a newbie photojournalist (\u201cPriscilla\u2019s\u201d Cailee Spaeny) and a grizzled veteran (Stephen McKinley Henderson) who tag along, much to Lee\u2019s chagrin. Released at a time when social media-amplified political voices in America have seldom sounded angrier or louder, the mere title and subject matter peg Garland\u2019s film as an especially provocative and unsettling concept. The plot, however, forgoes any of the backstory that might deepen those aspects in favor of an episodic trip across a landscape defined by stark visual flourishes, from barren stretches of highway to sections filled with abandoned cars and dead bodies. While the film establishes a budding if grudging mentor relationship between the two photographers, \u201cCivil War\u201d thus boils down primarily to its unnerving atmosphere and individual moments, fueled by the striking sound design and music. Of those encounters, none prove more harrowing than one involving random soldiers, one of whom is played by Dunst\u2019s real-life husband, Jesse Plemons, who asks the reporters, pointedly, \u201cwhat kind of American\u201d they are. In some respects, \u201cCivil War\u201d feels like a missed opportunity for what it leaves unaddressed, content to let the jarring notion of a war movie on American soil \u2013 like watching \u201cPlatoon\u201d or \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d \u2013 speak for itself. To the extent the audience is left grappling with unspoken questions, \u201cCivil War\u201d represents something of a departure from the nature of Garland\u2019s previous films. Because while this alternate future derives considerable impact from planting roots in reality, what the director has delivered is less about political commentary or issuing some kind of warning but rather, fundamentally, a horror movie. \u201cCivil War\u201d premieres April 12 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/11/entertainment/civil-war-movie-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_10_entertainment_interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review", "text": "After a dazzling first season, \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d moves in a lower-key mode through its second, a perhaps inevitable byproduct of Lestat\u2019s diminished role. Yet this AMC adaptation of Anne Rice\u2019s books remains a tasty trip through history and geography, having changed venues from New Orleans to Europe and the \u201cOld World Vampires\u201d on the prowl there. Although the logistics of an ageless vampire child weren\u2019t cited as the cause, the new season brings one major change, with Delainey Hayles sliding seamlessly into the role of Claudia (replacing Bailey Bass). Trapped forever in her youthful form, she accompanies Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) on his travels, and often drives the narrative with her desire for community. As for Lestat (Sam Reid), the conclusion of Season 1 largely confines his appearances to what\u2019s going on in Louis\u2019 head and flashbacks, though the nature of the show makes that a more effortless process than most. Indeed, despite the challenging task of turning Rice\u2019s books into an open-ended series, the framing device \u2013 as Louis and Armand (Assad Zaman) walk their human interviewer, Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian), through their bloody past \u2013 provides an opportunity to take off in all sorts of interesting directions and digressions. There\u2019s also some new blood (heh heh), as Claudia falls in with the Theatre des Vampires, whose leading man Santiago (Ben Daniels) brings an additional sense of menace as well as theatricality to the proceedings. A separate strand also beefs up Molloy\u2019s thread and backstory, including details about his earlier life that inform the perilous line he\u2019s walking in becoming Louis\u2019 skeptical biographer, with good reason to question what details his immortal subjects might be conspicuously omitting. Through the six episodes previewed, the story proceeds at a languid, almost dream-like pace, and while there\u2019s perhaps a little too much vampire theater, its contours remain engrossing in ways the 1994 movie wasn\u2019t, despite the starry pairing of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Thirty years have passed since then, but the series has still managed the difficult feat of putting its own distinctive stamp on the source material and justifying the vote of confidence AMC gave it by ordering a second season ahead of the first\u2019s debut. While vampires might have seemed like a no-brainer next step after AMC\u2019s long reliance on zombies, this version of \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d has found the right resting place, and the creative team has sunk its teeth into a concept that, against the odds, appears to be aging remarkably well. \u201cAnne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u201d begins its second season May 12 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC and AMC+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_entertainment_jerry-seinfeld-tv-comedy-analysis", "text": "\u201cSeinfeld\u201d premiered 35 years ago on NBC, becoming one of the most popular sitcoms ever and making Jerry Seinfeld and creator Larry David insanely rich. In promoting his directing debut \u201cUnfrosted,\u201d Seinfeld has lamented the current state of TV comedy, in a way that identifies some modern challenges while ignoring the complexity of how times have changed. Seinfeld voiced those remarks to the New Yorker while making the rounds (he joked about the extent of that promotional tour on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d) to support the movie, which looks back at the creation of the Pop-Tart in the 1960s. Yet the comic\u2019s views of where comedy went wrong have an unavoidable \u201cOld man yells at cloud\u201d quality, not because the observations were entirely wrong but because of everything they overlook in oversimplifying and romanticizing the past. \u201cIt used to be you would go home at the end of the day, most people would go, \u2018Oh, \u2018Cheers\u2019 is on. Oh, \u2018M*A*S*H\u2019 is on. Oh, \u2018Mary Tyler Moore\u2019 is on. \u2018All in the Family\u2019 is on,\u2019\u201d Seinfeld told The New Yorker. \u201cYou just expected, there\u2019ll be some funny stuff we can watch on TV tonight. Well, guess what \u2013 where is it? This is the result of the extreme left and P.C. crap, and people worrying so much about offending other people. Now they\u2019re going to see standup comics because we are not policed by anyone.\u201d That\u2019s a lot to unpack, starting with singling out four of the best sitcoms ever, conveniently skipping all the lame ones that existed during those years.\u00a0 Similarly, people looking for something to watch when those shows premiered only received three broadcast networks and a handful of channels, before Fox, cable and premium TV, much less Netflix, streaming and a host of internationally produced imports. Yes, greater sensitivity among various constituencies \u2013 or \u201cPC crap,\u201d if Seinfeld prefers \u2013 has complicated the comedian\u2019s job. But one aspect of the past Seinfeld appears to long for is that people could be offended with little fear of consequences or reprisals because, well, where were they going to go? When the menu consisted of ABC, NBC and CBS, it\u2019s not like they had a lot of choices or alternatives. The mass-appeal comedies that Seinfeld cites were indeed great shows, but they have given way to a wider variety of series aimed at narrower tastes, scattered across a vast array of outlets. The result has been fewer traditional multi-camera sitcoms but more single-camera shows, including the broadcast hits \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d \u201cGhosts\u201d and \u201cYoung Sheldon,\u201d the last of which (spun off from \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d) will wrap its seven-season run this month. That doesn\u2019t even begin to scratch the surface of cable and streaming comedies, animated shows, international series that now reach US shores, and acclaimed series labeled \u201ccomedy\u201d that aren\u2019t really comedies at all, like \u201cThe Bear\u201d and \u201cBarry.\u201d Even taking Seinfeld\u2019s argument at face value, \u201cAll in the Family\u201d is the only one of the shows he mentioned that might have regularly run afoul of the comedy scolds to which he objects. As for standup comics, there has been an explosion of opportunities to get their material in front of the public he couldn\u2019t have imagined when he was breaking in sets on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d including the barrage of specials spilling out as part of the \u201cNetflix is a Joke\u201d festival. Granted, there\u2019s a long tradition of talent bemoaning how bad things have gotten since their heyday. Having recently turned 70, Seinfeld and the rest of the baby-boom generation have seen TV change in unrecognizable ways from the period during which he cut his professional teeth. While it might not be \u201cAll in the Family\u201d or \u201cMary Tyler Moore,\u201d there\u2019s still funny stuff to watch for a broader range of tastes, including those with the fortitude to sit through \u201cUnfrosted.\u201d All that\u2019s required is knowing where to look, and maybe, opening your eyes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/entertainment/jerry-seinfeld-tv-comedy-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_01_entertainment_the-contestant-hulu-documentary-nasubi", "text": "Before \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d hit theaters or \u201cBig Brother\u201d turned George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d concept into a TV show, there was Nasubi, the unlikely (and unwitting) centerpiece of a cruel Japanese game show called \u201cDenpa Shonen.\u201d That strange story, and the road map it provided for the current age of social media and reality TV, gets recounted in \u201cThe Contestant,\u201d a stunning documentary premiering on Hulu. The story at its core practically defies description or belief. In 1998, Tomoaki Hamatsu, an aspiring comedian nicknamed Nasubi, was taken directly from an audition to a small room, where he was told to strip naked and fill out contest coupons trying to win prizes, advised that he must stay there until he earned 1 million yen. Filmed all the time without any sort of contract, Nasubi remained an object of amusement and fascination for more than a year, featured in a segment of the show subtitled \u201cA Life in Prizes,\u201d almost entirely deprived of contact with the outside world and subsisting on whatever food he could win. As the footage makes clear, Nasubi \u2013 naked, isolated and unaware of how he was perceived beyond that room \u2013 at times appeared to be struggling emotionally. Yet the studio audience is shown laughing at his plight, while the producers used an animated eggplant to cover his genitalia on the show. \u201cI wanted to create something never seen before,\u201d the producer, Toshio Tsuchiya, explains in \u201cThe Contestant,\u201d exhibiting no remorse regarding what transpired. In those interviews, he notes that his impulse was always to push the boundaries in terms of \u201cwhere to draw the line,\u201d matter-of-factly saying that if a contestant were to commit suicide, he would know he had gone too far. For his part, Nasubi speaks of how \u201cbroken\u201d he felt and the producers\u2019 indifference to the psychological and potentially physical toll the experience would exact upon him. \u201cI realized how cruel people could be,\u201d he says, citing the difference between \u201cmaking people laugh and being laughed at.\u201d The parallels to \u201cThe Truman Show,\u201d the 1998 movie starring Jim Carrey as the unwitting star of a \u201cshow\u201d built around his manufactured life, are striking. Nearly a quarter-century after the modern era of reality TV began when \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cBig Brother\u201d became instant sensations on CBS, it\u2019s hard not to see flashing warning signs in \u201cThe Contestant\u201d that have not only gone ignored but flourished (and really, festered) during the intervening years. Writer-director Claire TItley, who spent years working on the project, sees various aspects of the story that have become especially relevant, including the way people live their lives publicly on social media. As for the issues relating to reality TV, she told CNN, \u201cI wonder whether we\u2019ve learned any lessons at all. It feels like people are still pushing the boundaries, not necessarily in an ethically and morally good way.\u201d Titley also pointed to the complicity of the audience, which turned \u201cDenpa Shonen\u201d into a major hit and has continued to flock to titillating reality-TV programming, sometimes with serious consequences for the participants, across the globe. Indeed, while it\u2019s easy to see Tsuchiya as the documentary\u2019s villain, the events detailed in \u201cThe Contestant\u201d couldn\u2019t have happened without there being a fertile market for them. As Juliet Hindell, a BBC Tokyo correspondent at the time, recalls of covering \u201cA Life in Prizes,\u201d such shows had little difficulty attracting contestants, with the lure that unknown people \u201ccould become celebrities practically overnight.\u201d That dynamic persists today. The price individuals have paid for that, and  the callousness baked into it, are among the things \u201cThe Contestant\u201d leaves as questions to contemplate. Although Tsuchiya might have succeeded in creating something we hadn\u2019t quite seen before, we\u2019ve been exposed to many different versions of it in the years since, as people have pursued their 15 minutes (or in Nasubi\u2019s case, 15 months) of fame. \u201cThe Contestant\u201d premieres May 2 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/01/entertainment/the-contestant-hulu-documentary-nasubi/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Lamar proclaims himself both \u201cKing of New York\u201d and \u201cKing of the Coast.\u201d Drake told Billboard of the verse, \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anything to say about it.\u201d \u201cIt just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That\u2019s all it was,\u201d Drake said at the time. \u201cI know good and well that Kendrick\u2019s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.\u201d An \u2018Infinity War\u2019 of rappers The pair have continued to take shots at each other on tracks over the years, but this latest skirmish appears to have begun in October 2023, when rapper J. Cole collaborated with Drake on the song, \u201cFirst Person Shooter.\u201d On the track, Cole refers to himself, Lamar and Drake as the \u201cBig three\u201d in rap. Drake likened his own popularity in the game to the stardom of the late singer Michael Jackson. Lamar seemingly took exception to the comparisons and hit back on a collaborative track with Future and Metro Boomin that caught fire in March 2024, titled \u201cLike That.\u201d Lamar makes clear on the song that there is no \u201cBig three\u201d just \u201cBig me.\u201d He casts himself as Prince to Drake\u2019s Jackson, noting that the former outlived the latter. \u201cLike That\u201d is a cut on the album \u201cWe Don\u2019t Trust You,\u201d which many believe is filled with disses aimed at Drake. The apparent jabs surprised some listeners as Drake and Future have been longtime collaborators. Things got even more heated when Future and Metro Boomin released the followup \u201cWe Still Don\u2019t Trust You,\u201d which Billboard magazine declared is \u201cfilled with Drake disses, not only from Future, but from The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky as well.\u201d With so many coming after the Canadian rapper lyrically, it started feeling like Marvel Infinity War of hip-hop superheroes battling it out. The man who helped kick it all off, J. Cole, quickly exited the battle. Cole released \u201c7 Minute Drill\u201d on a surprise project \u201cMight Delete Later\u201d in which he came after Lamar, only to later declare the song lame. He removed it from streaming services, publicly apologized and has gone quiet since. Drake pushes back Last month, Drake dropped the diss track \u201cPush Ups\u201d in which he poked fun at Lamar\u2019s shoe size to his past collaborations with pop stars. \u201cMaroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\u201d Drake raps, appearing to mock Lamar\u2019s work with Maroon 5 on their song \u201cDon\u2019t Wanna Know\u201d and with Swift on her song \u201cBad Blood.\u201d Drake also took a swipe at Rick Ross, who was featured on \u201cWe Don\u2019t Trust You.\u201d Ross then began a social media war of words with Drake, which included accusing Drake of having undergone plastic surgery. K.Dot\u2019s onslaught Lamar, known also as K.Dot, responded with multiple volleys. First there was \u201cEuphoria,\u201d which is now as famous for the insults lobbed at Drake as it is for making the general public aware that the rapper was also an executive producer on the hit HBO drama. (HBO is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company.) Within days, Lamar followed that with \u201c6:16 in LA,\u201d which many interpreted to be making fun of Drake\u2019s penchant for titling songs with times and locations. Drake gets personal with \u201cFamily Matters\u201d Things got increasingly personally in this rap battle on Saturday, when Drake dropped the eight-minute diss track, \u201cFamily Matters.\u201d He makes allegations about abuse and infidelity involving Lamar and his fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Alford, on the song. Don\u2019t mess with a Pulitzer Prize winner Lest we forget that Lamar made history in 2018 by becoming the first rapper to win a prestigious Pulitzer Prize for his album \u201cDAMN,\u201d he didn\u2019t even let an hour go by after the release of \u201cFamily Matters\u201d to drop a response, titled \u201cMeet The Grahams.\u201d (Drake\u2019s legal name is Aubrey Graham.) The song gets heavy as Lamar addresses Drake\u2019s parents and Drake\u2019s parenting, accusing him of have a secret daughter. Lamar followed that within hours with another song, titled \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d in which accuses Drake of being attracted to underage girls. Drake responds Drake again had his say on Sunday with \u201cThe Heart Part 6.\u201d On this song, Drake claims he\u2019s the one who fed Lamar fake information about a secret child. \u201cWe plotted for a week and then we fed you the information/A daughter that\u2019s 11 years old, I bet he takes it,\u201d Drake raps.

{"id": "2024_05_10_entertainment_beach-boys-brian-wilson-conservatorship-judge-rules-intl-scli", "text": "Brian Wilson, musician and founding member of the hit \u201960s rock band The Beach Boys, has been placed under a conservatorship following a Los Angeles court ruling on Thursday. Judge Gus T. May of the Los Angeles Superior Court found \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that a conservatorship is necessary, court documents said, noting that Wilson consents to the conservatorship. According to the court documents, Wilson is \u201cunable to care for his person,\u201d has a \u201cMajor Neurocognitive Disorder\u201d and \u201clacks capacity to give informed medical consent for medications.\u201d Wilson\u2019s conservators are ordered to consult with his children regarding all material related healthcare decisions, the court documents said. According to the Wilson family, the decision to place Brian under a conservatorship came following the death of his wife, Melinda Wilson, in January. At the time, Wilson called his wife his \u201canchor,\u201d saying in a post on his website that \u201cMelinda was more than my wife.\u00a0She was my savior. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career.\u00a0She encouraged me to make the music that was closest to my heart.\u201d In a statement published in February, the Wilson family said that after \u201ccareful consideration and consultation\u201d among Brian, his children, his housekeeper and his doctors, \u201clongtime Wilson family representatives LeeAnn Hard and Jean Sievers will serve as Brian\u2019s co-conservators of the person\u201d following Melinda\u2019s passing. This decision was made, the statement said, to \u201censure that there will be no extreme changes to the household,\u201d as well as making sure that \u201cBrian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for by (housekeeper) Gloria Ramos and the wonderful team at the house who have been in place for many years helping take care of the family.\u201d \u201cBrian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses,\u201d the family\u2019s statement concluded. Wilson has had a tumultuous relationship with the spotlight, having suffered from fame-induced stress, depression, and drug addiction in the past. He decided to quit touring with his band after a nervous breakdown in 1964, though he continued to write, arrange, produce and record The Beach Boys\u2019 music. Wilson and The Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001. Wilson has also won two Grammy Awards as a solo artist, for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2005 and Best Historical Album in 2013.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/beach-boys-brian-wilson-conservatorship-judge-rules-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_entertainment_star-wars-phantom-menace-turns-25", "text": "The teeth-gnashing aspects of \u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d have been chewed upon for a quarter century, from Watto to Anakin Skywalker\u2019s Midi-chlorian count (and miracle birth) to almost everyone\u2019s favorite punching bag, Jar Jar Binks. Yet as the movie that kicked off George Lucas\u2019 prequel trilogy hits theaters to commemorate its 25th anniversary for the de facto \u201cStar Wars\u201d holiday May the Fourth, let\u2019s accentuate the positive by identifying a half-dozen things the film, and the franchise\u2019s patriarch, got decidedly right. Each of these elements have echoed through \u201cStar Wars\u201d lore, and in most instances been put to better use elsewhere (in sequels, the various animated series overseen by Dave Filoni and the recent live-action ones, like \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\u201d) than they were in the original film. Think of them as creative building blocks, which overcame clunkier parts of the script and awkward performances to influence the rest of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d timeline. They\u2019re presented here in ascending order of significance: 6. The Emperor\u2019s long game. The idea that Palpatine/Darth Sidious (played by Ian McDiarmid) would spend years undermining the Republic from the inside got a bit wonky, but it created a fertile backdrop for how the Sith could outmaneuver the Jedi. 5. The digital effects. Admittedly, this was a bit of a mixed bag, since Lucas\u2019 emphasis on the visual components seemed to come at the expense of paying attention to the acting and performances, and in ways to overwhelm them. Yet he credibly moved the bar forward in terms of digital effects and design, which paid off in the scale of the action sequences. 4. Mace Windu. Samuel L. Jackson didn\u2019t have much to do in this first movie, but the Jedi master became a vital part of the mythology and had opportunities to demonstrate his power later (perhaps foremost in the animated \u201cThe Clone Wars\u201d), while padding the actor\u2019s formidable resume when it comes to appearing in blockbuster franchises. 3. Darth Maul. As played by Ray Park, the mostly silent Sith apprentice represents one of the most visually striking characters introduced over the course of the entire series \u2013 including that way-cool double-sided lightsaber \u2013 so much so that Filoni went to great lengths to revive him after what certainly appeared to be a glass-half-empty exit at the end of \u201cPhantom Menace.\u201d 2. Casting Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. Although Lucas tilted the plot toward Darth Vader\u2019s origin story, finding the young Obi-Wan Kenobi was a major challenge, and McGregor gave the first trilogy dramatic ballast even in its weaker moments, as did Neeson as his master. Those qualities were underscored by their brief reunion in the recent Disney+ series. 1. The lightsaber duels. In the original trilogy, lightsaber duels were essentially just basic sword fights, with a few acrobatic maneuvers and uses of telekinesis. The battle between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan \u2013 set to composer John Williams\u2019 evocative \u201cDuel of the Fates,\u201d one of his finest musical contributions in a long line of them \u2013 lifted that to dazzling heights, not only in the use of \u201cForce\u201d abilities as an organic form of fighting but through the choreography and physicality. (Give much credit for the latter to Park, who put his experience as a martial artist and stunt double to excellent use.) Every lightsaber fight since then \u2013 including the memorable image of Yoda energetically leaping around in \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d and \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d \u2013 has built upon the framework that sequence established. It\u2019s also likely a key reason why \u201cStar Wars\u201d has continued to flourish as parents pass it on to their kids. Not everything in \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d aged well, but that climactic duel is one of those scenes that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. \u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d will play in select theaters beginning May 3.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/entertainment/star-wars-phantom-menace-turns-25/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_entertainment_eurovision-baby-lasagne-nemo-abba-preview-intl", "text": "Fifty years ago, two Swedish married couples went on the most consequential double date in music history, changing pop for good at the Eurovision Song Contest. True, the bar wasn\u2019t too high. 1974 was also the year that Paul Anka topped charts with \u201c(You\u2019re) Having My Baby,\u201d a track that won a 2006 CNN survey of the worst songs of all time.  But Abba \u2013 then still available in human form \u2013 have remained Eurovision\u2019s de facto godparents as the event grew into the merriest, most colorful musical competition in the world. Now, 50 years on from their \u201cWaterloo\u201d breakout, the contest is back in Sweden, its spiritual home, after Loreen won the country\u2019s seventh crown last May \u2013 becoming the first woman to win the competition twice. All these storylines coming together must be fate; incontrovertible proof that God is a Eurovision fan. You couldn\u2019t have written it any better, right Loreen? \u201cPeople are like \u2018OK, Sweden is the spiritual home of Eurovision\u2019 \u2013 I see Eurovision as this moving entity,\u201d she tells CNN. \u201cWho cares about the place?\u201d OK, well, that\u2019s not quite the narrative we were going for. But Loreen \u2013 who took the sparkly baton from ABBA and is now the undisputed Queen of Eurovision \u2013 must feel a tinge of emotion when she sees those four legendary faces on billboards all over host city Malmo\u2026 right? \u201cI\u2019m looking at ABBA and I\u2019m like, I want to have those pants,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cThose platform shoes, where can I get those?\u201d Listen, Loreen, can you just say something nice about ABBA, so we can move on from those digitally-rendered dinosaurs and talk about the runners and riders at Eurovision this year? \u201cIt really is a work of art, what they\u2019ve created,\u201d Loreen says obligingly, reflecting on the foursome\u2019s musical and stylistic output. \u201cThe whole product, ABBA, is a vibe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d That it is. But ABBA are the past; Baby Lasagne, Windows95Man and Nemo \u2013 a person, not a fish \u2013 are very much the present. And this year\u2019s competition is as moving, ridiculous, naked and powerful as ever. So just in time for Pulitzer season, CNN has taken on the earnest task of studiously watching rehearsals and carefully analyzing every song, to bring you this: the definitive guide to the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. Artists have been competing in two semi-finals this week, and 26 made it to Saturday\u2019s grand final, which starts at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. EST) in Malmo. To quote Malta\u2019s vocal gymnast Sarah Bonnici: \u201cHere we go aga\u2026aaa..aaa..aa\u2026ain, huh?\u201d \u2018I don\u2019t need to be normal\u2019 For the rest of Europe, hosting Eurovision is an unimaginable honor. For Sweden, it\u2019s beginning to feel like that \u201cquirky\u201d friend\u2019s improv troupe you\u2019d promised you\u2019d see, then promptly forgot about until the last minute, just as you\u2019re stepping into a bubble bath with a glass of Pinot Grigio. This year\u2019s fan park is a bit budget, complain seasoned eurofans. Public rehearsals were half-full, and tickets remain for the final, with mere hours to go. Some even claim the show\u2019s slogan - \u201cUnited by Music\u201d - may be influenced by last year\u2019s slogan, \u201cUnited by Music.\u201d But Eurovision is a special part of the cultural calendar. \u201cThis community is the whole palette of what we are. Goofy, serious, nerdy,\u201d Loreen says, counting adjectives on some unnecessarily long, golden fingernails. \u201cEverything that you can imagine.\u201d If there\u2019s one thing the contest has taught her, it\u2019s this: \u201cYou can actually feel real, authentic love for people that you don\u2019t know, but you do know\u2026 you know?\u201d Loreen will be performing as a guest during Saturday\u2019s final, while 22-year-old identical twins Marcus and Martinus take the daunting mantle of competing for the host country. \u201cWe\u2019re very competitive people; I think we\u2019re the most competitive in the whole competition,\u201d they say without a trace of irony. This year\u2019s slim favorite is Baby Lasagne, whose arena-pounding anthem \u201cRim Tim Tagi Dim\u201d describes a brain drain affecting Croatian towns. \u201cAy, I\u2019m a big boy now; I\u2019m going away and I sold my cow,\u201d he chants. But Mr. Lasagne is nothing if not modest. He credits his fianc\u00e9e with helping him launch his career \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s the lasagne, and I\u2019m just the baby,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t even like lasagne that much,\u201d he adds, disappointingly. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s OK. I eat it a few times a year.\u201d He\u2019s juking it out with Switzerland\u2019s Nemo, who came up with genre-bending epic \u201cThe Code\u201d at Eurovision camp, a place whose mere mention would induce bewilderment to the non-European mind. \u201cIt was like a playground,\u201d Nemo says. But now Nemo\u2019s at the real thing, \u201cand it\u2019s even bigger and crazier than I expected it to be.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Bambie Thug is surging as the final approaches, and the Netherland\u2019s Joost Klein is in with a shot. \u201cI don\u2019t mind winning, and I also don\u2019t mind losing. I love being,\u201d he says. No-one has had a bigger nightmare in Malmo than Windows95Man, whose entire persona revolves around an operating system whose name and logo cannot legally be shown at Eurovision. Teemu Keisteri, the genius behind the act, decided to wear a blurred version of the logo on his T-shirt instead. And he wears little else; Finland\u2019s performance sees Windows95Man hatch from a giant egg, then run around with no trousers on for two minutes, before \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 he\u2019s eventually reunited with a pair of denim hot pants that descend from the ceiling. \u201cIn my late twenties, I figured out that I don\u2019t need to be normal,\u201d Windows95Man tells CNN. \u201cI cannot control how the world sees my art.\u201d And what is the message of this artwork, exactly? Windows95Man sums it up like this: \u201cIf Daddy is a little bit naked, it\u2019s not so serious.\u201d Which is not remotely a creepy thing to say. The best and worst of this year\u2019s contest Europe is utterly obsessed with Eurovision. It\u2019s all they think about year-round. Just ask Greece\u2019s contestant, Marina Satti. \u201cWhen I grew up I didn\u2019t have a TV, so I kind of lost track,\u201d she says. OK, never mind then. But more than 150 million people do watch every year. Some 129 artists entered San Marino\u2019s national selection \u2013 around one Eurovision wannabe for every 260 people living in the microstate. And the contest is as much about the lovable weirdos as it is the winners. CNN\u2019s prestigious, first annual award for the worst Eurovision lyric was hotly contested. We had some spectacular, cliched imagery to consider; Iceland\u2019s Hera Bjork is \u201cstanding on the edge of a promise,\u201d Saba is \u201cthrowing memories in the air,\u201d and Slimane wants to \u201ccreate an ocean in the fire.\u201d \u201cHurricanes are roaming, but you take away the pain,\u201d croons Azerbaijan\u2019s Fahree, who\u2019s dressed like he\u2019s come straight from the future \u2013 but not a cool part of the future, just a 23rd-century Italian restaurant with a poor hygiene rating. \u201cShining in a tiger\u2019s eyes, only I can find my future,\u201d Poland\u2019s Luna sings, in a truly nonsensical piece of penmanship that failed to propel her to the final. But Norway\u2019s G\u00e5te take the crown, for this unemotional bit of scene-setting: \u201cI was a very fine and beautiful maiden, with an evil stepmother. My mother had died,\u201d the band explains at the start of their track. \u201cShe transformed me into a sword and a needle, and sent me off to the King\u2019s estate.\u201d The relentless publicists are Eurovision\u2019s real heroes, pitching their artists in ludicrously bombastic terms. Latvia\u2019s Dons creates \u201ccompelling, soul-stirring melodies,\u201d we\u2019re told. Luna \u201cdraws as much kind energy from the Moon as possible.\u201d Armenia claims its folk-duo\u2019s songs \u201chave been said to transcend borders,\u201d though it doesn\u2019t explain who, exactly, has said this. And please make sure you\u2019re sitting down for this \u2013 Cyprus\u2019s Silia Kapsis, we\u2019re informed, was once \u201cfeatured in a dance documentary produced by Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas.\u201d Portugal\u2019s Iolanda, by contrast, is hyped as \u2026 checks notes \u2026 \u201ca promising singer.\u201d Sorry, Iolanda. Eurovision\u2019s contestants are a humble bunch; all they want to do is sing their songs and heal our planet. \u201cI tend to believe that we can change something with this show,\u201d Joost Klein says. \u201cThis is quantum physics, bro,\u201d adds Loreen. \u201cWe\u2019re balancing things up in the world right now.\u201d One might ask: if singing can really fix the world, why don\u2019t these people just sing more? Why do they ever stop? Why isn\u2019t a Eurovision contestant airdropped into every conflict zone in a sequined flak jacket, to wail and emote as loud as they can, until all the world\u2019s leader are sat around a campfire listening to Italy\u2019s Angelina Mango strum \u201cWonderwall\u201d on her guitar? The reality is that a significant portion of Eurovision\u2019s fanbase is uncomfortable with the participation of Israel during the country\u2019s war on Gaza; climate activist Greta Thunberg led an anti-war protest in Malmo on Thursday, and another is planned on Saturday to coincide with the final. Israel\u2019s contestant Eden Golan was audibly booed during the semi-final. The  European Broadcasting Union defended the decision to keep Israel at the competition to CNN this week. But for four hours on Saturday night, much of Europe will enjoy the escape that contestants are promising to provide. They\u2019ll sit and watch obediently as a procession of sad-looking men wail about their exes in various states of undress. They\u2019ll cheer on fierce girlbosses and overly-coiffed double acts as they drain Malmo\u2019s supply of dry ice. And they\u2019ll become entranced with a new set of oddballs gunning straight for the continent\u2019s hearts. As Loreen says: \u201cIt\u2019s a hub of love\u2026 you wanna join?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/eurovision-baby-lasagne-nemo-abba-preview-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review", "text": "Seven years after a trilogy that ended with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d didn\u2019t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it\u2019s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity \u2013 the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren \u2013 the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What\u2019s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) \u2013 an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom \u2013 attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (\u201cThe Witcher\u2019s\u201d Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing \u201cThe Planet of the Apes\u201d but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run. Hollywood blockbusters aren\u2019t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these \u201cApes\u201d prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don\u2019t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it\u2019s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d premieres May 10 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_04_25_entertainment_challengers-review-zendaya", "text": "In tennis, \u201clove\u201d means nothing. Love also has little to do with \u201cChallengers,\u201d which uses the sport as the backdrop to serve up an elaborate, non-linear psychological triangle that proves twisty and enticing for much of the match, before double faulting by whiffing on the ending. Seduction and sex are again at the heart of this film from \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d director Luca Guadagnino, who also throws in twists of fate, paths not taken and \u2013 in the case of the central character played by Zendaya \u2013 a burning desire to win and exercise control over those around her, exploring how that elite-athlete mentality bleeds into her personal life. The framing device is a singles match between Art (\u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d Mike Faist), a decorated superstar who might be nearing the end, at least in his mind, of his tournament-winning career; and Patrick (\u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Josh O\u2019Connor), who arrives at the off-the-beaten-track tournament where they end up facing off in a run-down car that, his finances being what they are, doubles as his hotel room. Flashing back 13 years, we discover that the two were bosom pals as junior tennis players when they first set their eyes \u2013 springing out of their heads almost cartoon-like \u2013 on Tashi (Zendaya), a rising star whose game provokes as much lust from them as her striking looks. Back in the present, Tashi is Art\u2019s wife and coach, having lost her own career to a devastating knee injury. Yet it\u2019s pretty obvious that she\u2019s living through him \u2013 he addresses the point overtly, saying, \u201cI\u2019m playing for both of us\u201d \u2013 which only makes how she wound up with him, as well as the outcome of Art and Patrick\u2019s (very) protracted match, more intriguing. While sexual tension plays a central role in the movie (and certainly the marketing of it), \u201cChallengers\u201d is as much about blurring the lines between sex and the seductive power of big-time sports, with winning and success as the ultimate aphrodisiac. Add to that the two boys/men being pretty transparent about what they want, Tashi remains a source of mystery, in part because of the unscheduled detour her career has been forced to take. After his fine young cannibals romance \u201cBones and All,\u201d Guadagnino, working from a script by playwright Justin Kuritzkes, occupies more conventional and commercial territory here, while doing all he can to sex up how he films the tennis sequences. Despite the zooming angles and whizzing balls, there\u2019s no escaping the sheer abundance of those scenes, especially for anyone who has never sat through an entire US Open or Wimbledon final. Even using the sport as a metaphor, \u201cChallengers\u201d might become a bit of a challenge for those who show up eager to see the principals sweat for different reasons. Because she\u2019s playing more complicated angles, Zendaya\u2019s Tashi is the most interesting character as well as a source of frustration. Then again, the details regarding all three of the key figures stay somewhat vague thanks in part to the structure, though all are prone to the occasional racket-mangling tantrum. While the build-up proves effective, the payoff simply feels too precious, in a way that\u2019s particularly unsatisfying. That misstep doesn\u2019t invalidate sitting through this otherwise neatly choreographed match, but in tennis terms, it\u2019s the kind of unforced error that prevents Guadagnino\u2019s latest film from ranking as an unqualified winner. \u201cChallengers\u201d premieres April 26 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/25/entertainment/challengers-review-zendaya/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The organization billed as the \u201chome for Black artists, fans and industry professionals working in country, Americana, blues, and folk music\u201d is getting more attention these days since Beyonc\u00e9 dropped her country-inspired \u201cAct II: Cowboy Carter.\u201d \u201cThe really cool thing that\u2019s happened since the Beyonc\u00e9 release is now we have this whole group of Black fans that have stepped forward and are starting to engage,\u201d Holly G., who first launched the Black Opry in 2021 as a blog, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m super, super excited about that because that\u2019s the single piece that\u2019s been really, really difficult for us to figure out. If and when we put Black artists on stage, whether it be at one of our shows or at any of the popular country music festivals, it\u2019s still really difficult to Black people specifically to overlook the fact that the industry has told them that they don\u2019t belong in these spaces and to want to come out and engage.\u201d Not everyone has shared her excitement. Both Beyonc\u00e9 and her album have been criticized by some as not at all country. And while jumping with both feet into the genre may be new, the conversations about country music, race and the contributions by people of color predate the superstar singer. Holly G. started the Black Opry in an attempt to find country fans of color, who like her, did not feel welcomed. \u201cI try to be careful to make the distinction when I talk about country music, between country music and the mainstream industry and country music the art form and genre,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause Black people have always made this style of music. They\u2019ve always been in the stylistic space, but the industry actually is very good at keeping Black people out of it.\u201d What she found was that Black country music artists were as hungry for community as those who listened to the music. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t really have much intention to interact with artists other than highlighting them on the blog,\u201d Holly G. said. \u201cBut once I launched it and they saw the few artists that I featured initially, a bunch of different artists started reaching out to me and got connected.\u201d Aaron Vance is one of those artists. The Nashville based singer and songwriter has been toiling for years, trying to break into an industry not known for embracing diversity, despite the success of artists like Mickey Guyton, Darius Rucker and Kane Brown. Growing up on a farm in Mississippi, Vance has the life experiences that makes for a great country song - a love of the land, a work ethic that says you keep at it as everything has \u201ca season,\u201d and a talent for three chords and the truth. Yet the industry to date hasn\u2019t exactly welcomed him with open arms, which is why he was thrilled to learn about the Black Opry. \u201cI got my first tour with Sara Shook & the Disarmers and Joshua Ray Walker thanks to the Black Opry,\u201d Vance told CNN. \u201cI was one of the first people to show up at [the Black Opry meetings]. It\u2019s been very beneficial.\u201d And inspiring. Vance said it\u2019s been \u201ca whole lot easier for me to be in my skin\u201d after connecting with others like him, those who may not look like the majority of country music artists or its fans, but who nevertheless share the same passion for the genre. \u201cI think it\u2019s good attention even though some people are saying what it ain\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good because when you say what something isn\u2019t, it\u2019s gonna cause people to go to it and listen and see for themselves.\u201d Which is why the singer said he\u2019s happy that a superstar like Beyonc\u00e9 has turned her spotlight toward the contributions of artists of color in country music, creating an opportunity for new audiences to discover artists like Vance and others whom Holly G. and her organization are advocating for. The Black Opry puts on concerts to help raise the visibility of performers. Along the way, Holly G. has learned that it\u2019s not just people of color who are grateful for the work she and the Black Opry are doing. \u201cThere were people from all backgrounds that came forward and were saying that they were grateful to have a space where they could celebrate country music without the culture that made them feel uncomfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were a lot of white people that were like, \u2018We feel guilty for enjoying country music because we know the culture is not welcoming.\u2019 And so this was a space for them to do that and not feel guilty about it.\u201d That is music to her ears.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/entertainment/black-opry-country-music/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Adopting a British accent, Moss sinks her teeth into the role of an MI6 agent, but her cat-and-mouse game with a suspected terrorist gradually unravels after a reasonably compelling start. The six-episode show opens at a refugee camp on the Syrian/Turkish border, where Adilah (Yumna Marwan) has sought refuge. But is she actually an ISIS mastermind, one with valuable information about a pending terror attack? Determining that falls to Imogen (Moss), who, as a French agent observes, will get to the bottom of things if anyone can. Not surprisingly, the high stakes draw plenty of attention, not only from French authorities but a CIA agent (Josh Charles) who parachutes in and tries to exert control over the chaotic situation, like the proverbial American bull in an international china shop. Written by Steven Knight, a British writer-producer best known stateside for \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d (but also behind the more recent disappointments \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d and \u201cAll the Light We Cannot See\u201d), \u201cThe Veil\u201d has some fun playing with spy conventions. That includes the hostile interactions between Charles\u2019 character and his French counterpart (Dali Benssalah), which even results in a rather hilariously bad shoving match. Unfortunately, the show keeps drifting into cliches of the genre, from Adilah\u2019s motivations to be reunited with her child to Imogen being haunted by her past, which dilutes the taut interaction between the two principals as the agent tries to penetrate her target\u2019s protective shell in those opening chapters. Nobody pulls off glowering stares and quiet intensity quite like Moss does, and she appears to relish this opportunity to shapeshift into what amounts to sort of a modern-day Emma Peel, including boots and butt kicking, perhaps in part because she\u2019s not an obvious choice for that assignment. That said, she\u2019s likely having a better time than you will, and once you get past the initial novelty the show feels at best like a middle-of-the-road addition to a long list of espionage-related series. In that sense, \u201cThe Veil\u201d is at least aptly named. Because while it begins by delicately hiding its mystery, the longer the story tugs at that, the less its wispy premise holds together. \u201cThe Veil\u201d premieres April 30 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/30/entertainment/the-veil-review-elisabeth-moss/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

In an interview with GQ magazine published Wednesday, Galitzine responded to a question about how playing a character who is considered good-looking made him feel. He replied: \u201cI think the most important thing to me is that I\u2019m taken seriously as a performer.

{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling", "text": "Superhero movies have seen better days at the box office, but an action-comedy based on a 1980s TV show still feels like an unlikely candidate to kick off the summer. Buoyed by the lure of what Ryan Gosling can do for a post-\u201cBarbie\u201d encore (or Ken-core), \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d is too flat in the early going to fully meet that challenge, rallying toward the end without reaching the heights required to make a really big splash. At its best, director David Leitch (\u201cDeadpool 2\u201d) has served up a movie defined by its love for the movies, and specifically, the stunt work where he cut his professional teeth before shifting into the big chair. In that sense, the TV series that starred Lee Majors (a show most memorable for its theme song, which is featured) creates a very loose template to set up a vehicle about a stuntman whose troubles spill off the screen into real life, forcing him to put his skills to use dealing with real bad guys. Getting there requires some buildup, with Gosling\u2019s Colt Seavers introduced serving as the stunt double for a typically self-absorbed star, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), while becoming involved with Jody (Emily Blunt), a fellow member of the crew. An accident derails Colt\u2019s plans and indeed life, and time passes before he\u2019s called out of retirement by Gail (\u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham), the fast-talking, troubleshooting producer on all of Ryder\u2019s films. Of course, he\u2019d probably stay safely at home if the space epic in question didn\u2019t mark Jody\u2019s directing debut, offering the prospect of a reunion that, naturally, doesn\u2019t go as smoothly as he hoped. There are also hidden reasons for the renewed interest in Colt, which has to do with offscreen shenanigans and Ryder becoming involved with some nefarious characters. That forces Colt into what amounts to private-eye mode, using his movie-trained skills to get himself both into and out of perilous situations. Setting all that up, including the romance, results in some arid stretches between the elaborate stunts, which are ultimately the main source of \u201cThe Fall Guy\u2019s\u201d appeal and certainly its comedy. Gosling imbues Colt with a goofy charm and amusing neediness, but the underlying premise was a trifle strained even back in the Reagan era, and putting the whole thing on steroids for the movies doesn\u2019t completely address those issues. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d thus stands out primarily for smaller moments and wrinkles, such as Colt\u2019s boss (Winston Duke) constantly quoting movie lines to him, Taylor-Johnson sounding a whole lot like Matthew McConaughey, and a stunt dog trained to respond to French, including an especially juvenile command. Perhaps foremost, \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d feels burdened by the weight of expectations and its positioning as a major blockbuster when the movie really operates as a light-hearted ode to the unknown stuntman, in a way that\u2019s basically just amiably OK.

{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_tattooist-of-auschwitz-review", "text": "Something as simple as a framing device elevates \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d \u2013 which stands out from a host of recent Holocaust tales \u2013 thanks in part to Harvey Keitel, starring as the elderly Lale Sokolov who recounts his remarkable story of life in a concentration camp to an unlikely interviewer. Jumping around in time, this British production captures the horror of that experience while finding notes of grace in its narrator\u2019s survival. That\u2019s in part because this six-part series is at its core a love story, unfolding under the most horrible of circumstances. Assigned to tattoo identification numbers on the arms of other prisoners, the the young Lale, or Lali (\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u2019s\u201d Jonah Hauer-King, who lost a noticeable amount of weight for the role), meets Gita (Polish actress Anna Pr\u00f3chniak) while in the camps, becoming almost instantly smitten. \u201cI want you to live to be an old man,\u201d Gita tells him at one point, a wish that seems all the more tenuous as he deals with the sadistic guards, while she grapples with illness and those around them keep meeting terrible ends. Their interactions take place tenderly against a backdrop of pain, suffering and the constant threat of quick and arbitrary death, which leads the elder Lali to be haunted by visions of those he knew and lost. In a stark device, the victims (and in some instances, perpetrators) appear to Lali, like photographs etched in his mind, as he grapples with those memories and feelings of survivor\u2019s guilt. His story pours out, gradually, to aspiring author Heather Morris (\u201cYellowjackets\u201d star Melanie Lynskey), who is understandably overwhelmed by this flood of memories. \u201cI haven\u2019t got long,\u201d Lali tells her, fueling her commitment to ensure his story gets told. As noted, there have been several recent productions dealing with similar material, including Netflix\u2019s \u201cAll the Light We Cannot See\u201d and Hulu\u2019s \u201cWe Were the Lucky Ones.\u201d On top of that, the 80th anniversary of D-Day is prompting an onslaught of documentary fare devoted to World War II. Nevertheless, \u201cTattooist of Auschwitz\u201d stands apart from the crowd, thanks in part to the quality of its performances, not just by documenting the barbarity of the Nazis but the sprigs of humanity that managed to bloom during the darkest of times. Featuring a new song from Barbra Streisand, the series closes with footage of the real Sokolov being interviewed. Those clips drive the point home, in a way that demonstrates why even for those resistant to sitting through another Holocaust drama, there ought to be room for a really good one. \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d premieres May 2 on Peacock.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/tattooist-of-auschwitz-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_bodkin-review-will-forte-obama", "text": "The latest Netflix project falling under the Obamas\u2019 production deal, \u201cBodkin\u201d initially possesses an intriguing \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d-like vibe with a touch of \u201cLocal Hero,\u201d the classic 1983 film about a young executive dispatched to a Scottish village. Here, it\u2019s an American podcaster invading a quirky Irish town, nosing around a cold case that yields a steadily diminishing drip from this Irish spring. Said podcaster Gilbert (Will Forte) comes with his share of baggage, as does Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), the investigative reporter grudgingly assigned to accompany him. They\u2019re joined by Emmy (Robyn Cara), a bright-eyed young researcher who looks up to Dove, which doesn\u2019t make the more seasoned journalist\u2019s treatment of her any less frosty. Indeed, Dove makes clear she feels like she\u2019s slumming in pandering to this request (order, actually) from her bosses to squire Gilbert through his mission, at least until they begin to chip away at the layers surrounding what might have happened to three people who disappeared a quarter-century earlier. As with \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and \u201cLocal Hero,\u201d there\u2019s an odd quaintness to the town Gilbert finds charming, but as is so often the case, the cheery exterior for tourists and rubes hides a darker underbelly. That includes guardedness toward outsiders that introduces a pinch of \u201cAn American Werewolf in London\u201d into the stew as well. Gilbert approaches the whole exercise from a very different perspective than Dove, who becomes engaged by the prospect of cracking the case, while he simply wants to put on a good show, prompting her to liken his work less to journalism than pornography. \u201cHe thinks Ireland is some kind of Disneyland,\u201d she grumbles, which is understandable given the \u201cDarby O\u2019Gill and the Little People\u201d setting, with even more heavy drinking and pounding hangovers. Forte is happily more subdued than he often tends to be, but Gilbert is still a reluctant sleuth, which makes Dove (played with a nicely crusty edge by Cullen, an Irish actor) the true driver of this story. Over the seven episodes, that arc becomes increasingly convoluted and a trifle far-fetched \u2013 not fatal flaws, but not helpful ones either. The Obamas\u2019 Higher Ground production company has become a prolific supplier to Netflix, from movies like \u201cLeave the World Behind\u201d to award-winning documentaries. Created by Jez Scharf, \u201cBodkin\u201d represents a low-key addition to that slate, but still makes for a passable binge; still, what looks like a distinctive show gradually blends into its saturated genre \u2013 less a commentary on true-crime podcasts than a reminder that even with series that start out well, there\u2019s not always a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. \u201cBodkin\u201d premieres May 9 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/bodkin-review-will-forte-obama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_03_entertainment_unfrosted-review-jerry-seinfeld", "text": "Jerry Seinfeld waited this long for his directing debut, which makes the choice of \u201cUnfrosted,\u201d a silly lark of a comedy, somewhat perplexing. Far from a passion project, this Netflix film distinctly feels \u2013 as one of its writers says in the production notes \u2013 like a punchline in search of a movie, built on a soggy parade of sugary cameos that doesn\u2019t provide much snap, crackle and pop. Charitably, \u201cUnfrosted\u201d serves as a disjointed send-up of the 1960s, using a war between cereal companies \u2013 and the idea that for kids watching TV during those years, \u201cBattle Creek, Michigan\u201d seemed like a magical place \u2013 as its backbone. In that sense the ostensible plot, involving a race to develop what became the Pop-Tart, is really more a point of entry than a true recipe. Sharing script credit with a trio of writers (two of them \u201cSeinfeld\u201d alums, as well as collaborators on the animated \u201cBee Movie\u201d), Seinfeld more than anything seems to have wanted to make a modern-day Marx Brothers movie, where the gags fly fast and furious. That includes plenty of lines made funny by hindsight, like someone reading a newspaper in the early \u201860s and saying, \u201cVietnam, now that seems like a good idea.\u201d The problem is mastering that sort of tone is a lot harder than Groucho and company made it look. Sneaking in a bunch of old-movie references (\u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d among them), or jokes about John F. Kennedy (Bill Burr) being a philanderer, might provoke a chuckle or two in Seinfeld\u2019s demo, but the free-associating, madcap pacing feels like overkill in a way that gets old awfully fast. A fictionalized story with a tiny grain of truth, \u201cUnfrosted\u201d focuses on Seinfeld\u2019s Bob Cabana, an executive at Kellogg\u2019s who is horrified to discover that rival Post, and its scheming chief executive Marjorie Post (Amy Schumer), might be on the verge of marketing a breakfast pastry that could revolutionize the business. Determined to level the playing field, Bob enlists a former colleague (Melissa McCarthy) to join the effort to thwart Post, as the two embark on what amounts to a pop-culture tour of the 1960s. While some of those digressions are clever, most come across as arbitrary and odd, veering off course to include gags about everything from the space program to fitness guru Jack LaLanne. Of all the casting surprises, one stands head and shoulders above the rest (you\u2019ll know it when you see it), but that moment mainly highlights what \u201cUnfrosted\u201d could have been had the movie been able to sustain that. While it\u2019s possible to get into the nostalgic spirit, the question Seinfeld doesn\u2019t bother trying to address is \u201cWhy?,\u201d or at least, why now? Perhaps curiosity about the whole directing thing simply got the better of him, but it\u2019s a self-indulgent exercise, informed by a sense that Netflix would have said \u201cyes\u201d to anything he pitched them. (Seinfeld does include one sweet wrinkle, naming a character \u201cRick Ludwin\u201d after the late NBC executive who ordered \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d) In promoting the film, Seinfeld recently lamented the current state of TV comedy, so it\u2019s not surprising he\u2019d be drawn to the past. Still, while \u201cUnfrosted\u201d isn\u2019t wholly unfunny (or at least, not consistently so) it is, more than anything, just plain unnecessary. \u201cUnfrosted\u201d premieres May 3 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/entertainment/unfrosted-review-jerry-seinfeld/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Nicely played by the leads, this tale of a 40-year-old woman swept off her feet by a 20-something boy-band star amounts to playing the genre\u2019s hits while following all the same old steps. Destined for Amazon, it\u2019s a competent date-night or gals\u2019-night movie for those who don\u2019t want to leave the house \u2013 Chardonnay optional, but recommended \u2013 which makes practical sense, landing as it does in a middle ground that has struggled at the box office. Cheated on and left by her husband, Sol\u00e9ne (Hathaway) is a successful art-gallery owner who gets roped at the last-minute into squiring her teenage daughter and the kid\u2019s friends to Coachella, where her ex has purchased a meet-and-greet experience with the members of August Moon, whose following might lean more toward the tween crowd. A reluctant attendee, Sol\u00e9ne has the ultimate meet-cute moment with band member Hayes (Galitzine, of \u201cMary & George\u201d and \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d renown), stumbling into his trailer thinking it\u2019s the restroom. After some awkward banter and obvious chemistry \u2013 which with the benefit of hindsight is about as good as the movie gets \u2013 Hayes shows up unexpectedly (by her, that is) at Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s gallery, telling her shyly, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t meet people like you very often.\u201d For a pop star, he\u2019s an endearingly sensitive soul, which doesn\u2019t do much to quell her reticence, due both to their age gap and his fame. Romance and complications ensue, with writer-director Michael Showalter (\u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and \u201cSpoiler Alert,\u201d sharing script credit with Jennifer Westfeldt) adapting Robinne Lee\u2019s novel in part by relying on the customary montages to handle some of the heavy lifting.

All that really leaves, then, is the interplay between Hathaway and Galitzine, with the latter (starring in his second Amazon movie in a year\u2019s time about a romance complicated by fame) performing double duty on the songs. The problem is however well they might work in terms of rooting for them as a couple, it\u2019s hard to avoid the very real issue that the world he inhabits and indeed people in general can be pretty lousy. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d will likely be most satisfying for those who choose not to sweat the details, enjoying the scenery and fantasy wrapped up in it. Think of it as one of those movies that really reinforces the adage there are no new ideas, just fresh versions of old ones set to different beats. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d premieres May 2 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.

As the young Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) prepared to head off to college, he and his family learned that his father (Lance Barber) has died of a heart attack, the aftermath of which will be addressed in the two-part series finale on May 16. The moment seemed particularly cruel, inasmuch as the father, George Sr., had just been offered a long-sought opportunity to move up from coaching high school football into the college ranks, receiving an offer from Rice in Houston. \u201cWe always knew that there were a couple big moments that happened in Sheldon\u2019s life, his father passes away and he goes to Caltech,\u201d executive producer Steve Holland told CNN, adding that the decision was made to have that happen now \u2013 as opposed to during the final two episodes \u2013 so the characters could deal with its aftermath in the finale. According to Holland, series co-creator Chuck Lorre suggested that schedule of events, saying that after seven seasons of comedy (allowing for the occasional poignant moment), \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t want to leave the audience wallowing in grief at the end.\u201d The elder Sheldon (Jim Parsons) had referenced his father\u2019s death, and when it happened, during \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d although with the benefit of hindsight he wasn\u2019t always the most reliable narrator regarding his father and his perceived shortcomings \u2013 at least, based on how they played out in the second series.

All of that is documented by producer and director Prentice Penny in the new Hulu limited docuseries, \u201cBlack Twitter: A People\u2019s History.\u201d Penny, who both admires and participates in Black Twitter, told CNN the project came along at a time when he was looking \u201cto chase that feeling of being scared again.\u201d \u201cI also wanted a project that wasn\u2019t gonna be compared immediately to what I had just done,\u201d Penny, whose recent credits include serving as the showrunner for the HBO comedy \u201cInsecure,\u201d said. \u201cThey brought me this article in the fall of 2021, and I was like \u2018I love Black Twitter.

We were just doing that in a different space.\u201d For all the seriousness, there is also comic relief. A perfect example is the \u201cMeet Me in Temecula\u201d saga. It all started on Christmas Day in 2014, when a Twitter user going by @SnottieDrippen tweeted a critique of Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant\u2019s performance in a game against the Phoenix Suns. Another user, @MyTweetsRealAF, took offense and before long the two were engaged in a debate on social media. @SnottieDrippen suggested they meet up in Temecula to settle the disagreement, launching a \u201cMeet Me in Temecula\u201d meme that became shorthand for online disagreements that spin out of control. The fact that one of the potential combatants actually tweeted that he had driven to Temecula proved to be the cherry on top and the whole thing was a rollicking good time, thanks to Black Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been in barbershops, we\u2019ve all been at cookouts and there\u2019s always the brother, the uncle, whoever who takes the hoop argument a little too far,\u201d TJ Adeshola, Twitter\u2019s former head of Global Content Partnerships, said in the docuseries. \u201cYou don\u2019t play for the Lakers, bro.\u201d Penny acknowledged he\u2019s seen some apprehension about the docuseries arise, on X, naturally, and understands the concern. \u201cI feel like because so much of Black culture has been not told by us, we\u2019re always very skeptical of things that have to do with us,\u201d Penny said. \u201cI totally understand that.\u201d He\u2019s confident the docuseries, like the voices who embody Black Twitter, will connect. \u201cI feel like Black Twitter is bigger than the platform now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the energy of the way Black people just move in the world with more power and with more emboldeness.\u201d \u201cBlack Twitter: A People\u2019s History\u201d debuts Thursday on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/entertainment/prentice-penny-black-twitter-docuseries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
