In a new interview with Vogue, published Sunday, the \u201cNewsroom\u201d actress revealed that she recently had a hysterectomy. \u201cI took out my uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries,\u201d she said. Munn said that the procedure, which took place last month, was an alternative to taking a cancer treatment medication that was causing her to experience \u201cnext-level, debilitating exhaustion.\u201d She said it was \u201ca big decision to make, but it was the best decision for me because I needed to be present for my family.\u201d The hysterectomy would improve her quality of life, but it also meant that she\u2019d no longer be able to carry any future children. Munn and comedian John Mulaney welcomed their son, Malcom, in 2021. \u201cJohn and I talked about it a lot and we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re done growing our family,\u201d she said. Munn, who had previously frozen her eggs twice in the past, said she underwent another round of egg retrieval before moving ahead with the hysterectomy, in hopes of making an embryo to use for surrogacy. When her doctor later informed the couple that they had two healthy embryos, she and Mulaney \u201cjust started crying.\u201d \u201cIt was just so exciting because not only did we get it in one retrieval, but it also meant that I didn\u2019t have to keep putting myself at risk,\u201d she said. Munn first revealed that she was diagnosed with a form of breast cancer known as Luminal B cancer in March. The cancer was found in both of her breasts, and Munn\u2019s treatment included a double mastectomy. \u201cThis journey has made me realize how grateful I am to have options for not only fighting cancer,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also having more children if we want.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/entertainment/olivia-munn-hysterectomy-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_03_entertainment_star-wars-phantom-menace-turns-25", "text": "The teeth-gnashing aspects of \u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d have been chewed upon for a quarter century, from Watto to Anakin Skywalker\u2019s Midi-chlorian count (and miracle birth) to almost everyone\u2019s favorite punching bag, Jar Jar Binks. Yet as the movie that kicked off George Lucas\u2019 prequel trilogy hits theaters to commemorate its 25th anniversary for the de facto \u201cStar Wars\u201d holiday May the Fourth, let\u2019s accentuate the positive by identifying a half-dozen things the film, and the franchise\u2019s patriarch, got decidedly right. Each of these elements have echoed through \u201cStar Wars\u201d lore, and in most instances been put to better use elsewhere (in sequels, the various animated series overseen by Dave Filoni and the recent live-action ones, like \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\u201d) than they were in the original film. Think of them as creative building blocks, which overcame clunkier parts of the script and awkward performances to influence the rest of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d timeline. They\u2019re presented here in ascending order of significance: 6. The Emperor\u2019s long game. The idea that Palpatine/Darth Sidious (played by Ian McDiarmid) would spend years undermining the Republic from the inside got a bit wonky, but it created a fertile backdrop for how the Sith could outmaneuver the Jedi. 5. The digital effects. Admittedly, this was a bit of a mixed bag, since Lucas\u2019 emphasis on the visual components seemed to come at the expense of paying attention to the acting and performances, and in ways to overwhelm them. Yet he credibly moved the bar forward in terms of digital effects and design, which paid off in the scale of the action sequences. 4. Mace Windu. Samuel L. Jackson didn\u2019t have much to do in this first movie, but the Jedi master became a vital part of the mythology and had opportunities to demonstrate his power later (perhaps foremost in the animated \u201cThe Clone Wars\u201d), while padding the actor\u2019s formidable resume when it comes to appearing in blockbuster franchises. 3. Darth Maul. As played by Ray Park, the mostly silent Sith apprentice represents one of the most visually striking characters introduced over the course of the entire series \u2013 including that way-cool double-sided lightsaber \u2013 so much so that Filoni went to great lengths to revive him after what certainly appeared to be a glass-half-empty exit at the end of \u201cPhantom Menace.\u201d 2. Casting Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. Although Lucas tilted the plot toward Darth Vader\u2019s origin story, finding the young Obi-Wan Kenobi was a major challenge, and McGregor gave the first trilogy dramatic ballast even in its weaker moments, as did Neeson as his master. Those qualities were underscored by their brief reunion in the recent Disney+ series. 1. The lightsaber duels. In the original trilogy, lightsaber duels were essentially just basic sword fights, with a few acrobatic maneuvers and uses of telekinesis. The battle between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan \u2013 set to composer John Williams\u2019 evocative \u201cDuel of the Fates,\u201d one of his finest musical contributions in a long line of them \u2013 lifted that to dazzling heights, not only in the use of \u201cForce\u201d abilities as an organic form of fighting but through the choreography and physicality. (Give much credit for the latter to Park, who put his experience as a martial artist and stunt double to excellent use.) Every lightsaber fight since then \u2013 including the memorable image of Yoda energetically leaping around in \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d and \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d \u2013 has built upon the framework that sequence established. It\u2019s also likely a key reason why \u201cStar Wars\u201d has continued to flourish as parents pass it on to their kids. Not everything in \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d aged well, but that climactic duel is one of those scenes that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. \u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d will play in select theaters beginning May 3.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/entertainment/star-wars-phantom-menace-turns-25/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The show, which Seymour also executive produces, has humor as well as mystery and it\u2019s a natural fit for the \u201cDr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\u201d actor, who says many didn\u2019t realize she could do comedy until her breakout role in the 2005 film \u201cWedding Crashers.\u201d \u201cEveryone was shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t believe I could be funny and so I did a ton of comedy after that. And actually comedy, really good comedy in my opinion, is grounded.\u201d That\u2019s one of the things that attracted Seymour to the role of Harry, because she \u201cloved the idea of playing a very independent woman who doesn\u2019t need to get married, does drink too much red wine and changes career paths in her seventies.\u201d It\u2019s the same type of fearlessness Seymour displays in real life, and she believes the full life she lives helps make her a better performer. \u201cI have children, I have grandchildren, I do other things. I paint, I design, I do philanthropy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never sort of sat by the phone hoping it would ring. I\u2019m always creating something, or if somebody offers me something that\u2019s wacky and a tiny little thing I\u2019ll do it. There\u2019s no too small a role.\u201d And there\u2019s no role too emotional for Seymour either.

These days Seymour has found love with her boyfriend John Zambetti, who is a doctor and a musician. She chuckles when she recounts how she famously played a physician on \u201cDr. Quinn,\u201d a role Zambetti wasn\u2019t familiar with before they started dating, but now loves. \u201cWhen he met me and decided he wanted to go out with me, he barely remembered seeing [the James Bond film she starred in] \u2018Live and Let Die\u2019 and watched it again,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d never seen or heard of anything like \u2018Dr. Quinn\u2019 or anything and he\u2019s a doctor, so you\u2019d think he would\u2019ve known.

In his case, he said, it was \u201ctremendously debilitating and really seriously emotionally incapacitating.\u201d \u201cIt was one of the most traumatic points of my life but it is my story,\u201d he said. The discussion was prompted by the podcast\u2019s host Josh Horowitz asking Pine how he felt about comments that \u201cThe O.C.\u201d casting director Patrick Rush made last year in Alan Sepinwall\u2019s 2023 book \u201cWelcome to The O.C.: The Oral History.\u201d In it, Rush revealed that Pine read for the role of Ryan Atwood for the series, but that his \u201creally bad skin\u201d at the time, to Rush, was \u201cinsurmountable.\u201d The role of Atwood ultimately went to actor Ben McKenzie, who starred in the series during its run from 2003 to 2007.

Adopting a British accent, Moss sinks her teeth into the role of an MI6 agent, but her cat-and-mouse game with a suspected terrorist gradually unravels after a reasonably compelling start. The six-episode show opens at a refugee camp on the Syrian/Turkish border, where Adilah (Yumna Marwan) has sought refuge. But is she actually an ISIS mastermind, one with valuable information about a pending terror attack? Determining that falls to Imogen (Moss), who, as a French agent observes, will get to the bottom of things if anyone can. Not surprisingly, the high stakes draw plenty of attention, not only from French authorities but a CIA agent (Josh Charles) who parachutes in and tries to exert control over the chaotic situation, like the proverbial American bull in an international china shop. Written by Steven Knight, a British writer-producer best known stateside for \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d (but also behind the more recent disappointments \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d and \u201cAll the Light We Cannot See\u201d), \u201cThe Veil\u201d has some fun playing with spy conventions. That includes the hostile interactions between Charles\u2019 character and his French counterpart (Dali Benssalah), which even results in a rather hilariously bad shoving match. Unfortunately, the show keeps drifting into cliches of the genre, from Adilah\u2019s motivations to be reunited with her child to Imogen being haunted by her past, which dilutes the taut interaction between the two principals as the agent tries to penetrate her target\u2019s protective shell in those opening chapters. Nobody pulls off glowering stares and quiet intensity quite like Moss does, and she appears to relish this opportunity to shapeshift into what amounts to sort of a modern-day Emma Peel, including boots and butt kicking, perhaps in part because she\u2019s not an obvious choice for that assignment. That said, she\u2019s likely having a better time than you will, and once you get past the initial novelty the show feels at best like a middle-of-the-road addition to a long list of espionage-related series. In that sense, \u201cThe Veil\u201d is at least aptly named. Because while it begins by delicately hiding its mystery, the longer the story tugs at that, the less its wispy premise holds together. \u201cThe Veil\u201d premieres April 30 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/30/entertainment/the-veil-review-elisabeth-moss/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_04_26_entertainment_black-opry-country-music", "text": "Before there was conversation over whether Beyonc\u00e9 is country enough for country music, there was the Black Opry, holding space for music lovers and artists of color in the genre. The organization billed as the \u201chome for Black artists, fans and industry professionals working in country, Americana, blues, and folk music\u201d is getting more attention these days since Beyonc\u00e9 dropped her country-inspired \u201cAct II: Cowboy Carter.\u201d \u201cThe really cool thing that\u2019s happened since the Beyonc\u00e9 release is now we have this whole group of Black fans that have stepped forward and are starting to engage,\u201d Holly G., who first launched the Black Opry in 2021 as a blog, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m super, super excited about that because that\u2019s the single piece that\u2019s been really, really difficult for us to figure out. If and when we put Black artists on stage, whether it be at one of our shows or at any of the popular country music festivals, it\u2019s still really difficult to Black people specifically to overlook the fact that the industry has told them that they don\u2019t belong in these spaces and to want to come out and engage.\u201d Not everyone has shared her excitement. Both Beyonc\u00e9 and her album have been criticized by some as not at all country. And while jumping with both feet into the genre may be new, the conversations about country music, race and the contributions by people of color predate the superstar singer. Holly G. started the Black Opry in an attempt to find country fans of color, who like her, did not feel welcomed. \u201cI try to be careful to make the distinction when I talk about country music, between country music and the mainstream industry and country music the art form and genre,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause Black people have always made this style of music. They\u2019ve always been in the stylistic space, but the industry actually is very good at keeping Black people out of it.\u201d What she found was that Black country music artists were as hungry for community as those who listened to the music. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t really have much intention to interact with artists other than highlighting them on the blog,\u201d Holly G. said. \u201cBut once I launched it and they saw the few artists that I featured initially, a bunch of different artists started reaching out to me and got connected.\u201d Aaron Vance is one of those artists. The Nashville based singer and songwriter has been toiling for years, trying to break into an industry not known for embracing diversity, despite the success of artists like Mickey Guyton, Darius Rucker and Kane Brown. Growing up on a farm in Mississippi, Vance has the life experiences that makes for a great country song - a love of the land, a work ethic that says you keep at it as everything has \u201ca season,\u201d and a talent for three chords and the truth. Yet the industry to date hasn\u2019t exactly welcomed him with open arms, which is why he was thrilled to learn about the Black Opry. \u201cI got my first tour with Sara Shook & the Disarmers and Joshua Ray Walker thanks to the Black Opry,\u201d Vance told CNN. \u201cI was one of the first people to show up at [the Black Opry meetings]. It\u2019s been very beneficial.\u201d And inspiring. Vance said it\u2019s been \u201ca whole lot easier for me to be in my skin\u201d after connecting with others like him, those who may not look like the majority of country music artists or its fans, but who nevertheless share the same passion for the genre. \u201cI think it\u2019s good attention even though some people are saying what it ain\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good because when you say what something isn\u2019t, it\u2019s gonna cause people to go to it and listen and see for themselves.\u201d Which is why the singer said he\u2019s happy that a superstar like Beyonc\u00e9 has turned her spotlight toward the contributions of artists of color in country music, creating an opportunity for new audiences to discover artists like Vance and others whom Holly G. and her organization are advocating for. The Black Opry puts on concerts to help raise the visibility of performers. Along the way, Holly G. has learned that it\u2019s not just people of color who are grateful for the work she and the Black Opry are doing. \u201cThere were people from all backgrounds that came forward and were saying that they were grateful to have a space where they could celebrate country music without the culture that made them feel uncomfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were a lot of white people that were like, \u2018We feel guilty for enjoying country music because we know the culture is not welcoming.\u2019 And so this was a space for them to do that and not feel guilty about it.\u201d That is music to her ears.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/entertainment/black-opry-country-music/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Nicely played by the leads, this tale of a 40-year-old woman swept off her feet by a 20-something boy-band star amounts to playing the genre\u2019s hits while following all the same old steps. Destined for Amazon, it\u2019s a competent date-night or gals\u2019-night movie for those who don\u2019t want to leave the house \u2013 Chardonnay optional, but recommended \u2013 which makes practical sense, landing as it does in a middle ground that has struggled at the box office. Cheated on and left by her husband, Sol\u00e9ne (Hathaway) is a successful art-gallery owner who gets roped at the last-minute into squiring her teenage daughter and the kid\u2019s friends to Coachella, where her ex has purchased a meet-and-greet experience with the members of August Moon, whose following might lean more toward the tween crowd. A reluctant attendee, Sol\u00e9ne has the ultimate meet-cute moment with band member Hayes (Galitzine, of \u201cMary & George\u201d and \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d renown), stumbling into his trailer thinking it\u2019s the restroom. After some awkward banter and obvious chemistry \u2013 which with the benefit of hindsight is about as good as the movie gets \u2013 Hayes shows up unexpectedly (by her, that is) at Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s gallery, telling her shyly, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t meet people like you very often.\u201d For a pop star, he\u2019s an endearingly sensitive soul, which doesn\u2019t do much to quell her reticence, due both to their age gap and his fame. Romance and complications ensue, with writer-director Michael Showalter (\u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and \u201cSpoiler Alert,\u201d sharing script credit with Jennifer Westfeldt) adapting Robinne Lee\u2019s novel in part by relying on the customary montages to handle some of the heavy lifting. If only the garnishes were a little less tired, including the prying paparazzi and Reid Scott as Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s no-right-to-be-bent-out-of-shape ex. All that really leaves, then, is the interplay between Hathaway and Galitzine, with the latter (starring in his second Amazon movie in a year\u2019s time about a romance complicated by fame) performing double duty on the songs. The problem is however well they might work in terms of rooting for them as a couple, it\u2019s hard to avoid the very real issue that the world he inhabits and indeed people in general can be pretty lousy. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d will likely be most satisfying for those who choose not to sweat the details, enjoying the scenery and fantasy wrapped up in it. Think of it as one of those movies that really reinforces the adage there are no new ideas, just fresh versions of old ones set to different beats. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d premieres May 2 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.

{"id": "2024_05_03_entertainment_unfrosted-review-jerry-seinfeld", "text": "Jerry Seinfeld waited this long for his directing debut, which makes the choice of \u201cUnfrosted,\u201d a silly lark of a comedy, somewhat perplexing. Far from a passion project, this Netflix film distinctly feels \u2013 as one of its writers says in the production notes \u2013 like a punchline in search of a movie, built on a soggy parade of sugary cameos that doesn\u2019t provide much snap, crackle and pop. Charitably, \u201cUnfrosted\u201d serves as a disjointed send-up of the 1960s, using a war between cereal companies \u2013 and the idea that for kids watching TV during those years, \u201cBattle Creek, Michigan\u201d seemed like a magical place \u2013 as its backbone. In that sense the ostensible plot, involving a race to develop what became the Pop-Tart, is really more a point of entry than a true recipe. Sharing script credit with a trio of writers (two of them \u201cSeinfeld\u201d alums, as well as collaborators on the animated \u201cBee Movie\u201d), Seinfeld more than anything seems to have wanted to make a modern-day Marx Brothers movie, where the gags fly fast and furious. That includes plenty of lines made funny by hindsight, like someone reading a newspaper in the early \u201860s and saying, \u201cVietnam, now that seems like a good idea.\u201d The problem is mastering that sort of tone is a lot harder than Groucho and company made it look. Sneaking in a bunch of old-movie references (\u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d among them), or jokes about John F. Kennedy (Bill Burr) being a philanderer, might provoke a chuckle or two in Seinfeld\u2019s demo, but the free-associating, madcap pacing feels like overkill in a way that gets old awfully fast. A fictionalized story with a tiny grain of truth, \u201cUnfrosted\u201d focuses on Seinfeld\u2019s Bob Cabana, an executive at Kellogg\u2019s who is horrified to discover that rival Post, and its scheming chief executive Marjorie Post (Amy Schumer), might be on the verge of marketing a breakfast pastry that could revolutionize the business. Determined to level the playing field, Bob enlists a former colleague (Melissa McCarthy) to join the effort to thwart Post, as the two embark on what amounts to a pop-culture tour of the 1960s. While some of those digressions are clever, most come across as arbitrary and odd, veering off course to include gags about everything from the space program to fitness guru Jack LaLanne. Of all the casting surprises, one stands head and shoulders above the rest (you\u2019ll know it when you see it), but that moment mainly highlights what \u201cUnfrosted\u201d could have been had the movie been able to sustain that. While it\u2019s possible to get into the nostalgic spirit, the question Seinfeld doesn\u2019t bother trying to address is \u201cWhy?,\u201d or at least, why now? Perhaps curiosity about the whole directing thing simply got the better of him, but it\u2019s a self-indulgent exercise, informed by a sense that Netflix would have said \u201cyes\u201d to anything he pitched them. (Seinfeld does include one sweet wrinkle, naming a character \u201cRick Ludwin\u201d after the late NBC executive who ordered \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d) In promoting the film, Seinfeld recently lamented the current state of TV comedy, so it\u2019s not surprising he\u2019d be drawn to the past. Still, while \u201cUnfrosted\u201d isn\u2019t wholly unfunny (or at least, not consistently so) it is, more than anything, just plain unnecessary. \u201cUnfrosted\u201d premieres May 3 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/entertainment/unfrosted-review-jerry-seinfeld/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Judge Gus T. May of the Los Angeles Superior Court found \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that a conservatorship is necessary, court documents said, noting that Wilson consents to the conservatorship. According to the court documents, Wilson is \u201cunable to care for his person,\u201d has a \u201cMajor Neurocognitive Disorder\u201d and \u201clacks capacity to give informed medical consent for medications.\u201d Wilson\u2019s conservators are ordered to consult with his children regarding all material related healthcare decisions, the court documents said. According to the Wilson family, the decision to place Brian under a conservatorship came following the death of his wife, Melinda Wilson, in January. At the time, Wilson called his wife his \u201canchor,\u201d saying in a post on his website that \u201cMelinda was more than my wife.\u00a0She was my savior. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career.\u00a0She encouraged me to make the music that was closest to my heart.\u201d In a statement published in February, the Wilson family said that after \u201ccareful consideration and consultation\u201d among Brian, his children, his housekeeper and his doctors, \u201clongtime Wilson family representatives LeeAnn Hard and Jean Sievers will serve as Brian\u2019s co-conservators of the person\u201d following Melinda\u2019s passing. This decision was made, the statement said, to \u201censure that there will be no extreme changes to the household,\u201d as well as making sure that \u201cBrian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for by (housekeeper) Gloria Ramos and the wonderful team at the house who have been in place for many years helping take care of the family.\u201d \u201cBrian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses,\u201d the family\u2019s statement concluded. Wilson has had a tumultuous relationship with the spotlight, having suffered from fame-induced stress, depression, and drug addiction in the past. He decided to quit touring with his band after a nervous breakdown in 1964, though he continued to write, arrange, produce and record The Beach Boys\u2019 music. Wilson and The Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001. Wilson has also won two Grammy Awards as a solo artist, for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2005 and Best Historical Album in 2013.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/beach-boys-brian-wilson-conservatorship-judge-rules-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_entertainment_prentice-penny-black-twitter-docuseries", "text": "Twitter may no longer be Twitter, but the presence of Black Twitter is still being felt. If you doubt that, just hop over to X (the platform formally known as Twitter) and search for the recent hip-hop beef involving Drake and Kendrick Lamar. That drama is just the type of thing that Black Twitter has sunk its teeth into with memes and pithy quotes. But there is also a history of serious cultural commentary that has spotlighted inequality and injustice, like the tragic deaths of teens Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin. All of that is documented by producer and director Prentice Penny in the new Hulu limited docuseries, \u201cBlack Twitter: A People\u2019s History.\u201d Penny, who both admires and participates in Black Twitter, told CNN the project came along at a time when he was looking \u201cto chase that feeling of being scared again.\u201d \u201cI also wanted a project that wasn\u2019t gonna be compared immediately to what I had just done,\u201d Penny, whose recent credits include serving as the showrunner for the HBO comedy \u201cInsecure,\u201d said. \u201cThey brought me this article in the fall of 2021, and I was like \u2018I love Black Twitter. I would love to do something in this space.\u2019\u201d That article was a retrospective of Black Twitter, written for Wired by journalist Jason Parham, which serves as the foundation for the three-episode docuseries. Penny sees a connective thread from the civil rights era to Black Twitter. \u201cI think that\u2019s what Black Twitter became, a place to find community, which we always do, but find it digitally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re refining it in real life and doing the same things that were happening on Black Twitter, holding institutions accountable, holding the country accountable. We were just doing that in a different space.\u201d For all the seriousness, there is also comic relief. A perfect example is the \u201cMeet Me in Temecula\u201d saga. It all started on Christmas Day in 2014, when a Twitter user going by @SnottieDrippen tweeted a critique of Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant\u2019s performance in a game against the Phoenix Suns. Another user, @MyTweetsRealAF, took offense and before long the two were engaged in a debate on social media. @SnottieDrippen suggested they meet up in Temecula to settle the disagreement, launching a \u201cMeet Me in Temecula\u201d meme that became shorthand for online disagreements that spin out of control. The fact that one of the potential combatants actually tweeted that he had driven to Temecula proved to be the cherry on top and the whole thing was a rollicking good time, thanks to Black Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been in barbershops, we\u2019ve all been at cookouts and there\u2019s always the brother, the uncle, whoever who takes the hoop argument a little too far,\u201d TJ Adeshola, Twitter\u2019s former head of Global Content Partnerships, said in the docuseries. \u201cYou don\u2019t play for the Lakers, bro.\u201d Penny acknowledged he\u2019s seen some apprehension about the docuseries arise, on X, naturally, and understands the concern. \u201cI feel like because so much of Black culture has been not told by us, we\u2019re always very skeptical of things that have to do with us,\u201d Penny said. \u201cI totally understand that.\u201d He\u2019s confident the docuseries, like the voices who embody Black Twitter, will connect. \u201cI feel like Black Twitter is bigger than the platform now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the energy of the way Black people just move in the world with more power and with more emboldeness.\u201d \u201cBlack Twitter: A People\u2019s History\u201d debuts Thursday on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/entertainment/prentice-penny-black-twitter-docuseries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

He was 78. \u201cIt is with sad and heavy hearts that we convey to you the loss of internationally renowned, 6 time Grammy Award-winning, saxophonist, David Sanborn,\u201d reads a statement on his social media accounts. \u201cMr. Sanborn passed Sunday afternoon, May 12th, after an extended battle with prostate cancer with complications.\u201d Sanborn\u2019s publicist confirmed the accuracy of the post when reached by CNN. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, but continued performing until recently. \u201cIndeed he already had concerts scheduled into 2025,\u201d the statement concluded. \u201cDavid Sanborn was a seminal figure in contemporary pop and jazz music. It has been said that he \u2018put the saxophone back into Rock \u2019n Roll.\u2019\u201d Born in Tampa, Florida, Sanborn grew up in Missouri. He began playing the saxophone as part of his recovery after contracting polio at age three, according to his website. \u201cBy the age of 14, he was able to play with legends such as Albert King and Little Milton,\u201d it states in his biography on the site. \u201cDave went on to study music at Northwestern University before transferring to the University of Iowa where he played and studied with the great saxophonist JR Monterose.\u201d Sanborn went on to join the Butterfield Blues Band and played Woodstock with Paul Butterfield. His career took off and the saxophone player toured with Stevie Wonder, recording on Wonder\u2019s \u201cTalking Book\u201d album, playing with The Rolling Stones, and touring with David Bowie. Sanborn\u2019s solo on Bowie\u2019s \u201cYoung Americans\u201d was a stand out. His other collaborators include Paul Simon and James Taylor.

{"id": "2024_05_10_entertainment_interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review", "text": "After a dazzling first season, \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d moves in a lower-key mode through its second, a perhaps inevitable byproduct of Lestat\u2019s diminished role. Yet this AMC adaptation of Anne Rice\u2019s books remains a tasty trip through history and geography, having changed venues from New Orleans to Europe and the \u201cOld World Vampires\u201d on the prowl there. Although the logistics of an ageless vampire child weren\u2019t cited as the cause, the new season brings one major change, with Delainey Hayles sliding seamlessly into the role of Claudia (replacing Bailey Bass). Trapped forever in her youthful form, she accompanies Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) on his travels, and often drives the narrative with her desire for community. As for Lestat (Sam Reid), the conclusion of Season 1 largely confines his appearances to what\u2019s going on in Louis\u2019 head and flashbacks, though the nature of the show makes that a more effortless process than most. Indeed, despite the challenging task of turning Rice\u2019s books into an open-ended series, the framing device \u2013 as Louis and Armand (Assad Zaman) walk their human interviewer, Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian), through their bloody past \u2013 provides an opportunity to take off in all sorts of interesting directions and digressions. There\u2019s also some new blood (heh heh), as Claudia falls in with the Theatre des Vampires, whose leading man Santiago (Ben Daniels) brings an additional sense of menace as well as theatricality to the proceedings. A separate strand also beefs up Molloy\u2019s thread and backstory, including details about his earlier life that inform the perilous line he\u2019s walking in becoming Louis\u2019 skeptical biographer, with good reason to question what details his immortal subjects might be conspicuously omitting. Through the six episodes previewed, the story proceeds at a languid, almost dream-like pace, and while there\u2019s perhaps a little too much vampire theater, its contours remain engrossing in ways the 1994 movie wasn\u2019t, despite the starry pairing of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Thirty years have passed since then, but the series has still managed the difficult feat of putting its own distinctive stamp on the source material and justifying the vote of confidence AMC gave it by ordering a second season ahead of the first\u2019s debut. While vampires might have seemed like a no-brainer next step after AMC\u2019s long reliance on zombies, this version of \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d has found the right resting place, and the creative team has sunk its teeth into a concept that, against the odds, appears to be aging remarkably well. \u201cAnne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u201d begins its second season May 12 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC and AMC+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Here, it\u2019s an American podcaster invading a quirky Irish town, nosing around a cold case that yields a steadily diminishing drip from this Irish spring. Said podcaster Gilbert (Will Forte) comes with his share of baggage, as does Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), the investigative reporter grudgingly assigned to accompany him. They\u2019re joined by Emmy (Robyn Cara), a bright-eyed young researcher who looks up to Dove, which doesn\u2019t make the more seasoned journalist\u2019s treatment of her any less frosty. Indeed, Dove makes clear she feels like she\u2019s slumming in pandering to this request (order, actually) from her bosses to squire Gilbert through his mission, at least until they begin to chip away at the layers surrounding what might have happened to three people who disappeared a quarter-century earlier. As with \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and \u201cLocal Hero,\u201d there\u2019s an odd quaintness to the town Gilbert finds charming, but as is so often the case, the cheery exterior for tourists and rubes hides a darker underbelly. That includes guardedness toward outsiders that introduces a pinch of \u201cAn American Werewolf in London\u201d into the stew as well. Gilbert approaches the whole exercise from a very different perspective than Dove, who becomes engaged by the prospect of cracking the case, while he simply wants to put on a good show, prompting her to liken his work less to journalism than pornography. \u201cHe thinks Ireland is some kind of Disneyland,\u201d she grumbles, which is understandable given the \u201cDarby O\u2019Gill and the Little People\u201d setting, with even more heavy drinking and pounding hangovers. Forte is happily more subdued than he often tends to be, but Gilbert is still a reluctant sleuth, which makes Dove (played with a nicely crusty edge by Cullen, an Irish actor) the true driver of this story. Over the seven episodes, that arc becomes increasingly convoluted and a trifle far-fetched \u2013 not fatal flaws, but not helpful ones either. The Obamas\u2019 Higher Ground production company has become a prolific supplier to Netflix, from movies like \u201cLeave the World Behind\u201d to award-winning documentaries. Created by Jez Scharf, \u201cBodkin\u201d represents a low-key addition to that slate, but still makes for a passable binge; still, what looks like a distinctive show gradually blends into its saturated genre \u2013 less a commentary on true-crime podcasts than a reminder that even with series that start out well, there\u2019s not always a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. \u201cBodkin\u201d premieres May 9 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/bodkin-review-will-forte-obama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_entertainment_dark-matter-review-joel-edgerton", "text": "\u201cDark Matter\u201d takes another plunge into the madness of multiverses, operating on a more cerebral and down-to-earth level than the superhero epics that have explored it, from the \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d sequel to \u201cThe Flash.\u201d After an intriguing start, though, this Apple TV+ series merely sheds additional light on the difficulties of this narrative conceit, in what becomes a rather tedious contemplation of choices and roads not taken. Adapted by author Blake Crouch (whose page-to-TV credits include \u201cWayward Pines\u201d) from his novel, the story centers on Jason Dessen (\u201cThe Boys in the Boat\u2019s\u201d Joel Edgerton, living out the actorly dream of playing multiple versions of the same character), a physicist/professor seemingly living an idyllic life with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and teenage son (Oakes Fegley, who in his even-younger days fought \u201cThe War With Grandpa\u201d). Suddenly, Jason is not only abducted but replaced by a version of himself, having conjured a box that allows him to navigate between multiverses and an infinite assortment of possibilities, altered \u2013 sometimes dramatically, others almost imperceptibly \u2013 by individual choices and pivotal moments. Why this has happened \u2013 and what Jason can do to reclaim his life \u2013 presents what is at first an intriguing mystery, as well as a rumination on how one decision here or there can change our personal trajectory and relationships, coupled with broader questions of what the future might collectively hold. Once all that is established, though, \u201cDark Matter\u201d becomes less provocative over the course of its nine episodes, while embarking on a perhaps unavoidable series of tangents and detours that don\u2019t accomplish much more than killing time as Jason tries to work his way back home. The main problem, which nags at this entire subgenre of science fiction, is the sense that nothing really matters, since every new door/chapter \u2013 with doors that literally lead into alternate universes \u2013 feels as if it\u2019s just a step away from being rewritten or undone. As those scenarios and \u201cwhat ifs\u201d pile up, Jason\u2019s plight becomes as disorienting for the viewer as it is for him. \u201cDark Matter\u201d also has an overtly sentimental side in its rumination on what\u2019s important in life, which skews the story more toward Jason\u2019s particular journey than the jaw-dropping implications of what this portal to parallel worlds means (or could mean) for humanity. Apple has gambled on several ambitious science fiction projects of varying scope and scale, yielding mixed results, including \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d \u201cInvasion,\u201d \u201cConstellation,\u201d \u201cFoundation,\u201d \u201cSeverance\u201d (the true standout on this list) and \u201cSilo.\u201d \u201cDark Matter\u201d falls somewhere in the middle of that pack, which is to say, you ultimately won\u2019t miss all that much if you leave this door closed. \u201cDark Matter\u201d premieres May 8 on Apple TV+.

{"id": "2024_04_25_entertainment_challengers-review-zendaya", "text": "In tennis, \u201clove\u201d means nothing. Love also has little to do with \u201cChallengers,\u201d which uses the sport as the backdrop to serve up an elaborate, non-linear psychological triangle that proves twisty and enticing for much of the match, before double faulting by whiffing on the ending. Seduction and sex are again at the heart of this film from \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d director Luca Guadagnino, who also throws in twists of fate, paths not taken and \u2013 in the case of the central character played by Zendaya \u2013 a burning desire to win and exercise control over those around her, exploring how that elite-athlete mentality bleeds into her personal life. The framing device is a singles match between Art (\u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d Mike Faist), a decorated superstar who might be nearing the end, at least in his mind, of his tournament-winning career; and Patrick (\u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Josh O\u2019Connor), who arrives at the off-the-beaten-track tournament where they end up facing off in a run-down car that, his finances being what they are, doubles as his hotel room. Flashing back 13 years, we discover that the two were bosom pals as junior tennis players when they first set their eyes \u2013 springing out of their heads almost cartoon-like \u2013 on Tashi (Zendaya), a rising star whose game provokes as much lust from them as her striking looks. Back in the present, Tashi is Art\u2019s wife and coach, having lost her own career to a devastating knee injury. Yet it\u2019s pretty obvious that she\u2019s living through him \u2013 he addresses the point overtly, saying, \u201cI\u2019m playing for both of us\u201d \u2013 which only makes how she wound up with him, as well as the outcome of Art and Patrick\u2019s (very) protracted match, more intriguing. While sexual tension plays a central role in the movie (and certainly the marketing of it), \u201cChallengers\u201d is as much about blurring the lines between sex and the seductive power of big-time sports, with winning and success as the ultimate aphrodisiac. Add to that the two boys/men being pretty transparent about what they want, Tashi remains a source of mystery, in part because of the unscheduled detour her career has been forced to take. After his fine young cannibals romance \u201cBones and All,\u201d Guadagnino, working from a script by playwright Justin Kuritzkes, occupies more conventional and commercial territory here, while doing all he can to sex up how he films the tennis sequences. Despite the zooming angles and whizzing balls, there\u2019s no escaping the sheer abundance of those scenes, especially for anyone who has never sat through an entire US Open or Wimbledon final. Even using the sport as a metaphor, \u201cChallengers\u201d might become a bit of a challenge for those who show up eager to see the principals sweat for different reasons. Because she\u2019s playing more complicated angles, Zendaya\u2019s Tashi is the most interesting character as well as a source of frustration.

{"id": "2024_05_10_entertainment_young-sheldon-episode-12-shock", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The following contains spoilers about the May 9 episode of \u201cYoung Sheldon.\u201d Anyone who watched \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d with any regularity over its 12 seasons knew what was coming as its prequel \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d comes to a close, but the knock at the door that ended the most recent episode still felt like a gut punch. As the young Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) prepared to head off to college, he and his family learned that his father (Lance Barber) has died of a heart attack, the aftermath of which will be addressed in the two-part series finale on May 16. The moment seemed particularly cruel, inasmuch as the father, George Sr., had just been offered a long-sought opportunity to move up from coaching high school football into the college ranks, receiving an offer from Rice in Houston. \u201cWe always knew that there were a couple big moments that happened in Sheldon\u2019s life, his father passes away and he goes to Caltech,\u201d executive producer Steve Holland told CNN, adding that the decision was made to have that happen now \u2013 as opposed to during the final two episodes \u2013 so the characters could deal with its aftermath in the finale. According to Holland, series co-creator Chuck Lorre suggested that schedule of events, saying that after seven seasons of comedy (allowing for the occasional poignant moment), \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t want to leave the audience wallowing in grief at the end.\u201d The elder Sheldon (Jim Parsons) had referenced his father\u2019s death, and when it happened, during \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d although with the benefit of hindsight he wasn\u2019t always the most reliable narrator regarding his father and his perceived shortcomings \u2013 at least, based on how they played out in the second series. Although \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d is wrapping up, CBS viewers haven\u2019t seen the last of the Coopers: the network has ordered another spinoff, featuring the characters of Georgie (Montana Jordan) and Mandy (Emily Osment) for the 2024-25 TV season \u2013 \u201cGeorgie & Mandy\u2019s First Marriage\u201d \u2013 which merely adds to the needle-threading act performed by the producers. Still, any concerns about setting up what comes next didn\u2019t play into the \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d ending, Holland said, noting, \u201cWe were really just focused on ending this show as strong as we could.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/young-sheldon-episode-12-shock/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_entertainment_drew-barrymore-pets", "text": "Ask Drew Barrymore what breed of dog she would be were a canine and she doesn\u2019t even hesitate to answer. \u201cCorgi,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cNo question.\u201d And why a corgi? \u201cWell, my daughters and I love their fluffy butts,\u201d she said. \u201cI relate to the tiny legs and they\u2019re just so cute.\u201d The actor, producer and daytime talk show host is a pet mom to quite a crew: two dogs, four cats, a bearded dragon, a fish and a snake named Cecil, but with the \u201cc\u201d pronounced like a hard \u201cs\u201d as a snake would hiss. Barrymore adores animals. She said she wept the most writing her memoir \u201cWildflower\u201d when she shared a story about her beloved dog, Flossie, who lived to be almost 17. So, it made sense for Barrymore to partner with Ring for a new campaign announced Monday. \u201cRing Pet Portraits\u201d invites pet parents to join the company in raising funds for animal shelters in need by sharing their favorite pet videos and pictures. When people share a pet video or photo post on Instagram or TikTok using #RingPets through June 14, Ring will make a donation to support ASPCA\u00a0and local animal shelters across the US. Barrymore even filmed a commercial with her dog, Douglas, in support of the campaign (Jeremy, her bearded dragon, makes a cameo) in which she has to explain to her pup that she can\u2019t submit his photo because he\u2019s a \u201cnepo puppy.\u201d She recently lost her golden retriever, Lucy, a month ago, an experience Barrymore said \u201cwas so hard.\u201d \u201cThe whole show built like a memorial wall to her, which was so sweet. \u2018cause everyone in the building was so affected,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we all started in Covid, we weren\u2019t allowed to have guests or people. So, I would bring the dogs and they just made everything feel so much safer and cozier.\u201d Barrymore has been connected to animals almost since the beginning. She began her acting career as an infant and her first commercial was for a Purina puppy chow when she was a toddler. As a young adult she shared her home with cats and now as a 49 year-old mother of two young daughters her pets are a big part of the family. \u201cThere\u2019s just this like, unspoken relationship that you have this connection, this constant companion, this love that is just so profound,\u201d Barrymore said. \u201cMy dogs sleep in my bed with me and so do my cats and it makes me feel like a whole human being.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I won\u2019t sleep with my friends,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m weird about sharing a bed, but with my kids and animals, I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d She joked that she could have used a Ring camera on set as Lucy loved to wander around her daytime talk show. \u201cWe use cameras to watch babies. I certainly had many, many baby monitors,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God. Between the two kids. I felt like I was wrapped up in baby monitor cords. So yes, I\u2019m like, this totally makes sense.\u201d And while she loves the family she\u2019s built, Barrymore said she\u2019s not anxious to grow it. \u201cAfter we lost Lucy, the girls were like, we should get another dog for Douglas,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, another dog for Douglas will be my undoing. I can\u2019t do it right now.  I think it\u2019ll be a minute.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/entertainment/drew-barrymore-pets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review", "text": "Seven years after a trilogy that ended with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d didn\u2019t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it\u2019s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity \u2013 the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren \u2013 the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What\u2019s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) \u2013 an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom \u2013 attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (\u201cThe Witcher\u2019s\u201d Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing \u201cThe Planet of the Apes\u201d but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run. Hollywood blockbusters aren\u2019t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these \u201cApes\u201d prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don\u2019t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it\u2019s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d premieres May 10 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The \u201cSNL\u201d alum, who hosted for the third time on Saturday, came out to greet the audience after a delightful cold open during which the cast welcomed their real-life mothers onto the stage to tell jokes in honor of Mother\u2019s Day. After Rudolph said how honored she was to be hosting the Mother\u2019s Day episode, and mentioned her four children, cast members Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman came out to celebrate her return to the \u201cSNL\u201d stage.

Today we celebrate all kinds of mothers,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cStepmothers, godmothers, mothers from another brother, Dance Moms, Octomoms\u2026\u201d Chloe Fineman then stepped up with a teeny dog in her arms and asked, \u201cWhat about dog moms?\u201d Rudolph replied frostily, \u201cWhat about them? And honey, that\u2019s not a dog. That\u2019s a bitch.\u201d Her hilarious rapping went all over the place, mentioning some iconic \u201cSNL\u201d skits and characters like Coneheads and Mary Katherine Gallagher \u2013 as well as some of her own legendary impersonations of people like Donatella Versace. She also threw in some classic mom quotes, like, \u201cI will also turn this car around if you don\u2019t stop hitting your sister.\u201d Rudolph was a cast member on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d between 2000 to 2007.

{"id": "2024_05_06_entertainment_kendrick-lamar-drake-explainer", "text": "Two of hip-hop\u2019s biggest stars have beef and people are taking sides. Kendrick Lamar and Drake have been engaged in a lyrical battle in recent weeks that escalated over the weekend. The two artists each released songs about the other, in one case with Lamar not even waiting a full hour before he dropped a track in response to one of Drake\u2019s. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the verses that have been a hot topic of cultural conversation. Early collaborations There is plenty we don\u2019t know in terms of why there is apparent animosity between the two superstar rappers, but we do know that there is history. Back in 2011, Lamar appeared on Drake\u2019s second album \u201cTake Care\u201d on \u201cBuried Alive Interlude.\u201d It was the same year Lamar released his debut studio album \u201cSection.80.\u201d The two men were both carving a place for themselves in the industry at the time, with Drake then best known as an actor for his role as student Jimmy Brooks in the Canadian teen TV series, \u201cDegrassi.\u201d The pair would go on to tour together and collaborate on the track \u201cPoetic Justice\u201d on Lamar\u2019s sophomore studio album, \u201cGood Kid, M.A.A.D. City.\u201d \u201cKing of New York\u201d tries to take \u201cControl\u201d As one of hip-hop\u2019s rising stars, Lamar leaned into his growing success with the swagger one would expect in the rap game during a guest appearance on Big Sean\u2019s 2013 single, \u201cControl.\u201d Multiple artists are name-checked in the song, including Drake. The lyrics include, \u201cI got love for you all but I\u2019m tryna murder you,\u201d a euphemism for besting them professionally. Lamar proclaims himself both \u201cKing of New York\u201d and \u201cKing of the Coast.\u201d Drake told Billboard of the verse, \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anything to say about it.\u201d \u201cIt just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That\u2019s all it was,\u201d Drake said at the time. \u201cI know good and well that Kendrick\u2019s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.\u201d An \u2018Infinity War\u2019 of rappers The pair have continued to take shots at each other on tracks over the years, but this latest skirmish appears to have begun in October 2023, when rapper J. Cole collaborated with Drake on the song, \u201cFirst Person Shooter.\u201d On the track, Cole refers to himself, Lamar and Drake as the \u201cBig three\u201d in rap. Drake likened his own popularity in the game to the stardom of the late singer Michael Jackson. Lamar seemingly took exception to the comparisons and hit back on a collaborative track with Future and Metro Boomin that caught fire in March 2024, titled \u201cLike That.\u201d Lamar makes clear on the song that there is no \u201cBig three\u201d just \u201cBig me.\u201d He casts himself as Prince to Drake\u2019s Jackson, noting that the former outlived the latter. \u201cLike That\u201d is a cut on the album \u201cWe Don\u2019t Trust You,\u201d which many believe is filled with disses aimed at Drake. The apparent jabs surprised some listeners as Drake and Future have been longtime collaborators. Things got even more heated when Future and Metro Boomin released the followup \u201cWe Still Don\u2019t Trust You,\u201d which Billboard magazine declared is \u201cfilled with Drake disses, not only from Future, but from The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky as well.\u201d With so many coming after the Canadian rapper lyrically, it started feeling like Marvel Infinity War of hip-hop superheroes battling it out. The man who helped kick it all off, J. Cole, quickly exited the battle. Cole released \u201c7 Minute Drill\u201d on a surprise project \u201cMight Delete Later\u201d in which he came after Lamar, only to later declare the song lame. He removed it from streaming services, publicly apologized and has gone quiet since. Drake pushes back Last month, Drake dropped the diss track \u201cPush Ups\u201d in which he poked fun at Lamar\u2019s shoe size to his past collaborations with pop stars. \u201cMaroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\u201d Drake raps, appearing to mock Lamar\u2019s work with Maroon 5 on their song \u201cDon\u2019t Wanna Know\u201d and with Swift on her song \u201cBad Blood.\u201d Drake also took a swipe at Rick Ross, who was featured on \u201cWe Don\u2019t Trust You.\u201d Ross then began a social media war of words with Drake, which included accusing Drake of having undergone plastic surgery. K.Dot\u2019s onslaught Lamar, known also as K.Dot, responded with multiple volleys. First there was \u201cEuphoria,\u201d which is now as famous for the insults lobbed at Drake as it is for making the general public aware that the rapper was also an executive producer on the hit HBO drama. (HBO is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company.) Within days, Lamar followed that with \u201c6:16 in LA,\u201d which many interpreted to be making fun of Drake\u2019s penchant for titling songs with times and locations. Drake gets personal with \u201cFamily Matters\u201d Things got increasingly personally in this rap battle on Saturday, when Drake dropped the eight-minute diss track, \u201cFamily Matters.\u201d He makes allegations about abuse and infidelity involving Lamar and his fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Alford, on the song. Don\u2019t mess with a Pulitzer Prize winner Lest we forget that Lamar made history in 2018 by becoming the first rapper to win a prestigious Pulitzer Prize for his album \u201cDAMN,\u201d he didn\u2019t even let an hour go by after the release of \u201cFamily Matters\u201d to drop a response, titled \u201cMeet The Grahams.\u201d (Drake\u2019s legal name is Aubrey Graham.) The song gets heavy as Lamar addresses Drake\u2019s parents and Drake\u2019s parenting, accusing him of have a secret daughter. Lamar followed that within hours with another song, titled \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d in which accuses Drake of being attracted to underage girls. Drake responds Drake again had his say on Sunday with \u201cThe Heart Part 6.\u201d On this song, Drake claims he\u2019s the one who fed Lamar fake information about a secret child. \u201cWe plotted for a week and then we fed you the information/A daughter that\u2019s 11 years old, I bet he takes it,\u201d Drake raps. CNN has reached out to representatives for both artists for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/entertainment/kendrick-lamar-drake-explainer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_entertainment_jerry-seinfeld-tv-comedy-analysis", "text": "\u201cSeinfeld\u201d premiered 35 years ago on NBC, becoming one of the most popular sitcoms ever and making Jerry Seinfeld and creator Larry David insanely rich. In promoting his directing debut \u201cUnfrosted,\u201d Seinfeld has lamented the current state of TV comedy, in a way that identifies some modern challenges while ignoring the complexity of how times have changed. Seinfeld voiced those remarks to the New Yorker while making the rounds (he joked about the extent of that promotional tour on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d) to support the movie, which looks back at the creation of the Pop-Tart in the 1960s. Yet the comic\u2019s views of where comedy went wrong have an unavoidable \u201cOld man yells at cloud\u201d quality, not because the observations were entirely wrong but because of everything they overlook in oversimplifying and romanticizing the past. \u201cIt used to be you would go home at the end of the day, most people would go, \u2018Oh, \u2018Cheers\u2019 is on. Oh, \u2018M*A*S*H\u2019 is on. Oh, \u2018Mary Tyler Moore\u2019 is on. \u2018All in the Family\u2019 is on,\u2019\u201d Seinfeld told The New Yorker. \u201cYou just expected, there\u2019ll be some funny stuff we can watch on TV tonight. Well, guess what \u2013 where is it? This is the result of the extreme left and P.C. crap, and people worrying so much about offending other people. Now they\u2019re going to see standup comics because we are not policed by anyone.\u201d That\u2019s a lot to unpack, starting with singling out four of the best sitcoms ever, conveniently skipping all the lame ones that existed during those years.\u00a0 Similarly, people looking for something to watch when those shows premiered only received three broadcast networks and a handful of channels, before Fox, cable and premium TV, much less Netflix, streaming and a host of internationally produced imports. Yes, greater sensitivity among various constituencies \u2013 or \u201cPC crap,\u201d if Seinfeld prefers \u2013 has complicated the comedian\u2019s job. But one aspect of the past Seinfeld appears to long for is that people could be offended with little fear of consequences or reprisals because, well, where were they going to go? When the menu consisted of ABC, NBC and CBS, it\u2019s not like they had a lot of choices or alternatives. The mass-appeal comedies that Seinfeld cites were indeed great shows, but they have given way to a wider variety of series aimed at narrower tastes, scattered across a vast array of outlets. The result has been fewer traditional multi-camera sitcoms but more single-camera shows, including the broadcast hits \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d \u201cGhosts\u201d and \u201cYoung Sheldon,\u201d the last of which (spun off from \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d) will wrap its seven-season run this month. That doesn\u2019t even begin to scratch the surface of cable and streaming comedies, animated shows, international series that now reach US shores, and acclaimed series labeled \u201ccomedy\u201d that aren\u2019t really comedies at all, like \u201cThe Bear\u201d and \u201cBarry.\u201d Even taking Seinfeld\u2019s argument at face value, \u201cAll in the Family\u201d is the only one of the shows he mentioned that might have regularly run afoul of the comedy scolds to which he objects. As for standup comics, there has been an explosion of opportunities to get their material in front of the public he couldn\u2019t have imagined when he was breaking in sets on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d including the barrage of specials spilling out as part of the \u201cNetflix is a Joke\u201d festival. Granted, there\u2019s a long tradition of talent bemoaning how bad things have gotten since their heyday. Having recently turned 70, Seinfeld and the rest of the baby-boom generation have seen TV change in unrecognizable ways from the period during which he cut his professional teeth. While it might not be \u201cAll in the Family\u201d or \u201cMary Tyler Moore,\u201d there\u2019s still funny stuff to watch for a broader range of tastes, including those with the fortitude to sit through \u201cUnfrosted.\u201d All that\u2019s required is knowing where to look, and maybe, opening your eyes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/entertainment/jerry-seinfeld-tv-comedy-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Her sharp quips about the former NFL quarterback gained her thousands of new followers on Instagram and a hilarious appearance on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show.\u201d Glaser, however, is taking it all in stride. She\u2019s been doing standup long enough to know the ups and downs of the entertainment industry. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like when are people gonna get it? I\u2019m not one of those people.

I\u2019m not someone who\u2019s been waiting for this my whole life,\u201d Glaser told CNN in an interview this week. \u201cI mean, obviously this has been the goal to be beloved on this kind of scale, but it\u2019s also scary because when it comes on fast like this, you know, this kind of enthusiasm for someone lasts for a moment but can go away pretty quickly.\u201d Glaser said she knew Brady\u2019s \u201cGreatest Roast of All Time\u201d would land with viewers. \u201cI knew it was a home run and I knew that the event would be special because it was live,\u201d she said. \u201cI had hoped it would be number one on Netflix and that there would be viral moments, but I didn\u2019t think that I would be a big part of all that discussion.\u201d As the roast got closer, Glaser was ran her Brady jokes in up to four sets a night in Los Angeles, \u201cjumping from club to club.\u201d \u201cWorking with a team of writers, we would work during the day and then we would write in between shows and treat it like I was hosting an award show,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way I would do it if I got asked to host the Oscars, like it\u2019s that big of a deal.

{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling", "text": "Superhero movies have seen better days at the box office, but an action-comedy based on a 1980s TV show still feels like an unlikely candidate to kick off the summer. Buoyed by the lure of what Ryan Gosling can do for a post-\u201cBarbie\u201d encore (or Ken-core), \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d is too flat in the early going to fully meet that challenge, rallying toward the end without reaching the heights required to make a really big splash. At its best, director David Leitch (\u201cDeadpool 2\u201d) has served up a movie defined by its love for the movies, and specifically, the stunt work where he cut his professional teeth before shifting into the big chair. In that sense, the TV series that starred Lee Majors (a show most memorable for its theme song, which is featured) creates a very loose template to set up a vehicle about a stuntman whose troubles spill off the screen into real life, forcing him to put his skills to use dealing with real bad guys. Getting there requires some buildup, with Gosling\u2019s Colt Seavers introduced serving as the stunt double for a typically self-absorbed star, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), while becoming involved with Jody (Emily Blunt), a fellow member of the crew. An accident derails Colt\u2019s plans and indeed life, and time passes before he\u2019s called out of retirement by Gail (\u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham), the fast-talking, troubleshooting producer on all of Ryder\u2019s films. Of course, he\u2019d probably stay safely at home if the space epic in question didn\u2019t mark Jody\u2019s directing debut, offering the prospect of a reunion that, naturally, doesn\u2019t go as smoothly as he hoped. There are also hidden reasons for the renewed interest in Colt, which has to do with offscreen shenanigans and Ryder becoming involved with some nefarious characters. That forces Colt into what amounts to private-eye mode, using his movie-trained skills to get himself both into and out of perilous situations. Setting all that up, including the romance, results in some arid stretches between the elaborate stunts, which are ultimately the main source of \u201cThe Fall Guy\u2019s\u201d appeal and certainly its comedy. Gosling imbues Colt with a goofy charm and amusing neediness, but the underlying premise was a trifle strained even back in the Reagan era, and putting the whole thing on steroids for the movies doesn\u2019t completely address those issues. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d thus stands out primarily for smaller moments and wrinkles, such as Colt\u2019s boss (Winston Duke) constantly quoting movie lines to him, Taylor-Johnson sounding a whole lot like Matthew McConaughey, and a stunt dog trained to respond to French, including an especially juvenile command. Perhaps foremost, \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d feels burdened by the weight of expectations and its positioning as a major blockbuster when the movie really operates as a light-hearted ode to the unknown stuntman, in a way that\u2019s basically just amiably OK. Gosling has broad shoulders, but trying to make it anything more than that is, even for him, a heavy lift. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d premieres May 3 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_tattooist-of-auschwitz-review", "text": "Something as simple as a framing device elevates \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d \u2013 which stands out from a host of recent Holocaust tales \u2013 thanks in part to Harvey Keitel, starring as the elderly Lale Sokolov who recounts his remarkable story of life in a concentration camp to an unlikely interviewer. Jumping around in time, this British production captures the horror of that experience while finding notes of grace in its narrator\u2019s survival. That\u2019s in part because this six-part series is at its core a love story, unfolding under the most horrible of circumstances. Assigned to tattoo identification numbers on the arms of other prisoners, the the young Lale, or Lali (\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u2019s\u201d Jonah Hauer-King, who lost a noticeable amount of weight for the role), meets Gita (Polish actress Anna Pr\u00f3chniak) while in the camps, becoming almost instantly smitten. \u201cI want you to live to be an old man,\u201d Gita tells him at one point, a wish that seems all the more tenuous as he deals with the sadistic guards, while she grapples with illness and those around them keep meeting terrible ends. Their interactions take place tenderly against a backdrop of pain, suffering and the constant threat of quick and arbitrary death, which leads the elder Lali to be haunted by visions of those he knew and lost. In a stark device, the victims (and in some instances, perpetrators) appear to Lali, like photographs etched in his mind, as he grapples with those memories and feelings of survivor\u2019s guilt. His story pours out, gradually, to aspiring author Heather Morris (\u201cYellowjackets\u201d star Melanie Lynskey), who is understandably overwhelmed by this flood of memories. \u201cI haven\u2019t got long,\u201d Lali tells her, fueling her commitment to ensure his story gets told. As noted, there have been several recent productions dealing with similar material, including Netflix\u2019s \u201cAll the Light We Cannot See\u201d and Hulu\u2019s \u201cWe Were the Lucky Ones.\u201d On top of that, the 80th anniversary of D-Day is prompting an onslaught of documentary fare devoted to World War II. Nevertheless, \u201cTattooist of Auschwitz\u201d stands apart from the crowd, thanks in part to the quality of its performances, not just by documenting the barbarity of the Nazis but the sprigs of humanity that managed to bloom during the darkest of times. Featuring a new song from Barbra Streisand, the series closes with footage of the real Sokolov being interviewed. Those clips drive the point home, in a way that demonstrates why even for those resistant to sitting through another Holocaust drama, there ought to be room for a really good one. \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d premieres May 2 on Peacock.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/tattooist-of-auschwitz-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
