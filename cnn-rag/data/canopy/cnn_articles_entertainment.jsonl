{"id": "2024_06_04_entertainment_clipped-review-donald-sterling", "text": "In a rare victory for the Clippers over the Lakers, \u201cClipped\u201d is the second recent drama series devoted to one of Los Angeles\u2019 NBA teams but also the superior one, chronicling the spectacular fall of owner Donald Sterling. Rotating among four principal players, with Ed O\u2019Neill as Sterling, it\u2019s an all-star lineup covering a story filled with the kind of outlandish characters that require little embellishment. The title actually has multiple meanings, since audio clips of Sterling saying wildly racist things about Black people attending Clippers games figured prominently in his downfall. Yet \u201cClipped\u201d operates on four distinct if overlapping tracks, each nicely fleshed out and delineated over a relatively brisk six episodes. There\u2019s Sterling, obviously, whose imperious mentality toward his mostly Black players included parading his wealthy friends into the locker room to let them gawk at the athletes. In one of the creepier moments, he takes star Blake Griffin (Austin Scott) by the hand and leads him around, like a child, at a posh party the players uncomfortably attend. Still, the Sterling story really rests on the two key women in his life at the time: His wife, Shelly (Jacki Weaver), who had long put up with her husband\u2019s infidelities; and his assistant, V. Stiviano (Cleopatra Coleman), an aspiring reality TV star who became the featured player in a different kind of reality show by recording her boss, leading to the revelation of his ugly utterances to the world. Finally, there\u2019s Doc Rivers (Laurence Fishburne), the well-traveled coach who took the Clippers job well aware of the headwinds associated with its eccentric owner (\u201cI like a challenge,\u201d he explains early on). Even before the scandal erupted, Rivers had to deal with Sterling prefacing questions about personnel decisions with lines like, \u201cMy dermatologist says everybody\u2019s looking at this guy.\u201d While there\u2019s less basketball than \u201cWinning Time,\u201d HBO\u2019s series about the 1980s Lakers, \u201cClipped\u201d benefits from the fact so many of those involved with the Clippers during this stretch were so flat-out weird, no one more so than Sterling. (It\u2019s almost helpful to watch old clips of him to fully appreciate that O\u2019Neill\u2019s performance isn\u2019t a major exaggeration.) As for Stiviano, there\u2019s a certain poignance to her strangeness, recognizing the 80-year-old owner \u2013 nearly a half-century her senior \u2013 as a golden goose and ticket to where she longs to be, while watching Shelly fume when she cruises up to an event in her shiny Ferrari. Rivers, meanwhile, found himself in a particularly thorny situation as a Black man working for a demonstrable racist, desperately trying to hold his team together and stave off a walkout during a legitimate playoff run, while having TMZ loiter outside his door. Adapted from the ESPN podcast The Sterling Affairs under executive producer Gina Welch, and premiering a decade after the story broke as well as on the eve of the NBA Finals, the series also delves into the challenge facing the league. Sterling is shown dismissing the whole matter as \u201cA big nothing\u201d almost up to the moment when the NBA, under new commissioner Adam Silver, banned him and forced him to sell the franchise in 2014. Hulu has produced a lot of salacious true stories, but few better suited to the limited-series format than this. The Clippers still haven\u2019t won an NBA championship, but \u201cClipped\u201d takes the mess that Sterling unleashed and turns it into a solid-gold winner. \u201cClipped\u201d premieres June 4 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/entertainment/clipped-review-donald-sterling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Like Trudy Ederle swimming the English Channel, knowing where you\u2019re going, in this case, isn\u2019t as significant as the near-irresistible, awe-inspiring act of getting there. Granted, the title almost sounds like the marketing department threw in the towel on anything more appealing (its echoes of Ernest Hemingway notwithstanding), except that it\u2019s actually derived from the book, \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea: How Trudy Ederle Conquered the English Channel and Inspired the World,\u201d on which the film is based. In addition, the movie was originally destined to premiere on Disney+, until producer Jerry Bruckheimer (and according to the trade papers, positive audience testing) prompted the studio to give it a shot in the increasingly shark-infested theatrical waters, where its future appears uncertain. Wherever one sees it, \u201cYoung Woman\u201d possesses plenty of old-school charms, reflecting a triumph of the human spirit and endurance that (aided significantly by Amelia Warner\u2019s musical score) buoys the soul. In that regard it joins a long list of classic sports movies, perhaps even more than its recent cousins, the swim-themed Netflix film \u201cNyad\u201d and George Clooney\u2019s Olympic tale \u201cThe Boys in the Boat.\u201d Ridley has stayed busy in smaller films since her high-profile \u201cStar Wars\u201d stint, but few that showcase her innate likability better than this one. Then again, it\u2019s hard not to root for Trudy, born to German immigrant parents, who overcame measles as a child and the \u201cold ways\u201d insisted upon by her father (\u201cKilling Eve\u2019s\u201d Kim Bodnia) to become an Olympic-caliber swimmer, competing in the 1924 Games before undertaking the grueling 21-mile swim of the English Channel two years later. Ederle faced formidable tides in and out of the water, the latter in the form of overt sexism, offset by her steely mom (Jeanette Hain), supportive sister (Tilda Cobham-Hervey, who played Helen Reddy in \u201cI Am Woman\u201d) and demanding coach (Sian Clifford), as well as another swimmer (Stephen Graham) who recognizes her grit and potential. Norwegian director Joachim R\u00f8nning (\u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d) and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (2019\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d) both have Disney credentials, but \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d possesses the throwback feel of live-action fare that flourished long before fretting about theatrical windows became an overriding concern. The inevitable closing crawl and old newsreel footage merely adds heft to the story, in a way that feels a bit timelier 100 years after Ederle competed in the Olympics. Whether destined for consumption in a theater or via streaming, \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d is an exercise in the simple power of a well-told story, the kind that can wash over and uplift you all at once. \u201cYoung Woman the Sea\u201d premieres May 31 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_atlas-review-jennifer-lopez", "text": "Say what you want about Jennifer Lopez, but streaming algorithms surely love her, which accounts for her parade of recent movies \u2013 \u201cThe Mother\u201d (Netflix), \u201cShotgun Wedding\u201d (Amazon) and \u201cMarry Me\u201d (Peacock), all in the last two years. Add to that \u201cAtlas,\u201d a nonstop sci-fi action movie that basically gets the job done with a plot that recalls Disney\u2019s \u201cBig Hero 6,\u201d just with a lot more cursing. Although \u201cAtlas\u201d hinges on the now ever-popular \u201cartificial intelligence runs amok\u201d theme, that backdrop becomes a transparent excuse to set up a bonding exercise between Lopez\u2019s Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant data analyst who grew up with the AI robot Harlan (Simu Liu), who in turn has lead the rebellion against humanity. Atlas must then team up with another AI robot (voiced by Gregory James Cohan) in order to survive. The movie begins by racing through the devastating AI attack triggered by Harlan, before jumping 28 years into the future, when its title character gets recruited by a pair of military types (Mark Strong and Sterling K. Brown, both underemployed) regarding an opportunity to locate and stop him. After the obligatory chatter about her bad attitude and being ill-equipped for such a mission, she tags along, at which point the film becomes very Lopez-centric for an extended stretch. Of course, the idea of being forced to get to know the thing the protagonist hates and/or fears is a very old conceit, often explored through the prism of science fiction. In that respect, \u201cAtlas\u201d doesn\u2019t turn over new ground conceptually any more than it does with its robot design, which bears a strong resemblance to the oversized armored suits featured in \u201cAvatar\u201d or \u201cAliens,\u201d take your pick. Still, \u201cAtlas\u201d more than anything wants to operate as an action movie, and director Brad Peyton \u2013 a veteran of the Dwayne Johnson vehicles \u201cRampage,\u201d \u201cJourney 2: Mysterious Island\u201d and \u201cSan Andreas\u201d \u2013 keeps the story moving with a check-your-brain-at-the-door level of efficiency, relying on the shorthand of how familiar almost every beat of it feels. Netflix continues to lay down expensive bets on genre movies, with Zack Snyder\u2019s two-part \u201cRebel Moon\u201d among the more prominent recent examples. For her part, Lopez steps into a slightly different role \u2013 and wisely away from another rom-com \u2013 in her dual capacity as producer and star. While it\u2019s not entirely clear how the math works out on that, one needn\u2019t be a particularly brilliant data analyst to identify the boxes Netflix is hoping to check with the J-Lo + sci-fi equation. \u201cAtlas\u201d premieres May 24 on Netflix.

When time came for Gyllenhaal to help cast the upcoming Apple TV+ series \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d in which he stars and serves as an executive producer, he knew that Sarsgaard \u2013 who is married to his sister, actor and director Maggie Gyllenhaal \u2013 would be a perfect fit for one of the roles. \u201cPeter is such an incredible actor because he demands, in the space of acting or in the scene, a type of honesty and I think that\u2019s the same thing he asks for as a person,\u201d Gyllenhaal said in a recent interview with CNN. \u201cThe fictional world that you\u2019re working in on a project is a whole other thing, and it\u2019s a craft and it\u2019s something that we gratefully know very well.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m a little bit of a different version of myself when I\u2019m working in general,\u201d Sarsgaard said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to meet in a different place like that with someone that you know so well in your life, and we\u2019ve done a number of things together but it\u2019s not a lot of overall time.\u201d \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d is an eight-part miniseries based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Scott Turow, which was previously adapted into a 1990 feature film starring Harrison Ford. It\u2019s a courtroom thriller that follows Rusty Sabich (Gyllenhaal), a Chicago-based prosecutor who becomes entangled in the horrific murder of one of his colleagues. While the pair of brothers-in-law \u2013 who previously costarred in various films including 2005\u2019s \u201cJarhead,\u201d 2007\u2019s \u201cRendition\u201d and 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Guilty\u201d \u2013 enjoy banter offscreen, in \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard\u2019s characters find themselves at odds, as Sarsgaard plays another prosecutor in Sabich\u2019s office who suspects his colleague of wrongdoing. But when the cameras are off, according to Gyllenhaal, they both agree that family always comes first. \u201cI think most important to both of us, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say this, is our family and loving them and protecting them and being there for them and it takes priority over everything,\u201d he said. The Gyllenhaal siblings previously costarred in the beloved 2001 psychological thriller \u201cDonnie Darko,\u201d among other projects, and Sarsgaard starred in \u201cThe Lost Daughter\u201d in 2021, which his wife directed. The group will continue to keep things all in the family when Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard will reunite on Maggie Gyllenhaal\u2019s next directorial endeavor \u201cThe Bride!\u201d in 2025, according to Collider.

{"id": "2024_05_31_entertainment_the-great-lillian-hall-review-jessica-lange", "text": "Jessica Lange met the movie public perched in King Kong\u2019s giant palm, but her real breakthrough came in 1982 when she played a pair of actresses, earning Oscar nominations for both roles: as a fictional soap-opera star in \u201cTootsie\u201d and the real-life Frances Farmer in the tragic biography \u201cFrances\u201d (she won a statuette for the former). In a way, Lange\u2019s storied career comes full circle with \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall,\u201d playing an aging Broadway star in a movie HBO acquired and is premiering on the final day of Emmy eligibility, no doubt hoping that there are additional accolades, and perhaps awards hardware, in her future. As a format, the TV movie has surely seen better days (limited series have largely supplanted them), and \u201cLillian Hall\u201d is a modestly scaled production, punctuated by a trio of female leads: Lange as the title character, billed as \u201cthe first lady of the American theater;\u201d Kathy Bates as her loyal assistant; and Lily Rabe (like Lange, a veteran of producer Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d repertory company) as her daughter. While rehearsing for a play with an avant-garde director (Jesse Williams), Lillian begins forgetting lines and experiencing other memory lapses, clear signs that she might be in the early throes of dementia. Her first reaction, though, leans toward denial, then defiance, while gradually triggering uncertainty for those around her about a show that suddenly might be as difficult to put on with her as without her. Directed by Michael Cristofer from Elisabeth Seldes\u2019 screenplay, the film doesn\u2019t turn over new ground but nevertheless yields poignant moments, primarily in the interplay between Lange \u2013 a fierce lioness in winter, hungry for one more curtain call \u2013 and Bates, who could play this part in her sleep and still makes the most of it. \u201cWill you remind me who I was?\u201d Lillian asks, a line that beautifully captures the fear associated with her condition. Although Lange has kept busy working for Murphy in recent years \u2013 including her turn as another actor, Joan Crawford, in \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan,\u201d about the rivalry between Crawford and Bette Davis \u2013 the new film feels like a nice bookend to those earlier roles. At the same time, \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall\u201d operates as a love letter to the theater while catering to those who can appreciate an \u201cAll About Eve\u201d reference or two. \u201cI am not some broken-down old Chevy,\u201d Lillian rages at one point. The movie works hard to reinforce that message by providing Lange with a worthy showcase, in a vehicle that might be light on horsepower but feels as polished as its central character. \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall\u201d premieres May 31 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

{"id": "2024_06_06_entertainment_house-of-the-dragon-season-2-review", "text": "If the first season of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d challenged viewers with its dizzying list of introductions and disorienting time jumps, the second involves a more straightforward build-up toward a great civil war, where strategy often takes a back seat to vengeance and emotion. Still not the series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was, this prequel now mirrors its barbaric take on palace intrigue well enough to have become bloody good. Once again, the battle for the throne has \u201cYou win or you die\u201d stakes, pitting Queen Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy), her uncle/husband Daemon (Matt Smith) and their assorted forces against Rhaenyra\u2019s childhood friend Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and her sons (who happen to be Rhaenyra\u2019s half-siblings), one of whom, Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), currently claims their late father\u2019s mantle. Living up to the show\u2019s title, both sides of this Targaryen-on-Targaryen faceoff have an arsenal of dragons, which amount to a version of air power in these medieval times, and an almost nuclear-style deterrent against ill-thought-out behavior. While the dragons took a while to grow into players in the original series, here they figure prominently in calculations about military action and seldom disappoint once unleashed. In that sense, while other series have sought to match \u201cThrones\u201d in conjuring spectacle and grandeur (none more so than \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, whose deficiencies owe more to character and story), little on television can truly rival \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u2019s\u201d scope and scale. Happily, under executive producer Ryan Condal (who shares \u201ccreated by\u201d credit with author George R.R. Martin), the new season feels cleaner and more tightly focused, despite juggling existing players while adding a few key new ones. At its core, the women still hold the center, as the initially grieving Rhaenyra must deal with the headstrong Daemon, while Alicent and her father, Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), struggle to manage Aegon, another weak, erratic ruler prone to actions and decisions that risk undermining their cause. HBO made four episodes available, or half of this season, and they certainly don\u2019t rush things in setting up the chess pieces. Still, each hour contains at least one jaw-dropping moment, clearing the high bar set by the pilot episode\u2019s child-birth sequence with this season\u2019s not-for-the-faint-of-heart first episode, which nicely sets the table for much of what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe path to victory now is one of violence,\u201d the Hand to the King, Hightower, muses with grave seriousness. As the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d series, \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d reminds us, going back in time (in \u201cDragon\u2019s\u201d case, about two centuries) in some respects means starting from scratch, at least developing audience allegiance to the characters and keeping track of elaborate timelines and mythologies. After a somewhat rocky takeoff, \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d has seemingly reached its cruising altitude, while continuing to take big creative swings. Although the Emmy-winning \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d might not have stuck the landing, that clearly did little to dampen demand for its muscular, visceral brand of storytelling. Prosecuting the Targaryen war comes with risks, both for those in the show and those responsible for making it. For now, though, this has become a genuinely worthy successor, allowing those with a taste for the wickedness of Westeros to kick back and enjoy the ride. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d begins its second season June 16 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

Yet unlike its companion \u201cJeopardy!,\u201d which went through a long process replacing the late Alex Trebek, \u201cWheel\u201d figures to keep rolling along without much of a hitch, a sign of how the two long-running game shows differ. Both programs were created by Merv Griffin, who became fabulously wealthy thanks to their command of the hour leading into prime time on TV stations across the country. They thrived, however, for fundamentally different reasons, as anybody who ever watched \u201cWheel\u201d with an elderly grandparent can probably attest. \u201cJeopardy!\u201d was the smart show, the one where viewers might be able to answer some of the questions, but probably not as well as the winning contestants. Trebek captured that with a sly wit and suave demeanor, creating the impression that he knew all the answers \u2013 or rather, questions \u2013 even if that wasn\u2019t necessarily so. \u201cWheel,\u201d by contrast, caught on because of its simplicity, and like a lot of TV game shows, the rather smug sense of superiority the audience could hold toward many of the players. \u201cSeriously, you couldn\u2019t solve the puzzle with only three letters missing, all of them vowels? You deserve not to win that money!\u201d Sajak reinforced that by hosting the show with what felt like an arched eyebrow, while engaging in interactions with contestants that were frequently playful, if occasionally, particularly in recent years, a trifle odd. The mini-controversies included moments where he crankily snapped at players, and in 2023, awkwardly tried to put one in a headlock after he said he was a wrestler. Sajak was working as a TV weatherman in Los Angeles when Griffin hired him to take over \u201cWheel,\u201d replacing Chuck Woolery in 1981. Blessed with a high profile thanks to the show, CBS even hired him to host a late-night program in 1989, in a direct challenge to Johnny Carson\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d \u201cThe Pat Sajak Show\u201d lasted a little more than a year, offering a pretty good demonstration of the adage, \u201cDon\u2019t quit your day job.\u201d The tandem of \u201cWheel\u201d and \u201cJeopardy!\u201d nevertheless remained a well-oiled moneymaking machine. Beneficiaries included the family-run company that distributed the shows, King World, which also held sway over TV stations by selling rights to \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show.\u201d (Run by brothers Roger and Michael King, CBS acquired the company for $2.5 billion in 2000, and Griffin\u2019s company is now owned by Sony Pictures.) Sajak will be replaced by Ryan Seacrest, who has come as close as anyone to replicating the genial on-air persona of another game-show icon, Dick Clark, who, as host and producer, represented another conspicuous tie to a bygone era. Co-host Vanna White, meanwhile, continues with the show, providing an element of continuity beyond the game itself. In 2023, CBS renewed \u201cWheel\u201d and \u201cJeopardy!\u201d for five years, through the 2027-28 TV season, extending their longtime deal with ABC stations in major cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Even amid turmoil and change for the TV industry, \u201cWheel\u201d still averages more than 8 million viewers each week, ranking behind only \u201cJeopardy!\u201d among syndicated shows.

{"id": "2024_05_29_entertainment_eric-review-benedict-cumberbatch", "text": "Weird, dark but compulsively watchable, \u201cEric\u201d stars Benedict Cumberbatch and a hulking foul-mouthed puppet, not necessarily in that order. Set amid a dystopian vision of a dangerous, corrupt 1980s New York, it\u2019s part mystery, part satire and part right-wing fever dream about crime-infested cities, powered by the parental nightmare fuel of a missing child. That child is nine-year-old Edgar (Ivan Howe), whose father, Vincent (Cumberbatch), is the cranky, authority-flouting creator and lead puppeteer behind a popular children\u2019s show, \u201cGood Day Sunshine.\u201d The title and occupation both prove ironic, given that everything about the show is awash in grime and darkness, including the constant bickering between Vincent and his wife Cassie (Gaby Hoffmann), trapped in a broken marriage that isn\u2019t lost on their son. When Edgar abruptly goes missing, both parents blame Vincent, who becomes convinced his child\u2019s drawings of an ogre-like puppet named Eric are somehow the key to finding him. As Vincent turns to self-medication to ease his anxiety and guilt, Eric appears to him, and him alone, ostensibly to help him locate the boy. However, talking to an invisible creature \u2013 whose language would make the \u201cAvenue Q\u201d gang blush \u2013 isn\u2019t necessarily the way to win the trust of those around him, including Vincent\u2019s work partner Lennie (Dan Fogler), whose efforts to cover for Vincent\u2019s bad and erratic behavior face growing strain. The other major strand of \u201cEric,\u201d created by Welsh writer Abi Morgan (\u201cThe Iron Lady\u201d), involves the detective (McKinley Belcher III) assigned the case, a closeted Black man dealing with a racist and homophobic police department. In addition, there\u2019s the matter of a missing Black teenager \u2013 whose story, notably, hasn\u2019t received nearly as much media attention \u2013 creating the possibility that Edgar\u2019s disappearance might be somehow linked to a sordid web of child exploitation and trafficking. While Cumberbatch (whose recent dances with Netflix include \u201cPower of the Dog\u201d and \u201cThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\u201d) nails his performance as a guy slowly unraveling, the police investigation and its various twists, turns and red herrings animate \u201cEric,\u201d figuratively and literally. Through its six-episode run, Morgan impressively weaves in peripheral characters and seemingly minor players in unexpected ways. In this iteration of New York, nobody is above suspicion, the wealthy and influential \u2013 a roster that includes Vincent\u2019s well off and politically connected family \u2013 are the real monsters, and almost everyone gives the impression of being guilty of something. At times \u201cEric\u201d feels so relentlessly grim as to become almost oppressive, feeding the popular impression of New York (especially during the period in question) as a modern-day dystopia. The payoff, however, reveals method in that madness, in a way that brings the discordant elements together \u2013 with a few hiccups \u2013 in surprisingly effective fashion. Eric might need somebody to pull his strings, but give credit to \u201cEric\u201d \u2013 especially considering the challenging nature of the concept \u2013 for so effectively tying those threads together. \u201cEric\u201d premieres May 30 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/eric-review-benedict-cumberbatch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_baby-reindeer-you-stalking-netflix-cec", "text": "With Netflix\u2019s \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d captivating audiences \u2014 nearly 60 million viewers watched it in its first month \u2014 and the fifth and final season of \u201cYou\u201d set to release this year, stories about stalkers have clearly struck people\u2019s attention. But some experts warn that what you see on your screen isn\u2019t always representative of reality. Many Hollywood-ified dramatizations lean into storylines of extreme behaviors and sometimes don\u2019t include appropriate warnings, leading to misconceptions about what stalking actually is. For some victims, this could lead to more harm than good. Real-life stalking, experts say, can be more subtle than what is usually portrayed in popular media \u2014 though just as damaging and dangerous. How stalking is portrayed in popular media \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is a dramatized version of real events that happened to series creator and actor Richard Gadd. In the show, Gadd\u2019s character, Donny, meets Martha at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. The TV series \u201cYou,\u201d based on the 2014 novel of the same name, follows the perspective of stalker Joe Goldberg as he tracks, manipulates and murders his victims, often using romance and his good looks as a lure. Forensic psychologist Dr. Lorraine Sheridan says stalking is not always the cookie-cutter formula audiences are enthralled by. \u201cA lot of it (the media) is all killer, no filler. You don\u2019t get the more mundane aspects of stalking. You just get the really, really dramatic bits,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cThat means it is often quite misrepresented because the everyday, boring, hideous, demeaning, fear-inducing \u2014 but ultimately kind of predictably miserable \u2014 aspects of stalking does not make good TV.\u201d Gadd\u2019s story is real, but he says the version that appears in \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. \u201cI\u2019ve put out a statement publicly saying I want the show to be received as a piece of art, and I want the show to people (sic) to enjoy as a piece of art,\u201d Gadd told The Hollywood Reporter, speaking about those who aim to find the show\u2019s real life counterparts. \u201cI\u2019m called Donny Dunn. It exists in a sort of fictional realm, even though it\u2019s based on truth, it exists in a fictional realm, let\u2019s enjoy the world that I\u2019ve created.\u201d \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d comes with a standard post-credits disclaimer that says, \u201cThis program is based on real events; however certain characters, names, incidents, locations and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.\u201d One notable change is in the show: Martha is charged with three counts of harassment and stalking, found guilty and sent to prison. In real life, Gadd says the legal situation with his stalker was simply \u201cresolved.\u201d Stalking has always been a subject of popular media, even before many viewers can grasp the actual concept, since so much of it appears in content aimed at young people. In \u201cTwilight,\u201d the main character Edward breaks into his school crush Bella\u2019s room to watch her sleep. In \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d Emilio Estevez\u2019s character follows Andie MacDowell\u2019s character across town to crash her and her boyfriend\u2019s vacation. These representations can lead to confusion about what is stalking and what is romantic, according to the Stalking Prevention, Awareness and Resource Center (SPARC), which issued a discussion guide in 2019 that noted, \u201cRomantic films often include protagonists who are \u2018guys like Joe (Goldberg),\u2019 ones who stop at nothing to get the girl. Usually there is no negative consequence for their actions \u2014 in fact, the stalking is successful, and they persuade their initially reluctant romantic interests that they should be together.\u201d For its part in reducing victim blaming, Sheridan says that \u201cYou\u201d makes viewers \u201cquestion ourselves and (it) demonstrates how we can get taken in by somebody who is so cruel, selfish, sadistic and evil.\u201d Stalkers don\u2019t only take the shape of dashing, cunning men. In \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d Gadd\u2019s stalker is portrayed as unattractive and mentally ill \u2014 someone whom her victim actually feels sorry for. While both male and female fictional stalkers are portrayed as dangers, Sheridan notes\u00a0 that, typically, only women stalkers are portrayed in a way that gives audiences license to laugh and ridicule them. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth noting those more nuanced, less sensational, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to do something about this\u2019 kind of pieces of media (like \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cLover Stalker Killer\u201d) are both showing men as the victims,\u201d said Dana Fleitman, a SPARC training and awareness specialist. \u201cWhen we see women as victims, it is often on other networks that are a lot more campy (and) sensational.\u201d While 1 in 3 women will experience stalking in their lifetime, 1 in 6 men will as well, making it not a fully gendered issue. Some argue that stories where males are the victims may lend extra legitimacy to the problem. Anna Nasset, a stalking survivor and founder of Stand-Up Resources, watched \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d upon the recommendation of her colleagues and thought the show was \u201creally good.\u201d \u201cHaving the male victim in \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is going to do more than if the gender was switched. It just is,\u201d Nasset said. \u201cI hate to say it that way, but I think there\u2019s still that narrative of \u2018Well, this is just part of being a woman, this what you get!\u2019 Media portrayals of stalking aren\u2019t always accurate Media representations can also cause victims to believe they are not actually being stalked if\u00a0 their situation doesn\u2019t seem as severe as what they see on screen. \u201cStalking is very underreported and under-identified and so people kind of think they know what it is, but they\u2019re actually very unlikely to have received any sort of formal or real education on it. So, where are we learning what stalking is? It\u2019s often from these (media) misrepresentations,\u201d Fleitman said. Fleitman believes these dramatizations cause the public to confuse stalkers with sexy, romantic and heroic leads (much like Edward Cullen of \u201cTwilight\u201d) and think real-life victims are overreacting to a harmless, awkward attachment. With the exclusion of a US National Stalking Hotline and stalking public service announcements, Fleitman wishes there were more content warnings and resources around stalker-centered media so that audiences and organizations didn\u2019t have to do the bulk of the work. \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d rated TV-MA by Netflix for \u201clanguage, nudity, sex, sexual violence, substances,\u201d only has a viewer discretionary warning before \u201cEpisode 4\u201d wherein Gadd\u2019s character is sexually assaulted. In the series finale, the resource, wannatalkaboutit, pops up in the credits. Created by Netflix, it includes round tables and discussions guides of other Netflix shows and films, links to resources such as the National Suicide Hotline, Crisis Text and the Domestic Violence Hotline. Information is also available on sexual assault, sexual violence and relationship abuse. Yet no mention of stalking, despite it being the main subject matter of the show. Neither Netflix nor the \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d teams responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Nasset echoes that educating people about stalking is difficult but believes \u201cwe\u2019re on track\u201d to be able to have more public awareness around stalker-centered media, noting that content warnings or PSAs around sexual violence, which are now common, were rare as recently as 10 to 20 years ago. Fletiman calls stalking shows without PSAs and resources \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Sheridan argues that such efforts at public awareness are important, and reflect changing outlooks on what issues are worth talking about. \u201cI love the way the young people are standing up. I don\u2019t see it that they\u2019re soft and easily offended. I\u2019m seeing they\u2019re just not going to take that crap anymore and I\u2019m loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the PSAs, all the content warnings, bring it on. Because that comes with an opportunity for education as well.\u201d Fleitman also believes these stories have an opportunity: \u201cI think that the media can be a really good starting place for discussion, for learning, for empathizing with victims and survivors (and) for understanding stalking, but only if it\u2019s used that way.\u201d she said. The realities of stalking Stalkers are often imagined as hooded strangers in a secret lair but the reality is less dramatic \u2014 though just as scary. According to Fleitman, stalkers are more likely to be a current or past partner or acquaintance \u2014 a situation represented in both \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and \u201cYou.\u201d Stalking is about scaring or upsetting somebody, she says. SPARC defines stalking as \u201ca pattern of behavior directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress.\u201d Although the definition varies for different areas, Sheridan hopes to defy its notorious murkiness. \u201cA lot of things are hard to define. The bloody weather is hard to define, and people know what that is,\u201d she said. Fleitman hopes \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d can raise awareness for stalking victims, like men and so-called \u201cimperfect victims\u201d whose stories may not look like the ones we\u2019re used to seeing. The term \u201cimperfect victim\u201d refers to people who may be seen by those outside of the situation as not doing enough to prevent their abusers\u2019 actions \u2014 in some cases, they are even accused of doing something themselves to incite the stalker, such as not establishing boundaries or sharing too much private information. Fleitman said what someone chooses to share on the Internet can be seen as the new \u201cwell, what were you wearing?\u201d when it comes to stalking. The narrative enforces that victims are to be seen as blameless and innocent with no prior indiscretions of their own. Nasset often gets called a \u201cperfect victim\u201d because she was quick to report her situation to law enforcement, but she thinks the moniker is a \u201chorrible term.\u201d \u201c[A] stalker is going to do what the stalker is going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re trying to bargain with them or be nice to them, [it\u2019s] not necessarily going to change the trajectory.\u201d In fiction, stalking may make for tense drama, but in reality it is so insidious that it is often called \u201cslow motion homicide.\u201d And, indeed, stalking often ends with violence and death. 76% of intimate partner femicides included stalking in the year prior to their death and stalking increases the risk of intimate partner homicide by three times, according to SPARC. Nasset\u2019s stalker is currently serving 10 years in prison after being sentenced in 2019. He was a stranger who hung around her art gallery and began stalking her in 2011. Stalking is illegal in all US states and territories, but the topic is still under-researched and awareness resources are scant. In fact, stalking first became a crime in the US less than 35 years ago \u2014 in 1990 in the state of California. In Edinburgh, Scotland, where \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d takes place, harassment laws weren\u2019t introduced until 1997 before being amended in 2010 to more accurately reflect stalking\u2019s danger, validity and to call it out by name. This was just five years before the real-life Martha started stalking Gadd and four years before \u201cYou\u201d hit shelves in its first novel incarnation. While stalking makes for compelling storylines, the real-life issue is difficult to navigate. Representation in TV shows or movies could change this for the better by raising awareness about the nuances of predatory behavior. Or, it could perpetuate outdated and dangerous ideas about what stalking really is.

{"id": "2024_06_07_entertainment_run-lola-run-25-years-multiverse-movie", "text": "Listen up, Marvel Cinematic Universe. Twenty-five years ago, a small, low-budget German film by the name of \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d took the world by storm. Looking back, its director sees parallels between his visionary movie and the multiverse films that have become tentpole blockbusters today. Starring a magenta-haired Franka Potente, \u201cLola\u201d follows the titular heroine as she must race across Berlin to help her lackey mobster boyfriend (Moritz Bleibtreu) out of a life-threatening bind\u2026 and somehow find 100,000 Deutsche Marks along the way. One of the principal aspects of the film that makes it so special is how it\u2019s divided into three parts, vignettes that re-imagine Lola\u2019s predicament and follow her along a slightly different chain of events, each leading to a drastically different outcome. \u201cThe whole idea that you start from the same moment again, and you create a parallel universe\u201d was at the core of his film, \u201cLola\u201d director Tom Tykwer said in a recent interview with CNN. And while he made the distinction that \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d is a film in which each vignette ends and \u201cresets\u201d the story \u2013 instead of coexisting with the alternative stories that follow \u2013 when asked if he thought the whole multiverse trend began around the time of his film, Tykwer replied, \u201cConceptually, yes.\u201d Just like in more recent multiverse movies like \u201cInto the Spider-Verse\u201d or \u201cDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,\u201d each universe or vignette shares certain similarities. In \u201cLola\u2019s\u201d case, the most significant similarity is an animated sequence toward the beginning of each vignette \u2013 or \u201croute,\u201d as Tykwer refers to them \u2013 when she runs down the stairwell of her building and encounters a neighbor in a doorway with a vicious-looking dog. It is the subtle differences of that early interaction that set each version of Lola\u2019s story in new directions Tykwer said he always envisioned that particular sequence as being animated. \u201cIt was always amusing and fun to imagine that the first detour that each route takes is coming from animation, because animation is the closest to \u2013 in film \u2013 the closest to directly translated imagination,\u201d he said. Another parallel \u201cLola\u201d shares with some of the bigger movies of today is the exceptional physical demands it put on its star, Potente. While most actors might train for a role to optimize their physique and appearance for the benefit of the camera \u2013 think Hugh Jackman for his portrayal of the muscly mutant Wolverine, or Henry Cavill for \u201cThe Witcher\u201d \u2013 and actually lose their progress and stamina while shooting the film itself, Potente is seen running at a fast clip for an astounding amount of screen time in \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d (hence the title). Surprisingly though, the actress \u2013 who has gone on to appear in the \u201cBourne\u201d film franchise opposite Matt Damon and as the Season 2 villain in \u201cClaws,\u201d among many other credits \u2013 does not consider that shoot from early in her career as one of the most grueling. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t in any shape. I probably, to be very honest with you, (am in) way better shape right now than I was then,\u201d Potente said, adding that she was a smoker at the time. \u201cI mean, Jesus. But I was young.\u201d She also mentioned how in early talks with Tykwer, the director told her he \u201cdid not want somebody who looked like a like an ultra runner.\u201d \u201cThat would have turned a lot of things upside down about the film. I think it was about this person that in that very moment, wearing Dr. Martens, just decides to be self-reliant and go,\u201d Potente continued. \u201cAnd that was really important to come across. So there was no training involved.\u201d \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d races back into movie theaters nationwide on Friday, June 7 with a restored 4K print, in honor of the 25th anniversary of its release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/entertainment/run-lola-run-25-years-multiverse-movie/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The result has that calculated, tired feel about it, with a few moments of kinetic action but not enough to make the film play like anything more than a relic. On the plus side, Smith and Martin Lawrence, now in their 50s, still credibly pull off their characters, although frankly, the most memorable action scene \u2013 so good it seems to have parachuted in from another movie \u2013 doesn\u2019t involve them. Everything else about this reunion, including their old-married-couple squabbling and the various callbacks to previous films, has a perhaps inevitably stale quality, from the strains of the familiar song to the bikini-clad background actors the camera scans by to reflect the Miami locale. \u201cBad Boys\u201d begins with Smith\u2019s Mike settling down and Lawrence\u2019s Marcus experiencing a near-death scare that changes his outlook \u2013 a comedic flourish that, like almost everything else, proves underdeveloped. The latest threat, meanwhile, comes by way of a case their late captain (Joe Pantoliano) had investigated involving drug cartels and a ruthless killer (Eric Dane, here portraying the kind of stock villain that might as well be called McBaddie), exposing a web of corruption that forces Mike to reconnect with his son Armando (Jacob Scipio) and the buddy cops to go on the run. Back in the saddle after \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (Michael Bay having established the template on the first two movies), directing team Adil & Bilall don\u2019t scrimp on action and stunts, and unlike the movie they helmed in between, the much-discussed and lamented \u201cBatgirl,\u201d at least this film is getting released. That said, their efforts to bring a hyper-cinematic quality to the action yields a mixed bag, including a sequence that resembles a first-person shooter game. Despite all the blood, the comedy quotient in Chris Bremner and Will Beall\u2019s screenplay also qualifies as being largely anemic. The supporting players, similarly, have relatively little to do, including returnees Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Paola Nu\u00f1ez, a fleeting cameo by Tiffany Haddish, and a puzzling, wasted role for Rhea Seehorn (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d). In a classic example of bad-guy dialogue, Dane\u2019s character mutters after a failed attempt to eliminate Mike and Marcus, \u201cThese guys just refuse to die.\u201d The fourth \u201cBad Boys\u201d might not be enough to kill them, but it does suggest they should emulate much of the Florida population and, when it comes to the buddy-cop biz, consider retiring. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d premieres June 7 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/entertainment/bad-boys-ride-or-die-review-will-smith-martin-lawrence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_05_entertainment_checkpoint-zoo-joshua-zeman-russia-ukraine-war", "text": "Filmmaker Joshua Zeman didn\u2019t tell his parents that he was traveling to Ukraine in the fall of 2022, just months after Russia had launched a full-fledged military operation in the country. So when his phone kept pinging while on location, he knew it wasn\u2019t them. It was the app used by many locally that tells users when a bomb is incoming. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, and I didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Zeman, director of the upcoming film \u201cCheckpoint Zoo,\u201d told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe went and wore flak jackets and helmets and we were there filming and bombs were going off, the whole nine yards.\u201d The notifications went off so frequently that the crew had to turn them off at times, hoping to earn a moment of silence until the inevitable sound of the bombs exploding miles away from their filming location broke it. Both the bombs and the notifications were a constant reminder to Zeman that he was trying to make a movie during a 21st century war. Zeman made multiple trips Ukraine to capture footage for \u201cCheckpoint Zoo,\u201d a documentary that tells the story of the harrowing rescue of thousands of animals that were trapped inside Kharkiv\u2019s Feldman Ecopark zoo amid the conflict. It will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on June 6. The story in his film, he said, was too important not to tell. The victims you never see Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022 launched an assault on Ukraine by land, air and sea. The ongoing conflict, over two years later, has since left tens of thousands of troops and civilians dead. The Feldman Ecopark facility, located in Kharkiv near the Russian border, became one of the unwitting casualties of the war when the heavy fighting in the area left the park\u2019s 5000 animals with little food, water and caretakers. But after the park\u2019s founder, businessman and philanthropist Oleksandr Feldman, posted a video to his social media pages asking the world for help, resources were sent and a group of volunteers showed up to help bring the animals to safety. Six people died during the evacuation, including a 15-year-old boy. Zeman first learned of Feldman Ecopark\u2019s animal rescue after he saw a video of a Chimpanzee named ChiChi wandering around Kharkiv\u2019s Freedom Square. Intrigued, he was determined to find the Chimp\u2019s origin story, which led him to learning the full scope of Feldman Ecopark\u2019s animal evacuation. Soon thereafter, Zeman connected with a representative for the park and traveled to Kharkiv with his crew to film. \u201cThis is a film about the unintended victims of war that you don\u2019t quite see,\u201d Zeman said. Zeman reconstructs the events of the evacuation in \u201cCheckpoint Zoo\u201d using interviews conducted under the constant threat of artillery fire while on the ground in Ukraine and footage filmed by volunteers. Led by a team of heroic zookeepers and volunteers, the film highlights the people who risked their lives to save the animals of Feldman Ecopark. But getting there was no easy task. Zeman spent 12 hours at the Warsaw border on his way into Ukraine trying to explain to border officials that his luggage was full of film equipment. Peppered with questions about why he was trying to cross into Ukraine and what he was trying to film, Zeman attempted to explain that he was not a journalist, nor was he heading to the front lines \u2013 a concept that he remembers being confusing to officials. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to film a zoo,\u2019\u201d Zeman recalled telling officials at the time. \u201cThat just blew everybody\u2019s mind at the border.\u201d In what ultimately turned into a five day trek from Warsaw to Kharkiv, the filmmaker was finally on-site to capture footage of the park, which was beholden to the scars of war and empty of the 5000 animals that were re-homed to safer havens across the country months prior. \u201cIt was crazy that this was going on,\u201d Zeman said. \u201cI spoke to so many people whose lives had been impacted\u2026It was horrific what was going on and coming from the United States, coming from New York, it\u2019s just shocking.\u201d The language barrier at times presented a challenge. Zeman relied heavily on his translator to relay his questions and the subject\u2019s answers. But, he said, \u201cI just knew that the story was important and that the people were important and what they were saying was emotional.\u201d The footage Feldman, a Ukrainian businessman and Jewish philanthropist, first opened the park in 2011 with the initial vision that it\u2019d be a small park for children to play with animals, according to producers of the documentary. It eventually evolved into a sprawling facility that housed everything from moose and kangaroos to lions and monkeys. Feldman Ecopark also focused on rehabilitation and instituted programs for special needs children and for people struggling with addiction. During the evacuation, Feldman and his team relocated a significant amount of the animals from the park to his nearby home. In the film, Feldman\u2019s home \u2013 full of animals \u2013 is highlighted as he tearfully speaks about his connection to them and his quest to save them. The human cost of Feldman\u2019s grand effort was spoken about by many in the documentary but shown in graphic detail through the story of 15-year-old Denis Selevin, who was killed in a strike on the facility\u2019s grounds. In one scene, the child\u2019s father, Vitalii Selevin, confronts a Russian prisoner of war who was captured by the Ukrainian military following the strike. \u201cThis is the blood of my child,\u201d Vitalii Selevin tells man the restrained in the clip, after kneeling down to show him his bloodied hands. \u201cHow am I supposed to feel about you?\u201d Denis Selevin had died just minutes before this encounter. He had been at the facility that day helping evacuate and feed the animals when the park had come under fire by Russian troops. \u201cThe footage was unbelievable, it was shocking,\u201d Zeman said. \u201cIt was also amazing too because it happened on the last day of the evacuation. It\u2019s like a script.\u201d Zeman said he didn\u2019t even realize they had this footage at the time. He and his team knew at the time that Denis Selevin lost his life and thought they\u2019d have to tell his story through photographs. So when an editor first uncovered the footage, Zeman said he felt that it was \u201cvery important\u201d that they spoke to his parents on their next trip to Ukraine. \u201cI was surprised that they agreed to speak on camera,\u201d he said. They ultimately agreed, according to Zeman, because \u201cthey wanted the world to see what war can do.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment that is consistent through each testimonial featured in \u201cCheckpoint Zoo.\u201d Andrii Tyvaniuk, a Feldman Ecopark employee who helped with the evacuation says at one point in the film that \u201cnot all animals are animals, and not all humans are humans.\u201d \u201cBut many animals are humans,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd a whole lot of people are animals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/entertainment/checkpoint-zoo-joshua-zeman-russia-ukraine-war/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_summer-movie-preview-2024", "text": "It may feel like not long ago, but a year has passed since the summer of \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d and Hollywood is hoping for another season of enthusiastic audiences and perhaps an unlikely but viral cinematic pairing. (\u201c#Garfiosa,\u201d anyone?) Some things about this summer\u2019s slate of movies feel similar \u2013 namely, a lot of sequels on offer \u2013 while other elements feel a bit different, like the lingering hangover from last year\u2019s twin strikes that brought movie production to a months-long standstill. Nevertheless, there are more than a few characters sure to distract from that with their showy antics, some masked and mouthy (here\u2019s looking at you, Deadpool) and others aiming to turn our emotions \u201cInside Out\u201d all over again. Behold a list of the most buzzy movies being released theatrically between Memorial and Labor Day Weekends, 2024. For ease of reference, any sequel, prequel or reboot is marked with an asterisk: \u2018Furiosa\u2019* (May 24) George Miller\u2019s fifth foray into the gnarly post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max, \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d explores the origins of the titular character originated by Charlize Theron in 2015\u2019s Oscar-winning epic \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d Here, Furiosa is played to the mettle by Anya Taylor-Joy, with villainous antics (and a prosthetic nose) supplied by Chris Hemsworth. \u2018The Garfield Movie\u2019 (May 24) Chris Pratt gets to add another voice credit to his list of animated roles after last year\u2019s hit \u201cMario Bros. Movie\u201d with \u201cGarfield,\u201d following the famously lethargic ginger cat hailing from the comic strips of yore. Joining Pratt as the titular cat in this family-friendly romp are Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein, along with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Cecily Strong and Bowen Yang. \u2018Ezra\u2019 (May 31) Robert De Niro joins Bobby Cannavale and Rose Byrne in this drama about a comedian who is father to an autistic child, and the unexpected road trip they embark upon. Whoopi Goldberg, Vera Farmiga and Tony Goldwyn (who also directs) costar. Introducing William A. Fitzgerald in the title role as Ezra. \u2018Robot Dreams\u2019 (May 31) Nominated for best animated feature at the Academy Awards earlier this year, \u201cRobot Dreams\u201d is the winsome tale of a dog, named Dog, and his new robot friend named\u2026 you guessed it, Robot. This one gets extra points for being a period piece, of sorts, taking place in New York City in the 1980s. \u2018Summer Camp\u2019 (May 31) This \u201cBook Club\u201d-esque take on three friends from summer camp reuniting later in life for another hurrah stars Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard and Eugene Levy in what (inexplicably) looks to be the role of the hunk they fawned over as youngsters. With this plus \u201cBook Club,\u201d its sequel last year as well as \u201cPoms,\u201d Keaton looks to be launching her very own genre. \u2018Bad Boys: Ride or Die\u2019* (June 7) Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back for a fourth go-round of this buddy comedy/action hybrid, with the twist being that this time, they\u2019re on the run (according to the IMDb logline). The movie, costarring Vanessa Hudgens, follows 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (it seems that title\u2019s promise didn\u2019t quite stick). \u2018The Watchers\u2019 (June 7) The nepo baby phenomenon extends beyond actors, as this June entry marks the feature directorial debut of one Ishana Shyamalan, daughter to M. Night (she gained footing on his Apple TV+ series \u201cServant\u201d). The film looks dutifully creepy, and stars the talented Dakota Fanning (\u201cRipley\u201d) as an artist who finds herself in a strange forest in Ireland. Soon, that becomes the least of her problems. \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 (June 7) You read that right \u2013 this 1999 international classic is being rereleased with a 4K restoration to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie\u2019s original US debut. Starring Franka Potente and directed by the visionary Tom Tykwer, \u201cLola\u201d follows a young woman in Berlin who has 20 minutes to get across town to her boyfriend \u2013 and find 100,000 Deutche Marks on the way \u2013 or else he dies. As time ticks by and Lola makes split-second decisions, her life and that of those around her become remarkably altered. \u2018Inside Out 2\u2019* (June 14) Almost a decade (!!) since Pixar\u2019s Oscar-winning exploration into the mind and emotions of one young Riley, Amy Poehler and company are back as Riley grows into her teen years. Several new emotions will be at play, including Anxiety (voiced by \u201cStranger Things\u2019\u201d Maya Hawke), Envy (\u201cThe Bear\u201d star Ayo Edebiri), embarrassment and even ennui. Oh, to be a teen once again. \u2018Treasure\u2019 (June 14) \u201cGirls\u201d star and creator Lena Dunham and \u201cWilde\u201d actor Stephen Fry play a daughter and father who travel to Poland in the early 1990s to explore the latter\u2019s roots. But the specter of his trauma from surviving the Holocaust causes him to try to sabotage their trip, as the pair nonetheless face the past and grow closer in the process. \u2018Kinds of Kindness\u2019 (June 21) After last year\u2019s surprisingly bizarre and very acclaimed \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is the next team-up between two-time Oscar-winner Emma Stone and \u201cPoor Things\u201d director Yorgos Lanthimos. The new film is billed as a dark \u201ctriptych fable,\u201d costarring Willem Dafoe, \u201cCivil War\u201d actor Jesse Plemons,\u00a0Margaret Qualley, \u201cThe Whale\u201d star Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Mamoudou Athie and \u201cEuphoria\u201d rising star Hunter Schafer. \u2018The Bikeriders\u2018 (June 21) The next starring vehicle for \u201cElvis\u201d actor Austin Butler, \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d looks like a mashup of \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d and \u201cMidnight Cowboy,\u201d with Butler at the head of a rough and tumble biker gang in \u201960s Chicago. Costarring Tom Hardy and \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star\u00a0Jodie Comer. \u2018Thelma\u2019 (June 21) Marking her first lead role, \u201cThelma\u201d stars 94-year-old June Squibb as the titular senior who is targeted in a phone scam and decides to take matters into her own hands to get back what\u2019s hers. The Oscar-nominated \u201cNebraska\u201d star is joined in the new movie by \u201cThe White Lotus\u2019s\u201d Fred Hechinger, who plays her grandson. \u2018A Quiet Place: Day One\u2019* (June 28) This prequel sure looks like it\u2019ll make a lot of noise. The latest entry in John Krasinski\u2019s super sound-sensitive alien invasion franchise, \u201cDay One\u201d stars Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o and will focus on when the vicious beasts first arrive and begin wreaking havoc. \u201cStranger Things 4\u201d breakout star Joseph Quinn, along with franchise returnee Djimon Hounsou, costar. \u2018Horizon: An American Saga\u2019 - Chapter 1 (June 28) Long before \u201cYellowstone,\u201d Kevin Costner roamed the wild American frontier in \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d and he\u2019s clearly not done with the Western genre as this June\u2019s \u201cHorizon\u201d is just the first movie in a series, centered on expansion and settlement both before and after the Civil War. \u201cChapter 2\u201d comes on August 16, with a third installment currently in production. \u2018Despicable Me 4\u2019* (July 3) The Minions are back for another zany romp, with Steve Carell\u2019s Gru and family welcoming a new addition, Gru Jr., and facing off against a new baddie voiced by Well Ferrell. This one is sure to be a known quantity, especially for beleaguered parents looking for a break over July 4th weekend. \u2018MaXXXine\u2019* (July 5) Ti West\u2019s horror trilogy comes to a bloody close with this 1980s Hollywood-set movie starring Mia Goth as an adult film star harboring some killer secrets who is stalked by a slasher. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d comes after West\u2019s impressive 2022 film \u201cX,\u201d and the slightly less convincing \u201cPearl\u201d from later that year. The third entry boasts a phenomenal supporting cast including \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Giancarlo Esposito, Kevin Bacon and singer Halsey. \u2018Fly Me to the Moon\u2019 (July 12) This period piece stars Scarlett Johansson as a PR maven tasked with staging a fake moon landing in case the real one doesn\u2019t take off successfully, opposite Channing Tatum playing the launch director whose job it is to make sure it does. Woody Harrelson costars. \u2018Longlegs\u2019 (July 12) This terrifying-looking thriller stars the prolific Nicolas Cage as a severely demented serial killer leaving occult clues (think \u201cSe7en\u201d) for an FBI agent played by Maika Monroe, the excellent actress who played the final girl in \u201cIt Follows.\u201d The trailer has \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d vibes, in the scariest possible way. \u2018Twisters\u2019* (July 19) Taking a look at weather-related news these days, it\u2019s pretty clear that extreme tornadoes are no longer an odd occurrence deserving of big-budget Hollywood treatment. Nonetheless, \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star Glen Powell is taking over storm-chasing duties from the late Bill Paxton in this almost 30-years-later sequel. Be on the lookout for debris, cows and a possible cameo from Helen Hunt. \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019* (July 26) Almost certainly the blockbuster to beat this summer, the highly anticipated sequel (are you sensing a trend yet?) will see Ryan Reynolds return as the famed Merc with a Mouth, joined for this third go-round by none other than Hugh Jackman, reprising his signature role of Wolverine after (temporarily, anyway) saying goodbye to his claws in 2017\u2019s \u201cLogan.\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is also significant as Marvel\u2019s first R-rated superhero movie, bridging the gap between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the 20th\u00a0Century Fox crop of heroes \u2013 namely the X-Men \u2013 who now belong to Marvel\u2019s parent company Disney. Expect extensive, fourth wall-breaking commentary from Deadpool himself on all of this in the movie. \u2018D\u00ecdi\u2019 (July 26) Coming of age stories are a well-mined area, but this spirited look at a Taiwanese-American 13-year-old boy enjoying the last month of summer before high school in 2008 looks like just the off-kilter and authentic experience that can serve as excellent counter-programming to all the noisier and more mainstream cinematic fare this season. Perhaps make it a double-feature with the aforementioned superheroes, and launch the #DidiPool trend? You heard it here first. \u2018Harold and the Purple Crayon\u2019 (August 2) Based on the popular children\u2019s book by Crockett Johnson, \u201cHarold\u201d stars Zachary Levi (\u201cShazam!\u201d) as the titular owner of a purple crayon that can create anything he imagines. In a bit of a meta moment, he manages to draw himself out of the book and into the real world, where his powers draw the attention of both good and bad players. \u2018Cuckoo\u2019 (August 2) Starring \u201cEuphoria\u2019s\u201d Hunter Schafer in her first lead film role, this horror film looks positively creepy and a bit, well, cuckoo. Schafer plays a young woman visiting a mysterious German Alpine resort with her family. She is soon plagued by horrifically bloody visions and believes a strange woman is following her. The trailer mentions the habits of birds in nature, which definitely ratchets up the ick-factor. Costarring Dan Stevens. \u2018Sing Sing\u2019 (August 2) After his Oscar-nominated turn in last year\u2019s \u201cRustin,\u201d Colman Domingo (who also counts \u201cEuphoria\u201d among his credits) stars in another film based on a true story, this one set at the infamous prison in New York State. In the film, Domingo plays a wrongfully imprisoned inmate who finds meaning through acting in a theatre group alongside other incarcerated men in the penitentiary. Featuring an ensemble cast of formerly incarcerated actors. \u2018Kneecap\u2019 (August 2) This biopic about an Irish rap trio \u2013 who rap in their native Irish tongue \u2013 made a splash at Sundance earlier this year, with the actual trio portraying themselves in the movie. If that\u2019s not enough to pique curiosity, try this \u2013 the film features Michael Fassbender in a supporting role. \u2018Trap\u2019 (August 9) While his daughter\u2019s been busy with her own film (see \u201cThe Watchers\u201d above), M. Night Shyamalan hasn\u2019t slowed down himself, welcoming Josh Hartnett in a plum lead role as a dad taking his kid to the concert of a wildly popular Taylor Swift-like star whose fans are obsessive. Oh, and Hartnett\u2019s character also happens to be a serial killer, and the cops have blockaded the concert venue to trap him (hence the title). The big question is, if we were able to glean all that from the trailer, what could the final Shyamalan twist possibly be at the end? \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 (August 9) Blake Lively stars in this adaptation from the bestselling Colleen Hoover novel, about a traumatized woman torn between her first love and a new relationship, one that reminds her of patterns she\u2019s seen before.

Here, they\u2019re led by Oscar-winners Cate Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with Kevin Hart and \u201cBarbie\u201d star Ariana Greenblatt.

While the industry needs to seriously adjust expectations, and perhaps begin to accept what was once considered box-office mediocrity as the new normal, it\u2019s probably too soon to panic (yet). Thus far, the numbers look pretty grim. Surveying the four weekends in May, box-office totals plummeted roughly 35% versus last year, according to the site Box Office Mojo, with the average for the No. 1 new movie down almost 50%. For Memorial Day weekend the top two titles, \u201cFuriosa\u201d and \u201cGarfield,\u201d combined for only a little more than half of what Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d swam off with in 2023, marking the weakest official kickoff to summer in more than 30 years. Despite the dismal start, there is promise of bright spots ahead, with \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d clawing out record advance ticket sales, and the animated \u201cInside Out 2\u201d likely to be a major draw for families. Still, as the Hollywood Reporter noted, $100 million opening weekends, which once occurred with some regularity, increasingly feel like an artifact of the pre-Covid, less-streaming past. For those who follow movie grosses \u2013 a pastime as popular in certain circles as baseball stats \u2013 a few key factors should be considered, in roughly descending order of importance: Habits have changed, perhaps for good. It takes more to get people to go to the theater, and consumers who aren\u2019t dying to see something know thanks to shrinking theatrical windows that the film will be more conveniently available at home soon enough. They still want to watch movies, but on their terms, not Hollywood\u2019s. The strikes made things even worse. Studios have sought to spread out releases to ensure a steady flow of new product, but the six-month work stoppage slowed the pipeline, resulting in delayed premieres that have given people less reason to venture out. So far, there\u2019s no substitute for Marvel. Disney\u2019s superhero cash cow had a terrible 2023 by its standards, and the studio has vowed to be more selective in the future. But the company\u2019s enviable run of hits from \u201cIron Man\u201d in 2008 through \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d in 2019 filled theaters, and its sagging returns \u2013 whether that\u2019s due to \u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d or a more complicated list of factors \u2013 can\u2019t easily be replicated. Unproven ideas are hard. People like to grouse about Hollywood\u2019s reliance on sequels, but selling audiences on something new \u2013 even if that\u2019s a remake of an \u201880s TV show (\u201cFall Guy\u201d), or a prequel featuring a secondary character (\u201cFuriosa\u201d) \u2013 feels particularly challenging in light of overall box-office struggles. It\u2019s not all bad news. But there\u2019s a \u201cbut.\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d brightened summer 2023, and \u201cDeadpool\u201d and other highlights looming on the horizon this year, like \u201cWicked,\u201d could fill that role again. Still, true \u201cevents,\u201d the kind that fill theaters, are rare and getting rarer. As for identifying what will break through, screenwriter William Goldman\u2019s famous observation \u201cNobody knows anything\u201d has never sounded more accurate. The stars don\u2019t shine like they used to. Ryan Gosling flexed his muscles in \u201cBarbie\u201d and owned the Oscars by singing \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken.\u201d But even his star wattage didn\u2019t bring people to \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d in vast numbers, any more than Ryan Reynolds or Anya Taylor-Joy/Chris Hemsworth could lift \u201cIF\u201d and \u201cFuriosa,\u201d respectively. Making less is going to mean spending less. Blockbuster movies take a long time to produce, requiring decisions years before they hit screens, so the boat can\u2019t be quickly turned to avoid icebergs ahead. Although the notion \u201cYou have to spend money to make money\u201d applies, if movies keep earning less there\u2019s going to be a need to make them more inexpensively. The tradeoff, of course, is audiences have come to expect a certain level of opulence from their summer action. No one said these choices are easy, but studios can\u2019t blip back, \u201cEndgame\u201d style, to 2019. About all we know is that consumers will have the final say on just how cruel this summer will be, and where the movie business goes from there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/entertainment/box-office-summer-furiosa-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

CNN published a 2016 surveillance video showing Combs physically assaulting his former girlfriend, singer Cassie Ventura, at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles. The Washington, DC-based historically Black college or university said it will disband its scholarship program in Combs\u2019 name. \u201cThe University is unwavering in its opposition to all acts of interpersonal violence,\u201d the board added, linking to the school\u2019s \u201cInterpersonal Violence Prevention\u201d webpage in the statement.

Combs has been named in eight lawsuits since November, when Ventura accused him in a now-settled claim of years of abuse during their relationship and of raping her in 2018, CNN previously reported. Subsequent lawsuits have accused Combs of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity. He has not responded to all the allegations against him but has denied claims from many of the civil suits. The US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s investigative arm launched a federal probe into Combs and allegations of sex trafficking. Investigators searched his Los Angeles and Miami homes on March 25 as part of the probe. No federal criminal charges have been filed against Combs. The surveillance video published by CNN could potentially become evidence in the federal investigation. Meanwhile, investigators are preparing to bring Combs\u2019 accusers before a federal grand jury in New York, sources familiar with the probe told CNN. Allegations of money laundering and illegal drugs are also being federally investigated, CNN has learned.

The result is a particularly rich Disney+ documentary that captures the man as well as the ideas that will ensure him a kind of immortality. Henson is described as internal and quiet, an unlikely showman who would give the world Kermit the Frog, stumble into a family-friendly producing role with \u201cSesame Street\u201d and try, with some frustration, to branch out beyond that with movies like \u201cThe Dark Crystal\u201d and \u201cLabyrinth,\u201d which have come to be more appreciated in later years than when they were released. Frank Oz, who Henson recruited out of high school to work with him, says of Henson, \u201cHe was a very rare creature,\u201d while he and others share amusing anecdotes, such as how Henson fashioned Kermit out of his mother\u2019s coat and a ping pong ball he cut in half to make the eyes. Still, \u201cIdea Man\u201d director Ron Howard and Henson\u2019s kids who followed him into the entertainment industry, Brian and Lisa, don\u2019t shy away from his more complicated personal side, including the fact that he was away much of the time \u2013 it was \u201can incredibly busy life,\u201d Lisa Henson recalls \u2013 and frequently fought with their mother, Jane. Brian Henson speaks of friction at the dinner table, and his father grappling with the strain of success, which sparked when he fled to England to produce \u201cThe Muppets Show\u201d after US networks balked at the pitch, while still eager to explore creatively in a way that was illustrated by the experimental films he made early in his career. Henson was negotiating to sell his company to Disney, in part to get back to making films and away from being preoccupied with business concerns, when he died of toxic shock syndrome in 1990 at 53. A clip of ABC News anchor Peter Jennings sums up the place Henson had come to occupy in the culture, describing the news as being \u201clike a death in the family.\u201d Those close to Henson speak of his restlessness in the doc, which might explain why and how he accomplished so much in a relatively short span, deftly underscoring that with clips ranging from his earliest works to his directing efforts in the 1980s to Orson Welles interviewing him and Oz. Kermit might have sung that it\u2019s not easy being green, but watching \u201cJim Henson: Idea Man,\u201d it\u2019s very easy appreciating the mind that gave us the Muppets and more, while still acknowledging the human foibles of the hand behind them. \u201cJim Henson: Idea Man\u201d premieres May 31 on Disney+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/entertainment/jim-henson-idea-man-documentary-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

In 2019, frontman Chris Martin announced that the band was putting touring on hold while considering how to make their performances more environmentally friendly. Two years later, Coldplay announced its Music of the Spheres tour - and with it a pledge to halve\u00a0emissions generated by show production, freight and the travel for band members and crew. The achievement is partly down to audience participation, which has seen fans producing energy by jumping up and down on kinetic dance floors and cycling on specially modified bikes. The band also promised to plant a tree for every single ticket sold for their shows. The range of innovative measures during the tour, which have encouraged the audience to take part in the eco-friendly initiative, have led to them producing 59% less than on their previous stadium tour in 2016-17, Coldplay said. The band said that the figures have been verified by the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative. Quoted in the statement on Coldplay\u2019s website, John E. Fernandez, director of the MIT initiative, congratulated the band on their \u201cdedication to positive and meaningful actions,\u201d adding that they have been \u201csetting a new standard for the entire music industry.\u201d Coldplay thanked \u201call the brilliant people who\u2019ve made this possible.\u201d \u201cMost of all, we\u2019d like to thank everyone who\u2019s come to a show and helped charge the show batteries on the power bikes and kinetic dance floors; everyone who\u2019s arrived by foot, bike, ride share or public transport; everyone who\u2019s come with refillable water bottles or returned their LED wristband for recycling; and everyone who\u2019s bought a ticket, which means you\u2019ve planted one of 7 million trees so far,\u201d the band added. The global stadium tour kicked off in Costa Rica in March 2022 and will continue until later this year, playing to fans in venues as far afield as Finland, Greece, Australia and New Zealand. In a more detailed breakdown of measures taken, the band said that 7 million trees have been planted, 18 shows in 2023 were powered completely by a system using recycled BMW i3 batteries and that 72% of all tour waste has been diverted from landfill. Nevertheless, Coldplay admitted that more remains to be done, saying: \u201cAs a band, and as an industry, we\u2019re a long way from where we need to be on this. But we\u2019re grateful for everyone\u2019s help so far, and we salute everyone who\u2019s making efforts to push things in the right direction.\u201d In an interview with CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson in 2022, Martin said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a purely charitable exercise. We are trying to prove that capitalism can be a bit more compassionate and eco-conscious.\u201d Green touring has been around for decades, with musicians including Neil Young and Bonnie Raitt among the pioneers. But as the effects of climate change continue to intensify, the music industry is now bringing this approach mainstream.

{"id": "2024_06_07_entertainment_hit-man-review-glen-powell-richard-linklater", "text": "Breezy and slight, \u201cHit Man\u201d provides a somewhat unlikely showcase for Glen Powell (fresh off the rom-com hit \u201cAnyone But You\u201d), teaming up with acclaimed director Richard Linklater to take an intriguing true story before embellishing it, Hollywood-style, beyond recognition. Working nicely on those terms, the movie feels perfectly suited to Netflix, more fit for the \u201cyou might like\u201d button than trying to make a box-office killing. Serving as producer and co-writer (with Linklater) in addition to starring, Powell plays Gary Johnson, a New Orleans philosophy and psychology professor who made extra cash serving as tech support for a police sting operation designed to catch people trying to hire, unbeknownst to them, a cop masquerading as a contract killer. Forced by circumstances to fill in, Johnson discovered a genuine talent for acting, playing various versions of the \u201chit man\u201d to reel in his marks. Based on a Texas Monthly article, \u201cHit Man\u201d departs from Johnson\u2019s already pretty remarkable story around there, when he meets an alluring woman (Adria Arjona) seeking his services because of what she characterizes as an abusive husband. Instead of springing the trap and sending her to jail, Johnson enters into a relationship with her, a perilous proposition that yields an escalating assortment of headaches, as well as some quite clever twists and turns. After \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d and the less-effective \u201cDevotion,\u201d with the disaster sequel \u201cTwisters\u201d to come, Powell understandably welcomed this opportunity to work with Linklater, who \u2013 known for character-driven studies like \u201cBoyhood\u201d \u2013 has of late dabbled in documentaries (HBO\u2019s \u201cGod Save Texas\u201d) and animation (his autobiographical Netflix semi-fantasy \u201cApollo 10 \u00bd: A Space Age Childhood\u201d). Although he nicely conveys Johnson\u2019s sort-of Hitchcockian dilemma, Powell, with his leading-man qualities, isn\u2019t a completely natural fit as the sort of professorial type that would buttress this imposter role, which doesn\u2019t make the movie less fun, just a bit more improbable until the story really kicks into gear. Arjona, by contrast, feels almost like a throwback to old film noir as this alluring woman of mystery, appearing drawn to the dangerous aspects of Gary\u2019s alter ego while potentially harboring secrets of her own. In that sense, \u201cHit Man\u201d is as much a quirky romance as a thriller, juggling its mix of whimsy and suspense deftly enough, especially down the closing stretch. Near the outset, Johnson notes in voiceover that he was \u201cminding my own business when my life took the oddest of turns.\u201d As career choices go, though, the turns in \u201cHit Man\u201d make plenty of sense, beginning with Powell indulging in a smallish but generally satisfying cinematic detour, where he doesn\u2019t need to knock \u2018em dead on his familiar glide path to blockbuster-style stardom. \u201cHit Man\u201d premieres June 7 on Netflix.

Yet the Pride month-themed special does represent an intriguing wrinkle on the nature documentary \u2013 providing more depth and nuance than the occasional headline about \u201cgay penguins\u201d \u2013 while adopting a playfully irreverent tone that seeks to make the material more accessible than what viewers have come to associate with, say, Sir David Attenborough\u2019s body of work. While casual viewers of nature fare will likely be familiar with the aforementioned penguins and the extremely sexual bonobos, \u201cQueer Planet\u201d casts a much wider net, incorporating footage documented in the wild about coalitions of male lions, giraffes (\u201csuper queer,\u201d says biologist Antonia Forster), flamingos, dolphins, hyenas, bighorn sheep, macaques, and more. There\u2019s even a section about clownfish, with a researcher noting the males can change gender, suggesting wryly that the dad in \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d might have easily become a mom after he was widowed. Actor Andrew Rannells gets into the spirit with his narration \u2013 which begins by noting that nature is \u201cmore queer than you could possibly imagine\u201d \u2013 as do some of the academics interviewed. The most interesting aspect of \u201cQueer Planet,\u201d though, is how the Victorian mores of early scientists, beginning with Charles Darwin (\u201cHe was of his time,\u201d Forster notes), informed and influenced the way they addressed \u2013 and for the most part, ignored \u2013 evidence of queer behavior in animal populations, writing them off as dominance displays or aberrations. \u201cBiological reality explodes the Victorian heteronormative myth,\u201d says author/naturalist Bradley Trevor Greive. At its core, \u201cQueer Planet\u201d is indeed pushing a political agenda, making the case that criticism of LGBTQ+ communities on moral or religious grounds occasionally \u2013 and erroneously \u2013 cite survival-of-the-species issues to bolster those arguments. Seeing various animals engaging in what the producers call \u201cunconventional sexualities\u201d indicates that humans aren\u2019t necessarily outliers in that regard. The producers and interviewees appear to have anticipated and perhaps relished the notion that the doc\u2019s very existence would provoke pundits like Fox News\u2019 Tomi Lahren and groups like the conservative Media Research Center in advance of its premiere, with the latter describing it as a \u201cdocumentary\u201d in quotes, and Pride Month as \u201cthe weeks-long onslaught of LGBTQ propaganda force-fed to weary Americans.\u201d Yet in this golden age of nature documentaries unleashed by technological advances and the appetite for streaming content, \u201cQueer Planet\u201d deserves credit for trying to connect those dots back to our lives in a somewhat different way. As for the naysayers, the beauty of the modern media environment is such programs needn\u2019t be all things to all people. To the extent \u201cQueer Planet\u201d leverages those political and cultural dynamics to let detractors help promote it, Peacock looks like a pretty savvy bird. \u201cQueer Planet\u201d premieres June 6 on Peacock.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/entertainment/queer-planet-review-pride-month/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_entertainment_ryan-reynolds-deadpool-popcorn-buckets", "text": "Ryan Reynolds this week unveiled arguably the most anticipated and sure-to-be coveted merchandise tied to his upcoming film \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d: the movie\u2019s novelty popcorn bucket. Said to be designed by Deadpool himself, the bucket, modeled after Wolverine, features a large opening akin to the quick-healing mutant\u2019s wide-open mouth, complete with the low-key vulgar suggestion of a tongue (it\u2019s from the famously inappropriate Deadpool, after all). In his social media post announcing the buzzy item, Reynolds wrote, \u201cYears from now they will look back at 2024 as the year the War of the Popcorn Buckets began.\u201d What \u201cwar\u201d could he possibly be referring to and why the hype around these movie snack containers, anyway? Popcorn buckets, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, are having a major moment. The first round of 2024 bucket battles, one might argue, was won in March by a \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d popcorn bucket so strange it spawned a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit). The appeal of these buckets \u2013 also referred to as \u201cconcession vessels\u201d or even \u201cCollectible Concession Vehicles\u201d to include specialty beverage containers and the like \u2013 is wide, attracting both seasoned collectors and casual movie fans. \u201cSeeing an item at the movie theater of my favorite characters draws me in,\u201d said collector Shahji Adam in an email to CNN. Adam, who also collects other pop culture products like Funko Pop figures, described his passion for popcorn buckets as \u201cfun nostalgia\u201d for items that help him remember the feeling of watching a particular movie for the first time. A brief history of the bucket Branded popcorn buckets began popping up in the 1990s at Disney theme parks before they made their way to theaters in marketing campaigns. AMC\u2019s Nels Storm, vice president of food & beverage strategy and leader of the merchandise team, points to 2019 as a turning point in the novelty concession vessel\u2019s evolution. \u201cWe experimented with versions of plastic popcorn tubs and beverage vessels with film branding for years. The real inception of the current program kicked off in 2019 when we introduced the R2-D2 vessel to the movie-going public,\u201d Storm said, in reference to the famous android-shaped popcorn containers that came out in support of that year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.\u201d Noting how the R2-D2 buckets sold out at AMC locations around the country on opening night, Storm added that \u201cit was clear there was bigger potential in this space.\u201d Since then, other in-demand popcorn buckets have included the Ghostbusters Ecto-1 car, Thor\u2019s hammer Mj\u00f6lnir, Dominic Toretto\u2019s Charger, the Wonka hat and a Barbie car, Storm said. AMC even recently brought back the R2-D2 popcorn bucket for this year\u2019s May the Fourth \u201cStar Wars\u201d Day, in support of the rerelease of \u201cStar Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.\u201d That bucket is Adam\u2019s favorite, as seen on his TikTok. \u201cIt\u2019s gigantic and I love that the head of R2 is where you put the drink and the body is for the popcorn!\u201d he said. As with many collectibles, some buckets are hard to come by Roland Romero, a popcorn bucket devotee with a YouTube playlist of his impressive collection, noted the vessels are globally popular and not always easy to obtain. Some movie theater chains might be out of region or make the items available for a limited run, Romero said. \u201cThe only trick is that for nearly all these collectable items, guests wanting to get the latest will want to make sure they\u2019re seeing the movie on opening weekend, and in many cases, opening night,\u201d Storm noted. He added that the R2-D2 buckets sold out both times they were made available to the public, and that the Ecto-1 car popcorn vessel \u201cflew out of the theatres during the initial hours\u201d of \u201cGhostbusters Afterlife\u2019s\u201d opening night in November 2021. What\u2019s coming next in this bucket \u2018war\u2019 Theater chains are eager to entice audiences to come and eat popcorn at the movies instead of on their couches at home, so that means more sassy snack holders to come. \u201cThe sky is the limit,\u201d with where things might go, Storm said, adding that AMC is \u201calways pushing boundaries\u201d to make going to the movies a fun and worthwhile event. And if you thought reaching into the giant mouth of a sandworm from Arrakis was gross, just wait until other horror-related merchandising items come down the pike. Adam said that because he\u2019s a horror movie fan, he\u2019s excited for the \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d bucket, which is rumored to be in the form of a Xenomorph \u2013 or, the extremely dangerous and disgusting, two-mouthed, acid-for-blood extraterrestrial at the center of that storied franchise. Be warned. The battle continues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/entertainment/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-popcorn-buckets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_30_entertainment_hacks-season-3-finale", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The following contains spoilers about the \u201cHacks\u201d Season 3 finale, \u201cBulletproof,\u201d which premiered May 30. The third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d the Emmy-nominated Max comedy series, has in one respect felt strangely dated, with veteran comic Deborah Vance pursuing a late-night TV show as a capper to her career, at a time when those series have lost much luster from their heyday. Yet the show also contains what feels like a timeless lesson about Hollywood and doing anything to get ahead. The finale articulated that clearly, after Deborah (Jean Smart) lied to her writer/confidant Ava (Hannah Einbinder), telling her that the network had prevented her from installing Ava as the head writer on her show. As luck would have it, Ava had an encounter with the network boss (Helen Hunt), who made clear that choice belonged to Deborah, who later admitted as much, saying she didn\u2019t want to do anything that might risk her blowing this belated shot at late-night stardom. \u201cYou have to be selfish,\u201d she told Ava, adding, \u201cThis show has to be bulletproof, and it has to work. I\u2019ve lost way too much for it not to.\u201d While Ava\u2019s first impulse was to quit out of principle over Deborah\u2019s betrayal, the final scene marked a turning of the tables, with Ava blackmailing Deborah into giving her the head-writer position. When Deborah asks if she\u2019s willing to use that tactic to get what she wants, Ava responds pointedly, \u201cI would. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d What that means for their uneasy alliance going forward remains to be seen, although the two have experienced enough ups and downs that they seem unable to quit each other, for good or ill. Yet what \u201cHacks\u201d has nicely captured is the mix of narcissism and self-absorption that often feel like prerequisites to achieving show-business success, in this latest season somewhat mirroring another series set in the world of late-night TV, \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show,\u201d whose titular host (played by the late Garry Shandling) possessed all kinds of power that barely concealed his neuroses, descriptions that also applied to those around him. The irony is that \u201cLarry Sanders\u201d (which premiered in 1992 on HBO, while \u201cHacks\u201d occupies its streaming service, Max) came about during a very different time in late night, when the image of Johnny Carson as a comedy kingmaker still loomed over the business. The series made its debut a few months after Carson\u2019s final episode, playing as what became known as the \u201clate-night wars\u201d raged on. Today, names like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel still command prestige and respect, but the audience has dwindled among overwhelming audience fragmentation, and other late-night shows featuring James Corden and Samantha Bee have been swept away amid less hospitable economics for such fare. There\u2019s also a collegiality among the current hosts, who even teamed up during the writers strike, that bears scant resemblance to David Letterman and Jay Leno\u2019s famous feud. Although Deborah appears to be living in the past, \u201cHacks\u201d hasn\u2019t been, as evidenced by its penultimate episode, which dealt with the comic having to address the fallout from resurfaced old jokes that hadn\u2019t aged well, similar to the scenario that prompted Kevin Hart to withdraw as the host of the Oscars. Then again, after the show\u2019s Christmas episode, perhaps it\u2019s appropriate that \u201cHacks\u201d would find a way to live in the past, present, and to the extent these dynamics persist, maybe the future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/entertainment/hacks-season-3-finale/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
