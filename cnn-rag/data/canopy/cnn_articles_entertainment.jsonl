{"id": "2024_05_29_entertainment_eric-review-benedict-cumberbatch", "text": "Weird, dark but compulsively watchable, \u201cEric\u201d stars Benedict Cumberbatch and a hulking foul-mouthed puppet, not necessarily in that order. Set amid a dystopian vision of a dangerous, corrupt 1980s New York, it\u2019s part mystery, part satire and part right-wing fever dream about crime-infested cities, powered by the parental nightmare fuel of a missing child. That child is nine-year-old Edgar (Ivan Howe), whose father, Vincent (Cumberbatch), is the cranky, authority-flouting creator and lead puppeteer behind a popular children\u2019s show, \u201cGood Day Sunshine.\u201d The title and occupation both prove ironic, given that everything about the show is awash in grime and darkness, including the constant bickering between Vincent and his wife Cassie (Gaby Hoffmann), trapped in a broken marriage that isn\u2019t lost on their son. When Edgar abruptly goes missing, both parents blame Vincent, who becomes convinced his child\u2019s drawings of an ogre-like puppet named Eric are somehow the key to finding him. As Vincent turns to self-medication to ease his anxiety and guilt, Eric appears to him, and him alone, ostensibly to help him locate the boy. However, talking to an invisible creature \u2013 whose language would make the \u201cAvenue Q\u201d gang blush \u2013 isn\u2019t necessarily the way to win the trust of those around him, including Vincent\u2019s work partner Lennie (Dan Fogler), whose efforts to cover for Vincent\u2019s bad and erratic behavior face growing strain. The other major strand of \u201cEric,\u201d created by Welsh writer Abi Morgan (\u201cThe Iron Lady\u201d), involves the detective (McKinley Belcher III) assigned the case, a closeted Black man dealing with a racist and homophobic police department. In addition, there\u2019s the matter of a missing Black teenager \u2013 whose story, notably, hasn\u2019t received nearly as much media attention \u2013 creating the possibility that Edgar\u2019s disappearance might be somehow linked to a sordid web of child exploitation and trafficking. While Cumberbatch (whose recent dances with Netflix include \u201cPower of the Dog\u201d and \u201cThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\u201d) nails his performance as a guy slowly unraveling, the police investigation and its various twists, turns and red herrings animate \u201cEric,\u201d figuratively and literally. Through its six-episode run, Morgan impressively weaves in peripheral characters and seemingly minor players in unexpected ways. In this iteration of New York, nobody is above suspicion, the wealthy and influential \u2013 a roster that includes Vincent\u2019s well off and politically connected family \u2013 are the real monsters, and almost everyone gives the impression of being guilty of something. At times \u201cEric\u201d feels so relentlessly grim as to become almost oppressive, feeding the popular impression of New York (especially during the period in question) as a modern-day dystopia. The payoff, however, reveals method in that madness, in a way that brings the discordant elements together \u2013 with a few hiccups \u2013 in surprisingly effective fashion. Eric might need somebody to pull his strings, but give credit to \u201cEric\u201d \u2013 especially considering the challenging nature of the concept \u2013 for so effectively tying those threads together. \u201cEric\u201d premieres May 30 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/eric-review-benedict-cumberbatch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish", "text": "Billie Eilish has always done things her own way. Whether it be releasing her 2016 viral hit \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d onto Soundcloud, a DIY music streaming site, or writing and recording her record-breaking debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u201d with her collaborator and brother Finneas O\u2019Connell in her childhood bedroom, Eilish, 22, has never been shy about straying from industry norms \u2013 and it seems to be working well for the two-time Oscar-winner. With her third studio album \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d which drops on Friday, she\u2019s remained consistent. The sound of the album is sure to be a surprise to all, because Eilish intentionally chose to not release a single prior to launching the album \u2013 again, a rather unorthodox move. \u201cI wanna give it to you all at once,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram page last month when announcing the album. Her 2019 debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,\u201d along with 2021\u2019s \u201cHappier Than Ever\u201d and the new record, were all co-written and produced by O\u2019Connell. It follows Eilish and O\u2019Connell\u2019s Oscar win in March for their original song for the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie,\u00a0\u201cWhat Was I Made For,\u201d which was one of 2023\u2019s biggest hits. The duo previously won the Oscar for original song in 2022 for \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d However \u201cHard and Soft\u201d sounds, which we shall soon find out, Eilish hinted in an interview with Rolling Stone last month that she found herself harkening back to her roots with this record, bringing to mind a time in Eilish\u2019s musical journey where she first set her own precedent for being in control. \u201cI feel like this album is me,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a character. It feels like the \u2018When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u2019 version of me. It feels like my youth and who I was as a kid.\u201d Her penchant for bucking the norm is continuing into her plans for her upcoming \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d tour, which kicks off in Baltimore this fall. Eilish is choosing to skirt scalpers by restricting ticket transfers for those purchasing tickets to her shows. \u201cThe tour wants to give fans, not scalpers, the best chance to buy tickets at face value. To make this possible, they have chosen to use Ticketmaster\u2019s Face Value Exchange,\u201d Ticketmaster\u2019s Eilish ticket page reads. It further notes that if fans can\u2019t attend shows in the US or Canada that they\u2019ve purchased tickets for, they have the option to resell them at face value. The move comes nearly two years after the fervor surrounding the purchase of tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour crashed the Ticketmaster site, resulting in fans not having access to tickets, scalpers trying to resell the tickets at ungodly prices and a subsequent congressional hearing. Eilish was clearly paying attention and appears to be one of the only major mainstream artists to adapt, in hopes of preventing scalpers being able to hawk tickets at exorbitant resale fees. And with \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d Eilish is also trying to stand out and apart in the industry with her effort to protect something else she\u2019s historically passionate about: the environment. The \u201cBad Guy\u201d singer made waves when she lamented in a March interview with Billboard about the \u201cwasteful\u201d practice of releasing a multitude of album variants which, in turn, \u201cgets them more money.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so wasteful, and it\u2019s irritating to me that we\u2019re still at a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much about making money \u2013 and it\u2019s all your favorite artists doing that s\u2014,\u201d she said at the time. To back up her complaint, Eilish posted a manifesto on her website describing her sustainability plan for the release of \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d after announcing the album. She wrote that she will only release eight vinyl variants \u201ceach on the same day, containing the same track-listing across the board\u201d \u2013 to remove the incentive for die-hard fans who would purchase all the variants for any differing bonus tracks \u2013 \u201cand all produced with the most sustainable practices available.\u201d Environmental sustainability has remained at the forefront for Eilish to the current moment, as on her Instagram stories on Wednesday, she included sustainable transport plans to her New York album listening event. Perhaps emboldened by the two Oscars or nine Grammys that she\u2019s won, or the fact that her first two albums have hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the young entertainer has a proven track record of success doing things her way. And why should she change now, if it\u2019s working?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_summer-movie-preview-2024", "text": "It may feel like not long ago, but a year has passed since the summer of \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d and Hollywood is hoping for another season of enthusiastic audiences and perhaps an unlikely but viral cinematic pairing. (\u201c#Garfiosa,\u201d anyone?) Some things about this summer\u2019s slate of movies feel similar \u2013 namely, a lot of sequels on offer \u2013 while other elements feel a bit different, like the lingering hangover from last year\u2019s twin strikes that brought movie production to a months-long standstill. Nevertheless, there are more than a few characters sure to distract from that with their showy antics, some masked and mouthy (here\u2019s looking at you, Deadpool) and others aiming to turn our emotions \u201cInside Out\u201d all over again. Behold a list of the most buzzy movies being released theatrically between Memorial and Labor Day Weekends, 2024. For ease of reference, any sequel, prequel or reboot is marked with an asterisk: \u2018Furiosa\u2019* (May 24) George Miller\u2019s fifth foray into the gnarly post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max, \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d explores the origins of the titular character originated by Charlize Theron in 2015\u2019s Oscar-winning epic \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d Here, Furiosa is played to the mettle by Anya Taylor-Joy, with villainous antics (and a prosthetic nose) supplied by Chris Hemsworth. \u2018The Garfield Movie\u2019 (May 24) Chris Pratt gets to add another voice credit to his list of animated roles after last year\u2019s hit \u201cMario Bros. Movie\u201d with \u201cGarfield,\u201d following the famously lethargic ginger cat hailing from the comic strips of yore. Joining Pratt as the titular cat in this family-friendly romp are Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein, along with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Cecily Strong and Bowen Yang. \u2018Ezra\u2019 (May 31) Robert De Niro joins Bobby Cannavale and Rose Byrne in this drama about a comedian who is father to an autistic child, and the unexpected road trip they embark upon. Whoopi Goldberg, Vera Farmiga and Tony Goldwyn (who also directs) costar. Introducing William A. Fitzgerald in the title role as Ezra. \u2018Robot Dreams\u2019 (May 31) Nominated for best animated feature at the Academy Awards earlier this year, \u201cRobot Dreams\u201d is the winsome tale of a dog, named Dog, and his new robot friend named\u2026 you guessed it, Robot. This one gets extra points for being a period piece, of sorts, taking place in New York City in the 1980s. \u2018Summer Camp\u2019 (May 31) This \u201cBook Club\u201d-esque take on three friends from summer camp reuniting later in life for another hurrah stars Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard and Eugene Levy in what (inexplicably) looks to be the role of the hunk they fawned over as youngsters. With this plus \u201cBook Club,\u201d its sequel last year as well as \u201cPoms,\u201d Keaton looks to be launching her very own genre. \u2018Bad Boys: Ride or Die\u2019* (June 7) Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back for a fourth go-round of this buddy comedy/action hybrid, with the twist being that this time, they\u2019re on the run (according to the IMDb logline). The movie, costarring Vanessa Hudgens, follows 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (it seems that title\u2019s promise didn\u2019t quite stick). \u2018The Watchers\u2019 (June 7) The nepo baby phenomenon extends beyond actors, as this June entry marks the feature directorial debut of one Ishana Shyamalan, daughter to M. Night (she gained footing on his Apple TV+ series \u201cServant\u201d). The film looks dutifully creepy, and stars the talented Dakota Fanning (\u201cRipley\u201d) as an artist who finds herself in a strange forest in Ireland. Soon, that becomes the least of her problems. \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 (June 7) You read that right \u2013 this 1999 international classic is being rereleased with a 4K restoration to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie\u2019s original US debut. Starring Franka Potente and directed by the visionary Tom Tykwer, \u201cLola\u201d follows a young woman in Berlin who has 20 minutes to get across town to her boyfriend \u2013 and find 100,000 Deutche Marks on the way \u2013 or else he dies. As time ticks by and Lola makes split-second decisions, her life and that of those around her become remarkably altered. \u2018Inside Out 2\u2019* (June 14) Almost a decade (!!) since Pixar\u2019s Oscar-winning exploration into the mind and emotions of one young Riley, Amy Poehler and company are back as Riley grows into her teen years. Several new emotions will be at play, including Anxiety (voiced by \u201cStranger Things\u2019\u201d Maya Hawke), Envy (\u201cThe Bear\u201d star Ayo Edebiri), embarrassment and even ennui. Oh, to be a teen once again. \u2018Treasure\u2019 (June 14) \u201cGirls\u201d star and creator Lena Dunham and \u201cWilde\u201d actor Stephen Fry play a daughter and father who travel to Poland in the early 1990s to explore the latter\u2019s roots. But the specter of his trauma from surviving the Holocaust causes him to try to sabotage their trip, as the pair nonetheless face the past and grow closer in the process. \u2018Kinds of Kindness\u2019 (June 21) After last year\u2019s surprisingly bizarre and very acclaimed \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is the next team-up between two-time Oscar-winner Emma Stone and \u201cPoor Things\u201d director Yorgos Lanthimos. The new film is billed as a dark \u201ctriptych fable,\u201d costarring Willem Dafoe, \u201cCivil War\u201d actor Jesse Plemons,\u00a0Margaret Qualley, \u201cThe Whale\u201d star Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Mamoudou Athie and \u201cEuphoria\u201d rising star Hunter Schafer. \u2018The Bikeriders\u2018 (June 21) The next starring vehicle for \u201cElvis\u201d actor Austin Butler, \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d looks like a mashup of \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d and \u201cMidnight Cowboy,\u201d with Butler at the head of a rough and tumble biker gang in \u201960s Chicago. Costarring Tom Hardy and \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star\u00a0Jodie Comer. \u2018Thelma\u2019 (June 21) Marking her first lead role, \u201cThelma\u201d stars 94-year-old June Squibb as the titular senior who is targeted in a phone scam and decides to take matters into her own hands to get back what\u2019s hers. The Oscar-nominated \u201cNebraska\u201d star is joined in the new movie by \u201cThe White Lotus\u2019s\u201d Fred Hechinger, who plays her grandson. \u2018A Quiet Place: Day One\u2019* (June 28) This prequel sure looks like it\u2019ll make a lot of noise. The latest entry in John Krasinski\u2019s super sound-sensitive alien invasion franchise, \u201cDay One\u201d stars Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o and will focus on when the vicious beasts first arrive and begin wreaking havoc. \u201cStranger Things 4\u201d breakout star Joseph Quinn, along with franchise returnee Djimon Hounsou, costar. \u2018Horizon: An American Saga\u2019 - Chapter 1 (June 28) Long before \u201cYellowstone,\u201d Kevin Costner roamed the wild American frontier in \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d and he\u2019s clearly not done with the Western genre as this June\u2019s \u201cHorizon\u201d is just the first movie in a series, centered on expansion and settlement both before and after the Civil War. \u201cChapter 2\u201d comes on August 16, with a third installment currently in production. \u2018Despicable Me 4\u2019* (July 3) The Minions are back for another zany romp, with Steve Carell\u2019s Gru and family welcoming a new addition, Gru Jr., and facing off against a new baddie voiced by Well Ferrell. This one is sure to be a known quantity, especially for beleaguered parents looking for a break over July 4th weekend. \u2018MaXXXine\u2019* (July 5) Ti West\u2019s horror trilogy comes to a bloody close with this 1980s Hollywood-set movie starring Mia Goth as an adult film star harboring some killer secrets who is stalked by a slasher. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d comes after West\u2019s impressive 2022 film \u201cX,\u201d and the slightly less convincing \u201cPearl\u201d from later that year. The third entry boasts a phenomenal supporting cast including \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Giancarlo Esposito, Kevin Bacon and singer Halsey. \u2018Fly Me to the Moon\u2019 (July 12) This period piece stars Scarlett Johansson as a PR maven tasked with staging a fake moon landing in case the real one doesn\u2019t take off successfully, opposite Channing Tatum playing the launch director whose job it is to make sure it does. Woody Harrelson costars. \u2018Longlegs\u2019 (July 12) This terrifying-looking thriller stars the prolific Nicolas Cage as a severely demented serial killer leaving occult clues (think \u201cSe7en\u201d) for an FBI agent played by Maika Monroe, the excellent actress who played the final girl in \u201cIt Follows.\u201d The trailer has \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d vibes, in the scariest possible way. \u2018Twisters\u2019* (July 19) Taking a look at weather-related news these days, it\u2019s pretty clear that extreme tornadoes are no longer an odd occurrence deserving of big-budget Hollywood treatment. Nonetheless, \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star Glen Powell is taking over storm-chasing duties from the late Bill Paxton in this almost 30-years-later sequel. Be on the lookout for debris, cows and a possible cameo from Helen Hunt. \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019* (July 26) Almost certainly the blockbuster to beat this summer, the highly anticipated sequel (are you sensing a trend yet?) will see Ryan Reynolds return as the famed Merc with a Mouth, joined for this third go-round by none other than Hugh Jackman, reprising his signature role of Wolverine after (temporarily, anyway) saying goodbye to his claws in 2017\u2019s \u201cLogan.\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is also significant as Marvel\u2019s first R-rated superhero movie, bridging the gap between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the 20th\u00a0Century Fox crop of heroes \u2013 namely the X-Men \u2013 who now belong to Marvel\u2019s parent company Disney. Expect extensive, fourth wall-breaking commentary from Deadpool himself on all of this in the movie. \u2018D\u00ecdi\u2019 (July 26) Coming of age stories are a well-mined area, but this spirited look at a Taiwanese-American 13-year-old boy enjoying the last month of summer before high school in 2008 looks like just the off-kilter and authentic experience that can serve as excellent counter-programming to all the noisier and more mainstream cinematic fare this season. Perhaps make it a double-feature with the aforementioned superheroes, and launch the #DidiPool trend? You heard it here first. \u2018Harold and the Purple Crayon\u2019 (August 2) Based on the popular children\u2019s book by Crockett Johnson, \u201cHarold\u201d stars Zachary Levi (\u201cShazam!\u201d) as the titular owner of a purple crayon that can create anything he imagines. In a bit of a meta moment, he manages to draw himself out of the book and into the real world, where his powers draw the attention of both good and bad players. \u2018Cuckoo\u2019 (August 2) Starring \u201cEuphoria\u2019s\u201d Hunter Schafer in her first lead film role, this horror film looks positively creepy and a bit, well, cuckoo. Schafer plays a young woman visiting a mysterious German Alpine resort with her family. She is soon plagued by horrifically bloody visions and believes a strange woman is following her. The trailer mentions the habits of birds in nature, which definitely ratchets up the ick-factor. Costarring Dan Stevens. \u2018Sing Sing\u2019 (August 2) After his Oscar-nominated turn in last year\u2019s \u201cRustin,\u201d Colman Domingo (who also counts \u201cEuphoria\u201d among his credits) stars in another film based on a true story, this one set at the infamous prison in New York State. In the film, Domingo plays a wrongfully imprisoned inmate who finds meaning through acting in a theatre group alongside other incarcerated men in the penitentiary. Featuring an ensemble cast of formerly incarcerated actors. \u2018Kneecap\u2019 (August 2) This biopic about an Irish rap trio \u2013 who rap in their native Irish tongue \u2013 made a splash at Sundance earlier this year, with the actual trio portraying themselves in the movie. If that\u2019s not enough to pique curiosity, try this \u2013 the film features Michael Fassbender in a supporting role. \u2018Trap\u2019 (August 9) While his daughter\u2019s been busy with her own film (see \u201cThe Watchers\u201d above), M. Night Shyamalan hasn\u2019t slowed down himself, welcoming Josh Hartnett in a plum lead role as a dad taking his kid to the concert of a wildly popular Taylor Swift-like star whose fans are obsessive. Oh, and Hartnett\u2019s character also happens to be a serial killer, and the cops have blockaded the concert venue to trap him (hence the title). The big question is, if we were able to glean all that from the trailer, what could the final Shyamalan twist possibly be at the end? \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 (August 9) Blake Lively stars in this adaptation from the bestselling Colleen Hoover novel, about a traumatized woman torn between her first love and a new relationship, one that reminds her of patterns she\u2019s seen before. Costarring Justin Baldoni, Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj. \u2018Borderlands\u2019 (August 9) In case you\u2019re missing the Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 who took their final bow last summer \u2013 \u201cBorderlands\u201d should have you covered, as the film looks to follow a similarly freewheeling cohort of intergalactic misfits on a valiant quest. Here, they\u2019re led by Oscar-winners Cate Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with Kevin Hart and \u201cBarbie\u201d star Ariana Greenblatt. Based on the bestselling video game. \u2018Alien: Romulus\u2019* (August 16) Just when you thought it was safe to scream in space again, the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise returns, hopefully with a better entry than (at least) the last two. \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe\u201d director Fede Alvarez directs \u201cCivil War\u201d and \u201cPriscilla\u201d star Cailee Spaeny \u2013 who, from the looks of the trailer, seems to be on serious Sigourney Weaver duty \u2013 as she accompanies a group of space colonizers inspecting a derelict space station. It\u2019s a safe bet that they find trouble, and then some. \u2018Close to You\u2019 (August 16) \u201cUmbrella Academy\u2019s\u201d Elliot\u00a0Page stars as Sam, a trans man going home for the first time since transitioning. Once there, he rekindles a romance with an old flame, and must face long-simmering issues. Costarring Hillary Baack and Wendy Crewson. \u2018Blink Twice\u2019 (August 23) Jam packed with a starry cast, \u201cBlink Twice\u201d looks like a perfect late summer movie \u2013 attractive people, elaborate action sequences, and mindless mayhem. This is Channing Tatum\u2019s second entry this summer after \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d here playing a crazy tech billionaire who whisks a cocktail waitress (Naomi Ackie) and her friend (Alia Shawkat) off to his private island for what turns into an insane interlude. Kyle MacLachlan, Christian Slater, Haley Joel Osment and Geena Davis round out the cast. Directed by Zo\u00eb Kravitz. \u2018The Crow\u2019* (August 23) An uber-gory-looking reboot based on the influential James O\u2019Barr graphic novel, which also served as inspiration for the 1994 noir thriller of the same name that starred the late Brandon Lee. The new film stars Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from \u201cIt\u201d) as a brutally murdered man who returns from the dead to avenge his killing and that of his beloved soulmate Shelly (FKA twigs). \u2018Slingshot\u2019 (August 23) Laurence Fishburne and Casey Affleck star in this sci-fi thriller about an astronaut heading to the Titan moon of Saturn who loses his grip on reality when his mission becomes compromised. \u2018Reagan\u2019 (August 30) Dennis Quaid plays Ronald Reagan, a 1950s-era actor who eventually became the 40th President of the United States. Prepare for extensive debates on how the figure is portrayed here. With Penelope Ann Miller as Nancy Reagan.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/summer-movie-preview-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

While the industry needs to seriously adjust expectations, and perhaps begin to accept what was once considered box-office mediocrity as the new normal, it\u2019s probably too soon to panic (yet). Thus far, the numbers look pretty grim. Surveying the four weekends in May, box-office totals plummeted roughly 35% versus last year, according to the site Box Office Mojo, with the average for the No. 1 new movie down almost 50%. For Memorial Day weekend the top two titles, \u201cFuriosa\u201d and \u201cGarfield,\u201d combined for only a little more than half of what Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d swam off with in 2023, marking the weakest official kickoff to summer in more than 30 years. Despite the dismal start, there is promise of bright spots ahead, with \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d clawing out record advance ticket sales, and the animated \u201cInside Out 2\u201d likely to be a major draw for families. Still, as the Hollywood Reporter noted, $100 million opening weekends, which once occurred with some regularity, increasingly feel like an artifact of the pre-Covid, less-streaming past. For those who follow movie grosses \u2013 a pastime as popular in certain circles as baseball stats \u2013 a few key factors should be considered, in roughly descending order of importance: Habits have changed, perhaps for good. It takes more to get people to go to the theater, and consumers who aren\u2019t dying to see something know thanks to shrinking theatrical windows that the film will be more conveniently available at home soon enough. They still want to watch movies, but on their terms, not Hollywood\u2019s. The strikes made things even worse. Studios have sought to spread out releases to ensure a steady flow of new product, but the six-month work stoppage slowed the pipeline, resulting in delayed premieres that have given people less reason to venture out. So far, there\u2019s no substitute for Marvel. Disney\u2019s superhero cash cow had a terrible 2023 by its standards, and the studio has vowed to be more selective in the future. But the company\u2019s enviable run of hits from \u201cIron Man\u201d in 2008 through \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d in 2019 filled theaters, and its sagging returns \u2013 whether that\u2019s due to \u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d or a more complicated list of factors \u2013 can\u2019t easily be replicated. Unproven ideas are hard. People like to grouse about Hollywood\u2019s reliance on sequels, but selling audiences on something new \u2013 even if that\u2019s a remake of an \u201880s TV show (\u201cFall Guy\u201d), or a prequel featuring a secondary character (\u201cFuriosa\u201d) \u2013 feels particularly challenging in light of overall box-office struggles. It\u2019s not all bad news. But there\u2019s a \u201cbut.\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d brightened summer 2023, and \u201cDeadpool\u201d and other highlights looming on the horizon this year, like \u201cWicked,\u201d could fill that role again. Still, true \u201cevents,\u201d the kind that fill theaters, are rare and getting rarer. As for identifying what will break through, screenwriter William Goldman\u2019s famous observation \u201cNobody knows anything\u201d has never sounded more accurate. The stars don\u2019t shine like they used to. Ryan Gosling flexed his muscles in \u201cBarbie\u201d and owned the Oscars by singing \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken.\u201d But even his star wattage didn\u2019t bring people to \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d in vast numbers, any more than Ryan Reynolds or Anya Taylor-Joy/Chris Hemsworth could lift \u201cIF\u201d and \u201cFuriosa,\u201d respectively. Making less is going to mean spending less. Blockbuster movies take a long time to produce, requiring decisions years before they hit screens, so the boat can\u2019t be quickly turned to avoid icebergs ahead. Although the notion \u201cYou have to spend money to make money\u201d applies, if movies keep earning less there\u2019s going to be a need to make them more inexpensively. The tradeoff, of course, is audiences have come to expect a certain level of opulence from their summer action. No one said these choices are easy, but studios can\u2019t blip back, \u201cEndgame\u201d style, to 2019. About all we know is that consumers will have the final say on just how cruel this summer will be, and where the movie business goes from there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/entertainment/box-office-summer-furiosa-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The result is a particularly rich Disney+ documentary that captures the man as well as the ideas that will ensure him a kind of immortality. Henson is described as internal and quiet, an unlikely showman who would give the world Kermit the Frog, stumble into a family-friendly producing role with \u201cSesame Street\u201d and try, with some frustration, to branch out beyond that with movies like \u201cThe Dark Crystal\u201d and \u201cLabyrinth,\u201d which have come to be more appreciated in later years than when they were released. Frank Oz, who Henson recruited out of high school to work with him, says of Henson, \u201cHe was a very rare creature,\u201d while he and others share amusing anecdotes, such as how Henson fashioned Kermit out of his mother\u2019s coat and a ping pong ball he cut in half to make the eyes. Still, \u201cIdea Man\u201d director Ron Howard and Henson\u2019s kids who followed him into the entertainment industry, Brian and Lisa, don\u2019t shy away from his more complicated personal side, including the fact that he was away much of the time \u2013 it was \u201can incredibly busy life,\u201d Lisa Henson recalls \u2013 and frequently fought with their mother, Jane. Brian Henson speaks of friction at the dinner table, and his father grappling with the strain of success, which sparked when he fled to England to produce \u201cThe Muppets Show\u201d after US networks balked at the pitch, while still eager to explore creatively in a way that was illustrated by the experimental films he made early in his career. Henson was negotiating to sell his company to Disney, in part to get back to making films and away from being preoccupied with business concerns, when he died of toxic shock syndrome in 1990 at 53. A clip of ABC News anchor Peter Jennings sums up the place Henson had come to occupy in the culture, describing the news as being \u201clike a death in the family.\u201d Those close to Henson speak of his restlessness in the doc, which might explain why and how he accomplished so much in a relatively short span, deftly underscoring that with clips ranging from his earliest works to his directing efforts in the 1980s to Orson Welles interviewing him and Oz. Kermit might have sung that it\u2019s not easy being green, but watching \u201cJim Henson: Idea Man,\u201d it\u2019s very easy appreciating the mind that gave us the Muppets and more, while still acknowledging the human foibles of the hand behind them. \u201cJim Henson: Idea Man\u201d premieres May 31 on Disney+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/entertainment/jim-henson-idea-man-documentary-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

So is it easier or harder playing roles that might in some ways mimic their real lives? Turns out, it\u2019s both. \u201cI would say easier,\u201d Glazer, of \u201cBroad City\u201d fame, told CNN. \u201cSo much easier.\u201d \u201cEasier to play, easier to understand how tired, how confused, how frustrated, how grateful you are to pump and dump (breastmilk), to have a shot (of alcohol) when you\u2019re off the clock,\u201d Buteau chimed in. \u201cAnd also harder because then you\u2019re away from your kids.\u201d The film \u2013 which is being compared to \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and marketed as \u201ca hilarious and heartfelt comedy about the bonds of friendship and the messy, unpredictable challenges of adulthood and becoming a parent\u201d \u2013 was written by Glazer and actor/producer Josh Rabinowitz, who also worked with her on her famed \u201cBroad City\u201d series. That series, which ran from 2014 to 2019, has a cult following, as does Buteau\u2019s recently renewed Netflix series \u201cSurvival of the Thickest\u201d based on her book of essays of the same title. Suffice it to say with two such funny performers working together, not to mention the other cast members including Hasan Minhaj, Oliver Platt and John Carroll Lynch, it was a rollicking good time on the \u201cBabes\u201d set. \u201cWe were cracking up, like crying,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cMy co-writer Josh Rabinowitz famously during the plumber scene laughed so hard he smacked his head on his chair. He like injured his forehead, we were laughing so hard.\u201d Shooting in 25 days, with Buteau only being available to film for 15, heightened both the tension and the hilarity, they said, and Glazer confirmed that some of the best of those funny moments are being put together as extras for streaming. Director Pamela Adlon, best known for her starring role on acclaimed series \u201cBetter Things,\u201d said it was challenging getting the project done in such a short period of time. Yet the timing couldn\u2019t have been better given that she had just wrapped the final season of her show. Plus, the script really spoke to her, she told CNN. \u201cI read it and it was emotional besides all the comedy. And there was an edginess to it,\u201d Adlon said. \u201cAll those things have to go together for me to really respond to something. I gotta have the dark, I gotta have the funny, I gotta have the heart. It\u2019s gotta hit you in the gut to make you feel, make you cry, but then you gotta have a little light.\u201d Glazer should be proud to know that, as she said she, Rabinowitz and their producer Susie Fox worked really hard to mine their own life experiences as parents to craft a relatable script. \u201cIt was really important for us to have something so funny, but to balance it with heart and emotional heft,\u201d she said. \u201cThose were our guideposts.\u201d \u201cBabes\u201d is in theaters Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/entertainment/ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_20_entertainment_rick-and-morty-animated-tv-series-cec", "text": "After 10 years on the air, \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d the animated sci-fi comedy about a misanthropic scientist and his 14-year-old grandson\u2019s interdimensional adventures, is surprising as ever. In its seven seasons, it has steered its characters through apocalypses, divorces, an alien musical reality TV competition and school dances \u2014 events with equal gravity in its off-kilter universe. There are very few rules in \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d which makes the job all the more fun for its writers, who are working on its eighth and ninth seasons now. But in the middle of its seventh season, which ended in December, \u201cRick and Morty\u201d made its most shocking move yet \u2013\u2013\u00a0it finally gave Rick what he\u2019s spent more than half of his 70-odd years seeking. Rick finally killed his mortal enemy, Rick Prime, in the fifth episode of the show\u2019s recent 10-episode season. Rick Prime, a cruel version of Rick from another dimension, killed our Rick\u2019s wife, throwing his life off-course. Our protagonist\u2019s curdled, single-minded pursuit of vengeance eventually led him to rejoin his family, recruit his daughter Beth\u2019s teenage children for his interdimensional travels and set the series in motion. But true to \u201cRick and Morty\u2019s\u201d deeply cynical tone, Rick feels nothing when he kills Rick Prime in a series of increasingly brutal punches. Afterwards, back at his family home, while Morty rejoices in Rick\u2019s \u201cvictory,\u201d Rick is as numb as a zombie. The act of killing his enemy, Rick realizes, was ultimately meaningless and does nothing to ease the loss of his wife. It takes him a few episodes to shake his despair. \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d says series writer Heather Anne Campbell, is incredibly silly but utterly serious about the weirdness of being alive.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get at some deeper, funnier, dumber, more nihilistic truth about what we\u2019re doing here,\u201d Campbell told CNN. \u201cThe most effective way to demonstrate that to an audience is like, yeah, have you achieved your goal? And it doesn\u2019t feel like anything? What does that mean? Because that\u2019s something everybody experiences, I think, all the time.\u201d To love \u201cRick and Morty\u201d is to know that it can go anywhere at any time, from the planet Alphabetrium, made up of letter-shaped beings including the rapper Ice-T, to Viking Valhalla with Bigfoot. There are endless possibilities in the world(s) it\u2019s built, where substance-addled scientist Rick is the self-proclaimed smartest man in the universe and can do pretty much anything except readily admit his love for Morty, granddaughter Summer or Beth, or anyone beyond his best friend, the recently resurrected Bird Person. The season wasn\u2019t all major revelations and deeply sad dramatic beats, though. Just a week before that pivotal installment, \u201cRick and Morty\u201d aired an episode in which Rick feeds his family delicious spaghetti that they discover was made from a dead body. (Campbell wrote that one, plus the season seven finale.) That\u2019s the fulfilling joy of writing for \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d Campbell says \u2013\u2013 its \u201cinfinite sandbox.\u201d No idea is off limits as long as it rings true in the universe of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d and to its viewers, be it the moral cost of a spaghetti dinner or the emptiness felt after vanquishing a foe. \u201cThe six seasons previous have shown us that literally anything can be an episode,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the strength of the show is taking any of these completely absurd sci-fi concepts and really interrogating them and trying to illuminate some stupid truth about what life is and what we\u2019re experiencing.\u201d Rick made major strides in season seven, with one major setback As in previous seasons, \u201cRick and Morty\u2019s\u201d seventh season was profane, uproariously funny and often deeply upsetting. (\u201cRick and Morty\u201d is a property of Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN.) It was the first to air after Justin Roiland, who co-created the series with Dan Harmon and voiced both title characters, was fired due to allegations of sexual assault. But his departure didn\u2019t kneecap the series \u2013\u2013 new actors Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden were brought in to voice Rick and Morty, respectively, and the show continues to probe the mysteries of life in outlandish scenarios, asking questions like, Would you stage an intervention for your alcoholic friend whose wife left him for the Predator? And also, what if Hugh Jackman was there? Nihilism is where \u201cRick and Morty\u201d thrives \u2013\u2013\u00a0in the very first season, our title characters abandoned Morty\u2019s home planet with his parents and sister still on it after they unleashed a Cronenberg-ian mutation that turned everyone into oozing, murderous monsters, and all because Morty asked Rick for a love potion. But by the end of this seventh season, our title characters have emotionally matured somewhat. The pair get a subtly sweet moment in the season finale: Rick and Morty have grown jaded by the horrors they\u2019ve seen across dimensions and find they can no longer be scared. Eager to feel the jitters again, they leap into something called the Fear Hole, which brings to life their deepest anxieties. For Morty, that\u2019s a life where Rick leaves. Inside the hole, Morty meets a version of Diane, Rick\u2019s dead wife. Morty\u2019s fear manifests a version of Rick, who Diane tries to convince to stay in the hole \u2014\u00a0even though it\u2019ll kill him. Morty finally climbs out of the hole, but only after confronting his fear that Rick could leave the family as suddenly as he reentered their lives, stranding Morty in an unremarkable life once again. \u201cAm I \u2026 irreplaceable?\u201d Morty asks Rick once he\u2019s left the hole. Rick, ever withholding, counters: \u201cDefine irreplaceable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good \u2026 good,\u201d Morty says, hugging Rick tightly, a rarity in the series. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d Teetering on the edge of the hole, which is inexplicably located in a bathroom stall inside a Denny\u2019s, Rick is briefly tempted to find Diane, a choice made weightier by Rick\u2019s recent killing of the man who killed her. Instead, he pulls a photo of Morty out of his wallet and pins it to a corkboard inside the stall to signify, with pride, that his grandson is one of the few to make it out of the Fear Hole alive. It\u2019s as close as Rick can come to admitting he loves his grandson. The quiet moment lands because it\u2019s taken Rick so long to go that far \u2013\u2013\u00a0and leaves the rest of the series wide open. It\u2019s an exciting prospect for viewers and even for Cardoni, the new voice of Rick, who doesn\u2019t know where the series is headed either. \u201cThe character is growing,\u201d Cardoni told CNN ahead of the finale. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some great turns with (Rick) just in the season, in terms of his emotional health and mental health. We\u2019ve seen it working, and we\u2019re seeing him open up in different ways. I\u2019ll bring to that whatever I can, but I think the character is what\u2019s alive now.\u201d On a show where anything can happen, everything will Because an episode of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d can start from anything, Campbell pitched the idea for suicide spaghetti. It starts out like a \u201cclassic \u2018Rick and Morty\u2019 adventure\u201d in which Morty morally objects to something Rick does \u2013\u2013 in this case, serving delicious spaghetti to his family that\u2019s actually made from the remains of people whose insides turn to pasta only when they die by suicide. Harmon wasn\u2019t sold on the concept as an entire episode at first, Campbell said, but encouraged her to riff on it. It turned into \u201cThat\u2019s Amorte.\u201d At first, the episode feels like it\u2019s taking a blackly comic take on taboo subjects to disturbing extremes \u2013\u2013\u00a0fairly typical terrain for a series that once featured a \u201csoul orgy\u201d between Rick, Morty and Summer, plus a gaggle of dragons. But it turns oddly moving once the suicide spaghetti industry balloons and Morty finds himself complicit in its success. Rick ends the demand for pasta for good by hooking a dying man up to a machine that broadcasts scenes from his life to those watching across the planet. Eating the remains of a man who lived, lost and loved is suddenly no longer appetizing. \u201cI wanted to get across that life is not a direct path from one point to another \u2013\u2013\u00a0it is a constantly meandering river,\u201d Campbell said of the montage of the man\u2019s life. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t rob it of meaning, especially if you look at the entire thing all at once.\u201d The spaghetti episode only worked because co-creator Dan Harmon and showrunner Scott Marder were \u201cfully indulgent and patient\u201d in letting Campbell explore pasta as a plot device and developed it with her from the very beginning of the pitch process, she said. \u201cTapping that excitement for an area usually leads to stronger drafts for each episode on the whole,\u201d Marder told CNN. As for the ideas that make it that far, the \u201cenergy in the writer\u2019s room\u201d is the most important barometer of potential, Harmon told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about everyone laughing, but it is about them being excited \u2013\u2013 when two or more writers start talking over each other, and everyone is pitching very different possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf two people can disagree fundamentally about how they\u2019d use X-ray glasses, that\u2019s a sign there may be a story\u2019s worth of energy in X-ray glasses.\u201d Or, spaghetti. Campbell\u2019s pasta-centric episode tonally fits right in alongside the bleak episode in which Rick Prime dies. \u201cWe always say every episode needs to run a marathon, in terms of its lifespan, from a kernel of an idea to making it to air,\u201d Marder said, \u201cso an idea really works when it\u2019s got a strong enough engine in it to help power it, and our enthusiasm for it, through that 26-mile race.\u201d \u201cRick and Morty\u201d writers are working on the next three seasons at once, in varying stages of development. It\u2019s helpful that way, Campbell said, because they can easily chart how a major canonical move will reverberate in a future season. For example: With his death, Rick Prime ceded his position as the show\u2019s major villain to Evil Morty, who helped our Rick find his nemesis \u2014 but, by the episode\u2019s end, has the power to destroy all Ricks in every dimension, upsetting the show\u2019s balance at any time. Where \u201cRick and Morty\u201d goes next is anyone\u2019s guess, especially with a dead Rick Prime and rogue Evil Morty. But the unknown is the point of the series, Campbell said. \u201cThe future is so terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing alive is a puzzle. And those things colliding against each other is where the show is going.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/entertainment/rick-and-morty-animated-tv-series-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review", "text": "Seven years after a trilogy that ended with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d didn\u2019t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it\u2019s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity \u2013 the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren \u2013 the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What\u2019s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) \u2013 an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom \u2013 attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (\u201cThe Witcher\u2019s\u201d Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing \u201cThe Planet of the Apes\u201d but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run. Hollywood blockbusters aren\u2019t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these \u201cApes\u201d prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don\u2019t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it\u2019s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d premieres May 10 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_entertainment_the-great-lillian-hall-review-jessica-lange", "text": "Jessica Lange met the movie public perched in King Kong\u2019s giant palm, but her real breakthrough came in 1982 when she played a pair of actresses, earning Oscar nominations for both roles: as a fictional soap-opera star in \u201cTootsie\u201d and the real-life Frances Farmer in the tragic biography \u201cFrances\u201d (she won a statuette for the former). In a way, Lange\u2019s storied career comes full circle with \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall,\u201d playing an aging Broadway star in a movie HBO acquired and is premiering on the final day of Emmy eligibility, no doubt hoping that there are additional accolades, and perhaps awards hardware, in her future. As a format, the TV movie has surely seen better days (limited series have largely supplanted them), and \u201cLillian Hall\u201d is a modestly scaled production, punctuated by a trio of female leads: Lange as the title character, billed as \u201cthe first lady of the American theater;\u201d Kathy Bates as her loyal assistant; and Lily Rabe (like Lange, a veteran of producer Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d repertory company) as her daughter. While rehearsing for a play with an avant-garde director (Jesse Williams), Lillian begins forgetting lines and experiencing other memory lapses, clear signs that she might be in the early throes of dementia. Her first reaction, though, leans toward denial, then defiance, while gradually triggering uncertainty for those around her about a show that suddenly might be as difficult to put on with her as without her. Directed by Michael Cristofer from Elisabeth Seldes\u2019 screenplay, the film doesn\u2019t turn over new ground but nevertheless yields poignant moments, primarily in the interplay between Lange \u2013 a fierce lioness in winter, hungry for one more curtain call \u2013 and Bates, who could play this part in her sleep and still makes the most of it. \u201cWill you remind me who I was?\u201d Lillian asks, a line that beautifully captures the fear associated with her condition. Although Lange has kept busy working for Murphy in recent years \u2013 including her turn as another actor, Joan Crawford, in \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan,\u201d about the rivalry between Crawford and Bette Davis \u2013 the new film feels like a nice bookend to those earlier roles. At the same time, \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall\u201d operates as a love letter to the theater while catering to those who can appreciate an \u201cAll About Eve\u201d reference or two. \u201cI am not some broken-down old Chevy,\u201d Lillian rages at one point. The movie works hard to reinforce that message by providing Lange with a worthy showcase, in a vehicle that might be light on horsepower but feels as polished as its central character. \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall\u201d premieres May 31 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/entertainment/the-great-lillian-hall-review-jessica-lange/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The film about the presumptive Republican nominee comes five months before the presidential election. Starring Sebastian Stan as a young Trump, the film is an \u201cexploration of power and ambition set in a world of corruption and deceit,\u201d according to an official synopsis. \u201cSuccession\u201d star Jeremy Strong co-stars as Roy Cohn, the lawyer and fixer who Trump considered a mentor early in his career. \u201cIt\u2019s a mentor-protege story that charts the origins of an American dynasty. Filled with larger than life characters, it reveals the moral and human cost of a culture defined by winners and losers,\u201d the synopsis reads. \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which, despite the title, is not a reference to the reality competition series Trump starred in, includes a disclaimer that some parts of the story are slightly fictionalized. It is written by biographer and political journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Iranian-Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi. \u201cIn the time of turmoil, there\u2019s this tendency to look inwards, to sort of bury your head deep in the sand and look inside and hope for the best, hope for the storm to get away,\u201d Abassi told the audience at the movie\u2019s premiere on Monday, according to footage posted online. \u201cBut, the storm,\u201d Abassi continued, \u201cis not going away. The storm is coming, actually. The worst times are to come.\u201d Abassi went on to say that he chose to make a film \u201cabout the world\u201d through a story about Trump, because \u201cthere is no nice metaphorical way to deal with the rising wave of fascism.\u201d \u201cThere is only the messy way, there is only the banal way. There is only the way of dealing with this wave on its own turfs at its own level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty, but I think the problem with the world is that the good people have been quiet for too long.\u201d The film includes a depiction of Trump\u2019s relationship with his first wife, Ivana, and their divorce, according to The Hollywood Reporter. A scene of the former president undergoing liposuction drew audible gasps from the crowd, the publication reported. \u201cWe will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers.

{"id": "2024_05_30_entertainment_young-woman-and-the-sea-review-daisy-ridley", "text": "The only wrinkles in \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d are the ones Daisy Ridley likely developed spending all that time in the water, but the movie presents such a stirring true story, so efficiently told, that really shouldn\u2019t matter. Like Trudy Ederle swimming the English Channel, knowing where you\u2019re going, in this case, isn\u2019t as significant as the near-irresistible, awe-inspiring act of getting there. Granted, the title almost sounds like the marketing department threw in the towel on anything more appealing (its echoes of Ernest Hemingway notwithstanding), except that it\u2019s actually derived from the book, \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea: How Trudy Ederle Conquered the English Channel and Inspired the World,\u201d on which the film is based. In addition, the movie was originally destined to premiere on Disney+, until producer Jerry Bruckheimer (and according to the trade papers, positive audience testing) prompted the studio to give it a shot in the increasingly shark-infested theatrical waters, where its future appears uncertain. Wherever one sees it, \u201cYoung Woman\u201d possesses plenty of old-school charms, reflecting a triumph of the human spirit and endurance that (aided significantly by Amelia Warner\u2019s musical score) buoys the soul. In that regard it joins a long list of classic sports movies, perhaps even more than its recent cousins, the swim-themed Netflix film \u201cNyad\u201d and George Clooney\u2019s Olympic tale \u201cThe Boys in the Boat.\u201d Ridley has stayed busy in smaller films since her high-profile \u201cStar Wars\u201d stint, but few that showcase her innate likability better than this one. Then again, it\u2019s hard not to root for Trudy, born to German immigrant parents, who overcame measles as a child and the \u201cold ways\u201d insisted upon by her father (\u201cKilling Eve\u2019s\u201d Kim Bodnia) to become an Olympic-caliber swimmer, competing in the 1924 Games before undertaking the grueling 21-mile swim of the English Channel two years later. Ederle faced formidable tides in and out of the water, the latter in the form of overt sexism, offset by her steely mom (Jeanette Hain), supportive sister (Tilda Cobham-Hervey, who played Helen Reddy in \u201cI Am Woman\u201d) and demanding coach (Sian Clifford), as well as another swimmer (Stephen Graham) who recognizes her grit and potential. Norwegian director Joachim R\u00f8nning (\u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d) and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (2019\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d) both have Disney credentials, but \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d possesses the throwback feel of live-action fare that flourished long before fretting about theatrical windows became an overriding concern. The inevitable closing crawl and old newsreel footage merely adds heft to the story, in a way that feels a bit timelier 100 years after Ederle competed in the Olympics. Whether destined for consumption in a theater or via streaming, \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d is an exercise in the simple power of a well-told story, the kind that can wash over and uplift you all at once. \u201cYoung Woman the Sea\u201d premieres May 31 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_if-review-ryan-reynolds-john-krasinski", "text": "Occasionally a movie gets misleadingly marketed for understandable reasons, and so it is with \u201cIF,\u201d a sweetly sentimental film from writer-director John Krasinski that the ads make look like a madcap romp. The best parts should strike a mildly receptive chord with parents while potentially boring younger kids, a prescription that could subject the movie\u2019s imaginary friends to a harsh reality once audiences in summer-movie mode get a good look at it. After his breakout success with \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (whose delayed prequel will arrive in June), Krasinski shifts toward a PG-rated movie built around animated characters, infused with a family-friendly vibe. Yet it\u2019s no accident that the classic James Stewart movie \u201cHarvey\u201d at one point plays on the TV, since \u201cIF\u201d seeks the same whimsical tone, while owing perhaps its strongest debt to the 1995 film adaptation of \u201cA Little Princess\u201d \u2013 which also focuses on a young girl dealing with grief, loss and uncertainty \u2013 brightened by detours into the fantastic. Bea (Cailey Fleming, delivering a splendid anchoring performance after growing up among \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) has already lost her mom, and now her dad (Krasinski) is hospitalized as he awaits heart surgery. Forced to stay with her grandma (Fiona Shaw), Bea discovers a neighbor (Ryan Reynolds in kinder, gentler mode) who works to find new homes for imaginary friends (or IFs) whose kids have grown up and forgotten them. The imaginary friends, not surprisingly, turn out to be an eclectic and colorful lot, featuring a wide assortment of celebrity voices, among them Krasinski\u2019s wife, Emily Blunt, and the late Louis Gossett Jr. The most prominent imaginary pair each have notable connections to other cast members: Krasinski\u2019s \u201cThe Office\u201d co-star Steve Carell, whose needy Blue bears a too-strong resemblance to McDonald\u2019s Grimace; and Blossom, voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who produced \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d which co-starred Shaw. As Bea states at the outset, she no longer considers herself a kid given what she\u2019s endured, which makes the dual mission pretty overt \u2013 not just finding kids to go with these eccentric monsters, but helping the girl rediscover the wonders of childhood. In that latter regard, Krasinski conjures some touching, lovely moments, although they coexist awkwardly with the imperative to wring laughs and sight gags out of the computer-generated characters, which, however impressively they\u2019re rendered, has the effect of flattening the movie. In one respect, it\u2019s admirable that Krasinski would try to parlay whatever clout he\u2019s amassed into something more heartfelt, but that approach might have fared better by sparing the demands and expectations that go with lining up all those big names, lavish premieres, colorful character posters and marketing tie-ins. Simply put, it\u2019s a tough needle to thread. \u201cSometimes, life doesn\u2019t always have to be fun,\u201d Bea somberly tells her dad early on, as he tries to lift her spirits and allay her fears. \u201cIF\u201d does make the case for finding the fun in life, but in a movie that needs to be more fun than it is. \u201cIF\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/if-review-ryan-reynolds-john-krasinski/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_entertainment_hacks-season-3-finale", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The following contains spoilers about the \u201cHacks\u201d Season 3 finale, \u201cBulletproof,\u201d which premiered May 30. The third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d the Emmy-nominated Max comedy series, has in one respect felt strangely dated, with veteran comic Deborah Vance pursuing a late-night TV show as a capper to her career, at a time when those series have lost much luster from their heyday. Yet the show also contains what feels like a timeless lesson about Hollywood and doing anything to get ahead. The finale articulated that clearly, after Deborah (Jean Smart) lied to her writer/confidant Ava (Hannah Einbinder), telling her that the network had prevented her from installing Ava as the head writer on her show. As luck would have it, Ava had an encounter with the network boss (Helen Hunt), who made clear that choice belonged to Deborah, who later admitted as much, saying she didn\u2019t want to do anything that might risk her blowing this belated shot at late-night stardom. \u201cYou have to be selfish,\u201d she told Ava, adding, \u201cThis show has to be bulletproof, and it has to work. I\u2019ve lost way too much for it not to.\u201d While Ava\u2019s first impulse was to quit out of principle over Deborah\u2019s betrayal, the final scene marked a turning of the tables, with Ava blackmailing Deborah into giving her the head-writer position. When Deborah asks if she\u2019s willing to use that tactic to get what she wants, Ava responds pointedly, \u201cI would. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d What that means for their uneasy alliance going forward remains to be seen, although the two have experienced enough ups and downs that they seem unable to quit each other, for good or ill. Yet what \u201cHacks\u201d has nicely captured is the mix of narcissism and self-absorption that often feel like prerequisites to achieving show-business success, in this latest season somewhat mirroring another series set in the world of late-night TV, \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show,\u201d whose titular host (played by the late Garry Shandling) possessed all kinds of power that barely concealed his neuroses, descriptions that also applied to those around him. The irony is that \u201cLarry Sanders\u201d (which premiered in 1992 on HBO, while \u201cHacks\u201d occupies its streaming service, Max) came about during a very different time in late night, when the image of Johnny Carson as a comedy kingmaker still loomed over the business. The series made its debut a few months after Carson\u2019s final episode, playing as what became known as the \u201clate-night wars\u201d raged on. Today, names like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel still command prestige and respect, but the audience has dwindled among overwhelming audience fragmentation, and other late-night shows featuring James Corden and Samantha Bee have been swept away amid less hospitable economics for such fare. There\u2019s also a collegiality among the current hosts, who even teamed up during the writers strike, that bears scant resemblance to David Letterman and Jay Leno\u2019s famous feud. Although Deborah appears to be living in the past, \u201cHacks\u201d hasn\u2019t been, as evidenced by its penultimate episode, which dealt with the comic having to address the fallout from resurfaced old jokes that hadn\u2019t aged well, similar to the scenario that prompted Kevin Hart to withdraw as the host of the Oscars. Then again, after the show\u2019s Christmas episode, perhaps it\u2019s appropriate that \u201cHacks\u201d would find a way to live in the past, present, and to the extent these dynamics persist, maybe the future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/entertainment/hacks-season-3-finale/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_the-beach-boys-brian-wilson-music-documentaries", "text": "Streaming has yielded bounties in numerous areas, but nowhere more than in the field of music documentaries catering to Baby Boomers. Those projects have also been enriched not just by nostalgia for great acts but by weaving their soundtracks into the evolution of the culture through tumultuous times in the 1960s and \u201870s. Add two more projects to that tally this week: \u201cThe Beach Boys,\u201d an ode to the band that gave the world the surf sound and whose members, among other things, crossed paths with the Manson family; and \u201cStax: Soulsville USA,\u201d HBO\u2019s multi-part look at the Memphis music label that championed such artists as Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes. These productions have caught a different kind of wave, following \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back\u201d and Peter Jackson\u2019s more recent restoration of the Fab Four\u2019s \u201cLet It Be\u201d on Disney+; \u201cPaul Simon: In Restless Dreams\u201d (MGM+); Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Night in Pop,\u201d about the recording of \u201cWe Are the World\u201d in 1985; \u201cThank You, Good Night \u2013 The Bon Jovi Story\u201d (Hulu), and many more, among them an upcoming Cyndi Lauper documentary, \u201cLet the Canary Sing,\u201d on Paramount+. Despite advertisers\u2019 historic emphasis on reaching younger viewers, streaming services also rely on subscriptions, and Baby Boomers\u2019 money is as green as everybody else\u2019s. Beyond appealing to that demo, the documentaries create the opportunity to introduce these acts and their music to newer generations, while providing fresh insights for those weaned on them. \u201cThe Beach Boys,\u201d in particular, feels like a logical companion to Disney+\u2019s material on the Beatles, given the extent to which the two bands competed and fed off of each other\u2019s triumphs. As USC professor and cultural historian Josh Kun notes, the relationship between the bands was as much a collaboration as a rivalry, with Beach Boys songwriter/producer/troubled genius Brian Wilson drawing inspiration from John Lennon and Paul McCartney\u2019s creative output, and McCartney heralding Wilson\u2019s towering accomplishment, \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d as near perfection. Fueled by interviews with the surviving members, directors Frank Marshall (whose work in this space included \u201cThe Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\u201d) and Thom Zimny (a frequent Bruce Springsteen collaborator, including \u201cLetter to You\u201d) also enlist other musical luminaries to weigh in on the Beach Boys\u2019 influence and significance. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, for example, recalls crying when she first heard \u201cGod Only Knows,\u201d while Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Lindsey Buckingham discusses the tension between Wilson\u2019s creative ambitions and the commercial imperatives of a record label that didn\u2019t understand them. Wilson hated touring, retreating to the studio after experiencing what amounted to a breakdown on the road. After that, the Beach Boys essentially became two bands, one performing live and the other writing and fine-tuning songs back home. The Beach Boys\u2019 carefree image also proved out of tune with the Vietnam War. It was during those years when rifts formed and Dennis Wilson befriended Charles Manson, with band member Mike Love recalling that one encounter with the cult leader was enough for him. Discussing the band\u2019s internal dynamics, Love explains, \u201cI complemented Brian\u2019s melancholy with my upbeat-ness.\u201d \u201cThe Beach Boys,\u201d too, offers melancholy and nostalgia, and more than anything heightens appreciation for all those lingering vibrations, good and otherwise. As for \u201cStax,\u201d which premiered earlier this week on HBO, that story also conveys a combination of the sweet and sour, with the joy of the label\u2019s music offset by memories of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination and the shocking death of Redding in a 1967 plane crash, just before his \u201c(Sittin\u2019 On) the Dock of the Bay\u201d became a million-selling hit. Founded in 1957, Stax had to grapple with segregation and racism while building its profile, which, in one of the more enlightening sections, included an elaborate Oscar campaign for Hayes\u2019 theme from the movie \u201cShaft,\u201d as he became the first Black songwriter to win. Like Brian Wilson and Love, \u201cThe Beach Boys\u201d and \u201cStax\u201d complement each other, along with past documentaries that have covered similar territory, such as \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d Thanks to streaming, the road back to the music of the \u201860s and \u201870s is well traveled, but productions like these make those trips well worth taking. \u201cThe Beach Boys\u201d premieres May 24 on Disney+. \u201cStax: Soulsville USA\u201d is playing on HBO and Max, which, like CNN, are units of Warner Bros. Discovery.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/the-beach-boys-brian-wilson-music-documentaries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_entertainment_john-legend-sean-combs-allegations-amanpour", "text": "John Legend is speaking publicly for the first time about allegations against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who the former \u201cVoice\u201d coach collaborated with on a song that was released last year. In an interview released Thursday with CNN International\u2019s Christiane Amanpour to discuss his new podcast \u201cAfghan Star,\u201d Legend said that he was \u201chorrified by the allegations\u201d as well as \u201cby the video evidence that was released after that,\u201d in reference to the hotel surveillance footage obtained and published by CNN earlier this month showing Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a 2016 incident. \u201cI was horrified by the descriptions that I read before the video evidence came out,\u201d Legend added. \u201cAnd absolutely it\u2019s something that needs to be brought to light when it happens.\u201d The 2016 attack was first referenced in a November 2023 lawsuit that Ventura brought against Combs, whom she dated off and on from 2007 to 2018. Combs at the time denied the allegations outlined in Ventura\u2019s lawsuit \u2013 which was settled out of court one day after it was filed \u2013 months prior to the video\u2019s release. \u201cMy default stance is to believe women when they make these accusations and to make sure that we do whatever we can to support women\u201d making them, Legend said. He added that his hope is \u201cthat they\u2019re heard and that any kind of accountability and reparations can be made to make these women whole again.\u201d Legend also said that what Combs has been accused of is \u201cshameful\u201d and that he only wants \u201cthe best\u201d for Ventura and \u201cfor all the other victims that have alleged that he\u2019s abused them.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite a shame,\u201d the \u201cAll of Me\u201d singer said. \u201cI really just want accountability and hopefully some healing for all of his victims.\u201d Combs has been named in eight civil lawsuits including Ventura\u2019s now-settled 2023 complaint, all of which contain allegations of sexual assault. Outside of his video apology admitting to the 2016 attack on Ventura, Combs has denied the allegations, and seven of the cases remain active. Last year, Legend and Babyface collaborated with Combs on a song titled \u201cKim Porter\u201d \u2013 named after Combs\u2019 former partner with whom he shares three children \u2013 from Combs\u2019 2023 album \u201cThe Love Album: Off the Grid.\u201d Porter died in 2018 of pneumonia. Legend also spoke to Amanpour about his new podcast series \u201cAfghan Star,\u201d which tells the inspiring story behind the competition reality show of the same name that searched for talented singers across Afghanistan. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful story of the power of music, the power of the people\u2019s resilience, and a really remarkable show that was pretty revolutionary for its time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really captured the attention of the nation\u2026 I find the story inspiring, but also it really shows you the power of music and the power of the human spirit.\u201d \u201cAfghan Star\u201d first hit the airwaves in 2005 and went on to air 15 seasons. Legend credited the series as \u201cquite revolutionary\u201d for the country, saying that instruments were \u201cburned on the street\u201d in Afghanistan during the Taliban\u2019s reign prior to the show\u2019s debut. The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan\u2019s capital city almost two decades after they were driven from Kabul by US troops. \u201cMusic is not dead in Afghanistan right now, even though the Taliban\u2019s back in charge,\u201d Legend said. \u201cI think the spirit that was awakened and revived in Afghanistan by shows like \u2018Afghan Star\u2019 and other connections with music and entertainment, it\u2019s hard to put that back in the bottle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/entertainment/john-legend-sean-combs-allegations-amanpour/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Over the weekend, Sutter posted a photo on Instagram of her, husband Ryan Sutter and their two children enjoying some beach time and explained in the caption that people\u2019s worries were unnecessary. \u201cGeez people,\u201d she joked. \u201cCan\u2019t a girl have a nervous breakdown/trial separation/midlife crisis/death/divorce in peace around here?!\u201d \u201cIn all seriousness, for those concerned, I\u2019m safe and sound, happy and healthy, in love and grateful,\u201d Trista Sutter added. \u201cFor those who\u2019d rather focus on being critical and searching way too hard for darkness, good luck with that.\u201d It all began after Ryan Sutter wrote a Mother\u2019s Day post that revealed his wife was not celebrating the day with her family. \u201cI really wish I could talk to you. Ask you how you\u2019re doing? How was your day,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019d really like to hear your voice - just for a minute. So many times I\u2019ve called without much to say, not realizing how lucky I was or how much I\u2019d miss the opportunity if it were gone.\u201d He followed that post with one in which he clarified that he often writes his posts \u201cwithout regard for how they will be interpreted and with absolutely no intent to deceive or mislead anyone - that is the farthest thing from my mind.\u201d \u201cTrista is fine.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_back-to-black-review-marisa-abela-amy-winehouse", "text": "The tragic arc of Amy Winehouse\u2019s brief life and nova-like career creates built-in problems for a biography of the singer, which doesn\u2019t dampen the knockout performance by Marisa Abela in \u201cBack to Black,\u201d capturing the talent, rage and self-destructiveness that defined her. Thin as biopics go, the power of Abela\u2019s portrayal elevates the film, providing a poignance and strength that\u2019s the clearest motivation to go, go, go. Indeed, Winehouse\u2019s stratospheric rise and paparazzi-plagued stardom lean in the direction of a fairly one-dimensional story, as she falls head over heels for the troubled Blake (Jack O\u2019Connell), entering into a relationship that combines passion, excess and toxicity in roughly equal measure. At the same time, she\u2019s making her mark as a songwriter and singer, though her fondness for drink (and Blake\u2019s dalliances with drugs) goes hand in hand with that \u2013 tendencies that provoke less concern than they seemingly should from her father (Eddie Marsan) and colorful grandmother (Lesley Manville), a one-time jazz singer who isn\u2019t above telling tales out of school about the likes of Tony Bennett. Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (whose credits include the John Lennon biopic \u201cNowhere Boy\u201d as well as \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d) from a script by Matt Greenhalgh, \u201cBack to Black\u201d tilts too heavily toward Winehouse\u2019s personal struggles at the expense of her musical triumphs. Then again, as constructed here, the two went hand in hand, with the lyrics to songs like \u201cBack to Black\u201d and \u201cRehab\u201d directly addressing her addictions to her relationship with Blake and alcohol. Having appeared in the HBO series \u201cIndustry,\u201d Abela pulls off this remarkably challenging character both musically and dramatically, in a way that isn\u2019t necessarily sympathetic \u2013 to the extent Winehouse is often the author of her own troubles \u2013 but rather, magnetic. Ill-equipped for the demands of fame, she achieved it with sheer ferocity and talent, becoming the sort of commodity where the train\u2019s moving too fast to slow down much for warning signs. Of course, just making a movie about Winehouse invites charges of exploiting her tragic end at age 27 as opposed to celebrating her talent, but that\u2019s an issue that can be laid at the feet of any number of gone-too-soon musical biographies, from \u201cThe Doors\u201d to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d (The recent \u201cBob Marley: One Love\u201d was notably made with the blessing and participation of his family and felt like a licensed product.) In terms of capturing what animated Winehouse, the blinding star power that Abela emits here ultimately justifies the exercise. As for whether that means seeing \u201cBack to Black\u201d now in a theater or later at home, it\u2019s the kind of small-boned movie that, unlike its subject, doesn\u2019t quite have the feel of a headliner. \u201cBack to Black\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_baby-reindeer-you-stalking-netflix-cec", "text": "With Netflix\u2019s \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d captivating audiences \u2014 nearly 60 million viewers watched it in its first month \u2014 and the fifth and final season of \u201cYou\u201d set to release this year, stories about stalkers have clearly struck people\u2019s attention. But some experts warn that what you see on your screen isn\u2019t always representative of reality. Many Hollywood-ified dramatizations lean into storylines of extreme behaviors and sometimes don\u2019t include appropriate warnings, leading to misconceptions about what stalking actually is. For some victims, this could lead to more harm than good. Real-life stalking, experts say, can be more subtle than what is usually portrayed in popular media \u2014 though just as damaging and dangerous. How stalking is portrayed in popular media \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is a dramatized version of real events that happened to series creator and actor Richard Gadd. In the show, Gadd\u2019s character, Donny, meets Martha at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. The TV series \u201cYou,\u201d based on the 2014 novel of the same name, follows the perspective of stalker Joe Goldberg as he tracks, manipulates and murders his victims, often using romance and his good looks as a lure. Forensic psychologist Dr. Lorraine Sheridan says stalking is not always the cookie-cutter formula audiences are enthralled by. \u201cA lot of it (the media) is all killer, no filler. You don\u2019t get the more mundane aspects of stalking. You just get the really, really dramatic bits,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cThat means it is often quite misrepresented because the everyday, boring, hideous, demeaning, fear-inducing \u2014 but ultimately kind of predictably miserable \u2014 aspects of stalking does not make good TV.\u201d Gadd\u2019s story is real, but he says the version that appears in \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. \u201cI\u2019ve put out a statement publicly saying I want the show to be received as a piece of art, and I want the show to people (sic) to enjoy as a piece of art,\u201d Gadd told The Hollywood Reporter, speaking about those who aim to find the show\u2019s real life counterparts. \u201cI\u2019m called Donny Dunn. It exists in a sort of fictional realm, even though it\u2019s based on truth, it exists in a fictional realm, let\u2019s enjoy the world that I\u2019ve created.\u201d \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d comes with a standard post-credits disclaimer that says, \u201cThis program is based on real events; however certain characters, names, incidents, locations and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.\u201d One notable change is in the show: Martha is charged with three counts of harassment and stalking, found guilty and sent to prison. In real life, Gadd says the legal situation with his stalker was simply \u201cresolved.\u201d Stalking has always been a subject of popular media, even before many viewers can grasp the actual concept, since so much of it appears in content aimed at young people. In \u201cTwilight,\u201d the main character Edward breaks into his school crush Bella\u2019s room to watch her sleep. In \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d Emilio Estevez\u2019s character follows Andie MacDowell\u2019s character across town to crash her and her boyfriend\u2019s vacation. These representations can lead to confusion about what is stalking and what is romantic, according to the Stalking Prevention, Awareness and Resource Center (SPARC), which issued a discussion guide in 2019 that noted, \u201cRomantic films often include protagonists who are \u2018guys like Joe (Goldberg),\u2019 ones who stop at nothing to get the girl. Usually there is no negative consequence for their actions \u2014 in fact, the stalking is successful, and they persuade their initially reluctant romantic interests that they should be together.\u201d For its part in reducing victim blaming, Sheridan says that \u201cYou\u201d makes viewers \u201cquestion ourselves and (it) demonstrates how we can get taken in by somebody who is so cruel, selfish, sadistic and evil.\u201d Stalkers don\u2019t only take the shape of dashing, cunning men. In \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d Gadd\u2019s stalker is portrayed as unattractive and mentally ill \u2014 someone whom her victim actually feels sorry for. While both male and female fictional stalkers are portrayed as dangers, Sheridan notes\u00a0 that, typically, only women stalkers are portrayed in a way that gives audiences license to laugh and ridicule them. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth noting those more nuanced, less sensational, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to do something about this\u2019 kind of pieces of media (like \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cLover Stalker Killer\u201d) are both showing men as the victims,\u201d said Dana Fleitman, a SPARC training and awareness specialist. \u201cWhen we see women as victims, it is often on other networks that are a lot more campy (and) sensational.\u201d While 1 in 3 women will experience stalking in their lifetime, 1 in 6 men will as well, making it not a fully gendered issue. Some argue that stories where males are the victims may lend extra legitimacy to the problem. Anna Nasset, a stalking survivor and founder of Stand-Up Resources, watched \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d upon the recommendation of her colleagues and thought the show was \u201creally good.\u201d \u201cHaving the male victim in \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is going to do more than if the gender was switched. It just is,\u201d Nasset said. \u201cI hate to say it that way, but I think there\u2019s still that narrative of \u2018Well, this is just part of being a woman, this what you get!\u2019 Media portrayals of stalking aren\u2019t always accurate Media representations can also cause victims to believe they are not actually being stalked if\u00a0 their situation doesn\u2019t seem as severe as what they see on screen. \u201cStalking is very underreported and under-identified and so people kind of think they know what it is, but they\u2019re actually very unlikely to have received any sort of formal or real education on it. So, where are we learning what stalking is? It\u2019s often from these (media) misrepresentations,\u201d Fleitman said. Fleitman believes these dramatizations cause the public to confuse stalkers with sexy, romantic and heroic leads (much like Edward Cullen of \u201cTwilight\u201d) and think real-life victims are overreacting to a harmless, awkward attachment. With the exclusion of a US National Stalking Hotline and stalking public service announcements, Fleitman wishes there were more content warnings and resources around stalker-centered media so that audiences and organizations didn\u2019t have to do the bulk of the work. \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d rated TV-MA by Netflix for \u201clanguage, nudity, sex, sexual violence, substances,\u201d only has a viewer discretionary warning before \u201cEpisode 4\u201d wherein Gadd\u2019s character is sexually assaulted. In the series finale, the resource, wannatalkaboutit, pops up in the credits. Created by Netflix, it includes round tables and discussions guides of other Netflix shows and films, links to resources such as the National Suicide Hotline, Crisis Text and the Domestic Violence Hotline. Information is also available on sexual assault, sexual violence and relationship abuse. Yet no mention of stalking, despite it being the main subject matter of the show. Neither Netflix nor the \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d teams responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Nasset echoes that educating people about stalking is difficult but believes \u201cwe\u2019re on track\u201d to be able to have more public awareness around stalker-centered media, noting that content warnings or PSAs around sexual violence, which are now common, were rare as recently as 10 to 20 years ago. Fletiman calls stalking shows without PSAs and resources \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Sheridan argues that such efforts at public awareness are important, and reflect changing outlooks on what issues are worth talking about. \u201cI love the way the young people are standing up. I don\u2019t see it that they\u2019re soft and easily offended. I\u2019m seeing they\u2019re just not going to take that crap anymore and I\u2019m loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the PSAs, all the content warnings, bring it on. Because that comes with an opportunity for education as well.\u201d Fleitman also believes these stories have an opportunity: \u201cI think that the media can be a really good starting place for discussion, for learning, for empathizing with victims and survivors (and) for understanding stalking, but only if it\u2019s used that way.\u201d she said. The realities of stalking Stalkers are often imagined as hooded strangers in a secret lair but the reality is less dramatic \u2014 though just as scary. According to Fleitman, stalkers are more likely to be a current or past partner or acquaintance \u2014 a situation represented in both \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and \u201cYou.\u201d Stalking is about scaring or upsetting somebody, she says. SPARC defines stalking as \u201ca pattern of behavior directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress.\u201d Although the definition varies for different areas, Sheridan hopes to defy its notorious murkiness. \u201cA lot of things are hard to define. The bloody weather is hard to define, and people know what that is,\u201d she said. Fleitman hopes \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d can raise awareness for stalking victims, like men and so-called \u201cimperfect victims\u201d whose stories may not look like the ones we\u2019re used to seeing. The term \u201cimperfect victim\u201d refers to people who may be seen by those outside of the situation as not doing enough to prevent their abusers\u2019 actions \u2014 in some cases, they are even accused of doing something themselves to incite the stalker, such as not establishing boundaries or sharing too much private information. Fleitman said what someone chooses to share on the Internet can be seen as the new \u201cwell, what were you wearing?\u201d when it comes to stalking. The narrative enforces that victims are to be seen as blameless and innocent with no prior indiscretions of their own. Nasset often gets called a \u201cperfect victim\u201d because she was quick to report her situation to law enforcement, but she thinks the moniker is a \u201chorrible term.\u201d \u201c[A] stalker is going to do what the stalker is going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re trying to bargain with them or be nice to them, [it\u2019s] not necessarily going to change the trajectory.\u201d In fiction, stalking may make for tense drama, but in reality it is so insidious that it is often called \u201cslow motion homicide.\u201d And, indeed, stalking often ends with violence and death. 76% of intimate partner femicides included stalking in the year prior to their death and stalking increases the risk of intimate partner homicide by three times, according to SPARC. Nasset\u2019s stalker is currently serving 10 years in prison after being sentenced in 2019. He was a stranger who hung around her art gallery and began stalking her in 2011. Stalking is illegal in all US states and territories, but the topic is still under-researched and awareness resources are scant. In fact, stalking first became a crime in the US less than 35 years ago \u2014 in 1990 in the state of California. In Edinburgh, Scotland, where \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d takes place, harassment laws weren\u2019t introduced until 1997 before being amended in 2010 to more accurately reflect stalking\u2019s danger, validity and to call it out by name. This was just five years before the real-life Martha started stalking Gadd and four years before \u201cYou\u201d hit shelves in its first novel incarnation. While stalking makes for compelling storylines, the real-life issue is difficult to navigate. Representation in TV shows or movies could change this for the better by raising awareness about the nuances of predatory behavior. Or, it could perpetuate outdated and dangerous ideas about what stalking really is.

{"id": "2024_05_29_entertainment_sean-diddy-combs-federal-investigation", "text": "Federal investigators are preparing to bring accusers of music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs before a federal grand jury, two sources familiar with the probe tell CNN \u2014 signaling the US Justice Department is moving toward potentially seeking an indictment of Combs. Possible witnesses have been notified by investigators that they could be brought in to testify in front of a federal grand jury in New York City, according to one source. Bringing individuals who have filed civil lawsuits against Combs before a grand jury would mark a significant escalation in the government\u2019s ongoing investigation involving the producer and Bad Boy Records founder. Combs has been named in eight civil lawsuits since November \u2013 seven directly accusing him of sexual assault. One of the eight lawsuits, filed by former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, has been\u00a0settled. Another lawsuit\u00a0accused\u00a0his son Christian Combs of sexual assault, and Sean Combs is accused of aiding and abetting. A spokesperson for\u00a0the Homeland Security Investigations agency (HSI)\u00a0declined to comment on the existence of a grand jury,\u00a0but noted the investigation remains ongoing. These potential witnesses have not yet been prepped for testimony, both sources told CNN, cautioning that HSI investigators are still in the process of gathering evidence and questioning potential sources of information in their federal probe into Combs. One source said investigators are being thorough and taking their time to ensure that an indictment, should there be one, is \u201cbulletproof.\u201d Grand juries comprised of ordinary citizens are critical tools used by prosecutors, providing both an investigative function in approving the subpoenaing of documents and witnesses, and a vote on whether to criminally charge suspects. The use of a grand jury signals a particular case has moved beyond the preliminary stage where investigators generally assess whether possible violations of the law are believed to have been committed. Feds have interviewed multiple Combs accusers Combs\u2019 homes in Los Angeles and Miami were searched back in March. At that time, CNN reported that the rapper and entrepreneur was the target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security team that handles human trafficking crimes, and the ongoing investigation included a focus on sex trafficking, according to law enforcement sources. Now, additional sources told CNN that the majority of the plaintiffs who have filed civil suits against Combs have been interviewed by federal investigators. Combs has vehemently denied claims from many of the civil suits but has not responded to all of the allegations. In December 2023, after four lawsuits had been filed against him, Combs posted a fierce denial on his social media, writing that \u201csickening allegations\u201d had been made by accusers \u201clooking for a quick payday.\u201d \u201cLet me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.\u201d CNN previously reported in March, per a law enforcement source, that the investigation stems from many of the sexual assault allegations put forth in several of the civil lawsuits against Combs. CNN has learned that the scope of the investigation is much larger, focusing on sex trafficking, money laundering and illegal drugs. In addition to human trafficking, HSI also investigates narcotics smuggling and other organized criminal activity. \u201cIt\u2019s much bigger than just these lawsuits,\u201d one of the sources familiar with the scope of the investigation said. Federal investigators are now \u201cdigging deeper,\u201d and some of the accusers have been questioned numerous times, a source said. A second source corroborates this current state of the investigation. Accusers who have spoken to federal agents during the investigation have been actively cooperating with investigators, with some handing over evidence they believe may be helpful in the probe, one source said. Investigators are also bringing in new individuals for questioning, including corroborating witnesses of accusers. Evidence includes video from Combs\u2019 residences Federal agents are in possession of video taken inside of Combs\u2019 recently searched residences, a source said. It\u2019s unclear whether the video was seized during the raids, or whether investigators obtained video from individuals they have been questioning. \u201cThey are contacting people that they\u2019ve found on the tapes,\u201d a source told CNN. At least one male sex worker, who claims he has been victimized by Combs, has been questioned during the investigation, one source said, adding that this individual was seen in footage that is in possession of the federal investigators. In some of the lawsuits against Combs, accusers have alleged that they were informed, after the fact, that they were recorded having sex without giving their consent to be filmed. Combs has not responded to this specific accusation, but he dismissed all alleged wrongdoing in a blanket denial he posted in December 2023. In some of the civil suits, Combs is alleged of drugging multiple accusers. In the two most recent lawsuits filed against Combs within the past week, former fashion student April Lampros and former model Crystal McKinney both accused Combs of drugging them. In Lampros\u2019 suit, she claims that Combs forced her to take ecstasy and then demand she have sexual intercourse with one of his former girlfriends before raping her. Combs has not responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment since these two lawsuits were filed. Combs was also\u00a0accused in a civil suit filed last November of \u201cintentionally drugging\u201d and sexually assaulting Joi Dickerson-Neal back\u00a0in 1991, when she was a college student. Though his legal team has filed a motion to dismiss portions of this suit, Dickerson-Neal also accused Combs of \u201crevenge porn,\u201d claiming that Combs secretly recorded the sexual assault. Days later, a male friend revealed to Dickerson-Neal that he had viewed it, according to her claim.  Combs\u2019 team did not respond to specific allegations of drugging or secret recordings, but a spokesperson at the time said the complaint was \u201cmade up and not credible,\u201d discrediting the accusations as \u201cpurely a money grab.\u201d In their motion to dismiss, which is still pending, attorneys for Combs called Dickerson-Neal\u2019s allegations \u201cfalse, offensive, and salacious.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-federal-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_atlas-review-jennifer-lopez", "text": "Say what you want about Jennifer Lopez, but streaming algorithms surely love her, which accounts for her parade of recent movies \u2013 \u201cThe Mother\u201d (Netflix), \u201cShotgun Wedding\u201d (Amazon) and \u201cMarry Me\u201d (Peacock), all in the last two years. Add to that \u201cAtlas,\u201d a nonstop sci-fi action movie that basically gets the job done with a plot that recalls Disney\u2019s \u201cBig Hero 6,\u201d just with a lot more cursing. Although \u201cAtlas\u201d hinges on the now ever-popular \u201cartificial intelligence runs amok\u201d theme, that backdrop becomes a transparent excuse to set up a bonding exercise between Lopez\u2019s Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant data analyst who grew up with the AI robot Harlan (Simu Liu), who in turn has lead the rebellion against humanity. Atlas must then team up with another AI robot (voiced by Gregory James Cohan) in order to survive. The movie begins by racing through the devastating AI attack triggered by Harlan, before jumping 28 years into the future, when its title character gets recruited by a pair of military types (Mark Strong and Sterling K. Brown, both underemployed) regarding an opportunity to locate and stop him. After the obligatory chatter about her bad attitude and being ill-equipped for such a mission, she tags along, at which point the film becomes very Lopez-centric for an extended stretch. Of course, the idea of being forced to get to know the thing the protagonist hates and/or fears is a very old conceit, often explored through the prism of science fiction. In that respect, \u201cAtlas\u201d doesn\u2019t turn over new ground conceptually any more than it does with its robot design, which bears a strong resemblance to the oversized armored suits featured in \u201cAvatar\u201d or \u201cAliens,\u201d take your pick. Still, \u201cAtlas\u201d more than anything wants to operate as an action movie, and director Brad Peyton \u2013 a veteran of the Dwayne Johnson vehicles \u201cRampage,\u201d \u201cJourney 2: Mysterious Island\u201d and \u201cSan Andreas\u201d \u2013 keeps the story moving with a check-your-brain-at-the-door level of efficiency, relying on the shorthand of how familiar almost every beat of it feels. Netflix continues to lay down expensive bets on genre movies, with Zack Snyder\u2019s two-part \u201cRebel Moon\u201d among the more prominent recent examples. For her part, Lopez steps into a slightly different role \u2013 and wisely away from another rom-com \u2013 in her dual capacity as producer and star. While it\u2019s not entirely clear how the math works out on that, one needn\u2019t be a particularly brilliant data analyst to identify the boxes Netflix is hoping to check with the J-Lo + sci-fi equation. \u201cAtlas\u201d premieres May 24 on Netflix.

The frenetic and visceral nature of that yields a series of elaborate chases with relatively modest connective tissue holding them together. Spending almost as much time with younger versions of Furiosa as Taylor-Joy, the already-tough girl is quickly abducted from a haven called the Green Place \u2013 \u201ca place of abundance,\u201d as one of the raiders describes it \u2013 and taken to the warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth with an over-the-top lustiness that puts Thor to shame, even before factoring in the amusingly nasty prosthetic nose. Motivated by revenge and exposed to all the horrors the Wasteland can offer, Furiosa winds up operating among the three fortresses of that unyielding world, including one, the Citadel, presided over by the Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme), the nightmare-faced heavy who also appeared in 2015\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cFury Road.\u201d After a strong start, the action becomes a bit repetitive. And while the Mad Max series has never exactly been known for its intricate plotting, the centerpiece of those movies \u2013 \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d \u2013 built a credible foundation, stakes and framing device for the high-octane violence. Here, Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris structure the film in five numbered acts (roughly 30 minutes each), which adds to its already episodic quality, causing the few major characters to disappear for stretches. Similarly, a relationship between Furiosa and an intrepid driver named Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke, who played Orson Welles in \u201cMank\u201d) feels particularly tossed in from left field, though they do make a formidable pair in the carnage-causing department. Like her predecessors leading these movies, Taylor-Joy should be grateful she\u2019s not getting paid by the word, although she\u2019d clean up if her compensation was linked to glowering stares. The main challenge, really, involves treating Furiosa, with her limited screen resume, as the kind of figure to foster keen curiosity about, including the details that forged her. In some respects, \u201cFuriosa\u201d might be less significant for fleshing out the character originated by Charlize Theron than establishing a point of entry \u2013 and a Max-free one, no less \u2013 into one of those \u201cuniverses\u201d that all the cool studios yearn to create. (The film is distributed by Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.) Forty-five years after \u201cMad Max\u201d introduced many to a young Aussie named Mel Gibson, Miller certainly hasn\u2019t lost his touch as a visual stylist and mad maestro of elaborate action. In almost every other respect, this feels like one of those instances where there\u2019s more sound than \u201cFury.\u201d \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d premieres May 24 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_20_entertainment_bridgerton-staircase-scene-season-3", "text": "This article may contain spoilers for Bridgerton Season 3. Dearest gentle reader\u2026 By now, viewers have had time to watch the first four episodes of the highly anticipated third season of Bridgerton.\u00a0This season turned its focus to\u00a0the love story between Penelope\u00a0Featherington\u00a0(Nicola Coughlan) and\u00a0Colin Bridgerton\u2019s (Luke Newton), who the internet has lovingly nicknamed #Polin. After hearing Colin\u2019s disparaging words about her at the end of Season 2, Penelope decides to take a husband. Thinking it will help her chances with finding a match, she decides to get a makeover, starting with her clothes. In the first episode, \u201cOut of the Shadows,\u201d Penelope abandons her family\u2019s usual\u00a0bright citrus colors and lets her hair down. When she arrives at the ball wearing an ornate emerald gown, everyone in attendance turns their attention to her as she descends the stairs. That scene in particular was inspired by the 1999 romantic comedy, \u201cShe\u2019s All That,\u201d according to showrunner Jess Brownell. The movie features a scene in which geeky protagonist Laney Boggs, played by Rachael Leigh Cook, comes down the stairs to the song \u201cKiss Me\u201d following a makeover in which she trades her glasses for a pair of heels she can barely walk on. Brownell, told Final Draft\u2019s \u201cWrite On\u201d podcast that it was important to include a makeover scene in the season that pays homage to romantic comedies. \u201cRom-coms have been the movies that have informed\u00a0my approach to writing more than anything,\u201d Brownell said, also listing John Hughes films and \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d starring Patrick Dempsey. But the writing and producing team also wanted to give a fresh spin on the trope to avoid any pitfalls. \u201cWe talked a lot in the [writer\u2019s] room about the fact that the makeover trope can be problematic in a lot of ways \u2013 to suggest that a woman should just take off her glasses and let her hair down and instantly she\u2019s going to be so much more appealing.\u201d For \u201cBridgerton,\u201d Brownell says they decided to make the makeover about Penelope\u2019s internal journey and \u201cher need to find her confidence and step into her truth.\u201d The references to rom-coms didn\u2019t stop there this season. While the first two seasons portrayed the fake dating and enemies to lovers tropes, this season is all about two people going from friends to lovers. At one point, Colin decides to help Penelope\u2019s search for a husband by offering his advice, leading to several hilarious scenes in which she fails miserably at talking to potential suitors. But Penelope catches the eye of Lord Debling (Sam Phillips), causing a love triangle. The show also further develops its resident mean girl, Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen). Like your typical rom-com bully, Cressida has been a rival to other characters also searching for husbands. In Season 1, she threatened to spread a story about Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Bassett that would have damaged both of their reputations. This season, viewers see a more humanized version of Cressida as she desperately searches for a husband in her third year just like Penelope. If she doesn\u2019t find a husband this year, her parents will find one for her. \u201cNo mean girl is born a mean girl. There\u2019s always an origin story. We realize that Cressida, in fact, comes from a difficult home where her parents aren\u2019t nearly as loving as either the Bridgertons or even the Featheringtons,\u201d Brownell added. \u201cThere\u2019s room for some reflection and some growth in her as well.\u201d The first four episodes of Bridgerton Season 3 are now available to stream on Netflix.

Big and loud, with animated action aimed at kids, the film also loads up references to things like \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d \u201cTop Gun\u201d and \u201cFargo\u201d and still manages to feel as stale as a week-old lasagna left out too long in the summer. Part heist movie, part family reunion, the film draws upon the most salient characteristics of the flabby feline, but mostly as an excuse to build a story that seems to crawl further from its origins with every passing frame. A bevy of star voices (Chris Pratt leading the way in the title role, along with Samuel L. Jackson) can\u2019t enliven a project that, creatively speaking, exhausts at least four or five of its nine lives. Peaking during a pre-credit sequence, the film introduces a big-eyed baby Garfield (those plush toys aren\u2019t going to sell themselves) who gets abandoned by his dad, Vic (Jackson), a resourceful outdoor cat, and taken home by Jon (Nicholas Hoult), who even adopts Odie the dog to keep him company. Flash forward several years, and the grown and well-fed Garfield has his suburban bliss upended when he\u2019s abducted (catnapped?) by Jinx (Hannah Waddingham, in a mini-\u201cTed Lasso\u201d reunion with Brett Goldstein as one of her hench cats), using him as bait to lure Vic out of hiding and exact revenge. Said revenge involves forcing Vic and the resentful Garfield to team up on a milk heist from Lactose Farms, a setup that should make even dairy enthusiasts feel a trifle intolerant. In the process they encounter a lovelorn bull (Ving Rhames) and a security guard (Cecily Strong) named Marge who sure sounds a whole lot like her \u201cFargo\u201d namesake. A lot more happens, but it\u2019s all a transparent ploy to keep the audience distracted long enough for Garfield and Vic to engage in family bonding, and squabble over their \u201cThe Aristocats\u201d-style differences, which proves less heartwarming than intended. Part of the inherent challenge has to do with the demands of taking the simplicity of the original \u201cGarfield\u201d comic strip and blowing it up into something that can sustain this kind of enterprise, a task that feels especially thorny in this case. Traditionally, parents have looked for movies they can safely take kids to during the summer, and barring a few mildly racier gags, \u201cGarfield\u201d meets those modest criteria, at least, until reinforcements like the \u201cInside Out\u201d and \u201cDespicable Me\u201d sequels arrive. For anyone with an appetite for more than air conditioning and a PG rating, though, \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d is more like a stale snack than a fancy feast. \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d premieres May 24 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/entertainment/the-garfield-movie-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Bon Jovi was asked about the rumors that the couple had tied the knot during an appearance on the BBC\u2019s \u201cThe One Show\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re great,\u201d said Bon Jovi in response to being asked how the happy couple are. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely fantastic. It was a very small family wedding, and the bride looked gorgeous, and Jake is happy as can be. And yeah, it\u2019s true,\u201d he said, confirming reports of the wedding. The couple first shared news of their engagement in April 2023, and Brown, 20, told the story of how Bongiovi, 22, proposed in an appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jimmy Fallon in March. \u201cBasically, Jake and I bonded over diving. We love diving, we got our diving licenses together,\u201d said the \u201cStranger Things\u201d star, before explaining that his marriage proposal came underwater. \u201cHe gives me like a shell and I like, turn it over and it\u2019s a ring,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I like, looked at him and he was like,\u201d Brown said, mimicking Bongiovi talking under water. \u201cSo I was like okay,\u2019\u201d Brown said making the okay gesture. \u201cAnd I think it was underwhelming, but we freaked out.\u201d \u201cAnyway he puts the ring on my hand and as I go to show him the ring falls off my finger, plummets like, so fast, it was like a cinematic movie,\u201d Brown said. Bongiovi managed a deep dive to get the ring back. \u201cJake threw himself, like so deep, like the diver was like, \u2018You can\u2019t do that, like your ears \u2026 literally your brain will explode.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of who he is and I feel like we\u2019re always going to have each other\u2019s back and if anyone drops the ball, we got it,\u201d Brown said. And the couple have the backing of\u00a0Bon Jovi despite getting married at such a tender age. \u201cI don\u2019t know if age matters,\u201d he said during an appearance on\u00a0SiriusXM\u2019s \u201cAndy Cohen Live in May 2023. \u201cYou know, if you find the right partner and you grow together, I think that would be my advice really, is growing together is wise,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowing together and so I think that all of my kids have found the people that they think they can grow together with and we like \u2018em all.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/jake-bongiovi-millie-bobby-brown-wedding-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_entertainment_eminem-releases-houdini", "text": "Slim Shady is back, back again. But, apparently, not for long. Eminem appears to be killing off his alter ego in his latest project, an album titled, \u201cThe Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grace).\u201d He has dropped the album\u2019s first single, \u201cHoudini,\u201d which samples the Steve Miller Band\u2019s 1982 hit, \u201cAbracadabra.\u201d His lyrics take aim at several people, including Megan Thee Stallion and even himself. \u201cIf I was to ask for Megan Thee Stallion if she would collab with me, would I really have a shot at a feat?\u201d he raps, referencing Tory Lanez shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the feet in 2020, a crime for which Lanez was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Eminem also released a music video for the song in which he gets a little help from some of his celebrity friends. It opens with the 51-year-old rapper\u2019s music manager, Paul Rosenberg, leaving a seemingly less than positive voicemail about the new album before Eminem\u2019s mentor and frequent collaborator, Dr. Dre, tells him, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d The issue being a portal that allows time travel between the present and 2002. Cameos from 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg and Pete Davidson follow. Eminem battles it out with his younger-self in the video, which will remind fans of his 2002 \u201cWithout Me\u201d video. Recently a faux obituary appeared for his Slim Shady alter ego in his hometown newspaper, the Detroit Free Press. It referred to Slim Shady a \u201ca rogue splinter in the flourishing underground rap scene.\u201d \u201cThe Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr\u00e2ce)\u201d follows Eminem\u2019s 2020 album, \u201cMusic to Be Murdered By.\u201d The full collection of new music is set for release this summer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/entertainment/eminem-releases-houdini/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
