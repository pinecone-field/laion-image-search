{"id": "2024_07_01_entertainment_lost-abc-netflix", "text": "ABC was struggling to find hits in 2004 when the network introduced two of them: \u201cDesperate Housewives,\u201d a new take on a primetime soap opera; and \u201cLost,\u201d a sci-fi-tinged mystery that fast became a fan sensation, from its cryptic numbers to what really happened to that crashed plane and its passengers. Of the two, though, it was \u201cLost\u201d that fundamentally changed television and the relationship between the creative talent behind TV shows and the networks that carried them \u2013 fueling what might be called the novelization of television \u2013 not in the way the series began, but rather how it ended in 2010. The roots of that actually began several years earlier, when the show\u2019s executive producers, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, recognized that the twisty, mysterious series\u2019 ratings were beginning to suffer because of the open-ended nature of viewers\u2019 commitment. When would we get some answers, fans wanted to know. At their urging, in what Variety called a \u201cparadigm-shifting play,\u201d ABC allowed them to announce an official end date for the series, ordering 48 episodes over three seasons to complete the story. The announcement served notice that the series was indeed building toward something, that a payoff awaited those who were sinking all this time \u2013 and graduate-school-level thought and analysis \u2013 in the show, and what it all meant. Until then, the prevailing wisdom in television was, in essence, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. Series ran until the audience stopped watching them, not when the creators said, as if they were novelists who had reached the conclusion of the story. \u201cI think for story-based shows like \u2018Lost,\u2019 as opposed to franchise-based shows like \u2018ER\u2019 or \u2018CSI,\u2019 the audience wants to know when the story is going to be over,\u201d Cuse stated at the time, spelling out the novel comparison by adding, \u201cWhen J.K. Rowling announced that there would be seven \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 books, it gave the readers a clear sense of exactly what their investment would be. We want our audience to do the same.\u201d Producer J.J. Abrams, who co-created the series with Lindelof and Jeffrey Lieber, at the time called the decision \u201cthe right choice,\u201d crediting ABC for having \u201creal foresight and guts to make a call like this.\u201d Since then, arguably, a different kind of television has emerged and taken root, giving creative talent more latitude to decide the shelf life of their stories. That has included the growth of limited series that offer the promise of closure and finality, creating arcs with a clear beginning and end. Others followed that example, from \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d with its two-season conclusion, to \u201cStranger Things,\u201d to most recently \u201cThe Boys,\u201d which announced that superhero satire\u2019s fifth season will wrap up the story. That equation has made TV richer and more ambitious, as well as able to wrestle with different kinds of serialized storytelling. In the immediate aftermath of that, the children of \u201cLost\u201d \u2013 plentiful at first, as they always are when something unexpectedly succeeds \u2013 benefited from that appetite, as networks ordered more projects with mysteries baked into them, even if few of them could live up to its promise. Tellingly, even \u201cLost\u201d didn\u2019t stick the landing, yielding a finale that answered many of its questions but felt frustrating in its resolution. Knowing when to end isn\u2019t exactly the same as knowing how. By then, though, the show\u2019s legacy was secure. Bringing that full circle, all 121 episodes of the show are appropriately landing on Netflix, where they can be rediscovered \u2013 and binged in a more concentrated fashion \u2013 by those who don\u2019t have to wait years to see how it all ends. Welcome to the 2020s. The \u201cLost\u201d finale might not have conjured an ending worthy of all the hype. By then, though, it had helped point TV toward a new approach to telling stories, which, never mind the numbers (for the record, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42), might be the formula that really matters the most. \u201cLost\u201d premieres July 1 on Netflix in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/entertainment/lost-abc-netflix/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_beverly-hills-cop-axel-f-review-eddie-murphy", "text": "\u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d spawned a trio of movies, but more significantly, the 1984 film capped off a string of hits (after \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d and \u201cTrading Places\u201d) that launched Eddie Murphy into the movie-star stratosphere. As Murphy moves into the encores-for-streaming phase of his career (see \u201cComing 2 America\u201d), enter \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\u201d which features enough unapologetic nostalgia (cue the music) to power through its flat spots. The fact that the film is premiering via Netflix, as opposed to theaters, might warrant some second-guessing given the box-office numbers that the latest \u201cBad Boys\u201d sequel has delivered, but that\u2019s a debate for another day. From the get-go, the star appears up to the task as he slides back into a role to which he said goodbye 30 years ago, and introduced a decade before that. As with \u201cComing 2 America,\u201d \u201cAlex F\u201d uses a next-generation hook to get into the story and create the excuse to bring Murphy\u2019s Axel Foley from Detroit (after an introductory action sequence that goes on a bit too long) back to Beverly Hills, reuniting him with lots of familiar faces. In this case, he\u2019s summoned by Billy (Judge Reinhold) to help Axel\u2019s estranged daughter, Jane (Taylour Paige, who followed \u201cHit the Floor\u201d with \u201cZola\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d), a lawyer representing a client who has triggered a warning to back off from some very bad people. Before you can say \u201cGet the f\u2014k outta here\u201d (which is, not surprisingly, said several times), Axel lands in L.A., cheerfully insisting, \u201cThey love me in Beverly Hills!\u201d Staying on brand, he quickly irks the local authorities as he sets about protecting Jane, while running afoul of a corrupt detective played by Kevin Bacon (one of two movies in which he appears this week, the other being \u201cMaXXXine\u201d). Axel also gets teamed up with a younger cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has some history with Jane, although frankly \u2013 other than \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s hilarious cameo as a Beverly Hills realtor \u2013 the newcomers don\u2019t stand much of a chance to register as holdovers like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and John Ashton join Reinhold in dropping by. In perhaps the wisest (and easiest) decision, first-time feature director Mark Molloy relies heavily on music associated with the original movies, from Harold Faltermeyer\u2019s electronic score to songs like \u201cThe Heat is On\u201d and \u201cNeutron Dance,\u201d augmented by a new one from Lil Nas X. In the early going, a younger colleague in Detroit points out that Axel continues to hit the streets at a time when \u201cguys your age\u201d are transitioning to desk jobs, which basically spells out the formulation here, and how Murphy effectively carries off the same mentality as his alter ego. \u201cAxel F\u201d only turns up the heat to a low simmer, but as breezy escapism goes, those armed with the proper attitude might find themselves doing the neutron dance, or a version of it, all over again. \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.

{"id": "2024_07_08_entertainment_streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros", "text": "Streaming appears poised to undergo what some have called \u201cThe Great Re-Bundling,\u201d with services merging, combining or forming alliances that will essentially reconstruct the cable \u201cbundle\u201d that consumers relied upon for decades. While that makes sense for studios eager to offer \u201cmore robust and streamlined content,\u201d as Disney CEO Bob Iger said earlier this year, subscribers have every reason to wonder \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?,\u201d and if all these high-stakes corporate announcements will really benefit them. Will it make access to at-home viewing options cheaper? More plentiful? Easier to navigate and find what you want? Less of a chore to manage in terms of juggling multiple subscriptions? That\u2019s the goal, but honestly, we can\u2019t really know. The latest news to ripple through the streaming front involved reports Paramount, prior to moving forward on its merger with Skydance, looking to combine its Paramount+ with another service. Max, the HBO-centered provider from CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery, was among those cited as potential partners. Such an arrangement would follow the formal announcement in February of Venu Sports, a joint sports offering consisting of Disney\u2019s ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros.; Disney\u2019s intra-studio attempt to create a mega-service to subscribers who ante up for its trio of services: Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+; and Disney\u2019s collaboration plan with Warner Bros. on a bundle consisting of Disney+, Max and Hulu. The advantages for the companies, as they seek to compete with Netflix and the tech giants (Amazon and Apple foremost among them) that have helped crowd the streaming waters, aren\u2019t certain, but the objectives seem clear, beginning with the hope these combined or consolidated services will reduce churn \u2013 that is, people signing up and cancelling and signing up again. What has become increasingly obvious, though, is for all the knocks on cable, starting with the fact consumers paid for lots of channels they never watched, its one-stop-shopping approach eliminated some of the challenges springing up now. That old system worked because the \u201cbundle\u201d actually created a mechanism to financially support a vast number of choices serving various tastes. Simply put, paying for ESPN if you don\u2019t like sports, or CNN and MSNBC if you don\u2019t watch news, might have been irritating, but those millions of cable subscriptions spread out the revenue in a way that made dozens and dozens of channels available and affordable. The dream of a more a la carte system, where you pay for what you watch, has turned out to elusive, primarily because there\u2019s no way \u2013 at least yet \u2013 to adopt that where the cost doesn\u2019t become onerous, and maybe even prohibitive, for many consumers. Unwinding the bundle by \u201ccord cutting\u201d on cable subscriptions might have felt good, but in terms of the industry\u2019s economics, that shift opened Pandora\u2019s box. While Disney or Paramount\u2019s profits need not concern consumers, the ability of those companies to produce and present TV shows and movies people want to see does. After cutting the cord, stitching it back together in a different form through re-bundling comes with question marks, and risks. Just ask newspapers that once delivered a physical bundle that landed on people\u2019s doorsteps before the digital age upended their business model. The promises made by executives like Iger, who called Venu \u201ca major win for sports fans,\u201d might very well work out. In theory, consumers could indeed be spared some of the \u201cannoyance and decision-making,\u201d as Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle wrote, associated with keeping track of a half-dozen streaming services, adding that\u2019s \u201cwhy so many consumers prefer things like all-inclusive vacations, and why bundling is a common business practice.\u201d Still, when it comes to implementing structural changes in how entertainment gets distributed and consumed, an adage well known to most Disney characters remains worth remembering: Be careful what you wish for.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/entertainment/streaming-great-rebundling-disney-warner-bros/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_entertainment_alec-baldwin-trial-key-people", "text": "It\u2019s a role actor Alec Baldwin presumably never wanted: Defendant. Baldwin will stand trial in New Mexico beginning this week. He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna\u00a0Hutchins, who was shot on set as Baldwin and others were rehearsing a scene for their film \u201cRust.\u201d The one count\u00a0against Baldwin is described in court documents as \u201cnegligent use of a firearm.\u201d An alternative count alleges Baldwin caused Hutchins\u2019 death without due caution or circumspection, as \u201can act committed with the total disregard or indifference to the safety of others.\u201d With testimony expected to start as early as Wednesday, here are some of the key figures connected to the trial. Halyna Hutchins A journalist turned promising cinematographer, Hutchins was 42 at the time of her death. A native of Ukraine, Hutchins worked as an investigative journalist with British documentary productions in Europe, where she did feature documentaries for the BBC and Discovery. She lived in New York City, where she found a love for photography, before moving to Los Angeles. After taking a UCLA extension course for directing Hutchins quickly figured out she loved cinematography more than directing, according to an interview for \u201cWhy Women Are Excelling in Hollywood\u201d\u00a0posted on YouTube months before her death.\u00a0 Hutchins is survived by her husband, Matthew, and their young son. Alec Baldwin Baldwin, 66, held the prop gun that fired a live round of ammunition that hit Hutchins on October 21, 2021. The gun had been announced as \u201ccold\u201d or unloaded on set, according to investigation documents, before the Colt 45 was handed to Baldwin. The director of the movie told authorities that Baldwin was practicing drawing his gun when it was fired, according to information in 2021 affidavit for a search warrant. \u201cThat she died, that\u2019s the worst thing of all. Somebody died, and it was avoidable. It was so unnecessary,\u201d Baldwin said of Hutchins\u2019 death in a 2022 interview with CNN. \u201cEvery day of my life I think about that. \u201d The Academy Award-nominated actor is also among the producers on the western drama \u201cRust.\u201d Prosecutors contend Baldwin improperly handled the gun on the Bonanza Creek Ranch set. Luke Nikas Nikas is serving as Baldwin\u2019s lead defense attorney. He is employed by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan LLP, which is one of the largest law firms in the world. Nikas is a graduate of Harvard Law School and based in New York. He has filed several motions to dismiss the case on behalf of Baldwin, the most recent of which was denied last week. Nikas has previously told CNN they \u201clook forward\u201d to their day in court. Kari Morrissey Morrissey is the lead special prosecutor who will present the state of New Mexico\u2019s case against Baldwin. She has practiced law in the state for more than 20 years. Morrissey took over the case in 2023, dropped the charges against Baldwin and then later refiled them, citing \u201cadditional facts\u201d in the case. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer Marlowe Sommer was appointed to the First Judicial District Court in 2010 by then-New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson. Prior to becoming a judge, she served as a court clerk, defense attorney and a hearing officer. She presided over the high-interest trial of Hannah Gutierrez Reed, during which she kept to a succinct schedule. Hannah Gutierrez Reed Hannah Gutierrez Reed was the armorer for \u201cRust.\u201d She was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March for Hutchins\u2019 death and sentenced to 18 months in prison, the maximum possible punishment. \u201cI did not hear you take accountability in your allocution. You said you were sorry but not (that) you were sorry for what you did,\u201d Judge Marlowe Sommer said in announcing her sentence. \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon,\u201d the judge said. \u201cBut for you, Ms. Hutchins would be alive, a husband would have his partner and a little boy would have his mother.\u201d Joel Souza Souza, the director and screenwriter of \u201cRust\u201d film, was also shot on set in the 2021 incident. \u201cIt felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to my shoulder, I remember that distinctly,\u201d Souza testified in the Gutierrez Reed trial. Souza had been standing directly behind cinematographer Hutchins, trying to get a closer look at the shot in the film\u2019s camera. \u201cI distinctly remember (Hutchins) being lowered to the ground, people had her sort of on either side. I still didn\u2019t know what had happened. Nothing made sense,\u201d he testified. \u201cI remember initially thinking, \u2018Had she been startled by it?\u2019 and then I saw the blood on her back.\u201d David Halls Halls was the assistant director on \u201cRust\u201d who handed Baldwin the firearm on set the day Hutchins and Souza were shot. Halls signed a plea agreement\u00a0in 2023 \u201cfor the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon.\u201d Prosecutors said the terms of his deal included six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/entertainment/alec-baldwin-trial-key-people/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_06_entertainment_jennifer-allen-celebrity-weddings-love-is-blind", "text": "Jennifer Allen not having her dream wedding inspired her to help others achieve theirs. She is the founder of \u201cJust Elope,\u201d a Dallas-based \u201celopement and popup wedding specialists\u201d company. If she looks familiar, it\u2019s because she\u2019s served as an officiant at some high profile weddings, including that of rapper/TV personality Da Brat and entrepreneur Jesseca Dupart as part of their WE reality series \u201cBrat Loves Judy.\u201d She was also featured on Season 3 of Netflix\u2019s hit series \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Allen told CNN she and her now-husband Tavarous Allen were young and in a hurry to marry in 2010 before he was deployed in the military. \u201cHe said, \u2018We should get married before I leave,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\u201d she recalled, chuckling at the memory. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018The only thing that we can do is go to Vegas or go to City Hall. I do not want to get married at City Hall. We cannot afford to go to Vegas, so that\u2019s not an option.\u2019 And so I started looking online to see what I could find.\u201d What she found were no options in between, so the couple ended up getting married at City Hall which she now says was \u201cunderwhelming\u201d before her husband shipped out hours later. The lack of choices inspired Allen to start a business for other couples who \u2013 like she and her husband \u2013 had dreams of a special day that were bigger than their resources. Even those who plan a bigger wedding later deserve to make memories in the moment, she said. \u201cOne of the things that I always tell our couples when they say we\u2019re going to do something small now with a big wedding later, I always tell them, you gotta look at it like losing your virginity,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIf you lost your virginity in the back of a pickup truck and you had sex the next time in a hotel room, it does not change the fact that you lost it in the back of a pickup truck.\u201d That type of straight talk, as well as the attention to both detail and the desires of her clients, has helped Allen build a reputation that has led to her helping over 400 couples. It also led to her being enlisted to officiate over the potential wedding ceremony of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 3 contestants Sikiru \u201cSK\u201d Alagbada and Raven Ross (contestants \u201cdate\u201d without seeing each other and on their wedding day have the option to either wed or not on the show, and Alagbada opted not to). Allen enjoys helping put together weddings that can range from the $500 package her company offers to more elaborate affairs for brides like Jaqui Rice Gold, chief executive officer of G.O.A.T. Fuel and daughter of Hall of Fame football player Jerry Rice. \u201cI tell people our business is not for necessarily the budget buy, because she\u2019s a prime example of somebody that could have had a multimillion dollar wedding if she wanted to,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut she booked her package, paid her deposit, made her final payment 30 days before and used all of our references because we tell you where you should go to get your dress, hair, makeup and the rest.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/entertainment/jennifer-allen-celebrity-weddings-love-is-blind/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_entertainment_the-man-with-1000-kids-netflix-review", "text": "Netflix has enjoyed success with a certain kind of nightmare-fuel docuseries that strains various aspects of society through fun-house mirrors. \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d fits right in, down to the title, although the headline on the New York Times article that preceded this UK production, \u201cThe Case of the Serial Sperm Donor,\u201d surely would have worked equally well. The chosen title does have the advantage of evoking a movie, \u201cMan of a Thousand Faces,\u201d a biography of the silent-film star and horror staple Lon Chaney. It is also imprecise, or at best an estimate, since as the Times reported, the actual number of children fathered by Jonathan Jacob Meijer, a Dutch musician, \u201cis impossible to say,\u201d with a Dutch organization stating the total \u201ccould run to several hundred, even 1,000,\u201d while Meijer put the figure at \u201capproximately 250.\u201d Whatever the math, the bottom line of the story is certainly attention-getting: Meijer agreed to provide sperm to a number of families, outside of conventional donation channels as well as through traditional ones, leaving parents feeling misled and outraged, betrayed and defrauded, upon learning the truth. Meijer also traveled the world, providing donations in multiple countries, making a full count of the children with his DNA extraordinarily difficult to obtain. Lacking many options to take action, the parents finally went to court, seeking to prevent him from donating to anyone else. Produced by the makers of \u201cLover, Stalker, Killer,\u201d \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d begins in almost whimsical fashion, interviewing various parents \u2013 from single mothers to lesbian couples to a man who, after his second marriage, couldn\u2019t have his vasectomy reversed \u2013 who found Meijer online, liked the image he presented and availed themselves of his services. Eventually, though, enthusiasm gave way to rising anger and efforts to stop him, as well as plenty of questions, still largely speculative, about what motivated him and others to far exceed established donor guidelines. (Meijer declined to participate in the documentary but told the Times in 2021 that his goal was \u201cto help parents with realizing their dream.\u201d) Like so many of these sensational documentaries \u2013 including \u201cOur Father,\u201d a Netflix project about an Indiana fertility specialist who used his own sperm to inseminate patients, or HBO\u2019s \u201cBaby God\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d raises questions about the fertility industry, and its regulation, that go beyond individual cases to consider ethical and logistical concerns through an extreme lens. While the numbers might not be completely accurate, in terms of appealing to an audience weaned on sensational titles like \u201cThe Tinder Swindler\u201d and similar fare, this feels right on target. \u201cThe Man With 1000 Kids\u201d premieres July 3 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/entertainment/the-man-with-1000-kids-netflix-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_entertainment_taylor-swift-travis-kelce-anniversary", "text": "Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift\u2019s love affair is \u201cso high school\u201d in the best way. Not only have they given fans and followers something to be dreamy about, but there\u2019s also the anticipation of whether Kelce will put a ring on it (and not one of his Super Bowl championship ones). Here\u2019s a look back at the alchemy that got us to this era: July 2023 Kelce is very familiar with Kansas City\u2019s Arrowhead Stadium since that\u2019s where his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, play. But on July 8, 2023, he was there for a different reason \u2013 to see Swift perform as part of her \u201cEras Tour.\u201d A few weeks later he shared the story on his podcast \u201cNew Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce,\u201d which he co-hosts with his brother, about how he had attempted to get Swift his phone number via a Swiftie-style friendship bracelet. \u201cI was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\u201d he told the world after his brother Jason asked about attending the concert. \u201cSo I was a little butthurt I didn\u2019t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it,\u201d Kelce said. When Jason asked if his brother meant his jersey number or his phone number, the Kansas City tight end quipped, \u201cYou know which one.\u201d September 2023 From there, Kelce found himself fielding questions about what, if anything, was going on between him and Swift. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna talk about my personal life,\u201d he said during an interview with NFL+ host Andrew Siciliano. That didn\u2019t stop the speculation that the pair were dating, and Kelce shared during an appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d that he had invited Swift to watch him play. \u201cI threw the ball in her court,\u201d the football player said. \u201cI told her, \u2018I\u2019ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead.\u2019 We\u2019ll see what happens in the near future.\u201d Swift eventually took him up on it and appeared at his game on September 24, sitting next to his mother, Donna Kelce, in the family suite. Swifties, as her hardcore fan base is known, promptly lost it, heralding the kickoff of mania over the pair. October 2023 The NFL began leaning in to \u201cTraylor,\u201d \u201cTayvis,\u201d \u201cSwelce\u201d or whatever you choose to use as their couple nickname.  The league\u2019s official X account posted about her plenty when on October 1 Swift and some of her famous friends including Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds cheered Kelce and his team on against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. Everyone felt swept up in the excitement over the two, and Donna Kelce told CNN that all the attention surrounding her son and Swift felt \u201cunreal.\u201d \u201cI tell everyone that it\u2019s kind of like an alternate universe that I just happened to be in,\u201d Donna Kelce said. \u201cLike, I went through a third wall into another dimension. That\u2019s what it feels like.\u201d And in a case of \u201cwe can show you better than we can tell you,\u201d Kelce and Swift appeared to confirm their coupledom when they were photographed holding hands in New York City after they both made separate surprise appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d season 49 premiere on October 14. Swift gave definite girlfriend vibes a week later when she and Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, showed off their special handshake during a successful Chiefs play against the Los Angeles Chargers. Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes are besties as well as teammates. November 2023 There was no doubt that Swift and Kelce were indeed a couple once he traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, for her November 11 \u201cEras Tour\u201d stop. Not only was Kelce there with Swift\u2019s dad, she swapped the \u201cKarma\u201d lyric \u201cKarma is the guy in the screen coming straight home to me\u201d \u2013 which many thought was about her ex-boyfriend actor Joe Alwyn \u2013 for \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.\u201d And if that wasn\u2019t swoon-worthy enough, video of her running off stage into Kelce\u2019s arms for a smooch had those rooting for the superstar singer to find her person singing \u201cIt\u2019s a love story, baby, just say \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d Later that month Kelce was the cover star of WSJ Magazine\u2019s and opened up about their relationship.  \u201cObviously I\u2019ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them\u2026. I\u2019ve never dealt with it,\u201d Kelce told the publication of Swift\u2019s life in the spotlight. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it\u2026. The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.\u201d December 2023 Kelce wasn\u2019t the only one willing to talk about their relationship. Swift was named Time magazine\u2019s 2023 \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d and in an interview with the publication, she cleared up speculation that they became official at that first September football game she attended. \u201cBy the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,\u201d she told Time. She added, they \u201cwould never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date\u201d in the public sphere like that. Makes sense. January 2024 Not only did Kelce and Swift ring in the new year together with a sweet kiss, but she also met his brother Jason for the first time. The then-Philadelphia Eagles center and his wife Kylie Kelce hung out with Swift during the Chiefs\u2019 playoff game against the Buffalo Bills, Suffice it to say, Jason Kelce made quite the impression as he stripped off his shirt, guzzled beer and hopped out of the suite window to have some fun with the fans. Afterwards the brothers talked about it during an episode of their podcast and Jason Kelce said his wife had warned him to be on his \u201cbest behavior\u201d for his first meet up with his beloved brother\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cI was like, \u2018Kylie, the first day I met you I was blackout drunk and fell asleep at the bar,\u201d he said during the podcast. \u201cThis is part of the charm. This is part of the Jason Kelce charm. I wanna make my best first impression.\u2019\u201d It apparently worked as Travis Kelce told him, \u201cTay said she absolutely loved you.\u201d February 2024 Love was in the air the month of Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 not just between Swift and her boyfriend, but for his sports fans. His team made it once again to the Super Bowl, which allowed the NFL to further cash in given that Swift had been boosting ratings with her attendance at the games. And while some thought the league was overdoing it with all the shots of the singer during the games, Mama Kelce was excited for the new audience Swift was attracting. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that more and more people are embracing the NFL. I love sports. I especially love football because my boys have been doing it for so long,\u201d Donna Kelce told CNN at the time. \u201cI truly believe that it\u2019s bringing families closer. Sports tends to do that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve gotten letters, texts and comments when I\u2019m in the airport about how fathers are so happy that their daughters are finally coming to them to try to understand the game,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they couldn\u2019t have thought that would have ever happened before now.\u201d Her son Travis and his Chiefs went on to win the Super Bowl, their third in five years and their second in a row. And because we must know how did it end, Swift and Kelce gave us that movie moment when he turned from celebrating with his mother, told Swift \u201cCome here girl,\u201d and the pair embraced and exchanged a few kisses on the field. There was much partying and Swift even joked in a TikTok video about ending up in a nightclub with her parents as they celebrated the historic win. Later that month Kelce thrilled concertgoers in Australia when he flew out to join her when she played her Sydney tour stop. April 2024 Good luck remembering who played Coachella because all eyes were on Swift and her man as they enjoyed the annual music festival. It was so serious that a video of a lip reader trying to interpret what the couple said to each other while they jammed went viral. But that was nothing compared to the excitement when Swift dropped her new album \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d on April 19. Immediately, Swifties were trying to decode which songs/lyrics might be about Kelce. The singer scored with all the sports references in her track \u201cThe Alchemy,\u201d which led many to believe that the song about having an intense attraction to a new lover was inspired by Kelce. \u201cSo when I touch down/Call the amateurs and/Cut \u2018em from the team/Ditch the clowns, get the crown/Baby I\u2019m the one to beat,\u201d Swift sings. \u201cCause the sign on your heart/Said it\u2019s still reserved for me/Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?\u201d May 2024 Kelce proved to be Swift\u2019s number one fan and revealed his favorite Swift \u2018era.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m a big \u20181989\u2019 fan,\u201d Kelce told \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d during his second annual Kelce Jam music festival. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie, I may be a little biased towards \u2018The Tortured Poets Department.\u2019 Just a little bit.\u201d The pair also enjoyed a romantic vacation in Lake Como, Italy, while Swift was on break from the European leg of her Eras Tour. June 2024 Speaking of Europe, Swift posted a selfie of her, Kelce, Prince William and his two oldest kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, from her London concert, which also counted as his first Instagram-official shot on her feed. Kelce wasn\u2019t just along for the ride, it turns out. He made his debut at her Wembley Stadium concert in London where he donned a top hat and tails for a cameo on stage with Swift. Swift posted about her performance at the stadium, writing, \u201cAnd I\u2019m still cracking up/swooning over @killatrav\u2019s Eras Tour debut.\u201d July 2024 Kelce gave us the behind the scenes of his surprise debut, sharing on his podcast that \u201cIt was an absolute blast.\u201d \u201cIt was such a fun, playful part of the show and it was like the perfect time for me to go up there, just be a ham and have some fun, not only with [Swift]\u2026 but the crowd and really try and get everybody excited for the rest of the show,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was awesome.\u201d His main focus? Not to fumble. \u201cThe golden rule was \u2018Do not drop Taylor. Get her to the couch safe,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cDo not drop the baby\u201d is what he thought, and as usual, Kelce won.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/entertainment/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-anniversary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

While consensus seems to be that a lot of what pop culture has brought forth thus far in 2024 has been a bit \u201cmeh,\u201d there have also been standouts, triumphs and attention-getting titles worth of celebrating. Here\u2019s our list of some the year\u2019s best performances and content so far: MOVIES Best (or, most chillingly effective) cameo - Jesse Plemons in \u2018Civil War\u2019 The Oscars \u201cconversation\u201d already includes \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star Plemons delivering a brief performance so menacing, it calls to minds the scant 24 minutes Anthony Hopkins spent on screen before clinching an Academy Award for \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d Plemons\u2019 demented \u201csoldier\u201d in a crumbled and war-torn version of the near-future US, dispensing life and death with callous disdain, more than drives home the point filmmaker Alex Garland was trying to make with his latest movie. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how \u201cCivil War\u201d star Kirsten Dunst \u2013 who is married to Plemons in real life \u2013 felt comfortable going home with him after shooting his scene. Best genre-defying comedy -\u00a0\u2018Problemista\u2019 Writer, director and actor Julio Torres is an exceptional cinematic voice who has actually been around for awhile, creating excellent content for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and series such as \u201cLos Espookys\u201d and the soon-to-be released \u201cFantasmas.\u201d \u201cProblemista,\u201d which won acclaim at several festivals in 2023, features Torres as a toy designer from El Salvador trying to find opportunities to unleash his creative vision in the US, while also figuring out a way to stay in the country. He runs into both expected roadblocks as well as ones that are frustratingly inane, like a poorly designed grant website with a broken drop-down menu that makes it impossible for anyone located outside of country to apply. With artfully realized details like that, \u201cProblemista\u201d does the remarkable job of remaining universally engaging while exploring a very specific and individual experience. Plus, Tilda Swinton turns in one of her best idiosyncratic and delightfully deranged performances opposite the gifted Torres. Best meet-cute -\u00a0\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Not since \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d has Anne Hathaway captured the zeitgeist like this, and we\u2019re here for it. In \u201cIdea,\u201d she has a run-in at Coachella with It-Boy Nicolas Galiztine (of \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d and \u201cMary & George\u201d fame) that is so silly, and so disarming, it\u2019s hard not to go along for the gender-flipped \u201cNotting Hill\u201d (plus a few age-gap years) that follows. Other reasons to watch include the music performance scenes (the fictional boy band in the film isn\u2019t so fictional in that it was essentially created for the movie and has actually released music) and Hathaway\u2019s character\u2019s positively enviable Los Angeles enclave. Best visuals\u00a0- The Harkonnens in \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 It\u2019s getting harder and harder to dazzle with a truly original vision on the silver screen, but Denis Villeneuve pulls it off in his epic sci-fi sequel, which had been drastically delayed for a variety of reasons but finally dawned in the theaters this past spring. The sequences depicting the villainous Harkonnens \u2013 mostly monochromatic and overexposed to create an off-putting yet hypnotic ambiance \u2013 simply look like nothing else, and succeed in imparting a foreboding and terrifically extraterrestrial feel. Actor Austin Butler\u2019s improvised kiss planted on his uncle Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) helps as well. Honorable mentions: Best sports-infused romance/romance-infused sports movie\u00a0- \u201cChallengers\u201d Best use of profanity -\u00a0Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley in \u201cWicked Little Letters\u201d Best music documentary\u00a0- \u201cIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\u201d Best horror film - \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d Best animated film\u00a0- \u201cOrion and the Dark\u201d TV Best production - \u2018Shogun\u2019 The series production of the year, FX\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d managed to create the second showstopping television event based on the acclaimed James Clavell novel, after the first series did way back in 1980. CNN\u2019s Brian Lowry wrote in his glowing review that the new show \u201cblends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.\u201d Best show (somewhat) inspired by real life\u00a0- \u2018Baby Reindeer\u2019 While \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is by no means an easy watch, Richard Gadd\u2019s (true to an extent, that will surely be battled over for some time) recounting of his experience with a stalker \u2013 and how a previous experience of abuse played into it \u2013 is ultimately gratifying for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Gadd\u2019s layered and vulnerable performance anchors the show, and serves as the perfect foil for the brilliant Jessica Gunning \u2013 who plays his increasingly menacing stalker Martha \u2013 to truly shine and chew scenery at the same time. Best visuals -\u00a0\u2018Ripley\u2019 In a very different way from the villainous Harkonnen family in \u201cDune\u201d \u2013 but still depicting a nefarious villain nonetheless \u2013 the black-and-white Netflix series \u201cRipley\u201d can draw you in at practically any juncture, with stunningly ornate stylistic details and seaside Italian locations that are gasp-inducing maybe partially because they lack color. You could take screenshots from almost any scene and frame them as fine art, and the show \u2013 an austere retelling of the Patricia Highsmith novel after Anthony Minghella\u2019s far more colorful (literally and figuratively) film from 1999 \u2013 has the beguiling ability to make your eyes crave its somehow comfortable, monochromatic simplicity when you\u2019re not watching it. Best sophomore season -\u00a0\u2018Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u2019 \u201cInterview\u201d has only improved on what\u2019s come before \u2013 its first season, as well as the 1994 Neil Jordan movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt \u2013 and continues to be one of the best-acted and best-written shows on TV, while also remaining the juiciest. Vamps have never been more compelling than the iterations of the Anne Rice characters depicted here. Alternating between notes that are tragic, beautiful and sometimes hilarious, it\u2019s got a bit of everything. Which means its no surprise that AMC announced a third season renewal just this week. \u2013 Scottie Andrew Best cameo -\u00a0Carrot Top on \u2018Hacks\u2019 When Mr. Top (real name Scott Thompson, who while you weren\u2019t looking has become a major fixture in Las Vegas) comes out on screen in the second episode of this well-received third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d double-takes abound as to whether that\u2019s \u201creally him.\u201d His commitment in the scene is top notch, and stick around for the post-show featurette to watch him take director notes and do great line readings. Honorable mentions go to Dierdre Hall playing herself, sort of, as Paul W. Downs\u2019 mother in the Christmas episode, along with Christopher Lloyd as her maybe-new paramour. \u201cHacks\u201d also enjoys featured guests J. Smith-Cameron from \u201cSuccession,\u201d who finally gives (great) face to Kathy \u2013 Deborah\u2019s detested and two-timing sister \u2013 and Helen Hunt as a ball-busting network exec. Honorable mentions: Best documentary portrait of a living artist -\u00a0\u201cSteve! (Martin): A documentary in two pieces\u201d Best unabashed romance series -\u00a0\u201cOne Day\u201d Best mindless guilty summer reality obsession -\u00a0\u201cSummer House\u201d Best mystery - \u201cMonsieur Spade\u201d MUSIC Best musical genre reinvention - Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 A truly monocultural moment in music, Queen Bey\u2019s landmark eighth studio album took the old \u2013 like the Beatles\u2019 \u201cBlackbird\u201d and Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene\u201d \u2013 and made it new and vital again. It shined a light on both trailblazers and up-and-coming artists that normally aren\u2019t associated with the ever-changing genre that is \u201ccountry,\u201d while betraying a very personal story from Beyonc\u00e9 herself about her own experience in the music world as an artist of color. Best album that\u2019s definitely not for everyone - Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018Only God Was Above Us\u2019 There are few immediately hummable songs on the new record that call to mind \u201cHarmony Hall\u201d off of their last album in 2019, and the instrumentation is rich and complex and strangely captivating, like the band wanted to stuff as many distinctive sounds into each song as they could. And their trademark clever wordplay is very much on display in songs like \u201cGen-X Cops.\u201d \u2013 Brandon Griggs Best breakout - Chappell Roan While her debut album \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d was released late last year, Roan has been steadily gaining attention ever since \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 with viral performances at Coachella, the Governors Ball and Bonnaroo, along with a wonderful (and also very viral) set on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series in March. With a queer-centric performance style that is very drag-inspired, her latest single \u201cGood Luck Babe!\u201d epitomizes her fiercely independent, raw and authentic vibe. Plus, rock legend Elton John has already given his seal of approval. We\u2019re so in.  \u2013 Scottie Andrew and Alli Rosenbloom BOOKS \u2018Margo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u2019 by Rufi Thorpe Soon to be a TV series starring Elle Fanning, this novel \u2013 following a young, single, new mother with no job who joins OnlyFans and begins creating sexual content to stay afloat \u2013 toys with our perceptions of power and morality. What does it mean to be a good person, and who gets to decide? Over the course of the book, readers see Margo desperately trying to survive her situation, contending with the difficult \u2013 and sometimes unconventional \u2013 choices she makes in order to do so. \u2013 Leah Asmelash \u2018Sociopath: A Memoir\u2019 by Patric Gagne The release of \u201cRipley\u201d in April coincided with the arrival of the memoir\u00a0\u201cSociopath,\u201d\u00a0which offers a quite different case for demythologizing what it means to be a sociopath. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who\u2019s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and\u00a0argues that\u00a0the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed. \u2013 Sara Stewart PODCAST Best and most hilarious podcast about nothing in particular - \u2018The Bald and the Beautiful\u2019 The beloved queens from \u201cDrag Race\u201d Trixie and Katya blather on about nothing, and it\u2019s just everything.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_a-quiet-place-day-one-review", "text": "Like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d pries opens the door to a world with a host of possibilities, some of them \u2013 including the premise of a new prequel subtitled \u201cDay One\u201d \u2013 already touched upon in the two previous movies. Set in New York, the latest film begins from a slightly unexpected premise, but then efficiently spins it to yield additional horror while giving theater-goers every reason to keep their mouths shut. The 2021 sequel actually opened with a muscular flashback sequence to that moment when the grotesque, sound-sensitive alien invaders descended upon Earth, so the new film\u2019s tag line, \u201cExperience the day the world went quiet,\u201d reflects a bit of a conceptual echo. Introducing new characters, the main wrinkle in the new prequel \u2013 and it\u2019s a questionable one at first \u2013 involves telling the story from the perspective of Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a dying woman enduring hospice care with her cat, who serves as the de facto guide to all hell breaking loose. At a time when people are dying right and left, \u201cDay One\u201d thus uses a woman already close to death as the audience\u2019s surrogate. She interacts with various people along the way, but it\u2019s a fair stretch until she encounters the most significant one, Eric (Joseph Quinn, on a genre tear with \u201cStranger Things\u201d behind him and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d to come), who doesn\u2019t want to leave her side however much she tries \u2013 quietly \u2013 to chase him away. While the Emily Blunt- and John Krasinski-anchored family\u2019s sign-language fluency gave the original movie its gateway into an original-feeling twist on minimalist horror, this third film relies heavily on Nyong\u2019o\u2019s facial reactions, and it\u2019s hard to think of an actor who can say more with an expression. Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\u201cPig\u201d), who shares story credit with original director/producer Krasinski (whose summer dance card also includes \u201cIF\u201d), the film does let viewers see more of the horrifying creatures, although their lightning-quick attacks often keeps those images brief. There\u2019s also the matter of how the invaders manage to seemingly be everywhere at once, to the point where the slightest sound on screen provokes a sense of dread. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d takes advantage of those attributes, and even finds a way to use Sam\u2019s condition, somewhat awkwardly, to consider our humanity. If there\u2019s one clunky flourish, it\u2019s been clear going back to \u201cAlien\u201d that cats and sci-fi horror don\u2019t mix, and while her feline companion provides a periodic source of unpredictable tension, it\u2019s one of those devices that probably should have been left in the litter box. Unfortunately, everything that enjoys a modicum of success these days triggers talk of its own \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is no exception. Practically speaking, \u201cDay One\u201d takes a step toward demonstrating that this perilous post-invasion world offers no shortage of streets and hallways to tiptoe down, where nobody needs to ask \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d when they are greeted with silence. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/a-quiet-place-day-one-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_entertainment_eddie-murphy-beverly-hills-cop-4", "text": "Eddie Murphy is a Hollywood veteran who has starred in many beloved films through his decades-long career. The intrepid actor does, however, consider his role of Axel Foley in the \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d franchise to be one that stands out among the rest. \u201cBefore \u2018Beverly Hills Cop,\u2019 there had never been a movie that starred a Black man, a Black person, that was successful all around the world,\u201d Murphy said in a recent interview with Extra, pegged to the upcoming fourth installment of the movie series titled \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\u201d Murphy went on to say that \u201ceven still to this day, when Black folks, we make movies, most of the time they work in the States and outside of the country, they don\u2019t work.\u201d The Oscar-nominated actor mentioned his previous work in \u201cThe Nutty Professor\u201d and \u201cComing to America\u201d as examples of movies he starred in that were global hits, but said that \u201c\u2019Beverly Hills Cop\u2019 started it and started that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where you get Will (Smith) and The Rock, they do it now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2018Beverly Hills Cop\u2019 is the first one that did it.\u201d Capping on that worldwide love for the franchise, Murphy also confirmed that a fifth installment is currently in the works, and that the film\u2019s producer Jerry Bruckheimer is \u201cworking on the script.\u201d \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d first premiered in 1984 and became a career-defining role for Murphy. It earned an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay and spawned two sequels \u2013 1987\u2019s \u201cBeverly Hills Cop II\u201d and 1994\u2019s \u201cBeverly Hills Cop III\u201d \u2013 before the impending fourth entry.

{"id": "2024_06_24_entertainment_inside-out-2-box-office-disney-critics-woke", "text": "As emotions go, Disney\u2019s loudest critics might sound angry, but \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is bringing the studio nothing but joy. The Walt Disney Co. has often found itself cast as a reluctant participant in the culture wars, yielding occasional calls for boycotts and proclamations the company has become \u201ctoo woke.\u201d Yet the explosive box-office success of \u201cInside Out 2\u201d provides necessary perspective about a vast audience that remains hungry for Disney content, certainly enough to generate a major hit. Granted, those who regularly rail against Disney \u2013 which was drawn into a political battle with Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, beginning in 2022 over the state\u2019s so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill \u2013 have sought to rationalize the performance of the Pixar sequel, insisting its plot doesn\u2019t toe the \u201cwoke\u201d line the way something like the studio\u2019s latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d series, \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d does. Notably, a review-bombing campaign has been waged against the latter, depressing its score on the critic-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes to almost comical levels. Look a little closer, though, and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d features an effortless emphasis on values like diversity and inclusion that have helped make Disney a target. The Disney unit behind it, Pixar, also enjoyed a less-ostentatious box-office win last summer with \u201cElemental,\u201d a movie that used an allegorical relationship between characters made up of fire and water to explore bigotry, the immigrant experience, and a love story about overcoming differences. Whatever the reason \u2013 and with the sequel coming nine years after the original, pent-up demand is surely a part \u2013 there\u2019s no denying \u201cInside Out 2\u2019s\u201d results, with the movie adding $100 million at the North American box office during its second weekend \u2013 a record for an animated film \u2013 bringing its domestic total to $355 million, eclipsing \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d as the year\u2019s top movie in just 10 days of release. Worldwide, the film\u2019s haul has ballooned to nearly $725 million. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d will almost surely join the increasingly rare list of $1 billion-plus grossers since the Covid outbreak, which consists of sequels to \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cJurassic World\u201d as well as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting Disney has consciously sought to shy away from engaging in political battles, with CEO Robert Iger, who rejoined the company in that capacity in 2022, telling CNBC in November, \u201c\u201cWe have to entertain first. It\u2019s not about messages.\u201d In essence, Iger simply stated the obvious: That Disney, like any major corporation, prioritizes its profits and stock price, which means trying not to alienate potential customers, no matter how eager some of them are to be offended. Disney employees represent another constituency, which offers some context regarding why former CEO Bob Chapek finally chose, belatedly and under pressure from them, to criticize Florida. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d certainly looks like a triumph for Iger\u2019s strategy, while still conveying messages in a more subtle (and for those seeking any opportunity to pounce, less inflammatory) manner. Indeed, summer 2024 is shaping up to be a banner one for Disney, with the superhero satire \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d expected to another major attraction when the film opens in July, catering to an R-rated crowd that underscores the demographic reach of its assorted assets. That doesn\u2019t mean those who have turned Disney\u2019s Mouse ears into targets will be less inclined to rail against something like \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d distorting what the \u201cStar Wars\u201d show does and doesn\u2019t do in the process. It\u2019s a reminder, though, that plenty of people still see in the Disney name the ideal of entertainment that they can share with loved ones, and that as long as the studio fulfills that implied contract, woke or otherwise, Mickey and friends won\u2019t be going broke anytime soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/entertainment/inside-out-2-box-office-disney-critics-woke/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_28_entertainment_a-family-affair-review-nicole-kidman-zac-efron", "text": "The \u201cOlder woman dates younger star\u201d concept is getting a workout lately, with \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d now followed by \u201cA Family Affair,\u201d which could easily be called \u201cThe Idea of My Movie-Star Boss Sleeping With My Mom.\u201d While the Nicole Kidman-Zac Efron pairing should provoke curiosity, the tired beats of this romantic (and only occasional) comedy don\u2019t rub together well enough to generate many sparks. Part of the problem is the perspective tilts heavily toward the Kidman character\u2019s daughter, Zara (Joey King), who works as an assistant to actor Chris Cole (Efron), best known for playing a superhero called Icarus Rush. To Zara\u2019s chagrin, he\u2019s prone to stereotypical excesses, sending her on menial errands like running to a store to buy him isolated whey protein. (If you have to ask, it\u2019s not for you.) Zara has watched Chris use and dump women, threatening to quit almost as often as he talks about firing her. Their latest spat brings him to the house she shares with her mom, Kidman\u2019s Brooke, a successful and conveniently widowed author. After some mild awkwardness, Chris and Brooke wind up in bed together, leaving her, as she says, \u201cstarting to feel things again.\u201d Zara is understandably horrified by the prospect of the two hooking up, prompting her mom to offer that their age difference is a mere 16 years, not 20 (which is more accurate in reality, but never mind), so maybe just May-September in calendar terms. Directed by Richard Lagravenese \u2013 whose most pertinent credit here might be adapting the screenplay for \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d \u2013 \u201cA Family Affair\u201d suffers from the wholesale self-absorption of all concerned, which makes the notion of this as some grand romance harder to swallow. Not that the director along with writer Carrie Solomon don\u2019t try, including a dinner scene with Zara\u2019s grandma (Kathy Bates, again underemployed) that works hard at humanizing Chris beyond just Efron\u2019s \u201cIron Claw\u201d-sculpted physique. While there are a few amusing lines scattered along the way (when Brooke says she\u2019s Australian, Chris asks if she knows Margot Robbie), the comedy largely fizzles beyond the initial introductions, and the romance \u2013 after that first encounter \u2013 doesn\u2019t come across as terribly convincing. That leaves some star charisma, but not enough chemistry, to propel this across the finish line, dragging the customary Hollywood cliches \u2013 and lots of musical montages, seemingly to fill out the running time \u2013 along with it.

Early reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic show box office promise for the horror thriller set to open this weekend. For those who don\u2019t find real life frightening enough, here\u2019s what to know about the movie: The cast Nicolas Cage, \u201cIt Follows\u201d star Maika Monroe, Alicia Witt, Kiernan Shipka and Blair Underwood are some of the top names in the cast. Cage alone is a huge draw no matter how big his role is in any film. The plot Monroe stars as new FBI Agent Lee Harker who must dive into the occult in order to solve the case of a serial killer. In the midst of the investigation, Harker learns of a personal connection to the killer. She must race against time before another victim or victims lose their lives. The combination of a serial murderer on the loose and the satanic will likely be enough to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. What the critics are saying Die-hard horror fans pushed an early score to 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, before it dropped a bit. Variety\u2019s Peter Debruge had high praise for both writer-director Osgood Perkins \u2013 who is the son of \u201cPsycho\u201d star Anthony Perkins \u2013 and Cage. \u201cHow many horror movies can claim to hijack your subconscious?\u201d Debruge writes. \u201cWith Longlegs, writer-director Osgood Perkins delivers the kind of payoff we sought out as kids, daring ourselves to watch films about boogeymen that made us want to sleep with the lights on.\u201d David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter writes that the movie \u201cacknowledges a debt to The Silence of the Lambs in its chronicle of a young female rookie agent pulled into the FBI manhunt for a killer wiping out entire families.\u201d \u201cBut the movie is also its own freaky trip, a darkly disturbing experience pulsing with an evil that\u2019s unrelenting in its subcutaneous creepiness,\u201d he writes. Other critics were less enthused. Matt Cipolla of The Film Stage writes, \u201cBy living and dying on tame procedural, Longlegs fails to evoke any strong emotion. Perhaps that\u2019s partially by design: Perkins seems intent, if not particularly careful, to emulate his protagonist in style and form.\u201d When can you see it \u201cLonglegs\u201d hits theaters on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/entertainment/longlegs-what-to-know/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The prolific rapper dropped his \u201cNot Like Us\u201d music video on July 4 and it included some very important people to him. The song is part of what has become a very public feud between Lamar and Drake. Not only is there a scene featuring his fianc\u00e9e Whitney Alford and their two young children, but Lamar is also seen surrounded by a crowd of his fans who can be heard rapping along with him on his hit. Directed by the rapper along with Dave Free, it features cameos from several celebs associated with the West Coast, which is beloved by Lamar, a Compton native. They include NBA player DeMar DeRozan, who is also from Compton, and Tommy the Clown, known as the inventor of the krumping style of dance associated with the left coast. In the music video, Lamar offers multiple visual nods to Drake and his career including owls, which is the bird Drake uses for his OVO label. The video has been eagerly awaited especially by those who have followed the recent, fast and furious rap battle between Lamar and Drake. Both rappers, who are former collaborators, released multiple diss tracks, with \u201cNot Like Us\u201d becoming the most successful. Early on in the video, Lamar is seen doing push ups. Many believe it\u2019s a reference to Drake\u2019s single \u201cPush Ups,\u201d which was a response to Lamar\u2019s diss of him on the single, \u201cLike That,\u201d by Metro Boomin and Future. Even including his longtime love, Alford, and their children appears to be a nod to Drake\u2019s song, \u201cFamily Matters,\u201d in which Drake implied that Alford had cheated on Lamar. In his music video, Lamar and his family dance joyously and seemingly unbothered. \u201cNot Like Us\u201d debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 when it was released in May, according to Billboard and has been declared the \u201csong of the summer\u201d by many.

You made it through\u00a0the\u00a0first battle episode\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0season unscathed. The\u00a0chaotic fourth episode of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d Season 2 marks a major turning point in\u00a0the\u00a0Dance\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Dragons, with King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), Rhaenys (Eve Best) and two\u00a0dragons coming out\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0epic Battle\u00a0of\u00a0Rook\u2019s Rest not so unscathed. It also feels like a good opportunity to remember that teasing Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) is always a bad idea. Like, a really, really bad idea. The\u00a0episode picks up with Daemon (Matt Smith) at Harrenhal waiting for Grover Tully to die so his grandson can inherit his authority and help Daemon procure an army. Daemon also summons\u00a0the\u00a0Blackwoods to Harrenhal, while Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) is gathering\u00a0the\u00a0Brackens for his army as\u00a0they head to Rook\u2019s Rest. King Aegon finds out about Daemon claiming Harrenhal, and he\u2019s mad. Adding to his ire is his additional discovery that Aemond and Criston have been \u201cplotting\u201d war games without his authority, which is revealed when Aemond says that Criston is preparing an attack at Rook\u2019s Rest instead\u00a0of\u00a0going for Harrenhal. The\u00a0petulant King confides in Alicent (Olivia Cooke), who only\u00a0offers tough love \u2013 if that\u2019s what you want to call it \u2013 and tells him to pretty much do \u201cnothing\u201d at this point. Meanwhile, Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy) returns to\u00a0Dragonstone and fills in her cranky small council about her attempted peace talks with Alicent,\u00a0the outcome\u00a0of\u00a0which she says has left her with only two options: win her bid for\u00a0the\u00a0throne or die. Empowered by her revelatory chat with Alicent that she indeed is King Viserys\u2019 rightful heir, Rhaenyra is ready to tap into\u00a0their\u00a0dragon\u00a0power and head to Rook\u2019s Rest. Rhaenys volunteers to fly into battle with Meleys, Team Black\u2019s largest\u00a0dragon. In a dramatic montage, Rhaenyra tells her heir Jacaerys (Harry Collett) about Aegon\u00a0the\u00a0Conqueror\u2019s prophetic dream, Rhaenys gives Meleys a pre-battle pep talk, and King Aegon,\u00a0of\u00a0course, can\u2019t just sit around and do nothing so he hops on Sunfyre and flies out to Rook\u2019s Rest. Rhaenys and Meleys make it\u00a0there first, unleashing fire on Criston\u2019s army on\u00a0the\u00a0ground. But Criston and Aemond expected this and\u00a0they have a plan. Only Criston knows that Aemond and the dragon Vhagar are hiding out in\u00a0the\u00a0forest waiting for\u00a0their cue, so he sends Aemond\u00a0the\u00a0signal once he spots Rhaenys on her\u00a0dragon. Not part\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0plan, however, is King Aegon flying in on Sunfyre, which causes Criston to momentarily panic. Meleys wounds Sunfyre pretty badly and a struggle ensues. King Aegon is just trying to hang on when Aemond swoops in and fires\u00a0off a \u201cdracarys,\u201d seemingly aimed in Aegon\u2019s direction. As Vhagar\u2019s fire reaches\u00a0the\u00a0King and his\u00a0dragon,\u00a0they fall to\u00a0the\u00a0ground. With Sunfyre out\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0picture, Vhagar and Meleys tumble through\u00a0the\u00a0sky in a ball\u00a0of\u00a0fire as\u00a0they continue\u00a0their pursuit\u00a0of\u00a0each other in a real nail-biter of a sequence. Rhaenys knows she is playing a zero-sum game but continues fighting for Team Black, circling\u00a0the\u00a0skies until Vhagar inevitably kills Meleys. In a devastating slow-motion shot, Rhaenys and Meleys fall from\u00a0the\u00a0sky.\u00a0The\u00a0massive explosion\u00a0they land in seals\u00a0their fate. Dazed, Criston later finds Aemond in\u00a0the\u00a0woods looking over King Aegon, who is lying limp on\u00a0the\u00a0ground next to a sputtering Sunfyre. Elsewhere in Westeros \u2022 Alicent drinks a big cup\u00a0of\u00a0moon tea, leaving us to assume that she believed she was pregnant with Criston\u2019s baby.\u00a0\u2022 Rattled by her meeting with Rhaenyra, Alicent questions whether King Viserys truly wanted King Aegon to succeed him.\u2022 Young Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock) and Laena Velaryon (Nanna Blondell) make cameos when\u00a0they appear in Daemon\u2019s strange visions.\u00a0\u2022 Daemon also chats with Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) again, who tells him that Harrenhal is haunted with spirits and questions whether he\u2019s trying to prove his own claim against his own wife. Aemond\u2019s betrayal\u00a0of\u00a0King Aegon here seemed deliberate, as opposed to simply opportunistic. Maybe he was still upset about being teased at\u00a0the brothel and is just that petty. Or maybe, something much more sinister is at play. \u201cHouse\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Dragon\u201d airs Sunday nights on Max, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.

The young woman became the subject of tabloid fascination after her mother Dee Dee Blanchard was found stabbed to death in 2015 in their home near Springfield, Missouri. An investigation uncovered not only the elder Blanchard\u2019s role in her daughter\u2019s childhood of feigned illnesses, but also the fact that her daughter convinced her then-boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn to kill her mother as she slept as a way to escape the abuse. Gypsy Rose Blanchard pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2016. Prosecutors eventually sentenced her to 10 years in a plea deal due to the unique circumstances. She was released in December 2023 and told CNN soon after \u201cFor me, getting to prison was a chance to start a life for myself in terms of gaining independence from everyone.\u201d Media attention has continued since her release. She and Urker met and got engaged while she was in prison but split in 2022. Soon after their breakup, Blanchard married Louisiana teacher Ryan Anderson in a prison wedding ceremony in July 2022 before parting ways in March. She and Urker then rekindled their romance. Blanchard said they look forward to welcoming their baby in January.

A recent Forbes piece about the series, penned by author and activist Virgie Tovar, has caused a stir for referring to the pairing as \u201cmixed-weight,\u201d putting focus on the characters\u2019 different body types in a way some have found sexist. Known by fans as \u201cPolin,\u201d the duo\u2019s romance this season has been eagerly awaited since the show first premiered in 2020, given that fans of the series (and the Julia Quinn novels that inspired the hit Netflix franchise) know that Penelope has secretly yearned to catch Colin\u2019s eye from the beginning. As celebrated as the pair is, Tovar\u2019s article acknowledges the problematic discussion the characters\u2019 romantic relationship has spurred. \u201cFor some, this romance is unsettling because it forces them to consider that humans are simply not governed by tidy, predictable rules,\u201d Tovar writes. \u201cIf this romance upsets you, it says more about how deeply you\u2019ve internalized fatphobia than it says about the bodies of the actors playing Penelope and Colin.\u201d The article has drawn mixed reaction, with some celebrating the discussion and others decrying terminology used therein. Writer and critic Zo\u00eb Rose Bryant shared on X, \u201cI find it interesting how there are countless fictional couples in film and television where the man weighs more than the woman but people didn\u2019t start writing articles about whatever the f\u2014k a \u2018mixed-weight romance\u2019 is until it was the other way around.\u201d Tovar said to CNN in a statement, \u201cI think this conversation is really important, as difficult as it might be.\u201d \u201cAs someone who\u2019s watched \u2018Bridgerton\u2019 from Season 1, I genuinely and instantly saw myself in Penelope. That isn\u2019t an emotion that can be contrived, and I wrote the piece from that place,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think there needs to be room for both the plus-size person who didn\u2019t see themselves reflected in Penelope and those of us who did. Neither of us is wrong. I think it\u2019s important to hear from the people who don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d Coughlan has said she was aware of the conversations being had about her plus-sized body after the first two seasons and \u201cspecifically asked for certain lines and moments to be included\u201d in the new season, which features racy sex scenes between her character and Newton\u2019s. \u201cThere\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m very naked on camera, and that was my idea, my choice,\u201d Coughlan added at the time.

{"id": "2024_07_04_entertainment_maxxxine-review-mia-goth", "text": "In keeping with the current cinematic age, even a slasher/porn-centric franchise gets a \u201cuniverse\u201d these days, as \u201cMaXXXine\u201d caps off an unlikely trilogy from writer-director Ti West and star Mia Goth. Stepping up in class in terms of casting, the film works best as an ode to the movies and grime of 1980s Hollywood, and a bit less as a mystery built around its driven starlet-in-waiting. That would be Goth\u2019s Maxine Minx, an adult-film actor who survived a rural massacre during a remote shoot in \u201cX,\u201d the roots of which were explored in the prequel \u201cPearl.\u201d Maxine is now in L.A. and trying to make a go of it in legit movies (\u201cActing is acting,\u201d she says confidently during her audition), even if said movie is a horror film that\u2019s provoking protests and charges of satanism outside the studio. While chasing that big break, repeating her mantra, \u201cI will not accept a life I do not deserve,\u201d Maxine also learns that somebody appears to be after her, having set a private detective (Kevin Bacon, boiling over the top) on her tail, dredging up memories of her past. That at least provides connective tissue to \u201cX,\u201d and motivations that might go beyond the title character being really, really unlucky in that way \u201cfinal girls\u201d often are. The danger also comes at a time of high alert in the city, since it\u2019s 1985, and the Night Stalker killer remains at large. Not that Maxine\u2019s porn pals seem particularly on edge as they scrape and claw, trying to meet people with the clout to advance their careers. In addition to Bacon, the supporting cast includes Halsey, Giancarlo Esposito, \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, and Bobby Cannavale and Michelle Monaghan as a pair of detectives eager to glean what Maxine knows about the crime spree surrounding her \u2013 which merely triggers her skepticism and can-do attitude, applying the same ruthless pursuit of stardom to her self-defense. Goth again turns her alter ego into a force of nature, but the film\u2019s simplest pleasures come in its evocation of the time, with songs like \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d and the hit from \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d as well as Angelyne billboards and nods to movies like \u201cDressed to Kill.\u201d Although the theatrical box office has enjoyed welcome signs of life this summer, horror has stayed a reliable staple since the pandemic began, thanks in part to the discount-bin quality of films like \u201cX\u201d and \u201cPearl,\u201d relative to aspiring blockbusters, as long as they deliver the requisite thrills. West mixes some wit in with the gore here, even if the payoff, alas, doesn\u2019t rise to the level of the buildup. By then, though, \u201cMaXXXine\u201d has delivered enough nostalgia regarding its genre to merit a walk down its alleys, and not incidentally, the showcase and sendoff that Goth\u2019s character deserves. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d premieres July 5 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/entertainment/maxxxine-review-mia-goth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
