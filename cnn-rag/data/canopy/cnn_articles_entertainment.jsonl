{"id": "2024_06_25_entertainment_shifty-shellshock-death", "text": "Seth Binzer, who went by the stage name Shifty Shellshock and was lead singer for Crazy Town, has died. He was 49. The news was confirmed by Binzer\u2019s publicist Kelly Springer, who told CNN that her client \u201cwas a courageous fighter. So full of talent, light, compassion, love and grace. He will be missed by so many. He was one of those souls that was magnetic. We will miss you Seth. We are heart broken. Thank you for your talents and contributions to our music industry. We were all blessed to have had you.\u201d According to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner\u2019s online records, Binzer died on Monday in Los Angeles. His cause of death is listed as \u201cdeferred,\u201d pending additional investigation. Binzer was the lead singer behind Crazy Town\u2019s famed track \u201cButterfly,\u201d among others. Binzer and Bret Mazur co-founded the rap-rock band in the mid-1990s, with Adam \u201cDJ AM\u201d Goldstein later joining the group. Crazy Town became popular in the early aughts when the hit \u201cButterfly\u201d was released, and spent two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. The band sold more than six million copies of their debut album \u201cThe Gift of the Game,\u201d released in 1999. After Crazy Town released their second studio album \u201cDarkhorse\u201d in 2002, Binzer and Mazur parted ways. Binzer went on to work as a songwriter, producer and sound mixer for bands including The Plain White Tees, Julien K and Hollywood Undead, among others, according to the band\u2019s biography on their Facebook page. Binzer had been open about his struggles with substance abuse, most notably through his appearances on the 2008 season of \u201cCelebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew\u201d and on two seasons of \u201cSober House\u201d between 2009 and 2010. \u201cI have a really good group of people around me,\u201d Binzer said on a 2023 episode of the Punk Rock MBA podcast. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to be here.\u201d He added that he was continuing to make music, describing it as something that has \u201cbecome my therapy for myself. Even if noone gets it and it helps me, then I guess it\u2019s good. And if people love it, that\u2019s even better.\u201d Earlier this year, Binzer re-released a remix of \u201cButterfly\u201d in a collaboration with the rock band Black Oxygen called \u201cButterfly (New Anthem).\u201d He also released an EP in March titled \u201cFlirting With Disaster\u201d under the band name Crazy Town X, alongside band members Mark_CXT, DJ Rick One and Sean Heenan.

{"id": "2024_06_09_entertainment_the-day-after-abc-movie-cec", "text": "In November 1983, the US, Soviet Union and the rest of the world were teetering closer than ever on the edge of nuclear war. A NATO military exercise had spooked the Soviets, who thought the exercise was merely a cover for a real nuclear strike on the USSR, prompting them to ready their own nuclear forces. Who knew, then, that an ABC movie-of-the-week would play a significant role in potentially preventing nuclear war? \u201cThe Day After,\u201d a two-hour epic following a few weeks in the lives of small-town Midwesterners before and after a nuclear strike, was one of the most controversial and most-watched TV movies when it aired on November 20, 1983. In its first hour, the people of Lawrence, Kansas, go about their lives as the threat of nuclear war looms. But when the nuke finally comes to Kansas, the devastation is immediate: Acres of crops are singed and poisoned, homes are leveled, a fifth-grade class is vaporized at school. Characters we come to know in the film\u2019s first half are obliterated in an instant or barely clinging to life as they succumb to radiation poisoning. Even those who survive the attack by the film\u2019s end will soon die, viewers know. It\u2019s an uneasy watch now, but \u201cThe Day After\u201d was even more affecting when nuclear war was on the table and top of mind. It\u2019s still one of the most-watched TV events in US history \u2013\u2013\u00a0more than 100 million viewers tuned into its original broadcast, more half of the country\u2019s adult population at the time. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s credited with changing then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s mind against nuclear war. Getting \u201cThe Day After\u201d to air, though, was fraught. Even Reagan, who praised the film in his private writings, didn\u2019t agree with its bleak and upsetting depiction of nuclear aftermath. But the team who created it knew it could be important, so, after rejecting requests for edits, dodging complaints from conservative groups and acquiescing to the occasional network demand, \u201cThe Day After\u201d finally made it to TV and changed the history of the medium \u2013\u2013\u00a0and potentially the world. \u201cThere were all these behind the scenes (challenges) going on, which we working on the film never really knew at the time,\u201d said Jack Wright, an emeritus professor of theater at the University of Kansas and head of local casting on \u201cThe Day After,\u201d in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that the film came out as strong as it did.\u201d Censors thought the film was too graphic \u201cThe Day After\u201d ends with a written warning to the audience: \u201cThe catastrophic events you have just witnessed are, in all likelihood, less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States.\u201d As a made-for-TV movie airing in a primetime Sunday night slot, \u201cThe Day After\u201d couldn\u2019t depict true nuclear horror, though there were still shocking scenes of mass death and the aftermath of a crumbling society. That was the goal, director Nicholas Meyer said. \u201cI wanted to make it like a public service announcement,\u201d Meyer said in the 2022 documentary \u201cTelevision Event,\u201d about the tumultuous production of the film. The script was sparse and plain. Early scenes include a meeting at an art museum between a doctor and his daughter with plans to leave Kansas and a romantic tryst between a young couple days from getting married. We meet husbands, wives, their children and friends so that when they\u2019re ripped away from each other in the second half, their loss will feel almost as sudden as it would if a real nuclear event had separated them. Wright was tasked with casting thousands of extras from Lawrence. In one pivotal scene, more than 1,000 Lawrence locals were made to lie on cots in the University of Kansas\u2019 basketball arena, wearing tattered clothes and bearing bloody facial injuries as though they\u2019d barely survived the nuclear attack. The intensity of the scenes inspired the cast to discuss what they\u2019d do in the event of nuclear war, he said. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re dealing with that kind of subject matter, it sticks in your craw,\u201d Wright said. After seeing rough cuts of the film, though, the network thought it was a bit too devastating. Executives had notes: No blood, no scarring, no burning, said \u201cThe Day After\u201d producer Bob Papazian in the documentary \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d Many scenes were altered as a result: A long shot of a family burning to death as the nuclear bombs fell, as seen in \u201cTelevision Event,\u201d was scrapped, as were shots that focused on survivors\u2019 melting skin or victims\u2019 charred corpses. \u201cYou had to walk a fine line with this movie,\u201d Meyer told the Outline in 2017. \u201cPeople have a remote control in their hands. So we had to make a movie that conveyed the awfulness of nuclear war without making it so awful that you changed the channel.\u201d Stephanie Austin, an associate producer on the film, conducted extensive research on the devastation in places where nuclear bombs have been dropped, like Hiroshima. After the bombing there, much of the land was leveled. The network asked that \u201cThe Day After\u201d avoid showing the extreme destruction that was closer to reality. \u201cI thought we stopped short of telling the real truth,\u201d Austin said in \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d Lawrence locals were largely unaware of the drama brewing behind the scenes and were more excited about the prospect of making a movie, Wright said. \u201cSomething like this had never been done before,\u201d Wright told CNN of the film. \u201cWe were all just playing it by ear. It was amazing to all of us.\u201d Political interference threatened the final cut Before \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, Reagan\u2019s policy involved investing even more in US defenses, including a missile shield proposed to protect the US from a Soviet attack. But scaling up defenses only heightened tensions with the Soviets, who viewed Reagan\u2019s Strategic Defense Initiative as a threat to their own security. On October 10, while at Camp David, Reagan watched \u201cThe Day After,\u201d weeks before it would air on TV. The film, he wrote in his diary, \u201cleft (him) greatly depressed.\u201d \u201cWhether it will be of help to the \u2018anti nukes\u2019 or not, I cant (sic) say,\u201d Reagan wrote of the film\u2019s potential impact on disarmament supporters. \u201cMy own reaction was one of our having to do all we can to have a deterrent & to see there is never a nuclear war.\u201d Even though \u201cThe Day After\u201d resonated deeply with Reagan, his administration asked ABC to make several edits to the film to make it less upsetting for viewers, former ABC Motion Pictures president Brandon Stoddard said in an interview with the Television Academy Foundation. Conservative groups, too, had viewed the film as a potential threat to support for nuclear deterrence, or the policy of letting the nukes do the talking: Their very existence and the potential to use them was meant to prevent the USSR and other countries from launching their own nuclear weapons. The conservative outlet Human Events declared \u201cThe Day After\u201d to be a \u201cpropaganda spectacular\u201d over a month before it even aired, and others conducted letter-writing campaigns to persuade advertisers not to buy ad time during the film, the New York Times reported in October 1983. ABC refused to acknowledge desired cuts and complaints from the Reagan administration or conservative watchdogs, and the film aired its original two-hour cut just days before Thanksgiving in November 1983. In Reagan\u2019s 1984 State of the Union address, which came two months after \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, Reagan finally committed to preventing nuclear war rather than tease scenarios of survivability: \u201cTo preserve our civilization in this modern age, a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\u201d Three years later, Reagan would sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which saw the US commit to reducing its arsenal of nuclear arms. Advertisers hesitated to buy in Before \u201cThe Day After\u201d had even been completed, there were concerns about its graphic content. Stoddard, who died in 2014, was resolute that ABC would air the film anyway.\u00a0He said in the Television Academy interview that he was the one who wanted to pursue a film about nuclear war in the first place \u2013\u2013\u00a0but advertisers were getting cold feet. A few weeks before \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, the New York Times published a story about psychologists warning families that the film could potentially devastate young viewers and that children under 12 shouldn\u2019t watch it. \u201dI fear children will have nightmares about the show and worry about it for weeks or even months,\u201d one psychologist told the Times. \u201cOlder children and adults may have a sense of hopelessness.\u201d Fearing that \u201cThe Day After\u201d could isolate large swaths of viewers who didn\u2019t want to witness its bleak depiction of nuclear horror, companies largely resisted buying ad space. Companies also worried that their products would be associated with scenes of the destroyed Heartland or vaporized classrooms. To assuage advertisers, ABC allowed most companies to air their commercials during the first half of the film, before nuclear war came to Kansas, UPI reported after \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired in 1983. That way, Orville Redenbacher could hawk popcorn before any graphic deaths occurred. It was a good deal for the companies, Stoddard said: Since ABC had such trouble finding advertisers, it sold spots for as little as $11,000 \u2013\u2013\u00a0ads that were eventually seen by an audience of 100 million. The film has had a lasting impact \u201cThe Day After\u201d was upsetting, as psychologists warned, but also galvanizing. \u201cI vastly underestimated the importance of \u2018The Day After,\u2019\u201d said Kenneth Adelman, the former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency under Reagan, in \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d \u201cThe Day After\u201d brought discussion of nuclear war and the potential for disarmament to millions of people who viewed it, and became the rare film that \u201cactually became historical text rather than vice versa,\u201d wrote William Palmer, a Purdue University professor who discussed its impact in \u201cFilms of the Eighties: A Social History.\u201d \u201cFrom its earliest frames, \u2018The Day After\u2019 sets out to remove the blinders from an uninvolved American populace,\u201d Palmer wrote. \u201cThe Day After\u201d endures today as an artifact of a tense time and a powerful piece of art that changed minds and even influenced policy changes. By making it, the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Tim Grierson wrote last year, Meyer and his team helped \u201csave the world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/entertainment/the-day-after-abc-movie-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_entertainment_chinatown-water-wars-fifty-years-later", "text": "In the 1974 film \u201cChinatown,\u201d there\u2019s deceit, deception and murder, as well as a timeless Los Angeles protagonist \u2013 water. Having debuted 50 years ago this week, \u201cChinatown\u201d is set against a race for control of water in arid LA, and some of the devious power players who are after that control, along with the money that goes with it. An Oscar-winner for Robert Towne\u2019s original screenplay (out of 11 total Academy Award nominations), \u201cChinatown\u201d remains an indelible entry in the film noir genre, updating it with a complex and emotional story, while also shedding light on some of the real-life history of the city\u2019s rise. Intrinsic to LA\u2019s story is how water was \u2013 and still is \u2013 accessed by the city, a history riddled with disaster and corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing in the way (\u2018Chinatown\u2019) centralizes water as a character in the growth of Los Angeles,\u201d William Deverell, co-director of\u00a0the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West and professor of history at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant movie that gives us the feel of this water capture from the early 20th century, bringing the Sierra snow melt river 250 miles down to Los Angeles.\u201d The movie follows private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) as he crosses paths with a wronged woman (Faye Dunaway) and gets drawn into the complicated criminal underbelly of 1930s-era Los Angeles. In the process, he unwittingly uncovers a secret plan on the part of some men in power to buy up cheap, dry land on the outskirts of the city and divert much-desired water from even further away to those areas, thereby causing the value of that land to skyrocket. Drops of truth in a Hollywood fable While the broad strokes of that story are true, they deviate from what actually happened in two ways, according to Deverell. \u201cThe movie shrouds the scheme in secrecy and conspiracy \u2013 enough to provoke murder \u2013 but Angelenos basically knew that a set of already rich men would get richer when the water came (and watered their lands in the newly-annexed San Fernando Valley),\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t much care, as they knew that there was water and land enough to float many more boats, so to speak, than the oligarchs in on the ground floor.\u201d Essentially, the pursuit to bring water \u2013 which Deverell referred to as \u201cthe coin of the realm\u201d \u2013 to LA and its outskirts was not a secret. \u201cDeliberate, planned, carefully executed, thoughtfully engineered, sneakily done,\u201d he said, just not clandestine. The other main deviation that \u201cChinatown\u201d takes is the era in which much of this long-distance irrigation was done. The efforts to divert water from the faraway Owens Valley near Mammoth Lakes, CA \u2013 some 230 miles from Los Angeles \u2013 began as early as 1908, with the start of the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Deverell called the project \u201cthe prime infrastructural focus\u201d or inspiration of \u201cChinatown.\u201d The Roman Polanski-directed film, meanwhile, takes place some 25 years later. Uprisings, disasters and mayhem But regardless of these meanderings from the truth, the \u201cWater Wars\u201d (as they came to be known) that inspired the movie reflected real-life mayhem. The aqueduct opened in 1913, and swiftly desiccated the areas where it originated, resulting in an uprising in 1924 on the part of local farmers who used dynamite in an attempt to blow up part of the infrastructure that was routinely drying up their land. \u201cTensions and litigation continue well into contemporary times: the desiccated Owens Lake is getting some water put back in, but the issues continue to be hotly debated and contested,\u201d Deverell explained. \u201cIt\u2019s moved generally from riparian tugs of war into deep environmental terrain, all having to do with essentially picking up a river and moving it hundreds of miles away.\u201d In \u201cChinatown,\u201d the murder of Hollis Mulwray \u2013 Dunaway\u2019s character\u2019s husband (played by actor Darrell Zwerling) \u2013 incites much of the movie\u2019s action. His death follows his refusal to endorse a dam that he believed would prove faulty. In actuality, celebrated SoCal engineer William Mulholland built the St. Francis Dam that failed in 1928, resulting in the \u201clargest single loss of life in California history,\u201d according to Deverell. \u201cHis career was shattered,\u201d he said, adding that even though we have things named for him, like the famed Mulholland Drive, \u201cthere is this darker, obviously tragic past.\u201d The \u2018Water Wars\u2019 of today As the dry, hot periods get drier and hotter due to climate change \u2013 ask any longtime Los Angeleno about the recent wet weather in LA, and they will be quick to tell you drought-like conditions will indeed return as they always do \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise, perhaps, that the pursuit of water in the region has continued to inspire people to act outside of the law to grab some of the \u201cliquid gold.\u201d Take Dennis Falaschi, the former general manager of the Panoche Water District in the Central Valley. In a 2022 federal indictment, Falaschi was accused of conspiring to steal more than $25 million in water over a 20-year period. Late last month, he struck a deal and pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return and to conspiring to steal water valued somewhere between $1.5 million and $3.5 million. He awaits sentencing in September. His attorney had no comment when reached by CNN. The indictment also indicates \u201cthat Mr. Falaschi was just one of several individuals\u201d who were illegally drawing water from the federally-owned canal. \u201cThere was an old, rusted kind of former piece of irrigation equipment that was taking in some water from the Delta Mendota Canal,\u201d said Jessica Garrison, a Northern California correspondent for the Los Angeles Times who reported on the Falaschi case extensively. Garrison explained that after the faulty piece of equipment was discovered, instead of fixing it, \u201cthey put a gate in and they started just taking water out of the canal without a meter, without anybody knowing, often in the dead of night.\u201d Sounds worthy of a Hollywood tale on its own. \u201cIf you start looking for it, people are stealing water all over the place,\u201d Garrison also said. \u201cI mean, it is everybody from farmers to movie stars, anyone who\u2019s trying to grow anything in California, many of those people have been caught up in various water theft schemes.\u201d Even actor Tom Selleck was caught up in one, settling with the Calleguas Municipal Water District in July 2015 after allegedly diverting water to his ranch during an ongoing drought. And that\u2019s not to mention other Hollywood figures who made headlines for allegedly violating local drought restrictions, from Sylvester Stallone and Kevin Hart to the Kardashians. A \u2018takeaway for the ages\u2019 \u201cI think the beauty of \u2018Chinatown\u2019 is that California is to some extent built on stolen water,\u201d Garrison noted, going on to say \u201cthere\u2019s lots of different ways to steal water.\u00a0You can steal it legally, you can steal a little bit, you can steal a lot.\u201d Deverell echoed the sentiment. \u201cWe have \u2018water on the brain\u2019 \u2014 which is one of the lines from the movie, yes, because we have to,\u201d he said of Southern Californians. \u201cThere\u2019s a presumption\u2026 that water is dull, and it\u2019s anything but dull. The legal record around water, the fights, the manipulations, the engineering, the uncertainties. Water is fascinating. It\u2019s because it\u2019s so fundamental.\u201d Although \u201cChinatown\u201d is now half a century old, its themes endure. \u201cFifty years later\u2026 The deeper story about water and intrigues around water, its importance, Its fundamental quality, what people will do to get it, how depraved they will be,\u201d Deverell said. \u201cThat is a takeaway for the ages. That is something we can all think hard about to make sure in our town, our community, our county, our states, our region that the depravity is kept to a minimum.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/entertainment/chinatown-water-wars-fifty-years-later/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_entertainment_the-bear-season-2-recap-cec", "text": "Plug your ears: TV\u2019s screamiest series is back. \u201cThe Bear,\u201d the FX-on-Hulu kitchen-set dramedy, returns Wednesday night for its third season. No doubt it\u2019ll be just as stressful, loud and appetizing as ever. When we last left Carmy and co. a year ago, it was friends-and-family night at The Bear, the new restaurant made from the ashes of the sandwich joint that Carmy inherited from his late brother. But things are never calm for long in this kitchen, so in the last 10 minutes of the finale, Carmy got in a scream-fight with \u201ccousin\u201d Richie, accidentally broke up with his childhood crush Claire and got stuck in the walk-in refrigerator. But what of Marcus\u2019 ailing mom and Sydney\u2019s dreams of a Michelin star? Can The Bear survive in the cutthroat world of fine dining? And will anyone on this show ever learn the meaning of \u201cinside voice\u201d? Before you binge Season 3 of the Emmy-winning \u201ccomedy,\u201d here\u2019s where our favorite dysfunctional Chicagoans left off in the second season. The Bear is almost open for business After weeks of failing fire inspections, knocking down walls and generally fighting over every detail of the restaurant, the staff of the restaurant formerly known as The Beef are finally ready to open The Bear, their new fine dining destination in Chicago\u2019s River North neighborhood. Sydney wants a Michelin star. Carmy wants to prove to himself, his callous former boss and his deceased brother Mikey that he can run the restaurant of his dreams. And Uncle Jimmy Cicero wants them to make him some money, because they owe him $800,000. Yeesh. At least The Bear looks great, and the staff are in top form on family-and-friends night, where we end the season. Sydney is the chef de cuisine under executive chef Carmy (and she\u2019s rocking a new Thom Browne uniform), Tina is her sous, and the rest of the crew, from Ebra and Marcus to Richie and Fak, are newly confident in their talents. Their first-night menu includes a gorgeous \u201cseven fishes\u201d plate (a nod to the season\u2019s nightmarish Christmas episode), perfectly al dente bucatini and Marcus\u2019 doughnut that Carm angrily destroyed last season. (Remember, in the episode when Syd accidentally stabbed Richie? Just the ha-ha hilarity Emmy voters love.) There are some bumps \u2013\u2013\u00a0they run out of forks and fire a chef after they find him doing meth in the alley \u2013\u2013\u00a0but otherwise, everything looks fairly functional for this rage-prone team. Until \u2026 Carmy melts down in the cooler The Bear\u2019s family-and-friends night should be an exciting one for Carmen Berzatto, but then, he never really lets himself feel anything other than paralyzing anxiety and anger. Throughout Season 2, Carmy left planning for The Bear to Sydney while he pursued a relationship with Claire, the young doctor he\u2019s crushed on since they were kids. Of course, his happiness is short-lived. Carm quickly finds that he\u2019s the most ill-prepared chef in the kitchen. If The Bear fails, he thinks, it\u2019ll be his fault. And then, when he goes to grab something from the walk-in cooler, he gets locked inside \u2013\u2013\u00a0and that\u2019s his fault, too, because he never fixed the handle. Carm dramatically spirals while he\u2019s locked in there, venting about how he\u2019s a \u201cpsycho\u201d and doesn\u2019t \u201cneed to receive any amusement or enjoyment.\u201d He also, in his anxiety-spiral, refers to his relationship with Claire as \u201call this bulls**t.\u201d She\u2019s standing on the other side of the walk-in and hears the whole thing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way,\u201d she says, and leaves in tears. Richie and Carm then take turns yelling unforgivable things at each other through the door. We leave Carmy in the walk-in to sit with his mistakes. An Emmy-award winning comedy, everybody! Richie gets his groove back In a standout episode near the end of the season, Richie stages at a Michelin-starred restaurant headed by Carmy\u2019s former mentor (played by Oscar winner Olivia Colman). Though he resists the gig at first, assuming Carmy just wanted to get rid of him for the week, Richie eventually finds the job revitalizing. He polishes the prongs of forks with delicate gusto, learns how to be an expediter (the meticulously organized kitchen staffer who keeps everyone on time and in check) and even runs all the way to his favorite Chicago deep-dish joint to pick up a pizza for a guest who said she didn\u2019t want to leave the city without it \u2013\u2013\u00a0only for the chef to deconstruct it, which, depending on your pizza allegiances, is bordering on sacrilegious. But the experience worked wonders for Richie, culminating in a cathartic singalong to Taylor Swift\u2019s early hit \u201cLove Story.\u201d This was especially important since, earlier in the season, Richie asked his young daughter if they could please listen to someone other than Swift. He returns to The Bear with a new swagger and an all-black suit, and he\u2019s confident enough to handle both front-of-house service and expediting behind the scenes. Sydney tastes success Chef Syd devoted the entire season to dreaming up a new menu she hoped would be worthy of a Michelin star. But she finds an unreliable partner in Carmy, who keeps ignoring her to spend time with his new girlfriend. Luckily, she can trust the rest of the kitchen, especially Tina, to keep things afloat \u2013\u2013 except maybe Marcus, who kind of asked her out. Syd awkwardly rebuffed him, and things were tense between them in the finale. Syd throws up from nerves behind the restaurant on family-and-friends night, but then she gets right back to work. It\u2019s enough to prove to her dad, who was so scared for Sydney to fail earlier in the season, that this is \u201cthe thing\u201d she\u2019s meant to do. Sydney may not have needed any more validation for her culinary ambitions, but it still means a lot that her dad finally gets it. Marcus\u2019 mom might be in danger \u2026 The final episode of the season focuses for too long on pastry chef Marcus\u2019 phone, buzzing with missed calls from his mom\u2019s nurse. Marcus\u2019 mom was seriously ill throughout season two, so it was a huge deal when, earlier in the season, Carmy sent our doughnut-loving chef to Copenhagen for a dessert apprenticeship. He was so hesitant to leave his mom, but the experience was creatively fulfilling and inspiring for sweet Marcus. Couldn\u2019t \u201cThe Bear\u201d let him hold onto that happiness? Multiple messages from his mother\u2019s nurse is definitely not a good sign for The Bear\u2019s chillest employee. \u2026 while Carmy\u2019s mom is still starting drama Things are \u2026 not great between the surviving Berzatto children and their mother, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Last season\u2019s Christmas flashback episode introduced us to Donna Berzatto as the hard-drinking, emotionally vampiric and deeply depressed mother who broke down while cooking the traditional Italian \u201cfeast of the seven fishes\u201d and drove her car through her own house. Merry Christmas, indeed. When we meet Donna in the present day, she\u2019s hiding outside the restaurant. She can\u2019t bring herself to come in because she doesn\u2019t want to ruin the nice thing her kids made together. Maybe she\u2019ll let her kids feed her at The Bear this season. What\u2019s on the menu in Season 3 The interpersonal dynamics in The Bear\u2019s kitchen are perhaps more fragile than the electrical wiring Mikey bungled to burn the restaurant down. Will Sydney and Carmy find a professional arrangement that works for them? Will Carmy win Claire back, or even try? What will become of Marcus\u2019 mom, and how will that affect him in the kitchen? Will The Bear earn that Michelin star and stick it out in the Chicago restaurant scene? Will Curtis, Colman, John Mulaney, Bob Odenkirk and Sarah Paulson return as guest stars, or will a new slew of celebs cameo? And which Taylor Swift song will Richie rock out to this season? All will be revealed (we hope) when \u201cThe Bear\u201d returns.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/entertainment/the-bear-season-2-recap-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

And now, it\u2019s becoming just that. Well\u2026 sort of. The Hallmark Channel, along with the NFL, Skydance Sports and the Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 otherwise known as the team Kelce plays football for \u2013 announced on Tuesday that they\u2019ve joined forces to produce an upcoming holiday movie titled \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d which is set to start production next month. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d follows Alana Higman (Hunter King), who \u201cis sure that her family\u2019s lifelong history as Kansas City Chiefs superfans makes them a frontrunner to win the team\u2019s \u2018Fan of the Year\u2019 contest,\u201d according to a news release. The team\u2019s director of fan engagement, Derrick (Tyler Hynes), is tasked with evaluating how Alana\u2019s family measures up, and \u201cas the pair spends time together, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a spark between them.\u201d According to the release, the movie will honor the Chiefs\u2019 hometown by filming entirely in Kansas City, including at the team\u2019s home turf GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. Romance took center stage at many Chiefs games last year, with Swift and Kelce becoming romantically linked in September and the pop megastar being seen in attendance at several games to support the Super Bowl champ, who serves as the team\u2019s star tight end. Their relationship has since become a public spectacle as the couple are frequently seen at each other\u2019s events. Most recently, Kelce made his on-stage debut at Swift\u2019s concert in London on Sunday, just one day after the pair went \u201cInstagram official.\u201d While the plot of \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t exactly based on Kelce and Swift\u2019s ongoing romance, it seems fair to presume that this Hallmark movie perhaps was inspired by it \u2013 especially given the Chiefs\u2019 involvement. The announcement does not specify whether Swift and Kelce are directly involved in the project or gave it their blessing, but CNN has reached out to representatives of each for comment. Christmas can\u2019t come quickly enough this year it would seem, with \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d sounding like a perfect tribute to so-called \u201cChiefties\u201d everywhere.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/entertainment/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-chiefs-hallmark-movie/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_entertainment_trigger-warning-review-jessica-alba", "text": "Jessica Alba hadn\u2019t even turned 20 when she became an action star in the 2000 Fox series \u201cDark Angel,\u201d which provides some context for her return to butt-kicking mode in \u201cTrigger Warning,\u201d the kind of Netflix movie that invariably lands atop (or at least near) its \u201cmost viewed\u201d tier. Devoid of surprises, it\u2019s an efficiently violent return for Alba after a lengthy acting hiatus, briefly interrupted by the cop show \u201cL.A.\u2019s Finest.\u201d Coming a few months after she stepped back from her other vocation as founder of The Honest Company, \u201cTrigger Warning\u201d essentially plays like a minor variation on the Dwayne Johnson remake of \u201cWalking Tall,\u201d which is to say, there\u2019s nothing new here, and scant suspense about the contours of the plot. Still, Alba comes armed with a steely attitude and strong revenge motivation as Parker, a Special Forces commando who \u2013 following a brief introduction in the field \u2013 gets summoned back to her hometown after her father\u2019s death, which quickly appears to be more serious than an accidental mine-shaft cave-in. In addition to the mine, dad ran the local watering hole, though Parker has little interest in taking over her inheritance. The longer she hangs around, though, the more suspicious she becomes, which is complicated by her history with the local sheriff (Mark Webber), the fact his brother (Jake Weary) looks to be up to no good and that their father (Anthony Michael Hall) is a conservative senator who asks rude questions like what \u201cLatinx\u201d means. Parker also receives some help from one of her dad\u2019s employees, Mike (\u201cThe Night Agent\u2019s\u201d Gabriel Basso), but eventually she\u2019s going to have to Schwarzenegger her way through all this, having already exhibited a knack for close-quarters combat and wielding a knife. Making her US debut, Indonesian director Mouly Surya brings a kinetic (if slightly repetitive) quality to the action for those weaned on the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d style of fight choreography, where stabbing or shooting someone once never quite seems to be good enough. Alba credibly tackles that aspect, while portraying Parker as a grieving daughter (complete with gauzy flashbacks) to give her a bit more depth than the customary killing automaton. Netflix has found a fertile niche by featuring promotable stars in such genre fare where reviews, frankly, don\u2019t matter much, with Jennifer Lopez\u2019s sci-fi adventure \u201cAtlas\u201d among the recent examples. \u201cTrigger Warning\u201d might not be packing anything unexpected in the chamber, but for those who come to it with the proper mind-set, the movie doesn\u2019t wind up firing blanks either. \u201cTrigger Warning\u201d premieres June 21 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/entertainment/trigger-warning-review-jessica-alba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_entertainment_song-of-the-summer-year-history-cec", "text": "As the temperature outside heats up, so does the chatter around the \u201csong of the summer\u201d \u2014 the unofficial name for the track that becomes inescapable between Memorial Day and Labor Day. The song of the summer is the pesky earworm you hear blaring at the beach, the pool and the cookout. It\u2019s the infectious hit endlessly remixed at the club and in videos all over TikTok. It\u2019s the anthem that instantly transports you back to those hot, hazy months when you first heard it. The designation isn\u2019t purely objective or the result of a song\u2019s chart position. Often, it\u2019s based on vibes: What song just inexplicably feels like summer? What track simply seems to be everywhere? The answer isn\u2019t always straightforward. There are lots of \u201csong of the summer\u201d contenders each year, and the one that rises to the top might very well depend on your social circle and musical taste. So what exactly defines the song of the summer? Where did the idea of a singular track to rule the season even come from? And in an age where social media and streaming platforms have fragmented the cultural landscape, does the song of the summer even exist anymore? The long history of the summer song The concept of a summer anthem goes back further than you might think. David Hajdu, a music critic and author of \u201cLove for Sale: Popular Music in America,\u201d says the notion can be traced back to the sheet music industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Before the days of vinyl records and radio, people bought sheet music to play on pianos at home. Much of the music was religious or classical, but sheet music for secular, popular songs grew increasingly available over time, thanks in part to the emergence of publishing district\u00a0Tin Pan Alley. The sheet music of songs such as \u201cIn the Good Old Summer Time\u201d and the ragtime piece \u201cThe Coney Island Girl\u201d sold millions of copies, Hajdu says. Those sales numbers indicated a song\u2019s popularity, marking the beginning of the \u201csong of the summer.\u201d As Phil Edwards wrote in 2016 for Vox, thousands of songs were being published a year in the early 1900s, and experts were deliberating even then about what would emerge as  summer\u2019s defining song. One songwriter quoted in the Washington Post on May 12, 1907, declared that the popular song would be \u201cthe song that the drunk is going to sing,\u201d while another songwriter lamented that \u201cmore songs fail because they are too good than because they are not good enough.\u201d With the introduction of records and radio in US households throughout the first half of the 1900s, runaway hits such as George Gershwin\u2019s \u201cSummertime\u201d and lesser-known successes like Harry James\u2019 \u201cSleepy Lagoon\u201d proved popular over the summer, Hajdu says. But the song of the summer wasn\u2019t yet the institution that it is today. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people were walking around in 1925 and saying, \u2018You think that\u2019s the summer song this year? No, that\u2019s not the summer song this year,\u2019\u201d Hajdu says. \u201cBut the phenomenon was beginning to happen.\u201d In 1940, Billboard introduced its first chart ranking the sales of recorded songs, making it easier than ever to gauge a song\u2019s popularity. But it wasn\u2019t until the era of rock and roll in the late 1950s and \u201860s that the song of the summer became a full-blown phenomenon, per Hajdu. Young people suddenly had free time and disposable income in the post-war period, and catchy hits by The Beach Boys channeled the carefree attitude of the times. \u201c\u2018California Girls,\u2019 \u2018Good Vibrations\u2019 and a whole wave of songs evoke that idea of young people with time on their hands and some bucks in their pockets, enjoying that time,\u201d Hajdu says. Like many of the summer songs that came before and after them, the hits from this period were specifically about good times in the warmer months. These hits could be found across genres \u2014 1964\u2019s \u201cDancing In the Street\u201d by Martha and the Vandellas, 1966\u2019s \u201cSummer in the City\u201d by Lovin\u2019 Spoonful and 1969\u2019s \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime\u201d by Sly and the Family Stone all presented summer as a time to kick back and let loose. Summer songs at the time were hits in the true sense of the word. Sales charts were printed in local newspapers, and people followed them with the same fervor that they did sports statistics, according to Hajdu. Radio stations played a finite playlist of music over and over, exposing the general public to the same handful of songs. \u201cWhatever the big song was in 1964, 1958, 1972 was ubiquitous,\u201d Hajdu says. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get in your car to drive more than five to 10 minutes without hearing it. You couldn\u2019t walk around the mall or the shopping center or the downtown area without hearing the hit of the day.\u201d The \u2018song of the summer\u2019 becomes a subject of debate While summer-defining songs were an established concept for decades, they weren\u2019t really given intense consideration until the turn of the century, says Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. New York Magazine\u2019s 1995 Summer Fun issue devoted an article to examining the summer song as a unifying force \u2014 per the magazine, a summer song should be 1) released in the summer, 2) uncomplicated and 3) unforgettable. Then in September 1999, the critic Ann Powers pitted contenders for the song of the summer against each other in a bracket-style showdown (\u201cLivin\u2019 La Vida Loca\u201d vs. \u201cBailamos,\u201d \u201cIf You Had My Love\u201d vs. \u201cGenie in a Bottle,\u201d \u201cBills, Bills, Bills\u201d vs. \u201cUnpretty,\u201d among them). In the end, she declared the Backstreet Boys\u2019 \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d the victor. \u201cThat put in print this idea that we all know what the \u2018song of the summer\u2019 is; our parents and grandparents all associated certain songs with the summer; the music industry has released songs as summer songs,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cBut now we\u2019re going to call it a thing.\u201d Billboard launched its Songs of the Summer chart in 2010, its compilation of the season\u2019s most popular songs based on radio airplay, sales and streaming data from Nielsen. MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards introduced a song of summer category in 2013, with One Direction\u2019s \u201cBest Song Ever\u201d nabbing the inaugural award. Media publications published annual round-ups debating the would-be song of the summer. But broader changes to the music industry and entertainment media were already starting to affect the song of the summer as a phenomenon, Thompson says. For much of the 20th century, industry gatekeepers decided what songs got made and were filtered down to the public through records, radio and linear television \u2014 producing a \u201cmonoculture\u201d in which the American public had the same cultural touchpoints and in which a given song could become the \u201csong of the summer.\u201d The rise of cable, the internet and online streaming splintered the pop culture landscape, giving people more control over what music they consumed. It also meant that a wider array of artists now had a shot at capturing the public\u2019s attention. \u201cJust as we began to really identify and have a conversation about \u2026 the idea of the song of the summer, the whole notion of a song of the summer was collapsing before our very eyes,\u201d Thompson says. Does the song of the summer even exist anymore? With the fracturing of popular music, obituaries from critics and journalists started pouring in. \u201cThere Is No Song of the Summer,\u201d the Washington Post proclaimed in 2016. That same year, Vulture declared \u201cThe Song of the Summer Is Dead.\u201d A 2018 assessment from Rolling Stone suggested that \u201cThere Was No Song of the Summer This Year \u2014 and There Won\u2019t Be Ever Again.\u201d Though less assertive, the website Andscape last year posed the question, \u201cIs the song of the summer a thing of the past?\u201d \u201cWhen we casually throw out that \u2018everyone\u2019s listening to this,\u2019 we are no longer talking about that massive mass audience in the pre-internet and even pre-cable era, where the word \u2018everyone\u2019 could be almost used literally,\u201d Thompson says. Social media and the algorithms that drive streaming platforms have also drastically shortened the shelf life of entertainment, making it harder for a particular song to achieve a level of success that endures over the whole summer, Hajdu says. Some songs seem to go viral almost instantaneously, but it might only be a matter of weeks before the public moves on to the next big thing. It\u2019s also the case that what one person deems the song of the summer might be totally different from what another person feels defined the season, says Jason Lipshutz, senior director of music at Billboard. In 2023, Spotify and Billboard named country artist Morgan Wallen\u2019s \u201cLast Night\u201d the song of the summer \u2014 though some corners of the internet seemed perplexed at why the song seemed to be dominating country charts. But audiences who don\u2019t listen to country music could have conceivably passed the entire summer without ever hearing it, Lipshutz says. For some listeners, \u201cFlowers\u201d by Miley Cyrus or \u201cSnooze\u201d by SZA might have felt like the song that was \u201ceverywhere.\u201d For others, the song of the summer might have been \u201cPadam Padam\u201d by Kylie Minogue, the club hit that was dubbed a Pride anthem by several publications (despite not charting high on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100). \u201cBecause the pop music monoculture has fractured to some degree, you have more disagreement of what was actually the song of the summer and what defined each summer for different audiences,\u201d he adds. Even as the song of the summer has become increasingly debatable, the idea that a single song could encapsulate a given summer continues to have a hold over our culture. Thompson has a theory as to why: At a time when there is so much fragmentation over what we all consume, perhaps there\u2019s nostalgia for the days when one song \u2014 regardless of whether or not people actually liked it \u2014 created a shared cultural experience. \u201cOn some level, we want to have a discussion of what the song of the summer is because we are holding on to this hope that there actually is such a thing,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/entertainment/song-of-the-summer-year-history-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Chronicling Steven Van Zandt\u2019s colorful life as Bruce Springsteen\u2019s frequent collaborator, \u201cThe Sopranos\u2019\u201d weirdest mobster and an outspoken activist, \u201cDisciple\u201d plucks the right notes in a 2 1/2-hour marathon that\u2019s still shorter than an average night\u2019s work for the E Street Band. Broken into rough chapters, the HBO presentation begins with Van Zandt\u2019s formative musical years in New Jersey, his bromance with Springsteen and the various characters and players that circled in and out of their respective endeavors. Once Van Zandt had achieved a measure of success as an artist, his political interests consumed him, advocating for the anti-apartheid campaign in South Africa and on behalf of imprisoned Native-American activist Leonard Peltier, among other causes. Finally, there\u2019s \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d with series creator David Chase having seen Van Zandt during an awards ceremony, and deciding he belonged in the mob drama. \u201cThat guy\u2019s gotta be in the show,\u201d Chase recalls thinking in the doc \u2013 crafting a character for him when the musician insisted he didn\u2019t want to take a job away from a working actor. All those elements would be plenty entertaining on their own, frankly, but what really elevates \u201cDisciple\u201d is the dizzying list of bold-faced names that pop up seemingly at the drop of a guitar pick. When Van Zandt mentions the seminal experience of seeing the Beatles on Ed Sullivan\u2019s show, it\u2019s almost immediately followed by an interview with Paul McCartney. Ditto for other singers that Van Zandt mentions, like Dion DiMucci, Darlene Love and Gary U.S. Bonds. For many, the foundational part of Van Zandt\u2019s career, despite his solo efforts fronting Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul, remains his participation in the E Street Band, even if that meant living to an extent in Springsteen\u2019s shadow. Notably, he chose to strike out on his own at the apex of Springsteen\u2019s success with the \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d album, an act of independence, restlessness and, in the eyes of some of his friends and associates interviewed here, borderline insanity. Now in their 70s, Van Zandt and Springsteen can discuss each other in a way that speaks to the depth of their bond and the creative shorthand they enjoy, having lived lives they could have scarcely imagined back when they were knocking around clubs together in Asbury Park. The documentary bills Van Zandt as \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s most famous consigliere to Bruce Springsteen and Tony Soprano,\u201d but proceeds to show there\u2019s much more to him than that.

Her advisors originally wanted to try and position her as the next Barbra Streisand. \u201cLook, you already had a Streisand,\u201d Lauper recalled telling them.

{"id": "2024_06_13_entertainment_inside-out-2-review", "text": "Teens might be entering those awkward \u201cToo cool for Pixar\u201d years, but of all demographics, that cohort and their parents should relate the most to \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d a wonderfully clever sequel that ages up the concept with one dreaded word: Puberty. Whatever one\u2019s age, there\u2019s much to like in a movie that offers the requisite laughs and sweetness, while managing to feel quite profound. Granted, Disney\u2019s once-can\u2019t-miss animation powerhouse has experienced its own awkward stretch since \u201cToy Story 4\u201d five years ago, thanks to some questionable choices (see \u201cOnward\u201d) and factors beyond its control (the pandemic). Small wonder that there would be comfort in reaching back to a hit from 2015, one that highlighted Pixar\u2019s inventiveness as well as its ability to tap into childhood concerns \u2013 by bringing to life the conflicting emotions within them \u2013 in a way that resonated with adults as well. Under the stewardship of first-time feature director Kelsey Mann, \u201cInside Out 2\u201d re-introduces Riley (voiced by Kensington Tallman) as a now-teenager, playing hockey, excelling in school and enjoying a sense of self that hinges on thinking of herself as a good person. Joy (Amy Poehler) remains the maestro among her various emotions, accentuating the good and pushing the bad into the recesses of her mind. That equilibrium is instantly thrown for a loop, however, when (in one of several laugh-out-loud visual gags) the puberty button lights up, unleashing a new group of emotions, including Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Shame (Paul Walter Hauser) and Ennui (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, who is, naturally, French). Anxiety leads the newcomers in taking over the command center, telling Joy and the old guard, \u201cRiley\u2019s life is more complex now.\u201d That seems especially true as she\u2019s dealt unexpected news on the verge of arriving at hockey camp, where her performance, she fears, could have implications for her whole middle-school-to-high-school transition. While there have certainly been no shortage of movies dealing with those delicate coming-of-age years, the central device of \u201cInside Out\u201d provides an especially good way of exploring questions about growing up, the desire to fit in and still preserving some sense of the child you were as you mature. Pixar notably grappled with similar issues in \u201cTurning Red,\u201d one of its better recent efforts, which happened to arrive at an inopportune time and lack the established qualities that would help lure audiences to go see it. On the bright side, even with studios struggling at the box office there\u2019s evidence of a not-terribly-discriminating hunger for kid-friendly fare based on results for \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d with the latest edition of \u201cDespicable Me\u201d still to come. Whether \u201cInside Out 2\u201d translates that into the hoped-for commercial success \u2013 as last year\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ultimately did after a disappointing start \u2013 the film happily meets the high creative standards and expectations that Pixar has established. Whatever Riley\u2019s going through, there\u2019s nothing particularly complicated about that. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d premieres June 14 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/entertainment/inside-out-2-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_entertainment_rufi-thorpe-margos-got-money-troubles-cec", "text": "You\u2019re 20 years old, with no job and a new baby. What would you do? This is the scenario in which our hero, Margo Millet, finds herself after a brief affair with her English professor, in a new book \u201cMargo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u201d by Rufi Thorpe. Margo\u2019s answer? She joins OnlyFans and begins creating sexual content to stay afloat. The novel, out earlier this month and the basis of an upcoming Apple TV+ series, toys with our perceptions of power and morality. What does it mean to be a good person, and who gets to decide? Over the course of the book, readers see Margo desperately trying to survive her situation, contending with the difficult \u2014 and sometimes unconventional \u2014 choices she makes in order to do so. \u201cWhen you can no longer use the opinions of others as a mirror for knowing if you\u2019re okay or not, if you\u2019re a good person or not \u2014 because you\u2019ve begun doing something like showing your boobs on the internet, which makes lots of people disapprove of you \u2014 then how do you figure out how to be a good person?\u201d Thorpe asks in an interview with CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s taking authorship of your own life.\u201d Does any of this make Margo a bad person? It\u2019s up to readers to decide. CNN spoke to Thorpe about being good, the oddities on OnlyFans \u2014 and meeting Elle Fanning. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. There\u2019s a lot of cultural discussion at the moment around internet fame and sex work. What made you want to focus on this topic in a novel? There\u2019s so much stigma against sex work in our culture, and we put mothers up on such a pedestal that the idea of a mother sex worker character, I was like, how am I ever going to make it work? And then it was during the pandemic, a number of stand-up comics that I followed on Twitter started OnlyFans accounts because their ability to perform in public kind of went away overnight. And so as I was watching their accounts, and you know \u2014 OnlyFans really exploded during the pandemic that first year \u2014 I think they went from 20 million users to 120 million. And people were just less judgmental about it. I could tell that the conversation was different. Even my Mormon mother-in-law was like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s awfully good money for just posting your boobs on the internet.\u201d And I thought, \u201cThis is my chance to suss out and have an actual conversation about what this stigma is about in the first place.\u201d Part of it too is just these things are so accessible, almost clean now. You can post something online without doing anything in person.\u00a0 The lack of physical risk is huge. Because so much of the stigma against sex work is related to fear that someone is disrespecting themselves by putting their personal safety at risk. And so when you remove that risk, it becomes much less clear what the stigma is about. But it\u2019s also one of those confusing problems where you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, if you just made it legal and made work safer then that wouldn\u2019t be a problem anymore.\u201d There\u2019s that part in the book, during a mediation between Margo and the baby\u2019s father, and he is accusing her of being a porn star. And she\u2019s like, \u201cIs that so bad?\u201d Do you feel like this is becoming more normalized or more accepted? I definitely do think that our culture has become more sexually permissive over time, like, if you say, between 100 years ago and now, have the mores around sexual behavior become more permissive? I think it\u2019s an obvious yes, and I think that permission has really resulted only in greater liberation, safety and freedom for a greater number of people. So it\u2019s hard for me to see it as anything but a net cultural positive. Mark, the father, is saying, \u201cshe will be around the kinds of people who do sex work,\u201d as though there\u2019s this sort of general, very Victorian moral taint, fallen women. That they\u2019re going to have moral problems in other ways. I think that as sex work becomes more accessible and more common, it becomes increasingly clear how ridiculous and just sort of vague those arguments are. When you think about the number of girls now who have had an OnlyFans, you start to realize, like, what, none of them are ever going to get hired for a real job after this? Is it really going to still be acceptable to not hire someone because 10 years ago they had an OnlyFans account? I think that kind of prejudice is probably going to go away. There\u2019s such a range now in what\u2019s considered sex work, too. People posting pictures of feet on the internet because they need money, technically that is sex work, but is it really?\u00a0 There are people who have OnlyFans accounts that are just really hot workout videos. There\u2019s people who have OnlyFans accounts where they\u2019re naked and making a smoothie. It is not all as simple as, \u201cOh, this is pornography.\u201d But there\u2019s also indie porn stars out there who are making porn content where it\u2019s just them and their husband, where they\u2019re really not conforming to any of the stereotypes that we have about what sex work entails. And there\u2019s some weird ones, like all the people who pretend to be Sims, and you feed them little fruits. Totally shifting gears away from OnlyFans, I felt like at the heart of the book was this idea that people aren\u2019t always who you think they are. There\u2019s more beneath the surface. Anybody can be a good person, and everybody deserves good things. Would you agree with that assessment?\u00a0 Yeah. A huge part of the reason that I started writing in the first place was trying to understand moral judgments and how we make them. The ability for people who do bad things to also have really redeeming qualities and people who do good things to also have really problematic flaws \u2014 that\u2019s the whole project for me. One of the messages of the book is taking control and authority of your own narrative. I really wanted to write a book about the mechanics of female empowerment, and Margo realizing that she has more options than she thought, and that choosing between good girl and bad girl, that\u2019s just not enough options. That doesn\u2019t give you enough range to live a life. You got to be able to make moves. You got to protect your baby, your little guy. There\u2019s too much misogyny baked into the culture to ever be able to be truly empowered as a woman if you are completely controlled by trying to stay within the narrow box of \u201cGood Girl.\u201d Because if there\u2019s one thing that being a mother has taught me, everyone has an opinion on how you\u2019re doing it, and you\u2019re always doing it wrong. Breastfeeding is the only way, but then you\u2019re doing it too long. You should sleep train. You should not sleep train. The whole Mommy Wars are insane and ridiculous. You can\u2019t please everybody. You can\u2019t stay always in this reactive place. You have to decide what you want and who you want to be. Then there\u2019s going to be people who disapprove, and you have to accept that as part of reality. But you can\u2019t be helpless to it. Before the book was even out, it sparked this huge bidding war. It\u2019s now going to be on Apple TV+, with Elle Fanning and Nicole Kidman starring. Your other books didn\u2019t have that type of process \u2014 what was that like for you?\u00a0 Yeah, this doesn\u2019t happen to any book, this is insane. It was wild, to an extent that I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cKnockout Queen\u201d had been optioned in a very normal way, by one company who wanted to try and make it into a movie, and is still trying to make it into a movie. And so this was like me being thrown into the deep end. I kept getting sidetracked in the meetings, I\u2019m like, \u201cHow did you get this job? What did you major in in college? How do you make a TV show?\u201d I really knew nothing about the industry, and yet I, the person who knows the least about any of this, has to pick who\u2019s going to make it and who the Dream Team is going to be? I loved Elle for the role. I can\u2019t believe she did the audiobook. She did such an amazing job. I\u2019m just blown away by her. And it\u2019s funny, because I was such a huge fan of \u201cThe Great,\u201d and there\u2019s actually a scene from the first season that was key to my thinking as I was first drafting this novel. Fanning\u2019s character, Catherine the Great, has been trying to escape from the Russian court, and then she has given up. And she\u2019s like, well, there\u2019s nothing left to do but kill myself. And her maid walks on her about to kill herself, and she\u2019s like, well, \u201cyou could do that, or you could just kill him.\u201d And it just had never occurred to her that she had more options. It was that moment of like, \u201cOh, I actually have a whole range of agency that I had been unaware that I had,\u201d and so that was in the back of my mind. So I got to be in a Zoom meeting with Elle Fanning. I had a huge lip zit that I was just hoping she couldn\u2019t see because my camera was blurry. And I got to tell her, watching you was part of the reason that I had the idea for this book in the first place. It was such a dream come true. What do you think it is about this story that is so attractive in this moment? One thing that I did notice that people kept bringing up was about how the book was kind to the characters. And I think we\u2019ve had a lot of stories about rich people behaving grotesquely or being kind of depraved, like a \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d vibe. And I love that kind of thing. But I think sometimes, people respond to how heartwarming this story is even though it\u2019s also not sanitized. But I think that there is a real way in which people enjoy rooting for Margo. They come away liking her and admiring her, and it makes the book fun. As a culture, we sometimes have this perverse obsession with watching rich people do bad things, like \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d obviously, but also shows like \u201cSuccession,\u201d which become these giant phenomenons. Your book stands a little bit in contradiction to that. Rich people behaving badly, tale as old as time right? It\u2019s not like that\u2019s some sort of new thing. I think people get tired of watching the rich people behave badly, and they want an underdog to root for. And so then that comes in fashion, and probably the pendulum just swings back and forth. Instead of watching the ultra rich behave badly, we\u2019re now rooting for the single mom with money problems? Exactly, the plucky underdog. What were you hoping people take away from the novel? I have two answers. One is really simple. There were certain movies that I watched growing up that made me feel excited about being a woman. I\u2019m thinking specifically of a movie that played only on cable, but over and over, called \u201cWild Hearts Can\u2019t Be Broken,\u201d about this girl that jumps a horse into barrels of water as a sideshow act. I was obsessed with this movie as a girl, or also the movie \u201cBad Girls\u201d with Drew Barrymore \u2014 that was a female cowgirl movie. You feel like a badass at the end of it, where you\u2019re like, \u201cI am going to grow up to be like a badass girl who has power and is brave.\u201d I wanted the reader to just leave feeling excited to be brave. The other answer, I don\u2019t have any answers about how people or society should be. I just have increasing questions about, how do we judge each other? How do we be good to each other? Punishment in general seems like it doesn\u2019t work very well. What do we do instead? What do we do with people who are addicted to drugs? I think that the (opioid) epidemic has kind of changed the cultural narrative of, instead of \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d where junkies are far away and in a totally different social class or something. Instead, it\u2019s your aunt or whatever, who\u2019s addicted to her shoulder surgery medication. It becomes near, and it becomes every day. Suddenly, it\u2019s not as convenient to have the same narratives about addiction and whether those people deserve to be punished for being addicted or not. In general, those are always my questions. How do we really deal with these problems? So I would hope that the reader would leave wondering for themselves, freshly, what ought we do? Maybe it\u2019s not as simple as just judgment or punishment. Maybe there\u2019s more to be explored there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/entertainment/rufi-thorpe-margos-got-money-troubles-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Upon being shown the footage, \u201cthe very first thing she said was, \u2018I think this film can help me,\u2019\u201d according to Taylor.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd then she said, \u2018And I don\u2019t want you to cut out that scene, and don\u2019t cut it down.\u2019\u201d The scene in question came as a shock to Taylor, who did not expect to film Dion having one of the spasms associated with stiff person syndrome, the neurological condition with which she was been diagnosed. \u201cStatistically, the likelihood that that would happen while my camera was rolling is extraordinarily rare,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one expected that to happen. We never discussed, \u2018What if that happens, what do we do?\u2019 Never even had that conversation, because we just assumed it wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d Dion first shared her diagnosis in\u00a0an emotional video post\u00a0back in 2022. The disorder\u00a0is \u201ca rare, progressive syndrome that affects the nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord,\u201d according to the\u00a0National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Last year, Dion announced that she canceled her\u00a0\u201cCourage World Tour,\u201d with a source close to her telling CNN at the time that she \u201cwill likely never tour again.\u201d \u201cIt just snowballed very quickly,\u201d said Taylor, describing the moment when the spasm happened. Only minutes before, Dion had finished two days of recording for the first time in four years. Despite her discomfort and uncertainty about filming the incident, Taylor told Variety that she held on to her boom mic and kept filming. \u201cI realized, \u2018You know what? I have a job to do, too\u2019\u2026 But the human part of me was very uncomfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I really believe in the power of nonfiction, and I really believe that we can transport people in their own imagination by showing them real things, not scripted things.\u201d Earlier this month, Dion addressed the crowd at a screening of the film and spoke of a newfound hope for her condition. She also thanked her fans, saying the film was a \u201clove letter\u201d to each of them. The documentary was released Tuesday on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video streaming service.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/entertainment/celine-dion-seizure-footage-documentary-director-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_23_entertainment_orphan-black-echoes-review-krysten-ritter", "text": "Cloning is a pretty good metaphor for one of the key methods employed to populate TV these days, but \u201cOrphan Black: Echoes\u201d at least tries to distinguish itself from its predecessor, which ran five seasons and provided an Emmy-winning showcase for Tatiana Maslany. Starring Krysten Ritter, the new AMC series prints out its share of twists without possessing the DNA to launch another clone army. Adopting a somewhat tighter focus, the show is set in 2052, with Lucy (Ritter, a.k.a. Marvel\u2019s \u201cJessica Jones\u201d) fleeing a facility where she appears to have sprung fully formed from some kind of pink ooze with no memory of who she is, told only that she\u2019s been through \u201ca procedure.\u201d Flash forward, and after her escape she\u2019s found a modicum of normalcy in the outside world with Jack (Avan Jogia) and his teenage daughter (Zariella Langford-Haughton). Alas, secrets don\u2019t stay buried in sci-fi dramas, and Lucy is discovered by the scientist, Dr. Kira Manning (Keeley Hawes), who \u201cprinted\u201d her, while being pursued by operatives that compel her, as Lucy says, to \u201cfind out who I was to protect who I am.\u201d Doing so raises plenty of questions about her past identity, who\u2019s responsible for this elaborate (and illegal) technology and what the shadowy \u201cthey\u201d behind it want with her. The answers prove somewhat unexpected, including those pertaining to a teenager, Jules (Amanda Fix), also reluctantly drawn into the plot. Details dribble out gradually over the 10-episode season while providing an emotional hook that brings some welcome depth to the characters, which include the obligatory billionaire (an appropriately creepy James Hiroyuki Liao) who has championed Manning\u2019s work but whose motives remain suspect. As noted, while \u201cOrphan Black\u201d enjoyed a devoted cult following that even developed its own hashtag-anointed nickname \u201cClone Club,\u201d its narrative contortions became less engaging over time, a trap that \u201cEchoes\u201d mostly avoids, at least coming off the assembly line. Inevitably, though, the cloning concept has a way of diluting drama, as variations on the theme involving multiple versions of the same identity (HBO\u2019s take on \u201cWestworld\u201d comes to mind) have discovered, mostly the hard way. Created by Anna Fishko (\u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d), who produces the series along with the original\u2019s co-creator John Fawcett, the new show does a decent job threading the needle in terms of providing a connection to its namesake while establishing a separate set of stakes and characters that stand on their own. That said, Ritter\u2019s role isn\u2019t as conspicuously showy as Maslany\u2019s was, which largely defined that series. More broadly, AMC has also found a fertile niche in genre fare, with its Anne Rice series \u201cInterview With the Vampire,\u201d its acquisition of \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d and now this show to help flesh out its still-\u201cWalking Dead\u201d-heavy lineup. That\u2019s not an unqualified endorsement of sending in the clones, but tasked with giving \u201cOrphan Black\u201d an updated genetic makeover, \u201cEchoes\u201d credibly takes on what is, however one splices it, a challenging and complicated procedure. \u201cOrphan Black: Echoes\u201d premieres June 23 at 10 p.m. ET on AMC, BBC America and AMC+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/entertainment/orphan-black-echoes-review-krysten-ritter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_entertainment_judy-garland-trolley-song-pride-cec", "text": "It was 1944 when the trolley first started to clang. \u201cThe Trolley Song,\u201d a second-act standout from the 1944 movie musical \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d was sung by Judy Garland in striking Technicolor. It was released back when gay was more commonly understood to mean \u201chappy,\u201d a rainbow was just a weather phenomenon and a trolley was just another mode of transportation. And yet it has found new life online nearly 80 years later as an unlikely anthem for LGBTQ Pride. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d has been making the rounds again this year among young queer people who can\u2019t resist the brassy gift of Garland\u2019s vocal performance, its campy, heightened atmosphere and its timeless fun. \u201cHappy pride month (sic) to Judy Garland in the trolley song. And also to the trolley,\u201d one person wrote on X. \u201cThere\u2019s no pride month without the trolley song,\u201d said another. Some hope \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d will be a featured lip-sync on the next season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d while others believe the song deserves to be released as several club-ready remixes. At least one person called it Garland\u2019s version of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s summer smash \u201cEspresso,\u201d a frothy single about a fling that\u2019s a staple on many Pride playlists. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is not the most obvious candidate for a Pride playlist. It lacks the overt LGBTQ imagery of \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d perhaps Garland\u2019s most famous song, or the appeal of Garland\u2019s live performances toward the end of her life, which were heavily attended by her gay fans. But a closer read reveals why it resonates with LGBTQ fans today. \u201cThe tempo, the lyrics, the onomatopoeia \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s all super gay,\u201d said Dave Karger, a Turner Classic Movies host who frequently presents movie musicals, including \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d on the channel. (CNN and TCM share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.) Patrick Kelleher, a social justice organizer in Ireland who\u2019s written about his relationship with Garland and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d has noticed it popping up more frequently in his online circles, even declaring it \u201cthis year\u2019s Pride anthem.\u201d It\u2019s thrilling, he said, that the song that\u2019s brightened his life for so many years is now bringing other young LGBTQ people the same joy. \u201cAs someone who has been obsessing over this song for more than a decade, I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s getting all this renewed attention,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cAnd honestly, if \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 came on at a Pride event, I think the crowd would go absolutely wild.\u201d It\u2019s a campy crowd-pleaser Though \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is a rollicking crowd-pleaser, the scene in which it takes place starts out with Garland in a huff. Her character, Esther Smith, is a lovestruck teenager in Missouri, months before the 1904 World\u2019s Fair. She begins the song somberly traipsing around the trolley, wondering why her love interest has not boarded with her. When she finally spots him running to catch the caboose, the song revs up as Esther\u2019s excitement grows. \u201c\u2018Clang, clang, clang\u2019 went the trolley, \u2018ding, ding, ding\u2019 went the bell, \u2018zing, zing, zing\u2019 went my heartstrings \u2014 from the moment I saw him, I fell!\u201d she sings, wide-eyed and moony. In her \u201chigh-starch collar\u201d and periwinkle gloves, her giddiness radiates off the screen. The song\u2019s age hasn\u2019t diminished its appeal. Paige Turner, a seasoned New York-based drag queen, has been performing \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d for 10 years. Every time she steps onstage in her own \u201chigh-starch collar\u201d and costume made to look like Esther\u2019s trolley outfit, she says her audience starts \u201cscreeching\u201d with glee. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018Oh my God, is she doing \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019? Oh my God, is she coming out like that?\u2019 And it\u2019s a familiarity you want to give people\u2026\u201d Turner told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s respectable camp.\u201d \u201cThe Trolley Song\u2019s\u201d campiness lies in its hyper-stylized, theatrical, exaggerated quality that tips into fantasy. Kelleher likened it to Cher\u2019s 1998 autotune fantasia \u201cBelieve\u201d but \u201csomehow even more gay.\u201d Like Cher\u2019s hit, \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is dripping in artifice. But Garland\u2019s earnest delivery cuts through what could be considered corny to deliver a classic. \u201cWhen you take the musical theatre leanings out, \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 isn\u2019t all that different to some of the big pop songs queer people have tended to gravitate towards in more recent years,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cThe song and the clip from the film that accompanies it are instantly iconic.\u201d It\u2019s upbeat and joyful \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis\u201d was one of Garland\u2019s signature songs even before her death. Culture writer and critic Manuel Betancourt, who wrote a 33 1/3 book on the seminal live album from 1962, \u201cJudy at Carnegie Hall,\u201d said that the song received an \u201corgiastic reaction\u201d from her audience when it appeared in her opening medley. The singer Rufus Wainwright has covered \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d at least twice \u2013\u2013 once in 2007, when he covered \u201cJudy at Carnegie Hall,\u201d and again in 2022 with his live album \u201cRufus Does Judy at Capitol Studios.\u201d Both are open-hearted homages to the diva and her 1960s live performances, which were embraced by her gay fans. Earlier this month, Wainwright shared a TikTok of himself singing the song once again, eyes closed in bliss. \u201cI have had the most fun ever in my life singing that song,\u201d Wainwright told CNN in an email. \u201cOnce you get on that trolley with Judy, there is no getting off. Same with your sexuality.\u201d \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is one of Garland\u2019s \u201cbest-known, truly upbeat and celebratory numbers,\u201d Karger said, which makes it especially fitting for a month meant to honor the LGBTQ community and its hard-won victories, though the work toward equality is still in progress. With its quick tempo and spirited delivery, Turner said \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d can make her \u201cforget that the world is a crappy place sometimes.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re almost running to catch up and get on the ride with her, and we feel a part of it,\u201d she said. It\u2019s gay history Dee Michel, author of \u201cFriends of Dorothy: Why Gay Boys and Gay Men Love \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019\u201d was mystified as to why young queer people are meme-ing an 80-year-old song and praising it as a Pride anthem. He posits that the young LGBTQ community might be taking history that is not necessarily rooted in fact (such as the myth that Garland\u2019s death kickstarted the Stonewall riots or that \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d is the inspiration for the Pride flag) because they want to feel closer to their community. According to Michel, these \u201cmyths\u201d can be powerful stories that a culture uses to \u201chelp explain their place in the universe.\u201d Without a monolithic gay history lesson or a one-size-fits-all cultural landscape to guide them, queer youth may choose to believe in \u201cfolklore\u201d about the gay archives, Michel said. \u201cThere\u2019s this drive to be part of gay history and part of gay culture and feel like there\u2019s something larger than you that you\u2019re participating in,\u201d Michel told CNN. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what folklore does.\u201d Believing in Garland\u2019s influence can mean believing in something comforting. \u201cWhether (the history) was true or not, it doesn\u2019t really matter to people, because they want it to be true and it makes sense to them,\u201d Michel said. And \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d and its rapturous response at Garland\u2019s concerts, attended by supportive gay fans, are a part of her legend as a gay icon. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d has been adopted by LGBTQ people since Garland first started singing it in concert. Jim Bailey, a legendary Garland impersonator, often performed \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d dressed for adoring crowds that included the likes of Princess Diana, King Charles and Garland\u2019s daughter Liza Minnelli. It\u2019s been covered by various gay men\u2019s choruses, including those in London and Los Angeles. The song was even included in a medley on an \u201cAll Stars\u201d season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d in a challenge inspired by Garland. Though Garland rarely publicly voiced her support for LGBTQ people, queer people for decades have gravitated toward her because she\u2019s a \u201cwoman of resilience\u201d who endured abuse and tragedy throughout her life and was still a consummate artist, said Turner, the drag performer. And maybe she\u2019s still inspiring a sense of belonging among young queer people who are jamming to \u201cThe Trolley Song,\u201d whether it\u2019s their first listen or the 100th replay. \u201cIf there are young people out there \u2026 who are putting \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 out, how fantastic is that?\u201d Turner said. No matter that \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is nearly 80 years old. It\u2019s a cultural artifact that\u2019s still ripe for discovery \u2013\u2013 and a certified banger. \u201cGay people simply have great taste and to have great taste is to love Judy,\u201d Karger said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/entertainment/judy-garland-trolley-song-pride-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_entertainment_angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-key-moments", "text": "It was a seemingly perfect family in a picture-perfect magazine feature. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie sat in their sunlit glory, playing with their pretend children in their pretend backyard in a now-legendary 60-page photo spread titled \u201cDomestic Bliss\u201d in the July 2005 issue of W Magazine. The scenes of make-believe family depicted in the pages of the fashion magazine, published nearly 19 years ago, foreshadowed what went on to become a reality for the \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith\u201d co-stars: Six children between them and a loving relationship that saw the pair experience professional successes and weather personal hardships in seemingly equal measure. Once Hollywood\u2019s most glamorous power couple, Pitt and Jolie have been locked in a fraught web of legal proceedings since 2016. The divorce of the couple once dubbed Brangelina is not yet finalized and a painful family rift remains. A source close to Pitt told CNN that the actor \u201cloves his family\u201d and \u201dwants what\u2019s best\u201d for them. \u201cAnd so he\u2019s stayed silent on discussing anything about his kids even though it\u2019s obviously very upsetting,\u201d the individual said. The length of their ongoing divorce can be attributed to a number of factors, including a contentious custody trial, fallout from a 2016 incident on a plane and a complicated legal dispute relating to Jolie\u2019s sale of her stake in Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, the French winery that the former couple once co-owned and the property on which they were married in 2014. All Jolie has ever wanted, a source close to Jolie told CNN, \u201cis peace for her family and she hopes [Pitt] will eventually want that too.\u201d CNN has reached to representatives for both Pitt and Jolie for comment. Their Hollywood love story may have been photogenic, but their split has been nothing less than a legal drama with no end yet written. Here\u2019s a look back at their legal feud so far: The 2016 plane incident What could be considered the end of Brangelina allegedly took place on a private plane in September 2016. Details surrounding the circumstances of the incident emerged in August 2022, when a heavily redacted FBI report, provided to CNN by a source at the time, revealed that Jolie had accused Pitt of physically assaulting her and verbally abusing their children while they were aboard the private jet, traveling to the US from France. Pitt became the center of a probe related to the incident but was never arrested or charged, according to an FBI statement at the time. Jolie alleged that Pitt \u201cgrabbed her by her head,\u201d \u201cgrabbed her by the shoulders,\u201d shook her, pushed her into the plane\u2019s bathroom wall and was yelling profanities at her, according to the FBI report, which also stated Pitt allegedly lunged toward one of their children, resulting in Jolie suffering a physical injury after she tried to intervene. In an October 2022 countersuit in a legal case involving their winery (more on that in a bit), Jolie alleged that Pitt \u201cchoked one of the children and struck another in the face\u201d during the incident. In response, a representative for Pitt told CNN in a statement at the time that, \u201cBrad has accepted responsibility for what he did but will not for things he didn\u2019t do.\u201d In April, Jolie claimed in another legal filing from the winery case that Pitt\u2019s \u201chistory of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family\u2019s September 2016 plane trip.\u201d The filing did not go into further detail about the alleged prior abuse. According to that filing, Jolie chose not to press charges against Pitt in relation to the plane incident at the time because she believed \u201cthe best course was for Pitt to accept responsibility and help the family recover from the post-traumatic stress he caused.\u201d Jolie files for divorce In September 2016, just days after the incident on the private jet, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences. According to the petition, Jolie asked the court to grant her sole physical custody of the couple\u2019s then-minor children \u2013 Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivienne, who were between the ages of 8 and 15 at the time \u2013 with visitation rights for Pitt, who would retain joint legal custody. In a 2020 interview with Vogue India, Jolie said that she \u201cseparated\u201d from Pitt for the \u201cwellbeing\u201d of her family. \u201cIt was the right decision. I continue to focus on their healing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are six very brave, very strong young people.\u201d Custody battle Four of Jolie and Pitt\u2019s six children have turned 18 during the course of their ongoing divorce proceedings and their custody arrangement today pertains only to their twins Vivienne and Knox, who are now 15. According to a 2016 court order obtained by CNN at the time, their initial custody arrangement awarded Jolie physical custody of the children. Pitt would, according to the order, have \u201cagreed upon therapeutic visitation\u201d with the minor children and was ordered to undergo random drug and alcohol testing. Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he\u2019d quit \u201cboozing,\u201d saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just become a problem. And I\u2019m really happy it\u2019s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I\u2019ve got my feelings in my fingertips again.\u201d In 2018, a court order obtained by CNN outlined a shared custody schedule for that summer, with Jolie maintaining primary physical custody and Pitt being granted unrestricted phone access to the children. The order also required Jolie to tell their children that the court determined they\u2019re \u201csafe\u201d with their father and that having a healthy relationship with both parents is \u201ccritical.\u201d Following a privately arbitrated custody trial, Pitt was awarded temporary joint custody of the children in May 2021, two sources with knowledge of the case told CNN at the time. Jolie appealed the custody ruling, alleging the judge who had overseen the custody trial had a conflict of interest with Pitt\u2019s legal team. Jolie won her appeal and a California appeals court disqualified the judge. Jolie retains primary custody, and a distance between Pitt and their children has become more apparent in recent months. Vivienne reportedly cited her name as \u201cVivienne Jolie\u201d in the playbill for \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d the Tony-winning musical she helped produce with Jolie. And Shiloh, 18, last month filed a petition to legally drop Pitt from her last name. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard for him,\u201d said the source close to Pitt. \u201cThis is a really hard period.\u201d They become legally single Though their divorce proceedings are ongoing, through what is called a \u201cbifurcated\u00a0judgment,\u201d Pitt and Jolie were declared legally single in 2019. As part of the filing, Jolie officially dropped \u201cPitt\u201d from her last name. New York matrimonial and family law attorney Sophie Jacobi-Parisi, who is not affiliated with either Pitt or Jolie\u2019s legal matters, told CNN a bifurcated divorce is \u201cunique\u201d to California divorces in that it allows former couples to \u201cbreak the bonds of matrimony\u201d while other issues \u2013 be they financial or otherwise \u2013 remain outstanding. But it can sometimes have a detrimental effect on proceedings, she added, because it may remove \u201cincentive to keep people rational,\u201d further prolonging the time it takes to finalize a divorce. The slow pace of the divorce proceedings, even after the bifurcated judgement, is \u201cunusual,\u201d according to Jacobi-Parisi. \u201cIt\u2019s all of these unique little situational aspects of this that have completely exacerbated a super high-conflict divorce from the very beginning \u2013 and they both have the money to fight,\u201d she said. The Ch\u00e2teau Miraval winery lawsuit Much of Pitt and Jolie\u2019s legal saga has centered on the battle over their country estate in the south of France, Ch\u00e2teau Miraval. The suits and filings relating to this matter have also been the vehicles through which many details about their split and ongoing issues have been made public. Their fight over the property began in February 2022, when Pitt sued Jolie and her former company, Nouvel LLC, over what he claimed was the \u201cunlawful\u201d sale of her stake in Miraval, acquired by the couple in 2008. Pitt\u2019s lawsuit alleged that he and Jolie had agreed when they purchased the winery that neither would sell without the other\u2019s consent. According to a subsequent 2023 court filing, attorneys for Pitt called Jolie\u2019s sale \u201cvindictive\u201d after an \u201cadverse custody ruling.\u201d A countersuit filed by Nouvel LLC in September 2022 accused Pitt of \u201cwaging a vindictive war against\u201d Jolie and claimed that there was never any such agreement. The countersuit alleges that Jolie attempted to sell her share of the winery to Pitt but the deal fell apart over a provision in a non-disclosure agreement \u201cdesigned to prohibit Jolie from publicly speaking about the events that had led to the breakdown of their marriage.\u201d Jolie sold Nouvel LLC and its stake in the winery to Tenute del Mondo, a subsidiary of Stoli Group, controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler, in October 2021. Jolie notified Pitt in a January 2021 email about her intention to sell her share in the winery, stating that she no longer wanted to be involved with a business \u201cbased on alcohol, when alcoholic behavior harmed our family so deeply.\u201d The email was an exhibit submitted to the court by Jolie\u2019s attorneys in October 2022. More details about the former couple\u2019s home life may soon emerge. In April, Pitt filed a motion requesting Jolie produce years worth of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), according to a legal filing obtained by CNN. The court granted Pitt\u2019s motion in May and set a deadline for Jolie to submit the NDAs by mid-July, according to the order, obtained by CNN. These NDAs have become the center of the Miraval case, which in itself has felt like \u201can extension of their divorce,\u201d according to Jacobi-Parisi, who clarified that the Miraval case and the divorce are technically separate court actions. Jacobi-Parisi added:\u00a0\u201cUnder the Miraval court action, [the NDAs] can then bring up and dredge up all of the information that was probably sealed in their divorce.\u201d In other words, there may be more to come before Jolie and Pitt truly close this chapter and find their bliss, domestic or otherwise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/entertainment/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-key-moments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_entertainment_summer-anthem-2024-song-tiktok-cec", "text": "You know a song of the summer when you hear it. It\u2019s the song that drags you off the sidelines and onto the dancefloor. A song that sounds best when it\u2019s being sung by the people you love, cups in hand, in sticky heat. It worms its way into your brain and stays there, and, even years later, takes you right back to the summer you first heard it. Songs of the summer, at their best, are sonic representations of the hottest months of the year, says Mike Errico, a songwriter and instructor at New York University\u2019s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. \u201cThey\u2019re upbeat, extroverted, bright and fun, with a big, repeatable chorus that even the most musically challenged can join in on,\u201d Errico tells CNN. \u201cBeing danceable is a big plus, because it can work on the beach in the day, or in the clubs at night.\u201d Interestingly, most of these songs were released weeks or months before the first day of summer. And more than a few of them received a major boost from TikTok, where their catchiest 15 to 30 seconds have found a massive (and influential) audience. It was easier even a decade ago to settle on the song of the summer. \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d was inescapable in 2013; so was \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d the year before. But there are fewer and fewer breakouts like those as monoculture shrinks \u2014\u00a0now, TikTok is perhaps the most influential decider of a song\u2019s success, and with its ever-quickening trend cycle, it\u2019s easy for songs even by major artists to get lost in the shuffle. And yet, some bangers have broken through. The contenders for this year\u2019s song of the summer are soaring up Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, soundtracking videos online and inspiring us to work up a sweat offline. Now that summer has officially started, sample these musical confections and decide for yourself \u2014\u00a0what\u2019s destined to become the song of summer 2024? \u2018Espresso,\u2019 Sabrina Carpenter Carpenter\u2019s cotton candy-light single sounds like a summer fling feels: Fairly brief, nothing deep and just plain fun. That most of the lyrics are sugary nonsense \u2014\u201cI know I Mountain Dew it for ya\u201d and \u201cMy \u2018give-a-f**ks\u2019 are on vacation,\u201d for two \u2014\u00a0only adds to its frothy charm. It all works, though, because Carpenter\u2019s in on the joke, wryly playing the part of a resistant love interest who\u2019s putting up with a man\u2019s attention if only because it boosts her own ego. \u201cIsn\u2019t that sweet? I guess so!\u201d \u2018Lunch,\u2019 Billie Eilish This culinary-themed cut from the young Grammy winner\u2019s latest album is propulsive, buoyant and slyly sexual \u2014\u00a0certainly the closest to summer that Eilish\u2019s sound has ever come. She\u2019s downright giddy with lust on \u201cLunch,\u201d a track that flirts between heavy bass and feathery piano as though it\u2019s riding the peaks and valleys of passion. It\u2019s a song that feels destined to end in a mosh pit, bodies jumping and writhing to Eilish\u2019s version of lovestruck pop. \u2018Nasty,\u2019 Tinashe Finally, after years of grinding out reliably dancey R&B anthems, Tinashe\u2019s viral moment has arrived \u2014\u00a0with a major assist from a British TikTok dancer. Crafty TikTok-ers layered Tinashe\u2019s new single on top of a video of a dancer named Nate thrusting and grinding in a soca dance class. Even without the meme treatment, though, Tinashe\u2019s latest seems made for shaking it in the summer \u2014\u00a0Janet Jackson proved as much when she blended the new \u201cNasty\u201d with her own track of the same name at a recent live show. Over a clean, sophisticated beat, Tinashe matter-of-factly asserts her badness. And its suggestive, quotable refrain is born to endure beyond TikTok: \u201cIs somebody gonna match my freak?\u201d \u2018Good Luck, Babe!\u2019 Chappell Roan Where previous entries on this list were more ambivalent on the subject of love, Roan\u2019s anthem is this summer\u2019s bleeding heart. \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d boasts the musical theatrics of Kate Bush, \u201880s synths straight out of Cyndi Lauper\u2019s catalog and a queer point of view all Roan\u2019s own. In its most thrilling moment, Roan fantasizes the woman she loves waking up in the future next to a man she loathes: \u201cYou know I hate to say, but, I told you so,\u201d she sings, suddenly breaking into a high belt. If summer is about taking it easy, Roan didn\u2019t get the memo: She\u2019s doing vocal gymnastics here. (And at Roan\u2019s increasingly popular live shows, thousands of people are belting along with her.) \u2018Million Dollar Baby,\u2019 Tommy Richman This ubiquitous TikTok banger became a hit seemingly overnight. But it\u2019s a smash from the first listen, with its arresting falsetto chorus, trap-funk undercurrent and vague but relatable lyrics about making it. The song itself is a self-fulfilling prophecy, perhaps, for Richman: Before it went stratospheric on TikTok (there are at least five million videos set to a clip of the song) and streaming platforms, he was virtually unknown. Here, he borrows sounds from more established artists like Sampha and Brockhampton, building a track that evokes sweaty, striving summer nights. \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019 Kendrick Lamar Here\u2019s a song of the summer that breaks all the rules. At 4:33, it\u2019s the longest song in the bunch by a minute. \u201cNot Like Us\u201d doesn\u2019t really have a chorus, and the closest thing to it \u2014 Lamar chanting the title \u2014 only appears two minutes into the song. It\u2019s got three verses that, typical of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Lamar, are stuffed with verbose slant rhymes. And yet, the latest of Lamar\u2019s diss tracks against Drake, himself a longtime song of the summer contributor, has turned into a bonafide hit (albeit a wordy one). With its surgical disassembly of the man behind \u201cOne Dance\u201d and \u201cHotline Bling,\u201d \u201cNot Like Us\u201d forces listeners to pay close attention throughout its runtime. Even without a hook, it\u2019s a song that\u2019s meant to be rapped along to with a crowd \u2014 maybe that\u2019s why Lamar performed it five times at his Juneteenth show in LA. His audience knew every word. \u2018A Bar Song (Tipsy),\u2019 Shaboozey Fresh off a recent feature on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter,\u201d Shaboozey\u2019s summer hit is a countryfied take on J-Kwon\u2019s immortal club hit \u201cTipsy.\u201d But unlike J-Kwon\u2019s celebration of the club circa 2004, Shaboozey is decidedly glummer on his post-workday drinking binge. \u201cEverybody at the bar gettin\u2019 tipsy,\u201d he laments. Still, lyrics about dragging your increasingly drunk self from bar to bar in a desperate attempt to shed the stress of your 9-to-5 are not unrelatable. It might not be as feather-light as \u201cEspresso\u201d or danceable as \u201cNasty,\u201d but \u201cA Bar Song\u201d has an easy-to-sing hook that\u2019s destined to play at closing time at a Nashville honky tonk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/entertainment/summer-anthem-2024-song-tiktok-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_entertainment_kinds-of-kindness-yorgos-lanthimos-cast-interviews", "text": "Jesse Plemons is thrilled to learn he can make someone faint. In an interview promoting his latest movie \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d I share an incident that took place at a screening I attended, in which I\u2019m all but certain he sent an audience member over the edge. \u201cAt what part? Do you remember?\u201d the actor says eagerly, eyes lighting up. It wasn\u2019t even something his character did, I reply, just something he said \u2013 a grisly bit of foreshadowing. \u201cWow,\u201d says Plemons, beaming. \u201cOh, I like that.\u201d The film\u2019s writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos, a connoisseur of Biblical violence and creator of cursed demimondes, likes to push viewers to the limit. But for Plemons to do so with a line reading is an achievement. No wonder he was awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival in May for his performance. Plemons joins Lanthimos regulars Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe, supported by Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Margaret Qualley and Mamoudou Athie, in the Greek filmmaker\u2019s prickliest and most transgressive work since \u201cDogtooth,\u201d his Oscar-nominated breakthrough from 2009. Group sex, cannibalism and suicidal animals all feature. As one critic succinctly put it, \u201cSicko Yorgos is back.\u201d After writing two films with Tony McNamara (yielding the career-boosting \u201cThe Favourite\u201d and \u201cPoor Things\u201d) Lanthimos has reunited with his old writing partner Efthimis Filippou to create a diabolical comedy triptych. Set in contemporary America, the three short stories feature the ensemble cast playing different roles in each story. In one, a man (Plemons) whose life is dictated by his boss (Dafoe) suffers the consequences when he disobeys an order. In another, a man (Plemons) is overjoyed by the return of his missing wife (Stone), only to start believing she\u2019s an imposter. And in the last, two disciples of a sex cult (Plemons and Stone) search for a prophesized messiah at the instruction of their mercurial leader (Dafoe). Although each actor is re-cast, a mysterious character known only as \u201cR.M.F\u201d features fleetingly in each story, suggesting all three take place in the same universe. The interconnect-ness doesn\u2019t stop there, but nor does the film lock together in a neat way. Instead, themes and arcs are mirrored and connect, moments firing off against each other like synapses. If this is as close as we\u2019ve yet come to seeing inside Lanthimos\u2019 brain, he staunchly refuses to spoon feed it to his audience. Paired with a coy marketing campaign, this has led some to question what the film is all about. Alwyn concedes that it took a couple of watches to start unpacking it. At first blush, \u201cit was just a visceral experience, which I think is the case with a lot of his films.\u201d \u201cHe really isn\u2019t pretentious,\u201d says Dafoe of his director. \u201cIt really is that classic thing of he\u2019s an artist that is putting stuff out there that\u2019s really rich. I think people will bring their experience to it and come to different interpretations.\u201d Athie, whose most prominent role is as Plemon\u2019s cop partner and very, very close friend in the second story, has the neatest interpretation of the film: \u201cThis is a real exploration of control, and how willing people are to give it away,\u201d he says. Fittingly, Plemons describes preparing for a project so open to interpretation in much the same way. \u201c(Yorgos) has a lot of ideas, but isn\u2019t married to any one of them,\u201d he explained. As an actor, \u201cit is this sense of surrender and abandon, and stepping off a ledge and hoping for the best.\u201d In \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d Lanthimos injects Old Testament logic into everyday life in twisted parables about the social contracts we write one another. He suggests we\u2019re all in dom-sub relationships with each other, the only debate being what the boundaries of each relationship may be. Plemons\u2019 character is calling the shots in the second story, but in the first and third that falls to Dafoe. If God had a face, he might look like Willem Dafoe, according to Lanthimos, who has the actor let rip with two very different God complexes. As horrible boss Raymond he is imperious; as spiritualist leader Omi he is seductive, budgie smugglers, eyeliner and all. \u201cHe finally got to play himself,\u201d Plemons jokes. \u201cYeah, yeah. Shhh!\u201d Dafoe replies, laughing. In the cut and thrust of the shoot, who knows who chose what for the amorous cultist, says Dafoe, but Lanthimos \u201cdoes give you room,\u201d turning you in \u201can accomplice.\u201d \u201cMaybe my biggest contribution was really liking those orange Speedos and saying, \u2018I want to wear those!\u2019\u201d All three of the film\u2019s main doms are merciless but pose as loving. Love in its ickiest and stickiest forms is a throughline of Lanthimos\u2019 films (see: Colin Farrell and a steak knife in \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d or Christos Stergioglou\u2019s fabulist father in \u201cDogtooth\u201d). Here, the screenplay puts characters in deplorable situations for their love of work, spouse and faith. Some do deplorable things to hold on to that love; others do deplorable things when that love curdles. This idea reaches a nadir with one of Alwyn\u2019s characters, in a scene shared with Stone. It involves an assault; a moment of standout awfulness in a film that thinks nothing of showing us self-mutilation and horrific traffic accidents. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do scenes that are nasty and explore really dark corners, then, touch wood, you\u2019re going to be in a room of people that you really like,\u201d says Alwyn. \u201cKnowing Emily (Stone\u2019s birth name) as a friend, and Yorgos too, and having worked with them before, that comfort was kind of built in.\u201d \u201cAlthough it\u2019s nasty on camera, the atmosphere (was) light on set \u2013 or trie(d) to be,\u201d he promises. Alwyn, a veteran of \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d is in many ways the typical Lanthimos actor. A repeat performer, his characters have been humiliated, shot for laughs, or acted in the worst way imaginable (\u201cYeah, he does have it in for me maybe,\u201d Alwyn quips). But like so many actors in the director\u2019s growing troupe, he keeps coming back for more. \u201cHe\u2019s so singular as an artist and a creator,\u201d says the actor. \u201cAnd although you\u2019re going to probably be asked to do some pretty uncomfortable things or be pretty unpleasant at some point in a project of his, he\u2019s actually a nice guy.\u201d Now try telling that to the audience members fainting in the aisles. \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is available in select US cinemas from June 21, and released nationwide and in the UK on June 28.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/entertainment/kinds-of-kindness-yorgos-lanthimos-cast-interviews/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

We sure hope so, because this week\u2019s episode of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d is filled with just as much horror. Understandably, King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) is distraught over the death of his heir. In what can only be described as a royal temper tantrum, he shouts, \u201cThis is war! I declare war!\u201d Convinced this is the work of Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy), Aegon is out for vengeance and wants to \u201cdracarys\u201d Team Black. But Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) swoops in to pour some water on his grandson\u2019s fiery impulses and tells King Aegon to chill for a minute, reasoning that \u201csome good may come of this.\u201d He concocts a plan to blame it all on Rhaenyra by holding a public funeral procession through the streets of King\u2019s Landing. Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and Helaena (Phia Saban) sit behind Jaehaerys\u2019 coffin in the wagon while a King\u2019s Guardsman shouts, \u201cBehold the works of Rhaenyra Targaryen, pretender to the throne, King slayer!\u201d It\u2019s an effective measure. Word quickly gets back at Dragonstone, where Rhaenyra is learning about the death of Jaehaerys for the first time and that she\u2019s being blamed for it. As a mother still grieving the death of her own child, she is aghast that anyone would think that she was behind it. It isn\u2019t until she glances over at Daemon (Matt Smith) to find that smug little smirk on his face for Rhaenyra to immediately figure out that he had something to do with this. This revelation spawns a nasty spat between the pair. Daemon denies that he told anyone to kill Jaehaerys, and Rhaenyra refuses to believe him. Daemon insists he only commissioned his assassins to kill Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) and that this was all one big misunderstanding, but Rhaenyra accuses Daemon of taking her \u201cI want Aemond Targaryen\u201d statement as an excuse to seek his own revenge against her for her late father choosing her as his heir instead of him. \u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Daemon says. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic,\u201d Rhaenyra retorts. The lovers\u2019 quarrel ends there, with Daemon flying out of Dragonstone on Caraxes. Otto may have been calling the shots at the start of the episode, but he wasn\u2019t by the end of it. He confronts King Aegon about having every single ratcatcher in King\u2019s Landing publicly hanged in town, saying it was a reckless decision and that, unlike his late father, he has no dignity. \u201cF\u2013k dignity. I want revenge,\u201d Aegon says. This ends with King Aegon firing Otto as his Hand and replacing him with Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), who Aegon says has proven to be \u201cof more worth than a hundred old men\u201d because of his plan to send Arryk Cargyll (Luke Tittensor) to Dragonstone, posing as his twin brother Erryk (Elliott Tittensor), to kill Rhaenyra. Elsewhere in Westeros Maybe Otto said it best when he mused that these folks are not peacocks, rather \u201cthey\u2019re all shrieking and feathers.\u201d Sounds about right. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d airs Sunday nights on Max, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.

{"id": "2024_06_12_entertainment_the-boys-season-4-review-political-drama", "text": "\u201cThe Boys\u201d began with an intriguing question for our superhero-infused pop culture \u2013 namely, what would happen if extraordinary powers were wedded with corruption, neuroses and corporate greed. Yet that dark, satirical take on the genre has blossomed into TV\u2019s most political drama, a quality even more overtly on display in its much-anticipated fourth season. Put more simply, don\u2019t let the masks and capes fool you. The fact that the latest episodes drop as the US braces for a presidential campaign only magnifies elements that have existed throughout the show\u2019s run on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, becoming the service\u2019s signature series, including the spinoffs \u201cGen V\u201d and \u201cThe Boys Presents: Diabolical.\u201d The fourth season features the usual conflict between superheroes in the uneasy employ of Vought International and those who oppose them. The former cohort begins with the near-invincible, psychopathic Homelander (Antony Starr), whose Superman-like public persona is carefully manicured to hide those qualities, while the latter take their lead from Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), even if they frequently question his methods. The Butcher-Homelander standoff is complicated by their battle for the soul of the latter\u2019s biological son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), which itself encompasses consideration of the question of nature versus nature. More than any season before it, the new arc leans into the political realm thanks to the involvement of politician Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), and efforts by Vought and Homelander to impact the political debate. That includes thinly-veiled references to a group clearly intended to represent QAnon, the conspiracy-minded movement, and the use of propaganda tactics to manipulate the public and voters. At one point, the characters attend an event called Truthcon, where a banner that reads \u201cThere are no conspiracies \u2013 or coincidences\u201d is prominently flown. The show also reveals the private disdain of those in (and with) power toward their supporters, a point made in a uniquely \u201cThe Boys\u201d-esque manner. To punctuate that, there\u2019s a new hero, Firecracker (Valorie Curry), whose political leanings echo Vought News\u2019 conservative commentators (she even gets her own show). As series creator Eric Kripke told Entertainment Weekly, the character serves as a surrogate for \u201cconspiracy-minded movements and the super extreme right-wing news media.\u201d Dispensing with subtlety, Kripke and company have surrounded that satire in violence and excess, qualities that feel organic to this world, where the traditional ideal of heroism is used to obscure brutal realities. Although the Deep (Chace Crawford), an Aquaman-like member of the Vought-backed superhero team known as the Seven, is often a semi-pathetic sources of derision, he sums that mentality up when he comes to the realization, as he puts it, \u201cViolence is power.\u201d Inevitably, the new season involves new, unexpected and uneasy alliances, as well as the thorny (and seemingly perennial) issue of finding ways to neutralize Homelander, which hardly feels like a fair fight. Having earned its reputation as the most gruesome and kinky show on television, \u201cThe Boys\u201d grapples with a certain pressure to fulfill those expectations for the faithful. In its totality, the eight-episode season largely manages to clear that bar (or should one prefer, limbo under it), including a few explosively funny (and not incidentally, grisly) visual gags. Success has also enabled \u201cThe Boys\u201d to play a long game, meaning nobody should expect too much closure from this season when there\u2019s a fifth and final season to come. From that view, the series might have lost some of its freshness but not its ability to surprise and provoke, peeling back its mask a little further to issue a warning about the danger of brightly colored fascism, a message clearly intended to echo beyond its world and into ours. \u201cThe Boys\u201d begins its fourth season June 13 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/entertainment/the-boys-season-4-review-political-drama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_entertainment_kevin-costner-horizon-movie", "text": "Kevin Costner wants you to know that his new film, the first part of \u201cHorizon: An American Saga,\u201d is not three hours long. \u201cIt\u2019s two hours and fifty-one minutes,\u201d he told CNN in a recent interview as he sipped on a soothing cup of tea with honey during a busy press tour. \u201cLet\u2019s be really clear about that.\u201d If anyone knows the film\u2019s running time down to the second, it would be Costner. He co-wrote, produced, directed and co-stars in the epic western set around the time of the American Civil War. Costner said he\u2019s been trying to get the film made for decades and has no concerns that the length might be a turnoff to those with short attention spans. \u201cI make movies for people so that they won\u2019t be bored,\u201d he said. \u201cI give them a taste of something in a different direction, which is probably why it\u2019s hard for me to get them made at first \u2018cause they\u2019re a little different.\u201d From any perspective, it\u2019s an ambitious project. There are four planned films with the first \u201cchapter\u201d being released on June 28 and the second in theaters on August 16. The first film sets the scene of a clash between a group of settlers and the indigenous people who already live in the west. Costner is currently filming the third movie. \u201cThese stories and these people, their lives keep evolving and their situations get even more desperate, more thrilling, more is at stake,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because we know them and we care about them, and the third one I\u2019m filming right now is incredibly dynamic.\u201d Fans of Costner\u2019s 1990 film \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d and his role in \u201cYellowstone\u201d are aware of his affinity for westerns, something Costner attributes to the inherent \u201cdrama\u201d of these settings. \u201cIf we can just close our eyes and go back, realize how hard it was because you were going west, but you were also coming up against people who had lived there for thousands of years and didn\u2019t want to let go of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you had no law out there. There was nothing to really protect you. The only thing that was taking you out there was this appetite in America that if you were strong enough and bold enough, you could hold onto something if you were willing to actually defend.\u201d \u201cThat kind of attitude is a recipe for disaster and nothing but clash. And how do you deal with someone who wants what you have? If you do that in a real simple way, it\u2019s boring,\u201d Costner added. \u201cBut if you do that in a way that you realize the dilemma, that must be what  people were going through back then, it can be really very entertaining.\u201d The mix of history and a star-studded cast was heady for Costner, who directs several heavy hitters, including Abbey Lee, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Luke Wilson and more. It\u2019s the kind of film he\u2019s long wanted to see and make. So with all the work directing entails, why did Costner also decide to take on the role of cowboy Hayes Ellison in the film? It was personal, he said. \u201cI felt like I was the guy to play this guy,\u201d Costner said. \u201cYou know, I named my son after him, who\u2019s in the movie [Hayes Costner, 15, makes his acting debut in \u2018Horizon\u2019] and it\u2019s just been a journey for me, too. I just believe in the power of movies.\u201d And while he\u2019s no historian, Costner recognizes the importance of releasing films set pre- and-post-Civil War at a time when America feels divided. He\u2019s hopeful that his project will spark audiences to reflect on how the states came to be united in the first place. \u201cWhat has to occur in any culture in life is a level of empathy, a level of understanding history, really understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can have empathy when you understand history. It\u2019s like we are in this together and we can flourish. If we don\u2019t, we will be divided.\u201d \u201cHorizon: An American Saga\u201d debuts in theaters on June 28. The film is distributed by Warner Bros., which like CNN is part of Warner Bros. Discovery.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/entertainment/kevin-costner-horizon-movie/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The beloved romance movie, starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple separated by class, released on June 25 2004. Directed by Nick Cassavetes, the movie is based on the 1996 Nicholas Sparks book of the same name and follows an elderly man, played by James Garner, reading aloud from a notebook to a woman in a nursing home with dementia, played by Gena Rowlands. As he reads, the movie flashes back to 1940s South Carolina, where Gosling\u2019s lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun falls in love with rich girl Allie Hamilton, whose parents try to keep them apart. Cassavetes credited the film\u2019s costars with its staying power. \u201cThey\u2019re both the greatest actors in the world, and some of the things that I asked them to play were so difficult, and there was nothing they couldn\u2019t do,\u201d the director recalled in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly. \u201cIf you want to know why\u00a0The Notebook\u00a0is considered kind of a romantic classic, the answers are Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, and that\u2019s the beginning and the end of it.\u201d Cassavetes told the publication that Rowlands, who is his mother, is now currently living with Alzheimers. \u201cI got my mom to play older Allie, and we spent a lot of time talking about Alzheimer\u2019s and wanting to be authentic with it, and now, for the last five years, she\u2019s had Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Cassavetes said. \u201cWe lived it, she acted it, and now it\u2019s on us.\u201d Sparks drew inspiration from a real couple to pen the touching love story. \u201cIt is a story of young love, it\u2019s a story of reunited love, it\u2019s a story of everlasting love,\u201d the author told CBS Sunday Morning. \u201cIt\u2019s also a story of memory.\u201d Here are five unforgettable exchanges from \u201cThe Notebook\u201d movie: \u2022 \u201cSo it\u2019s not gonna be easy.

And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve given me. That\u2019s what I hope to give to you forever. I love you.

{"id": "2024_06_24_entertainment_inside-out-2-box-office-disney-critics-woke", "text": "As emotions go, Disney\u2019s loudest critics might sound angry, but \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is bringing the studio nothing but joy. The Walt Disney Co. has often found itself cast as a reluctant participant in the culture wars, yielding occasional calls for boycotts and proclamations the company has become \u201ctoo woke.\u201d Yet the explosive box-office success of \u201cInside Out 2\u201d provides necessary perspective about a vast audience that remains hungry for Disney content, certainly enough to generate a major hit. Granted, those who regularly rail against Disney \u2013 which was drawn into a political battle with Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, beginning in 2022 over the state\u2019s so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill \u2013 have sought to rationalize the performance of the Pixar sequel, insisting its plot doesn\u2019t toe the \u201cwoke\u201d line the way something like the studio\u2019s latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d series, \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d does. Notably, a review-bombing campaign has been waged against the latter, depressing its score on the critic-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes to almost comical levels. Look a little closer, though, and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d features an effortless emphasis on values like diversity and inclusion that have helped make Disney a target. The Disney unit behind it, Pixar, also enjoyed a less-ostentatious box-office win last summer with \u201cElemental,\u201d a movie that used an allegorical relationship between characters made up of fire and water to explore bigotry, the immigrant experience, and a love story about overcoming differences. Whatever the reason \u2013 and with the sequel coming nine years after the original, pent-up demand is surely a part \u2013 there\u2019s no denying \u201cInside Out 2\u2019s\u201d results, with the movie adding $100 million at the North American box office during its second weekend \u2013 a record for an animated film \u2013 bringing its domestic total to $355 million, eclipsing \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d as the year\u2019s top movie in just 10 days of release. Worldwide, the film\u2019s haul has ballooned to nearly $725 million. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d will almost surely join the increasingly rare list of $1 billion-plus grossers since the Covid outbreak, which consists of sequels to \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cJurassic World\u201d as well as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting Disney has consciously sought to shy away from engaging in political battles, with CEO Robert Iger, who rejoined the company in that capacity in 2022, telling CNBC in November, \u201c\u201cWe have to entertain first. It\u2019s not about messages.\u201d In essence, Iger simply stated the obvious: That Disney, like any major corporation, prioritizes its profits and stock price, which means trying not to alienate potential customers, no matter how eager some of them are to be offended. Disney employees represent another constituency, which offers some context regarding why former CEO Bob Chapek finally chose, belatedly and under pressure from them, to criticize Florida. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d certainly looks like a triumph for Iger\u2019s strategy, while still conveying messages in a more subtle (and for those seeking any opportunity to pounce, less inflammatory) manner. Indeed, summer 2024 is shaping up to be a banner one for Disney, with the superhero satire \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d expected to another major attraction when the film opens in July, catering to an R-rated crowd that underscores the demographic reach of its assorted assets. That doesn\u2019t mean those who have turned Disney\u2019s Mouse ears into targets will be less inclined to rail against something like \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d distorting what the \u201cStar Wars\u201d show does and doesn\u2019t do in the process. It\u2019s a reminder, though, that plenty of people still see in the Disney name the ideal of entertainment that they can share with loved ones, and that as long as the studio fulfills that implied contract, woke or otherwise, Mickey and friends won\u2019t be going broke anytime soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/entertainment/inside-out-2-box-office-disney-critics-woke/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_entertainment_subtitles-movies-tv", "text": "One of the benefits of streaming has been an increased flow of series and movies from around the globe, as services try to keep their shelves filled with fresh alternatives. Subscribers in the US, moreover, seem much less resistant than in years past when it comes to watching shows either entirely or heavily in languages other than English, as evidenced by the popularity of titles like \u201cSquid Game,\u201d \u201cLupin\u201d and most recently \u201cShogun.\u201d Yet even shows produced in English in other countries, like the UK and Australia, can become a little thick for an American ear trying to sort out the idiomatic quirks and other differences. If you paused a few times to catch lines in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d or \u201cBodkin,\u201d or Paramount+\u2019s \u201cSexy Beast,\u201d rest assured, you are not alone. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason why data indicate more people \u2013 especially young adults, who are more prone to second-screen viewing and multitasking \u2013 are watching shows in their primary language with the subtitles on. According to a 2023 survey by YouGov, nearly 40% of US respondents preferred having the subtitles on when watching TV in a language they speak, with those under 30 employing that practice by a better than two-to-one margin compared to those age 45 to 64. The survey found that those using subtitles cite two primary factors in equal measure: Subtitles enhance their comprehension, and they help them understand accents. Netflix, as the most widely distributed streaming service, has cast its net farther and wider in terms of offering programs produced around the world, and it has taken note of changes in the way people consume its content. The service has increased the number of films and series that support audio descriptions (AD) and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing (SDH). Kathy Rokni, Netflix\u2019s senior director of globalization, said the service employs an in-house team of \u201csubtitling experts and language managers,\u201d designed to enhance the viewing experience while remaining faithful to the filmmakers\u2019 intentions. \u201cWe believe great stories transcend borders, cultures, abilities, and languages,\u201d Rokni said via email, noting that 40% of viewing hours on Netflix now happen with subtitles, including SDH, over half of which involves members employing subtitles in their primary language. Certainly, it\u2019s a long way back to 1979, when the Australian movie \u201cMad Max\u201d was dubbed into American English because the distributor feared Americans wouldn\u2019t be able to understand the Aussie accents. British series obviously have a long history in the US \u2013 look no further than \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and the period dramas presented by \u201cMasterpiece Theater\u201d \u2013 but they traditionally tended to operate within a relatively narrow swatch of audience and genres. By contrast, it\u2019s notable today that a wider variety of imports, either in English or other languages, are organically finding success with little advance fanfare and promotion, as \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and before that \u201cSquid Game\u201d did. The trend suggests viewers are actively sampling internationally produced material as they seek (and often stumble upon) options via streaming platforms. For streaming services, there\u2019s a clear benefit to that, since series already produced elsewhere generally cost less to acquire than homegrown product, particularly with the production pipeline having slowed due to last year\u2019s twin and prolonged actors and writers strikes. So if the best show you\u2019ve seen lately also happens to be one where you find yourself reading along while watching, either to assist your understanding or simply by choice? It\u2019s not just you.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/entertainment/subtitles-movies-tv/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
