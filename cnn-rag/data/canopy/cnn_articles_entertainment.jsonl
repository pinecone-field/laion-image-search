{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_entertainment_house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones-ijdgi-cec", "text": "Winter never came for me. I say that not even fully understanding what that means, though I do know it means plenty to fans of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cHouse of the Dragon.\u201d Bring on the fire breathing, as I am fully prepared to be judged for all of what I am about to say. I completely understand fandom. I better, given that I\u2019m an entertainment reporter by both trade and choice. Not to mention that those two shows have been massive hits for HBO, which shares a parent company with CNN. I also admit to some FOMO when others are all in on pop culture obsessions, because I want to play too! And people love them some \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Like seriously love it. My mom will tell you that pop culture has been in my blood almost since the beginning, especially television shows. If you wanted to keep me quiet as a kid, you either handed me a book or you plopped me in front of a television. Especially anything having to do with historical fiction. So it would make sense that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d would be my jam since it\u2019s based on the incredibly popular \u201cA Song of Fire and Ice\u201d fantasy book series by George R. R. Martin. Upon seeing the promotional photos before the series debuted in 2011, I immediately thought \u201cmedieval drama!\u201d and was ready to be all in, starting with the novels. The struggle began when I was reading the first book in the series. I am that annoying type of person who MUST read the book before the thing it\u2019s based on comes out. (I also have to read book series in strict order, but I digress). The first book is titled \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d and I settled in fully expecting to be engrossed by all 694 pages. I even poured my favorite beverage in my chalice goblet to set the mood for what I had heard was a powerful tale of the inhabitants of the fictitious lands of Westeros and Essos. Things didn\u2019t go as planned. I just couldn\u2019t seem to connect with the book, despite Martin being a fine writer. \u201cMaybe I just can\u2019t read it,\u201d I thought, and downloaded it on Audible to listen instead. Dear reader, it became the first audiobook I have ever fallen asleep to while listening. So my expectations were already low when the series debuted. I tried to watch the first few episodes and they seemed too dark to me \u2014 and I\u2019m not just talking about the subject matter. The cinematography seemed so dark, at times I felt like I was struggling to make out the characters. It all felt so\u2026bleak. Add the fact that, as an empath, I really can\u2019t do beheadings, and I decided to tap out. \u201cSuccession\u201d with swords The show very quickly began to take over my social media feeds and thus began my feelings of being left out of what plenty of people appeared to be enjoying. I tried to sort out why exactly I wasn\u2019t vibing with the \u201cGOT\u201d franchise. Was it because I\u2019m not the biggest fantasy fan? No, I loved \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cShadow and Bone.\u201d Was it the violence? Perhaps, though anyone who knows me (or followed either my writing and/or my social media) knows that I am a huge mob movies fan. I even wrote an essay inspired by the fact that I rewatch Martin Scorsese\u2019s classic \u201cGoodfellas\u201d at least once a week even though, in fairness, I watch a sanitized version that I recorded off of television so it\u2019s not as violent as the original. The closest explanation I\u2019ve been able to come up with centers on the fact that \u201cThe Game of Thrones\u201d characters aren\u2019t the greatest people, and even the incredibly handsome visage of Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington) doesn\u2019t change that fact. As my editor Megan Thomas pointed out, it really is like \u201cSuccession\u201d with swords. Almost every character has an angle, and most of them aren\u2019t people you\u2019d want as friends in real life. \u201cSuccession\u201d is another hit HBO show by the way, so make of that pattern what you will. When it comes right down to it, even for someone who enjoys watching any and all things having to do with the mafia, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d which includes storylines of rape, war and incest felt way too brutal to me. Solace can often be found in community and I feel like Adam Elkus nailed it in his 2015 Medium piece titled \u201cWhy Game of Thrones Is Making Us Stupid.\u201d \u201cIt is a form of power pornography in which viwers [sic] watch human beings degrade, hurt, betray, abuse, and destroy each other and then compulsively compete to see how can make the most clever gif or Imgur image out of such depravity,\u201d he writes.  Heavy, right? Wih this weekend\u2019s premiere of the second season of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spinoff \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d I decided to try again. This is the part where I should write something noble about how I feel like a different person or that I am in a different place years later, having survived the pandemic or something like that. The truth is my friend actress LaNisa Renee Frederick has been documenting watching \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d for the first time on her Instagram account and cracking me up with her comments like \u201cThese people need baths,\u201d \u201cIs he gonna die soon,\u201d and \u201cIs he Black? Are there Black people in this?\u201d With remote and snacks in hand I tried again to binge watch \u201cGOT\u201d and \u2026 nope. Still not for me. Before you suggest that I jump straight to watching \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d and abandon all hopes of its predecessor, scroll back to the portion where I mentioned my obsessive need to read things in order. That goes for watching things in order as well, and while it\u2019s technically a prequel, just thinking about doubling back like that feels like I would be disturbing something in the force. (I know that\u2019s a Star Wars reference but, I\u2019m really trying to placate the fantasy fans who might feel tempted to come for my head.) Plus, these days I\u2019m searching for as many things as possible to feel good about. So sorry \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d it doesn\u2019t appear we\u2019re meant to be. Don\u2019t feel sad for me that I\u2019m missing out on all the action of the second season of a show that\u2019s eagerly awaited because I\u2019m cool with it. And should anyone try to shame you for the same or express that they can\u2019t believe that anyone wouldn\u2019t love \u201cGOT\u201d or \u201cHOTD,\u201d share this piece with them. I want them to know it was me.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/entertainment/house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones-ijdgi-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_entertainment_presumed-innocent-review-jake-gyllenhaal", "text": "Bearing little resemblance to the 1990 movie starring Harrison Ford, \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d has become an Apple TV+ limited series with an old-fashioned, pulpy feel \u2013 \u201cold-fashioned\u201d in the way classic courtroom dramas incorporated dramatic flourishes that would never, ever happen in a real trial. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the accused prosecutor, in a show that works strictly as a check-your-brain-at-the-courthouse-steps exercise. Filled with florid characters and overheated situations, writer David E. Kelley (whose credits include lots of legal dramas dating back to \u201cL.A. Law\u201d) teams up with producer J.J. Abrams on this adaptation of Scott Turow\u2019s book, which capitalizes on the eight-episode format to take a longer time (too long, frankly) before getting into the courtroom. Mostly, that provides opportunities to get to know Rusty Sabich (Gyllenhaal, having moved into pass-the-popcorn mode between this and \u201cRoad House\u201d) and his family dynamics in a deeper way, before he\u2019s thrown into a tailspin when accused of murdering colleague Carolyn Polhemus (Norwegian star Renate Reinsve), with whom he was having an affair and, by his own admission, obsessed. Rusty\u2019s wife, Barbara (Ruth Negga), doesn\u2019t believe he killed her, but the case drags his infidelity into public view and essentially rubs her nose in it, with plenty of flashbacks of their steamy illicit trysts to put an exclamation point on that because, hey, streaming. Other than Gyllenhaal, whose take on Rusty is decidedly less sympathetic than Ford\u2019s was (albeit with a better haircut, although the rest of the movie feels superior), everyone else appears to be working off cue cards that say \u201cDO IT BIGGER.\u201d That includes Negga as the wounded wife; Gyllenhaal\u2019s real-life brother-in-law, Peter Sarsgaard, as the prosecutor, Tommy Molto, champing at the bit to convict Rusty; and Bill Camp as Raymond Horgan, the former boss who agrees to defend him. Notably, that tonal criticism also applies to Kelley\u2019s other recent drama based on a novel, Netflix\u2019s \u201cA Man in Full,\u201d which, in both cases, somewhat neutralizes an impressive cast. \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d nevertheless proves watchable despite \u2013 and for some, surely, because of \u2013 its excesses. Apple made seven of the eight episodes available, so how this version handles the twisty ending remains to be seen, though it\u2019s fair to say the production takes a few liberties up until that point. \u201cThis is nuts,\u201d Rusty\u2019s teenage daughter says as suspicion falls upon her dad, which makes her sound both like a legal analyst, at least in the context of this trial, and an astute TV critic. \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d does have its moments, but in terms of making a case for committing to sit through eight chapters, Kelley, Gyllenhaal and company haven\u2019t exactly put together an open-and-shut case. \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d premieres June 12 on Apple TV+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/entertainment/presumed-innocent-review-jake-gyllenhaal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_entertainment_harvey-weinstein-prior-bad-acts-laws", "text": "By the time Taral\u00ea\u00a0 Wulff had testified against Harvey Weinstein in his 2020 trial, she had already sacrificed years of her life. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal when you look back that a phone call can change your life,\u201d Wulff told CNN, reflecting on the day she was called by the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office to share her story. After reading articles that led to Weinstein\u2019s downfall, Wulff recognized similar patterns between what had happened to her and other accusers. \u201cI wanted to step forward,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to help them.\u201d What she didn\u2019t realize is that her life would completely transform, losing all of her anonymity and becoming one of the faces of the landmark #MeToo trial that would come to impact how society views power dynamics in the workplace. Before Wulff put her most personal story on the world\u2019s stage, testifying that Weinstein sexually assaulted her\u00a0in\u00a02005, she had barely told anyone about her allegations\u00a0\u2014 not even her own father, who learned the details by reading his daughter\u2019s testimony in the media. \u201cGod, it\u2019s horrible. It really is,\u201d Wulff recalled. \u201cMy dad and I are close. I couldn\u2019t share that with him.\u201d \u201cThe only people you can really talk to are your lawyers,\u201d she continued. \u201cFor three years leading up to the trial, to me testifying, I was meeting with them regularly.\u201d Wulff added, \u201cI just wanted to be normal, but there was nothing normal about it.\u201d By the end of the trial, it was all worth it, she said. Weinstein\u2019s 2020 trial resulted in a rape conviction and the Hollywood producer was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Wulff felt overwhelmed and hadn\u2019t yet processed her trauma, but knew she had contributed to justice being served. Fast-forward four years: This April, Weinstein\u2019s conviction was overturned. In a 4-3\u00a0decision by the New York Court of Appeals, the overturned conviction was not based on whether Weinstin is\u00a0guilty or not guilty, but on legal technicalities \u2014 largely the fact that the judge allowed\u00a0what are known as\u00a0Molineux witnesses, like Wulff, who testified about prior bad acts, but were not directly tied to charges Weinstein was facing. Wulff was one of three Molineux witnesses in the 2020\u00a0trial \u2013 none of whom would be\u00a0allowed to testify in Weinstein\u2019s re-trial, which Manhattan prosecutors have said they intend to move forward with as soon as this fall. In their successful appeal, Weinstein\u2019s defense argued that the jury heard stories from other women that painted him as a \u201cbad guy,\u201d but were not relevant to their deliberations. \u201cIt was his character that was on trial. It wasn\u2019t the evidence that was on trial,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s attorney, Arthur Aidala, said at the appeal hearing. Like Wulff, Dawn Dunning \u2014 another Molineux witness from the 2020 trial \u2014 was stunned by the court\u2019s reversal. \u201cI want to move on with my life\u2026 This has been such a long ordeal for me,\u201d Dunning told CNN. \u201cI would love to have that closure.\u201d Dunning\u2019s testimony during the trial had striking similarities to Wulff\u2019s. Both women told the jury they were aspiring actresses working as waitresses in New York when they met Weinstein, who offered to help them with their careers before assaulting them. The prosecution\u2019s purpose in introducing them as Molineux witnesses was to establish\u00a0an alleged pattern of behavior. Weinstein, who has been\u00a0publicly\u00a0accused by over 100 women, has denied all sexual misconduct allegations against him. In 16 states in the\u00a0US\u00a0\u2014 including California where Weinstein is currently appealing his 2022 Los Angeles conviction\u00a0for sex crimes\u00a0\u2014 prior bad acts testimony, like Dunning and Wulff\u2019s, is admissible in court. In New York, where Weinstein\u2019s conviction was overturned, it it is not. Evidence introduced under the Molineux rule must exceed a high bar for inclusion, one not met in Weinstein\u2019s case, according to the New York Court of Appeals. Now, both Dunning and Wulff are advocating for new\u00a0legislation\u00a0that would allow prior bad acts testimony into sex crimes cases. Last week, a bill proposed by members of the New York State Assembly that would have amended the state\u2019s criminal procedure law failed to pass the State Assembly, after having successfully passed the Senate. The bill is expected to be reintroduced at the\u00a0legislature\u2019s\u00a0next session, but for now, it is dead \u2014 another setback for women like Dunning and Wulff. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for the legal system to catch up to this bigger cultural change and movement that we\u2019ve had as a society,\u201d Dunning said. \u201cUnfortunately, the legal system is slow.\u201d Dunning added that she feels \u201clet down\u201d by this latest legal\u00a0setback and\u00a0is concerned that the bill not passing \u201ccould prevent other women from coming forward.\u201d She hopes that the justice system continues to progress so that sex crimes will become easier to report and to prosecute. \u201cThe thought that he would be free again is terrifying,\u201d she said\u00a0of Weinstein, acknowledging his ongoing appeal on his California conviction. \u201cI just think he\u2019ll stop at nothing to get back at us. He will never stop abusing women. If he gets out, I know everyone thinks he\u2019s so old and frail and sick, but he\u2019s never going to stop. He never will stop.\u201d The prospect of Weinstein walking free one day also weighs heavily on Wulff, calling the overturned conviction a \u201cwake-up call.\u201d \u201cAs long as we keep talking and we don\u2019t go back into the shadows and we don\u2019t let setbacks set us back, we will keep that light bright on it,\u201d Wulff said.\u00a0\u201cIf you have a sister, a daughter, a mother, we\u2019re trying to protect them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-prior-bad-acts-laws/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_entertainment_will-smiths-bad-boy-4-press-tour", "text": "Now, this is a story all about how Will Smith\u2019s life got flipped, turned upside down - and how he appears to be working hard to fix that. Smith has been making the rounds promoting his latest project, \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d the fourth in his film franchise with Martin Lawrence. It\u2019s not his first film since he slapped Chris Rock on stage at the 2022 Academy Awards after the comedian made a joke about Smith\u2019s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. The summer popcorn movie, however, is performing better than his other projects that more immediately followed the incident. Smith\u2019s historical slave drama \u201cEmancipation\u201d released six months after the Oscars controversy that resulted in the actor getting banned from the event for a decade. That press tour was selective, somber and scaled-back. Smith acknowledged at the time that some audiences might not be willing to support the movie due to his starring role in it. \u201cI completely understand \u2014 if someone is not ready, I would absolutely respect that and allow them their space to not be ready. My deepest concern is my team \u2013 Antoine [Fuqua the film\u2019s director] has done what I think is the greatest work of his entire career,\u201d Smith said about \u201cEmancipation.\u201d \u201cThe people on this team have done some of the best work of their entire careers, and my deepest hope is that my actions don\u2019t penalize my team. At this point, that\u2019s what I\u2019m working for.\u201d Smith returning to a familiar action-comedy franchise, \u201cSummertime\u201d Smith - with Lawrence beside him - is yielding better results. \u201cFor fans who have been down from the first one, I promise you there\u2019s a moment in this movie where you stand up out of your seat and throw your hands in the air with the level of perfection of the call-back that we have. It\u2019s as good as it\u2019s ever been done,\u201d Smith said in an interview with Hot 97 before the film hit theaters. \u201cIt is incredible. I am hyped for people to see it.\u201d His approach has been reminiscent of recent movie promotional tours from Tom Cruise, who leans into flash and fun, stunts over substance. The man who survived jumping on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s couch and more than one broken marriage is a master at directing audiences to the product rather than the person behind the product. Moviegoers appear ready to move on from Smith\u2019s slap. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d has so far grossed more than $140 million since it opened June 7, according to Box Office Mojo. Smith has also been bringing the fun to the people, literally. He quietly sat in \u201cBad Boys\u201d screening during opening weekend at a Cinemark theater in Baldwin Hill, California, before surprising moviegoers afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s a ritual I have I do whenever a movie come out,\u201d he explained in a video shared on social media. As the theater is letting out, Smith can be seen telling those leaving he\u2019s glad they enjoyed the movie before the crowd goes crazy with excitement. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a personal appearance by Will Smith, apparently, is valuable once again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/entertainment/will-smiths-bad-boy-4-press-tour/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_entertainment_firebrand-review-henry-viii-alicia-vikander", "text": "After \u201cToo many years lost in history,\u201d as they memorably sing in \u201cSix: The Musical,\u201d the wives of Henry VIII continue to receive their belated due, with the latest example being \u201cFirebrand,\u201d devoted to his sixth and final spouse, Katherine Parr. Alicia Vikander and Jude Law anchor this handsome exercise in historical fiction, which meanders a bit before nicely paying off at the end. History, the opening narration cleverly notes, is largely devoted to men and war, forcing us to putty in gaps about the rest \u2013 including, in this case, the women who passed through King Henry VIII\u2019s decadent life. Novelist Elizabeth Fremantle provided such filler with \u201cQueen\u2019s Gambit: A Novel of Katherine Parr\u201d (not to be confused with Netflix\u2019s chess series), which provides the backbone for this look at Parr (Vikander) as she dealt with an \u201caging and ailing\u201d Henry (Law, bloated and bearded for the occasion). Already erratic, his cantankerous temper was further fueled by his infected foot, awful enough that people cover their mouths when exposed to the stench from it. In the early going, Parr has seemingly found a kind of equilibrium in Henry\u2019s court, serving as a doting mother to her stepchildren, overseeing the castle as Regent while the king adventures in France and insisting that no, honest, she has everything under control. \u201cHe\u2019s changed,\u201d she says. \u201cHe listens to me.\u201d Yet upon Henry\u2019s return, the queen finds herself in considerable jeopardy, in part thanks to her friendship with Protestant preacher Anne Askew (Erin Doherty), an outspoken critic of Henry\u2019s church; and her close relationship with Thomas Seymour (Sam Riley), the brother of Henry\u2019s third wife Jane. Faced with Henry\u2019s mercurial behavior, and the suspicions of his heretic-hunting bishop (Simon Russell Beale), Parr is left playing a dangerous game in which time itself becomes a key player, given assumptions that the king\u2019s various illnesses will claim him before he can turn her into another casualty of his reign. Brazilian director Karim A\u00efnouz captures the dimly lit gruesomeness of the era (the limitations of medieval medicine won\u2019t have anybody pining for Tudorcare), which brings texture to all the palace intrigue. Foremost, \u201cFirebrand\u201d seeks to portray Parr as more than just a number, possessing the skills of an accomplished writer in addition to navigating the politics surrounding her position. (The screenplay is by sisters Henrietta and Jessica Ashworth, with additional writing by Rosanne Flynn.) Speaking volumes with her gaze, Vikander is a shrewd choice for that role, although for much of the movie her low-key demeanor can\u2019t help but be overwhelmed a bit by Law\u2019s lusty vulgarity and emotional outbursts. The Tudor dynasty has long served as a source of fascination for movies and TV. Probably destined for a short stay in theaters, \u201cFirebrand\u201d plays like a relatively minor if generally worthy addition to that long filmography, training the spotlight on a woman who understood that keeping her wits about her, at all times, was the surest way to keep her head. \u201cFirebrand\u201d premieres June 14 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/entertainment/firebrand-review-henry-viii-alicia-vikander/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_entertainment_brats-review-brat-pack-andrew-mccarthy", "text": "Deeply personal approaches worked beautifully in nostalgic Michael J. Fox and Val Kilmer documentaries, but \u201cBrats\u201d turns Andrew McCarthy\u2019s near-40-year-old beef about \u201cthe Brat Pack\u201d label into an exercise in self-indulgence, too heavily skewed toward his point of view. While it\u2019s fun seeing \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d as they near \u201cThe Early-Bird Dinner Club\u201d years, this is one of those projects that would have benefited from a more journalistic tone. The origin of the term dates back to a New York magazine story with the headline \u201cHollywood\u2019s Brat Pack,\u201d which lumped together stars of movies like \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d and \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d playing off the \u201cRat Pack\u201d nickname that defined Frank Sinatra and his celebrity pals. McCarthy and his contemporaries, however, found the designation dismissive and insulting, underscored by rapid-fire video clips with news/\u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d types throwing it around in the \u201880s, and the young actors fidgeting through questions about it from the likes of Phil Donahue, Charlie Rose and Merv Griffin. Now in their early 60s, McCarthy \u2013 having written a memoir, \u201cBrat: An \u201880s Story,\u201d about his experiences \u2013 transforms that into this ABC News documentary for Hulu, which is presented almost entirely looking over his shoulder. That includes an extended sequence of him on the phone trying to set up interviews with his contemporaries, which is every bit as scintillating as that sounds. A hit-miss collection of conversations follows, with some of the key players (Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson notable among them) taking a pass, while Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Lea Thompson, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer and Rob Lowe \u2013 some of whom question their own \u201cBrat Pack\u201d credentials \u2013 walk down memory lane, generally exhibiting less animus toward being \u201cbranded\u201d that way than McCarthy appears to harbor. As it happens, the most interesting exchanges come from third-party voices, such as authors Malcolm Gladwell and Bret Easton Ellis, which underscores that a sense of distance and perspective can be helpful in these situations, from noting how director John Hughes avoided issues of race to the significance of music in films of that era. As the actors acknowledge, they benefited from a shift that saw Hollywood chasing their demographic, an emphasis on catering to youth that permeated TV as well as movies and persists to this day. Gladwell makes the astute case that such productions will never be quite the same as they were back then thanks to fragmentation brought about by streaming and an abundance of choices. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a relatively unified youth culture \u2026 to everything\u2019s all over the place,\u201d Gladwell observes. \u201cThere\u2019s no common denominator.\u201d Mostly, \u201cBrats\u201d plays like a latter-day therapy session like the one the kids underwent in \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d only with the benefit of four decades of hindsight. It certainly feels like McCarthy seeks to build toward that by meeting with the writer of the article who coined \u201cBrat Pack,\u201d David Blum, who understands how the young actors might have seen it as dismissive or \u201cunjust,\u201d as Moore puts it, but doesn\u2019t apologize for something that amounted to a playful turn of phrase half a lifetime ago. As noted, \u201cBrats\u201d joins a long list of confessional and/or nostalgic documentaries, with Soleil Moon Frye\u2019s \u201cKid 90\u201d and Alex Winter\u2019s \u201cShowbiz Kids\u201d among other examples. \u201cWe fit a niche that needed to be filled in pop culture at that moment,\u201d McCarthy says of himself and his peers back in their heyday. Don\u2019t look now, but \u201cBrats\u201d does much the same thing, filling a slightly different niche as streaming services look for ways to garner attention and distinguish themselves from the Subscription Pack. \u201cBrats\u201d premieres June 13 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/entertainment/brats-review-brat-pack-andrew-mccarthy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_09_entertainment_the-day-after-abc-movie-cec", "text": "In November 1983, the US, Soviet Union and the rest of the world were teetering closer than ever on the edge of nuclear war. A NATO military exercise had spooked the Soviets, who thought the exercise was merely a cover for a real nuclear strike on the USSR, prompting them to ready their own nuclear forces. Who knew, then, that an ABC movie-of-the-week would play a significant role in potentially preventing nuclear war? \u201cThe Day After,\u201d a two-hour epic following a few weeks in the lives of small-town Midwesterners before and after a nuclear strike, was one of the most controversial and most-watched TV movies when it aired on November 20, 1983. In its first hour, the people of Lawrence, Kansas, go about their lives as the threat of nuclear war looms. But when the nuke finally comes to Kansas, the devastation is immediate: Acres of crops are singed and poisoned, homes are leveled, a fifth-grade class is vaporized at school. Characters we come to know in the film\u2019s first half are obliterated in an instant or barely clinging to life as they succumb to radiation poisoning. Even those who survive the attack by the film\u2019s end will soon die, viewers know. It\u2019s an uneasy watch now, but \u201cThe Day After\u201d was even more affecting when nuclear war was on the table and top of mind. It\u2019s still one of the most-watched TV events in US history \u2013\u2013\u00a0more than 100 million viewers tuned into its original broadcast, more half of the country\u2019s adult population at the time. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s credited with changing then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s mind against nuclear war. Getting \u201cThe Day After\u201d to air, though, was fraught. Even Reagan, who praised the film in his private writings, didn\u2019t agree with its bleak and upsetting depiction of nuclear aftermath. But the team who created it knew it could be important, so, after rejecting requests for edits, dodging complaints from conservative groups and acquiescing to the occasional network demand, \u201cThe Day After\u201d finally made it to TV and changed the history of the medium \u2013\u2013\u00a0and potentially the world. \u201cThere were all these behind the scenes (challenges) going on, which we working on the film never really knew at the time,\u201d said Jack Wright, an emeritus professor of theater at the University of Kansas and head of local casting on \u201cThe Day After,\u201d in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that the film came out as strong as it did.\u201d Censors thought the film was too graphic \u201cThe Day After\u201d ends with a written warning to the audience: \u201cThe catastrophic events you have just witnessed are, in all likelihood, less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States.\u201d As a made-for-TV movie airing in a primetime Sunday night slot, \u201cThe Day After\u201d couldn\u2019t depict true nuclear horror, though there were still shocking scenes of mass death and the aftermath of a crumbling society. That was the goal, director Nicholas Meyer said. \u201cI wanted to make it like a public service announcement,\u201d Meyer said in the 2022 documentary \u201cTelevision Event,\u201d about the tumultuous production of the film. The script was sparse and plain. Early scenes include a meeting at an art museum between a doctor and his daughter with plans to leave Kansas and a romantic tryst between a young couple days from getting married. We meet husbands, wives, their children and friends so that when they\u2019re ripped away from each other in the second half, their loss will feel almost as sudden as it would if a real nuclear event had separated them. Wright was tasked with casting thousands of extras from Lawrence. In one pivotal scene, more than 1,000 Lawrence locals were made to lie on cots in the University of Kansas\u2019 basketball arena, wearing tattered clothes and bearing bloody facial injuries as though they\u2019d barely survived the nuclear attack. The intensity of the scenes inspired the cast to discuss what they\u2019d do in the event of nuclear war, he said. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re dealing with that kind of subject matter, it sticks in your craw,\u201d Wright said. After seeing rough cuts of the film, though, the network thought it was a bit too devastating. Executives had notes: No blood, no scarring, no burning, said \u201cThe Day After\u201d producer Bob Papazian in the documentary \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d Many scenes were altered as a result: A long shot of a family burning to death as the nuclear bombs fell, as seen in \u201cTelevision Event,\u201d was scrapped, as were shots that focused on survivors\u2019 melting skin or victims\u2019 charred corpses. \u201cYou had to walk a fine line with this movie,\u201d Meyer told the Outline in 2017. \u201cPeople have a remote control in their hands. So we had to make a movie that conveyed the awfulness of nuclear war without making it so awful that you changed the channel.\u201d Stephanie Austin, an associate producer on the film, conducted extensive research on the devastation in places where nuclear bombs have been dropped, like Hiroshima. After the bombing there, much of the land was leveled. The network asked that \u201cThe Day After\u201d avoid showing the extreme destruction that was closer to reality. \u201cI thought we stopped short of telling the real truth,\u201d Austin said in \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d Lawrence locals were largely unaware of the drama brewing behind the scenes and were more excited about the prospect of making a movie, Wright said. \u201cSomething like this had never been done before,\u201d Wright told CNN of the film. \u201cWe were all just playing it by ear. It was amazing to all of us.\u201d Political interference threatened the final cut Before \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, Reagan\u2019s policy involved investing even more in US defenses, including a missile shield proposed to protect the US from a Soviet attack. But scaling up defenses only heightened tensions with the Soviets, who viewed Reagan\u2019s Strategic Defense Initiative as a threat to their own security. On October 10, while at Camp David, Reagan watched \u201cThe Day After,\u201d weeks before it would air on TV. The film, he wrote in his diary, \u201cleft (him) greatly depressed.\u201d \u201cWhether it will be of help to the \u2018anti nukes\u2019 or not, I cant (sic) say,\u201d Reagan wrote of the film\u2019s potential impact on disarmament supporters. \u201cMy own reaction was one of our having to do all we can to have a deterrent & to see there is never a nuclear war.\u201d Even though \u201cThe Day After\u201d resonated deeply with Reagan, his administration asked ABC to make several edits to the film to make it less upsetting for viewers, former ABC Motion Pictures president Brandon Stoddard said in an interview with the Television Academy Foundation. Conservative groups, too, had viewed the film as a potential threat to support for nuclear deterrence, or the policy of letting the nukes do the talking: Their very existence and the potential to use them was meant to prevent the USSR and other countries from launching their own nuclear weapons. The conservative outlet Human Events declared \u201cThe Day After\u201d to be a \u201cpropaganda spectacular\u201d over a month before it even aired, and others conducted letter-writing campaigns to persuade advertisers not to buy ad time during the film, the New York Times reported in October 1983. ABC refused to acknowledge desired cuts and complaints from the Reagan administration or conservative watchdogs, and the film aired its original two-hour cut just days before Thanksgiving in November 1983. In Reagan\u2019s 1984 State of the Union address, which came two months after \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, Reagan finally committed to preventing nuclear war rather than tease scenarios of survivability: \u201cTo preserve our civilization in this modern age, a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\u201d Three years later, Reagan would sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which saw the US commit to reducing its arsenal of nuclear arms. Advertisers hesitated to buy in Before \u201cThe Day After\u201d had even been completed, there were concerns about its graphic content. Stoddard, who died in 2014, was resolute that ABC would air the film anyway.\u00a0He said in the Television Academy interview that he was the one who wanted to pursue a film about nuclear war in the first place \u2013\u2013\u00a0but advertisers were getting cold feet. A few weeks before \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, the New York Times published a story about psychologists warning families that the film could potentially devastate young viewers and that children under 12 shouldn\u2019t watch it. \u201dI fear children will have nightmares about the show and worry about it for weeks or even months,\u201d one psychologist told the Times. \u201cOlder children and adults may have a sense of hopelessness.\u201d Fearing that \u201cThe Day After\u201d could isolate large swaths of viewers who didn\u2019t want to witness its bleak depiction of nuclear horror, companies largely resisted buying ad space. Companies also worried that their products would be associated with scenes of the destroyed Heartland or vaporized classrooms. To assuage advertisers, ABC allowed most companies to air their commercials during the first half of the film, before nuclear war came to Kansas, UPI reported after \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired in 1983. That way, Orville Redenbacher could hawk popcorn before any graphic deaths occurred. It was a good deal for the companies, Stoddard said: Since ABC had such trouble finding advertisers, it sold spots for as little as $11,000 \u2013\u2013\u00a0ads that were eventually seen by an audience of 100 million. The film has had a lasting impact \u201cThe Day After\u201d was upsetting, as psychologists warned, but also galvanizing. \u201cI vastly underestimated the importance of \u2018The Day After,\u2019\u201d said Kenneth Adelman, the former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency under Reagan, in \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d \u201cThe Day After\u201d brought discussion of nuclear war and the potential for disarmament to millions of people who viewed it, and became the rare film that \u201cactually became historical text rather than vice versa,\u201d wrote William Palmer, a Purdue University professor who discussed its impact in \u201cFilms of the Eighties: A Social History.\u201d \u201cFrom its earliest frames, \u2018The Day After\u2019 sets out to remove the blinders from an uninvolved American populace,\u201d Palmer wrote. \u201cThe Day After\u201d endures today as an artifact of a tense time and a powerful piece of art that changed minds and even influenced policy changes. By making it, the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Tim Grierson wrote last year, Meyer and his team helped \u201csave the world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/entertainment/the-day-after-abc-movie-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The result has that calculated, tired feel about it, with a few moments of kinetic action but not enough to make the film play like anything more than a relic. On the plus side, Smith and Martin Lawrence, now in their 50s, still credibly pull off their characters, although frankly, the most memorable action scene \u2013 so good it seems to have parachuted in from another movie \u2013 doesn\u2019t involve them. Everything else about this reunion, including their old-married-couple squabbling and the various callbacks to previous films, has a perhaps inevitably stale quality, from the strains of the familiar song to the bikini-clad background actors the camera scans by to reflect the Miami locale. \u201cBad Boys\u201d begins with Smith\u2019s Mike settling down and Lawrence\u2019s Marcus experiencing a near-death scare that changes his outlook \u2013 a comedic flourish that, like almost everything else, proves underdeveloped. The latest threat, meanwhile, comes by way of a case their late captain (Joe Pantoliano) had investigated involving drug cartels and a ruthless killer (Eric Dane, here portraying the kind of stock villain that might as well be called McBaddie), exposing a web of corruption that forces Mike to reconnect with his son Armando (Jacob Scipio) and the buddy cops to go on the run. Back in the saddle after \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (Michael Bay having established the template on the first two movies), directing team Adil & Bilall don\u2019t scrimp on action and stunts, and unlike the movie they helmed in between, the much-discussed and lamented \u201cBatgirl,\u201d at least this film is getting released. That said, their efforts to bring a hyper-cinematic quality to the action yields a mixed bag, including a sequence that resembles a first-person shooter game. Despite all the blood, the comedy quotient in Chris Bremner and Will Beall\u2019s screenplay also qualifies as being largely anemic. The supporting players, similarly, have relatively little to do, including returnees Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Paola Nu\u00f1ez, a fleeting cameo by Tiffany Haddish, and a puzzling, wasted role for Rhea Seehorn (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d). In a classic example of bad-guy dialogue, Dane\u2019s character mutters after a failed attempt to eliminate Mike and Marcus, \u201cThese guys just refuse to die.\u201d The fourth \u201cBad Boys\u201d might not be enough to kill them, but it does suggest they should emulate much of the Florida population and, when it comes to the buddy-cop biz, consider retiring. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d premieres June 7 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_06_12_entertainment_kevin-spacey-morgan-interview-scli-intl", "text": "Kevin Spacey has said that he was \u201ctoo handsy\u201d and that he\u2019s been guilty of \u201cpushing the boundaries\u201d in the past, in a lengthy interview released Tuesday. The two-time Oscar winner was responding to claims of inappropriate behavior in an interview that ran for more than 90 minutes. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely 150% prepared to take accountability for those things and mistakes that I made\u2026 bad, bad, bad, behavior some times,\u201d he told Piers Morgan Uncensored on YouTube. Last year, Spacey, 64, was found not guilty of seven counts of sexual assault and two counts of other serious sexual offenses following a four-week trial in London. The allegations covered a period between 2004 and 2013, when Spacey served as artistic director at the Old Vic theater in the British capital. He previously pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. In 2022, a New York jury found Spacey not liable for battery in a trial in which actor Anthony Rapp alleged Spacey picked him up and laid on top of him after a party in 1986. Spacey also faced criminal charges of indecent assault and battery in connection with a July 2016 incident, where he was accused of groping a young man at a Nantucket bar. He had pleaded not guilty at the time and in 2019, Massachusetts prosecutors dropped the case after the man who accused him of assault pleaded the fifth on the witness stand. When asked by Morgan what he meant by his \u201cbad behavior\u201d in the interview, Spacey replied, \u201cpushing the boundaries\u2026 being too handsy, touching someone sexually\u2026 in a way that I didn\u2019t know at the time they didn\u2019t want.\u201d Morgan responded: \u201cSome people would say that that is criminal, that if you grope people in a sexual way, against their wishes, that that is a crime.\u201d Spacey denied the suggestion, saying \u201cgroped\u201d is a \u201cvery odd word.\u201d \u201cPersonally\u2026 I have caressed people, I have been gentle with people\u2026 that is the way that I am. You\u2019re making a pass at someone, you don\u2019t want to be aggressive, you want to be gentle,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think the word itself is not a word that I would associate with my experience.\u201d Nevertheless, he now sees younger actors may have felt unable to speak up. \u201cI will never behave in the ways that I did previously. Ever,\u201d he insisted. Earlier, he admitted that when he looked back \u201cthere were bouts with arrogance, there were bouts with my ego.\u201d \u201cMy goal is no longer to be the best actor - which it was - my goal is now to prove that I\u2019m a man of good character.\u201d At times, Spacey appeared tearful, particularly when asked where he\u2019s living. He said he faced legal bills of many millions, adding: \u201cThis week where I had been living in Baltimore is being foreclosed on, my house is being sold at auction.\u201d When asked why it is being foreclosed, Spacey said he \u201ccan\u2019t pay the bills\u201d that he owes.

With reports the pair have hit a rough patch in their almost two-year marriage, many are trying to read between the \u201cBennifer\u201d lines about the couple reportedly putting their house on the market or Lopez\u2019s recent decision to cancel her tour to be with her family. But it appears that the pair have already given us all we need to know about their romance. Just watch \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told.\u201d The Prime Video documentary first released in February as a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez\u2019s short film that accompanied her latest album, \u201cThis Is Me\u2026Now: A Love Story.\u201d It was a lot of J-Lo at once, some criticized too much, but the documentary, in retrospect, is revelatory. Before they wed (twice) in 2022, Lopez and Affleck were previously engaged two decades prior, only to call it off three days before their planned September 2003 wedding over pressures of living in the spotlight. \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told\u201d explores what brought them back together, along with their bond and even their conflicts - in other words an adult relationship. The title and its meaning No one can say Ben Affleck isn\u2019t romantic. He took their correspondence, every letter and email they had written over 20 years and put it in a memory book he titled, \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told.\u201d He presented it to Lopez for their first Christmas together after they reunited. Lopez used the letters as inspiration for \u201cThis is Me\u2026Now,\u201d sharing it with her creative team. \u201cShe would pick one and she would let us touch them and read them,\u201d one songwriter recounts in the documentary. Affleck shares his reaction when he discovered the book had served as source material for his wife\u2019s work. \u201cShe was like \u2018I\u2019ve been reading and the people\u2026this is the kind of inspiration. I\u2019ve been showing them the book,\u201d Affleck recalls in the film. \u201cI was like \u2018You\u2019ve been showing all the musicians all those letters that\u2026\u2019 and they were like \u2018Yeah, we call you Pen Affleck!\u2019 And I was like \u2018Oh my God.\u2019\u201d Though out of his comfort zone, the Oscar-winning producer and writer seems to understand. \u201cI did really find the beauty and the poetry and the irony in the fact that it\u2019s the greatest love story never told,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a record about it, that seems kind of like telling it.\u201d Their different approaches to creativity and fame are what some observers believe may be the cause of possible conflict in their power-coupledom. \u201cThings that are private, I always felt are sacred and special because, in part, they\u2019re private,\u201d Affleck says at one point in the film. \u201cWe\u2019re just two people with different kinds of approaches trying to learn to compromise.\u201d \u201cGetting back together, I said, \u2018Listen, one of the things I don\u2019t want is a relationship on social media,\u2019\u201d Affleck later says in the project. \u201cThen I sort of realized it\u2019s not a fair thing to ask. It\u2019s sort of like, you\u2019re gonna marry a boat captain and you go, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like the water.\u2019\u201d Lopez expresses her appreciation for Affleck\u2019s support. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Ben] is very comfortable with me doing all of this,\u201d she says in the documentary. \u201cBut he loves me, he knows I\u2019m an artist, and he\u2019s gonna support me in every way he can because he knows you can\u2019t stop me from making the music I made\u2026 he doesn\u2019t want to stop me. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s comfortable being the muse.\u201d All of the emotion \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told\u201d begins with Lopez explaining how her reunion with Affleck inspired her to do her first studio album in a decade. She states that her love for him endured in their years apart, but she put to the side. \u201cWhen her and Ben first broke up it was catastrophic to her constitution,\u201d said Dave Meyers, who both directed her music videos years ago and the \u201cThis Is Me\u2026Now: A Love Story\u201d short film. \u201cEverything that she wanted from what she understood love to be, for that to not work, For the pressures to break it apart. That just spun her out.\u201d Lopez recalls their initial split, noting that she felt she had lost her best friend and weeps as she talks about the love Affleck has shown her. \u201cWhat he saw in me, what he allowed me to believe about myself, only comes from love,\u201d she says as tears roll down her face. \u201cNobody else could make me see that about myself. It\u2019s very moving. Because I didn\u2019t think much of myself, and so the world didn\u2019t think much of me.\u201d In one scene, Lopez, worn down by the stress of the project she self-financed, expresses her fears she\u2019s falling short on set, in her marriage and as a mother. In another scene, Affleck is there to encourage her when she worries the visual representation of her new album is going to \u201csuck.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll be scared it\u2019ll suck until it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he reassures his wife and makes her laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta discern between things that suck DNA-wise, and things that just don\u2019t work right.\u201d There\u2019s also plenty of fun. Affleck notes that Lopez\u2019s character in her short film (which she insists is not completely based on her life) is 28 years old, which is not the age she was when they were first together. \u201cBut you were,\u201d she says to Affleck. \u201cYou were. That\u2019s why you were not as smart as me.\u201d Affleck is now 51 and Lopez is 54. When he teases her in the documentary about \u201cwanting to play younger\u201d even in her semi-autobiographical film, she lovingly calls him an \u201cidiot.\u201d Lopez sums up how the couple found their way back to each other after so many years. \u201cWe\u2019re totally different people now. And we\u2019re the same,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we have the same. One hundred percent.\u201d Enough for more chapters in a story that Affleck and Lopez still appear to be writing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-relationship/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_07_entertainment_run-lola-run-25-years-multiverse-movie", "text": "Listen up, Marvel Cinematic Universe. Twenty-five years ago, a small, low-budget German film by the name of \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d took the world by storm. Looking back, its director sees parallels between his visionary movie and the multiverse films that have become tentpole blockbusters today. Starring a magenta-haired Franka Potente, \u201cLola\u201d follows the titular heroine as she must race across Berlin to help her lackey mobster boyfriend (Moritz Bleibtreu) out of a life-threatening bind\u2026 and somehow find 100,000 Deutsche Marks along the way. One of the principal aspects of the film that makes it so special is how it\u2019s divided into three parts, vignettes that re-imagine Lola\u2019s predicament and follow her along a slightly different chain of events, each leading to a drastically different outcome. \u201cThe whole idea that you start from the same moment again, and you create a parallel universe\u201d was at the core of his film, \u201cLola\u201d director Tom Tykwer said in a recent interview with CNN. And while he made the distinction that \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d is a film in which each vignette ends and \u201cresets\u201d the story \u2013 instead of coexisting with the alternative stories that follow \u2013 when asked if he thought the whole multiverse trend began around the time of his film, Tykwer replied, \u201cConceptually, yes.\u201d Just like in more recent multiverse movies like \u201cInto the Spider-Verse\u201d or \u201cDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,\u201d each universe or vignette shares certain similarities. In \u201cLola\u2019s\u201d case, the most significant similarity is an animated sequence toward the beginning of each vignette \u2013 or \u201croute,\u201d as Tykwer refers to them \u2013 when she runs down the stairwell of her building and encounters a neighbor in a doorway with a vicious-looking dog. It is the subtle differences of that early interaction that set each version of Lola\u2019s story in new directions Tykwer said he always envisioned that particular sequence as being animated. \u201cIt was always amusing and fun to imagine that the first detour that each route takes is coming from animation, because animation is the closest to \u2013 in film \u2013 the closest to directly translated imagination,\u201d he said. Another parallel \u201cLola\u201d shares with some of the bigger movies of today is the exceptional physical demands it put on its star, Potente. While most actors might train for a role to optimize their physique and appearance for the benefit of the camera \u2013 think Hugh Jackman for his portrayal of the muscly mutant Wolverine, or Henry Cavill for \u201cThe Witcher\u201d \u2013 and actually lose their progress and stamina while shooting the film itself, Potente is seen running at a fast clip for an astounding amount of screen time in \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d (hence the title).

{"id": "2024_06_07_entertainment_hit-man-review-glen-powell-richard-linklater", "text": "Breezy and slight, \u201cHit Man\u201d provides a somewhat unlikely showcase for Glen Powell (fresh off the rom-com hit \u201cAnyone But You\u201d), teaming up with acclaimed director Richard Linklater to take an intriguing true story before embellishing it, Hollywood-style, beyond recognition. Working nicely on those terms, the movie feels perfectly suited to Netflix, more fit for the \u201cyou might like\u201d button than trying to make a box-office killing. Serving as producer and co-writer (with Linklater) in addition to starring, Powell plays Gary Johnson, a New Orleans philosophy and psychology professor who made extra cash serving as tech support for a police sting operation designed to catch people trying to hire, unbeknownst to them, a cop masquerading as a contract killer. Forced by circumstances to fill in, Johnson discovered a genuine talent for acting, playing various versions of the \u201chit man\u201d to reel in his marks. Based on a Texas Monthly article, \u201cHit Man\u201d departs from Johnson\u2019s already pretty remarkable story around there, when he meets an alluring woman (Adria Arjona) seeking his services because of what she characterizes as an abusive husband. Instead of springing the trap and sending her to jail, Johnson enters into a relationship with her, a perilous proposition that yields an escalating assortment of headaches, as well as some quite clever twists and turns. After \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d and the less-effective \u201cDevotion,\u201d with the disaster sequel \u201cTwisters\u201d to come, Powell understandably welcomed this opportunity to work with Linklater, who \u2013 known for character-driven studies like \u201cBoyhood\u201d \u2013 has of late dabbled in documentaries (HBO\u2019s \u201cGod Save Texas\u201d) and animation (his autobiographical Netflix semi-fantasy \u201cApollo 10 \u00bd: A Space Age Childhood\u201d). Although he nicely conveys Johnson\u2019s sort-of Hitchcockian dilemma, Powell, with his leading-man qualities, isn\u2019t a completely natural fit as the sort of professorial type that would buttress this imposter role, which doesn\u2019t make the movie less fun, just a bit more improbable until the story really kicks into gear. Arjona, by contrast, feels almost like a throwback to old film noir as this alluring woman of mystery, appearing drawn to the dangerous aspects of Gary\u2019s alter ego while potentially harboring secrets of her own. In that sense, \u201cHit Man\u201d is as much a quirky romance as a thriller, juggling its mix of whimsy and suspense deftly enough, especially down the closing stretch. Near the outset, Johnson notes in voiceover that he was \u201cminding my own business when my life took the oddest of turns.\u201d As career choices go, though, the turns in \u201cHit Man\u201d make plenty of sense, beginning with Powell indulging in a smallish but generally satisfying cinematic detour, where he doesn\u2019t need to knock \u2018em dead on his familiar glide path to blockbuster-style stardom. \u201cHit Man\u201d premieres June 7 on Netflix.

In the letter, viewed by CNN, Adams wrote that he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the video. \u201cI strongly condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with all survivors of domestic and gender-based violence,\u201d the letter reads. The letter adds: \u201cAfter internal deliberations, the Key to the City of New York committee recommended nullifying and rescinding Mr. Combs\u2019 key.\u201d Combs previously apologized for his actions in the video. Combs, who grew up in Harlem,\u00a0was awarded the key\u00a0in\u00a0September 2023. The award is a \u201csymbol of civic recognition and gratitude reserved for individuals whose service to the public and the common good rises to the highest level of achievement,\u201d according to a press release at the time. The key was returned to the city on June 10, according to City Hall. CNN has reached out to representatives for Combs for comment. Combs has been named in\u00a0eight civil lawsuits since November\u00a0\u2013 seven directly accusing him of sexual assault. One of the eight lawsuits, filed by former girlfriend Ventura, has been\u00a0settled. Another lawsuit\u00a0accused\u00a0his son Christian Combs of sexual assault, and Sean Combs is accused of aiding and abetting. Combs has vehemently denied claims from many of the civil suits but has not responded to all of the allegations.

{"id": "2024_06_13_entertainment_brat-pack-documentary-mccarthy-cec", "text": "When I watch the trailer for Andrew McCarthy\u2019s new documentary, \u201cBrats,\u201d my pulse races as if I\u2019m watching old home movies of myself and my friends. I\u2019m not a Hollywood star \u2014 ahem! \u2014 and I don\u2019t know anyone in the film, but I have frantically searched the Internet for more on the movie, which revisits a group of young actors \u2014 principally Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Anthony Michael Hall and McCarthy himself \u2014 who came to be known in the 1980s as the \u201cBrat Pack.\u201d These former stars made movies during one of the most pivotal periods in my life, when I left behind my childhood, entered the fraught universe of my teen years and became aware that boys were interesting. Maybe a little too interesting. McCarthy\u2019s documentary, which premieres today on Hulu, explores the lives today of actors who starred in such films as \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d \u201cSixteen Candles,\u201d \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d and \u201cPretty in Pink.\u201d The film is not about my life, but judging from the trailer it\u2019s full of my memories and music. On its surface, \u201cBrats\u201d is about the stars we \u201880s kids lived and died by (and how they didn\u2019t like the \u201cBrat Pack\u201d label). On a deeper level it also appears to be about the passage of time, the vagaries of fate and the way labels can loom large enough to change lives. When the Brat Pack movies came out, I was a Long Island girl, on the cusp of my teen years. The youngest of four daughters, I woke up each day to my clock radio playing Top 40 or New Wave. I read \u201cSeventeen\u201d magazine religiously and frequented the mall, where I could watch coming attractions of new movies \u2014 including previews of R-rated films forbidden by my Catholic mother. The first movie I saw to star some of the Brat Packers was 1983\u2019s \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d the drama about rival youth gangs in early-\u201860s Oklahoma. It\u2019s not strictly considered a Brat Pack movie, but it features Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez, two charter members of the club. My oldest sister, Tricia, loved it, So I did, too. I was too young to watch it right away but I read the book a dozen times to match the number of times Tricia saw the movie. I still have my dog-eared paperback of the S.E. Hinton classic, and the faded cover is torn just below the image of actor C. Thomas Howell. The movie was set in a different era far from my Long Island town, and featured terms like \u201cgreasers\u201d that meant nothing to me. But it had the same teenage angst I was feeling, and some of the hottest actors I\u2019d ever seen. During a sleepover at a friend\u2019s house, we rewound the videocassette on the VCR countless times trying to catch the unscripted moment when Lowe\u2019s towel almost falls off after he\u2019s taken a shower. Lowe was older and even better-looking \u2014 if that\u2019s possible \u2014 two years later in \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d where he played a recent college grad. What made these movies so alluring to me was one simple fact: The characters \u2014 high school students, college students and even young professionals \u2014 showed me a world I hadn\u2019t yet fully entered. It was the world of my older sisters, and as any little girl will tell you, that\u2019s the world that matters the most. Like many younger siblings, I experience nostalgia not just for my own childhood and adolescence but for the many events I experienced vicariously through my sisters. Whatever films or actors or musicians caught my sisters\u2019 attention inevitably captured mine. The movie that most captured the attention of my sister, Denise, was \u201cPretty in Pink.\u201d Just like the Molly Ringwald character, Denise loved to shop for vintage clothing. She and I would take the Long Island Railroad into New York City, visiting shops like Canal Jean Co. and Antique Boutique in Greenwich Village where we\u2019d skim the racks of 1940s men\u2019s suit jackets and vintage jeans. We pored over magazine spreads that showed the looks from these films and tried to emulate them. When I asked Denise recently about the movie, she recalled seeing it over and over in the theater, not only because she thought Ringwald was \u201cthe coolest\u201d but also because back in that pre-Netflix era, teens went out to the movies. That may partly explain why these movies loom so large for me. \u201cGoing to the movies was the big thing to do every Friday and Saturday night,\u201d Denise said. We listened to her cassette tape of the \u201cPretty in Pink\u201d soundtrack on repeat in our house and I can remember blaring the movie\u2019s big hit, \u201cIf You Leave,\u201d by OMD, at high volume. Its heartache sentiments might strike some people as sappy, but for me it still conjures the feeling of falling hard for someone. I soaked it all in, and in a scrapbook I made during high school, I pasted pictures from magazines of the bands I liked, including New Order, INXS and the Psychedelic Furs, who recorded \u201cPretty in Pink\u2019s\u201d title song. I also was enchanted by Demi Moore\u2019s smart-mouthed character, Jules, in \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d who delivered snarky comments with a smoky, world-weary voice. That was the kind of woman I wanted to become (although the scenes of her meltdown after she locked herself in her apartment didn\u2019t reflect my naturally upbeat personality but then again, I wasn\u2019t dealing with my \u201cstepmonster\u2019s funeral.\u201d) The Brat Packers became unwitting role models for me. This was partly because some of the movies were written and directed by John Hughes, who in the mid-1980s portrayed young adult life in a way that was much more realistic than ABC after-school specials or TV shows like \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201d Film critic Roger Ebert once called Hughes \u201cthe philosopher of adolescence.\u201d Hughes\u2019 characters spoke our language and got our visual cues. In one scene in \u201cSixteen Candles,\u201d a poster of the band Culture Club hangs on the wall. It resonated with me because my sister, Liz, was crazy about Boy George. In \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d Hughes explored how a popular girl like Claire, played by Ringwald, would be seen as more important than other students and how even someone as outwardly rebellious as Judd Nelson\u2019s character, John Bender, would feel stung by the implicit pecking order. As the Brat Pack era dawned, I was attending a public school where I didn\u2019t care for the industrious kids in my Honors class but was too bookish for the popular crowd. In my sophomore year, I transferred to a Catholic high school that I loved partly because doing well academically didn\u2019t isolate you socially. The president of the Honor Society was also the cutest guy in the school. But it was in a far wealthier town than my own, and some of the preppy kids were rich and obnoxious like James Spader\u2019s character in \u201cPretty in Pink.\u201d Soon after transferring, I tapped a perfectly thin, perfectly attired blonde on the shoulder in math class to ask her a question. I\u2019d noticed that her uniform skirt fit her perfectly and clung to her sinewy frame while mine was loose, bulky and unflattering. Her family must have paid a seamstress to trim the skirt. She turned around, took one look at my hair-sprayed bangs \u2014 I hadn\u2019t yet adopted the preppy bob that was popular at the school \u2014 and then turned away without saying a word. I was beneath her. Today, some 40 years later, I can say some of the Brat Pack films hold up better than others. \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d for example, is deservedly in the National Film Registry, which recognizes movies of cultural significance. But the performances and scenes in \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d now strike me as trite. (Remember Rob Lowe\u2019s sax-playing character climbing out on the roof?) And of course, \u201cSixteen Candles,\u201d despite some tender and hilarious moments, was sexist and racist. The one non-White character was an Asian exchange student, Long Duk Dong, a crude stereotype played for laughs. And the character played by Anthony Michael Hall is encouraged to have sex with a girl who is passed-out drunk. But what does hold up is the films\u2019 music. The song that closes out \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d \u2014 Simple Minds\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t You Forget About Me\u201d \u2014 remains an iconic embodiment of the raucous feelings of that era of my life. It plays as Judd Nelson\u2019s troubled rebel walks away from the school, fist defiantly raised, a moment after Ringwald\u2019s princess character has placed in his hand one of her diamond earrings. The mismatched classmates have formed an unlikely bond, and we\u2019re all swooning. I could sleep for a thousand years and would still wake up knowing the words: \u201cAs you walk on by, will you call my name?\u201d Soundtracks from the MTV era help these movies transcend moments that have aged poorly, and my own penchant for nostalgia helps when even the music falters. John Parr\u2019s \u201cMan in Motion\u201d from \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d is cheesy, but in its over-the-top earnestness I can still feel my breathless excitement over the film and its actors. As McCarthy wrote in a 2021 memoir that gave rise to his documentary, \u201cIt\u2019s not just the work; maybe now more importantly, it is the memory of the work that\u2019s so valuable to people.\u201d The movies came out for all of us \u201880s kids \u201cwhen the future was a blank slate, when anything was possible.\u201d Now he has made a documentary that I have no choice but to watch because he\u2019s investigated not only his distant past but a part of mine, too. I can\u2019t wait to see what he found out about a moment we shared through the silver screen and what it all meant \u2014 if it really mattered. Actually, forget that last part. It definitely mattered.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/entertainment/brat-pack-documentary-mccarthy-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_entertainment_ryan-reynolds-deadpool-popcorn-buckets", "text": "Ryan Reynolds this week unveiled arguably the most anticipated and sure-to-be coveted merchandise tied to his upcoming film \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d: the movie\u2019s novelty popcorn bucket. Said to be designed by Deadpool himself, the bucket, modeled after Wolverine, features a large opening akin to the quick-healing mutant\u2019s wide-open mouth, complete with the low-key vulgar suggestion of a tongue (it\u2019s from the famously inappropriate Deadpool, after all). In his social media post announcing the buzzy item, Reynolds wrote, \u201cYears from now they will look back at 2024 as the year the War of the Popcorn Buckets began.\u201d What \u201cwar\u201d could he possibly be referring to and why the hype around these movie snack containers, anyway? Popcorn buckets, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, are having a major moment. The first round of 2024 bucket battles, one might argue, was won in March by a \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d popcorn bucket so strange it spawned a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit). The appeal of these buckets \u2013 also referred to as \u201cconcession vessels\u201d or even \u201cCollectible Concession Vehicles\u201d to include specialty beverage containers and the like \u2013 is wide, attracting both seasoned collectors and casual movie fans. \u201cSeeing an item at the movie theater of my favorite characters draws me in,\u201d said collector Shahji Adam in an email to CNN. Adam, who also collects other pop culture products like Funko Pop figures, described his passion for popcorn buckets as \u201cfun nostalgia\u201d for items that help him remember the feeling of watching a particular movie for the first time. A brief history of the bucket Branded popcorn buckets began popping up in the 1990s at Disney theme parks before they made their way to theaters in marketing campaigns. AMC\u2019s Nels Storm, vice president of food & beverage strategy and leader of the merchandise team, points to 2019 as a turning point in the novelty concession vessel\u2019s evolution. \u201cWe experimented with versions of plastic popcorn tubs and beverage vessels with film branding for years. The real inception of the current program kicked off in 2019 when we introduced the R2-D2 vessel to the movie-going public,\u201d Storm said, in reference to the famous android-shaped popcorn containers that came out in support of that year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.\u201d Noting how the R2-D2 buckets sold out at AMC locations around the country on opening night, Storm added that \u201cit was clear there was bigger potential in this space.\u201d Since then, other in-demand popcorn buckets have included the Ghostbusters Ecto-1 car, Thor\u2019s hammer Mj\u00f6lnir, Dominic Toretto\u2019s Charger, the Wonka hat and a Barbie car, Storm said. AMC even recently brought back the R2-D2 popcorn bucket for this year\u2019s May the Fourth \u201cStar Wars\u201d Day, in support of the rerelease of \u201cStar Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.\u201d That bucket is Adam\u2019s favorite, as seen on his TikTok. \u201cIt\u2019s gigantic and I love that the head of R2 is where you put the drink and the body is for the popcorn!\u201d he said. As with many collectibles, some buckets are hard to come by Roland Romero, a popcorn bucket devotee with a YouTube playlist of his impressive collection, noted the vessels are globally popular and not always easy to obtain. Some movie theater chains might be out of region or make the items available for a limited run, Romero said. \u201cThe only trick is that for nearly all these collectable items, guests wanting to get the latest will want to make sure they\u2019re seeing the movie on opening weekend, and in many cases, opening night,\u201d Storm noted. He added that the R2-D2 buckets sold out both times they were made available to the public, and that the Ecto-1 car popcorn vessel \u201cflew out of the theatres during the initial hours\u201d of \u201cGhostbusters Afterlife\u2019s\u201d opening night in November 2021. What\u2019s coming next in this bucket \u2018war\u2019 Theater chains are eager to entice audiences to come and eat popcorn at the movies instead of on their couches at home, so that means more sassy snack holders to come. \u201cThe sky is the limit,\u201d with where things might go, Storm said, adding that AMC is \u201calways pushing boundaries\u201d to make going to the movies a fun and worthwhile event. And if you thought reaching into the giant mouth of a sandworm from Arrakis was gross, just wait until other horror-related merchandising items come down the pike. Adam said that because he\u2019s a horror movie fan, he\u2019s excited for the \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d bucket, which is rumored to be in the form of a Xenomorph \u2013 or, the extremely dangerous and disgusting, two-mouthed, acid-for-blood extraterrestrial at the center of that storied franchise.

The Eras Tour, which began in Glendale, Arizona on March 18, 2023, has been extended several times since it was first announced. It has since passed through the United States, South America, Asia and Australia, and is currently on its European leg before it makes a return to North America. It now appears there will be no additions to the current dates listed on her website, with the last one a show in Vancouver, Canada, on December 8. \u201cI think that this tour has really become my entire life,\u201d Swift said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s taken over everything.\u201d \u201cLike, I think I once had hobbies but I don\u2019t know what they were anymore. \u2018Cause all I do when I\u2019m not on stage is, like, sit at home and try to think of clever, like, acoustic song mashups and think about what you might want to hear. Just \u2013 so like, when I\u2019m not on the stage, I\u2019m dreaming about being back on the stage with you guys,\u201d she continued. Swift thanked her fans for all the work they have put in to be at her show, including making plans \u201cso far in advance,\u201d memorizing lyrics and figuring out transportation. The Eras Tour has had a staggering impact on tourism, recently causing a spike in air travel across Europe. United Airlines revealed in May that demand for flights to Milan and Munich, where Swift is set to perform in July, has soared, with upward of 45% more passengers compared with last year. Her recent concerts at Edinburgh, Scotland, led to seismic activity being detected four miles from the stadium where the singer was performing, according to the British Geological Society. The historic tour has also been accused of pushing up inflation and is predicted by British bank Barclays to boost spending by nearly $1 billion in the United Kingdom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/entertainment/taylor-swift-eras-tour-end-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Then there was the actual kissing, which made a \u201cmess\u201d when the two differently toned makeup colors they were each wearing combined, she said. \u201cSo we kept doing this kiss\u2026 and I would end up looking as though I had been sucking a caramel bar after each take because his makeup would come off on me.\u201d In fact, Winslet described shooting this scene as a \u201cnightmare\u201d because DiCaprio \u201cwouldn\u2019t stop laughing\u201d and because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t breathe in that bloody corset\u201d she was wearing.

The movie will celebrate \u201cthe islands, communities and traditions of Pacific Islanders in a spectacular adventure,\u201d according to the announcement from Disney, which added: \u201cCatherine Laga\u2018aia will be voyaging to Motunui and beyond as the adventurous teenager who sails out on a daring mission to save her people in Disney\u2019s upcoming live-action Moana.\u201d Laga\u2018aia\u2019s IMDB profile shows just one other listing \u2013 for three episodes of the TV series \u201cThe Lost Flowers of Alice Hart,\u201d which also starred Sigourney Weaver. She is no stranger to showbiz, however, as her father is Jay Laga\u2018aia, a New Zealand-born actor who starred in two of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies. Disney announced the casting online, saying Laga\u2018aia will appear alongside Dwayne Johnson as Maui, the larger-than-life demigod for whom he provided the voice in the original 2016 animated feature. He is also one of the movie\u2019s producers, alongside, among others, \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote much of the original movie\u2019s soundtrack. In a statement included in the announcement, Laga\u2018aia,  who lives in Sydney, said: \u201cI\u2019m really excited to embrace this character because Moana is one of my favorites. \u201cMy grandfather comes from Fa\u2018aala, Palauli, in Savai\u2018i. And my grandmother is from Leulumoega Tuai on the main island of \u2018Upolu in Samoa. I\u2019m honored to have an opportunity to celebrate Samoa and all Pacific Island peoples, and to represent young girls who look like me.\u201d Her proud father took to social media to announce the news, too, posting on Instagram: \u201cMy family and I are so pleased to share this news with the rest of the world. My daughter Katie can finally share the news that she will be taking on the role of Moana in the live action Disney movie along side Dwayne Johnson and Lin Manuel Miranda.\u201d Set for release in July 2026, the movie also features New Zealand actor John Tui as Moana\u2019s father, Samoan-New Zealand actress Frankie Adams as her mother and Rena Owen as the storyteller Gramma Tala. Directing is Thomas Kail, whose previous credits have included \u201cHamilton\u201d on Broadway and Disney+. News of the live version was announced by Johnson last year. He said on Instagram that \u201cthis story is my culture, and this story is emblematic of our people\u2019s grace, mana and warrior strength.\u201d The animated \u201cMoana\u201d was a smash, making over $680 million at the box office and the most-streamed movie of 2023, according\u00a0Nielsen\u00a0tracking. The sequel, \u201cMoana 2,\u201d is set for release in November. Auli\u2019i Cravalho starred as Moana in the original film, along with Rachel House, Nicole Scherzinger and Temuera Morrison. Disney has successfully reimagined several of its animated classics as live-action movies, beginning with \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d in 2017, followed by \u201cAladdin\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d in 2019 and \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/entertainment/disney-catherine-lagaaia-moana-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_entertainment_inside-out-2-review", "text": "Teens might be entering those awkward \u201cToo cool for Pixar\u201d years, but of all demographics, that cohort and their parents should relate the most to \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d a wonderfully clever sequel that ages up the concept with one dreaded word: Puberty. Whatever one\u2019s age, there\u2019s much to like in a movie that offers the requisite laughs and sweetness, while managing to feel quite profound. Granted, Disney\u2019s once-can\u2019t-miss animation powerhouse has experienced its own awkward stretch since \u201cToy Story 4\u201d five years ago, thanks to some questionable choices (see \u201cOnward\u201d) and factors beyond its control (the pandemic). Small wonder that there would be comfort in reaching back to a hit from 2015, one that highlighted Pixar\u2019s inventiveness as well as its ability to tap into childhood concerns \u2013 by bringing to life the conflicting emotions within them \u2013 in a way that resonated with adults as well. Under the stewardship of first-time feature director Kelsey Mann, \u201cInside Out 2\u201d re-introduces Riley (voiced by Kensington Tallman) as a now-teenager, playing hockey, excelling in school and enjoying a sense of self that hinges on thinking of herself as a good person. Joy (Amy Poehler) remains the maestro among her various emotions, accentuating the good and pushing the bad into the recesses of her mind. That equilibrium is instantly thrown for a loop, however, when (in one of several laugh-out-loud visual gags) the puberty button lights up, unleashing a new group of emotions, including Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Shame (Paul Walter Hauser) and Ennui (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, who is, naturally, French). Anxiety leads the newcomers in taking over the command center, telling Joy and the old guard, \u201cRiley\u2019s life is more complex now.\u201d That seems especially true as she\u2019s dealt unexpected news on the verge of arriving at hockey camp, where her performance, she fears, could have implications for her whole middle-school-to-high-school transition. While there have certainly been no shortage of movies dealing with those delicate coming-of-age years, the central device of \u201cInside Out\u201d provides an especially good way of exploring questions about growing up, the desire to fit in and still preserving some sense of the child you were as you mature. Pixar notably grappled with similar issues in \u201cTurning Red,\u201d one of its better recent efforts, which happened to arrive at an inopportune time and lack the established qualities that would help lure audiences to go see it. On the bright side, even with studios struggling at the box office there\u2019s evidence of a not-terribly-discriminating hunger for kid-friendly fare based on results for \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d with the latest edition of \u201cDespicable Me\u201d still to come. Whether \u201cInside Out 2\u201d translates that into the hoped-for commercial success \u2013 as last year\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ultimately did after a disappointing start \u2013 the film happily meets the high creative standards and expectations that Pixar has established. Whatever Riley\u2019s going through, there\u2019s nothing particularly complicated about that. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d premieres June 14 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/entertainment/inside-out-2-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_summer-movie-preview-2024", "text": "It may feel like not long ago, but a year has passed since the summer of \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d and Hollywood is hoping for another season of enthusiastic audiences and perhaps an unlikely but viral cinematic pairing. (\u201c#Garfiosa,\u201d anyone?) Some things about this summer\u2019s slate of movies feel similar \u2013 namely, a lot of sequels on offer \u2013 while other elements feel a bit different, like the lingering hangover from last year\u2019s twin strikes that brought movie production to a months-long standstill. Nevertheless, there are more than a few characters sure to distract from that with their showy antics, some masked and mouthy (here\u2019s looking at you, Deadpool) and others aiming to turn our emotions \u201cInside Out\u201d all over again. Behold a list of the most buzzy movies being released theatrically between Memorial and Labor Day Weekends, 2024. For ease of reference, any sequel, prequel or reboot is marked with an asterisk: \u2018Furiosa\u2019* (May 24) George Miller\u2019s fifth foray into the gnarly post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max, \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d explores the origins of the titular character originated by Charlize Theron in 2015\u2019s Oscar-winning epic \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d Here, Furiosa is played to the mettle by Anya Taylor-Joy, with villainous antics (and a prosthetic nose) supplied by Chris Hemsworth. \u2018The Garfield Movie\u2019 (May 24) Chris Pratt gets to add another voice credit to his list of animated roles after last year\u2019s hit \u201cMario Bros. Movie\u201d with \u201cGarfield,\u201d following the famously lethargic ginger cat hailing from the comic strips of yore. Joining Pratt as the titular cat in this family-friendly romp are Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein, along with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Cecily Strong and Bowen Yang. \u2018Ezra\u2019 (May 31) Robert De Niro joins Bobby Cannavale and Rose Byrne in this drama about a comedian who is father to an autistic child, and the unexpected road trip they embark upon. Whoopi Goldberg, Vera Farmiga and Tony Goldwyn (who also directs) costar. Introducing William A. Fitzgerald in the title role as Ezra. \u2018Robot Dreams\u2019 (May 31) Nominated for best animated feature at the Academy Awards earlier this year, \u201cRobot Dreams\u201d is the winsome tale of a dog, named Dog, and his new robot friend named\u2026 you guessed it, Robot. This one gets extra points for being a period piece, of sorts, taking place in New York City in the 1980s. \u2018Summer Camp\u2019 (May 31) This \u201cBook Club\u201d-esque take on three friends from summer camp reuniting later in life for another hurrah stars Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard and Eugene Levy in what (inexplicably) looks to be the role of the hunk they fawned over as youngsters. With this plus \u201cBook Club,\u201d its sequel last year as well as \u201cPoms,\u201d Keaton looks to be launching her very own genre. \u2018Bad Boys: Ride or Die\u2019* (June 7) Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back for a fourth go-round of this buddy comedy/action hybrid, with the twist being that this time, they\u2019re on the run (according to the IMDb logline). The movie, costarring Vanessa Hudgens, follows 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (it seems that title\u2019s promise didn\u2019t quite stick). \u2018The Watchers\u2019 (June 7) The nepo baby phenomenon extends beyond actors, as this June entry marks the feature directorial debut of one Ishana Shyamalan, daughter to M. Night (she gained footing on his Apple TV+ series \u201cServant\u201d). The film looks dutifully creepy, and stars the talented Dakota Fanning (\u201cRipley\u201d) as an artist who finds herself in a strange forest in Ireland. Soon, that becomes the least of her problems. \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 (June 7) You read that right \u2013 this 1999 international classic is being rereleased with a 4K restoration to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie\u2019s original US debut. Starring Franka Potente and directed by the visionary Tom Tykwer, \u201cLola\u201d follows a young woman in Berlin who has 20 minutes to get across town to her boyfriend \u2013 and find 100,000 Deutche Marks on the way \u2013 or else he dies. As time ticks by and Lola makes split-second decisions, her life and that of those around her become remarkably altered. \u2018Inside Out 2\u2019* (June 14) Almost a decade (!!) since Pixar\u2019s Oscar-winning exploration into the mind and emotions of one young Riley, Amy Poehler and company are back as Riley grows into her teen years. Several new emotions will be at play, including Anxiety (voiced by \u201cStranger Things\u2019\u201d Maya Hawke), Envy (\u201cThe Bear\u201d star Ayo Edebiri), embarrassment and even ennui. Oh, to be a teen once again. \u2018Treasure\u2019 (June 14) \u201cGirls\u201d star and creator Lena Dunham and \u201cWilde\u201d actor Stephen Fry play a daughter and father who travel to Poland in the early 1990s to explore the latter\u2019s roots. But the specter of his trauma from surviving the Holocaust causes him to try to sabotage their trip, as the pair nonetheless face the past and grow closer in the process. \u2018Kinds of Kindness\u2019 (June 21) After last year\u2019s surprisingly bizarre and very acclaimed \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is the next team-up between two-time Oscar-winner Emma Stone and \u201cPoor Things\u201d director Yorgos Lanthimos. The new film is billed as a dark \u201ctriptych fable,\u201d costarring Willem Dafoe, \u201cCivil War\u201d actor Jesse Plemons,\u00a0Margaret Qualley, \u201cThe Whale\u201d star Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Mamoudou Athie and \u201cEuphoria\u201d rising star Hunter Schafer. \u2018The Bikeriders\u2018 (June 21) The next starring vehicle for \u201cElvis\u201d actor Austin Butler, \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d looks like a mashup of \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d and \u201cMidnight Cowboy,\u201d with Butler at the head of a rough and tumble biker gang in \u201960s Chicago. Costarring Tom Hardy and \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star\u00a0Jodie Comer. \u2018Thelma\u2019 (June 21) Marking her first lead role, \u201cThelma\u201d stars 94-year-old June Squibb as the titular senior who is targeted in a phone scam and decides to take matters into her own hands to get back what\u2019s hers. The Oscar-nominated \u201cNebraska\u201d star is joined in the new movie by \u201cThe White Lotus\u2019s\u201d Fred Hechinger, who plays her grandson. \u2018A Quiet Place: Day One\u2019* (June 28) This prequel sure looks like it\u2019ll make a lot of noise. The latest entry in John Krasinski\u2019s super sound-sensitive alien invasion franchise, \u201cDay One\u201d stars Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o and will focus on when the vicious beasts first arrive and begin wreaking havoc. \u201cStranger Things 4\u201d breakout star Joseph Quinn, along with franchise returnee Djimon Hounsou, costar. \u2018Horizon: An American Saga\u2019 - Chapter 1 (June 28) Long before \u201cYellowstone,\u201d Kevin Costner roamed the wild American frontier in \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d and he\u2019s clearly not done with the Western genre as this June\u2019s \u201cHorizon\u201d is just the first movie in a series, centered on expansion and settlement both before and after the Civil War. \u201cChapter 2\u201d comes on August 16, with a third installment currently in production. \u2018Despicable Me 4\u2019* (July 3) The Minions are back for another zany romp, with Steve Carell\u2019s Gru and family welcoming a new addition, Gru Jr., and facing off against a new baddie voiced by Well Ferrell. This one is sure to be a known quantity, especially for beleaguered parents looking for a break over July 4th weekend. \u2018MaXXXine\u2019* (July 5) Ti West\u2019s horror trilogy comes to a bloody close with this 1980s Hollywood-set movie starring Mia Goth as an adult film star harboring some killer secrets who is stalked by a slasher. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d comes after West\u2019s impressive 2022 film \u201cX,\u201d and the slightly less convincing \u201cPearl\u201d from later that year. The third entry boasts a phenomenal supporting cast including \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Giancarlo Esposito, Kevin Bacon and singer Halsey. \u2018Fly Me to the Moon\u2019 (July 12) This period piece stars Scarlett Johansson as a PR maven tasked with staging a fake moon landing in case the real one doesn\u2019t take off successfully, opposite Channing Tatum playing the launch director whose job it is to make sure it does. Woody Harrelson costars. \u2018Longlegs\u2019 (July 12) This terrifying-looking thriller stars the prolific Nicolas Cage as a severely demented serial killer leaving occult clues (think \u201cSe7en\u201d) for an FBI agent played by Maika Monroe, the excellent actress who played the final girl in \u201cIt Follows.\u201d The trailer has \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d vibes, in the scariest possible way. \u2018Twisters\u2019* (July 19) Taking a look at weather-related news these days, it\u2019s pretty clear that extreme tornadoes are no longer an odd occurrence deserving of big-budget Hollywood treatment. Nonetheless, \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star Glen Powell is taking over storm-chasing duties from the late Bill Paxton in this almost 30-years-later sequel. Be on the lookout for debris, cows and a possible cameo from Helen Hunt. \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019* (July 26) Almost certainly the blockbuster to beat this summer, the highly anticipated sequel (are you sensing a trend yet?) will see Ryan Reynolds return as the famed Merc with a Mouth, joined for this third go-round by none other than Hugh Jackman, reprising his signature role of Wolverine after (temporarily, anyway) saying goodbye to his claws in 2017\u2019s \u201cLogan.\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is also significant as Marvel\u2019s first R-rated superhero movie, bridging the gap between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the 20th\u00a0Century Fox crop of heroes \u2013 namely the X-Men \u2013 who now belong to Marvel\u2019s parent company Disney. Expect extensive, fourth wall-breaking commentary from Deadpool himself on all of this in the movie. \u2018D\u00ecdi\u2019 (July 26) Coming of age stories are a well-mined area, but this spirited look at a Taiwanese-American 13-year-old boy enjoying the last month of summer before high school in 2008 looks like just the off-kilter and authentic experience that can serve as excellent counter-programming to all the noisier and more mainstream cinematic fare this season. Perhaps make it a double-feature with the aforementioned superheroes, and launch the #DidiPool trend? You heard it here first. \u2018Harold and the Purple Crayon\u2019 (August 2) Based on the popular children\u2019s book by Crockett Johnson, \u201cHarold\u201d stars Zachary Levi (\u201cShazam!\u201d) as the titular owner of a purple crayon that can create anything he imagines. In a bit of a meta moment, he manages to draw himself out of the book and into the real world, where his powers draw the attention of both good and bad players. \u2018Cuckoo\u2019 (August 2) Starring \u201cEuphoria\u2019s\u201d Hunter Schafer in her first lead film role, this horror film looks positively creepy and a bit, well, cuckoo. Schafer plays a young woman visiting a mysterious German Alpine resort with her family. She is soon plagued by horrifically bloody visions and believes a strange woman is following her. The trailer mentions the habits of birds in nature, which definitely ratchets up the ick-factor. Costarring Dan Stevens. \u2018Sing Sing\u2019 (August 2) After his Oscar-nominated turn in last year\u2019s \u201cRustin,\u201d Colman Domingo (who also counts \u201cEuphoria\u201d among his credits) stars in another film based on a true story, this one set at the infamous prison in New York State. In the film, Domingo plays a wrongfully imprisoned inmate who finds meaning through acting in a theatre group alongside other incarcerated men in the penitentiary. Featuring an ensemble cast of formerly incarcerated actors. \u2018Kneecap\u2019 (August 2) This biopic about an Irish rap trio \u2013 who rap in their native Irish tongue \u2013 made a splash at Sundance earlier this year, with the actual trio portraying themselves in the movie. If that\u2019s not enough to pique curiosity, try this \u2013 the film features Michael Fassbender in a supporting role. \u2018Trap\u2019 (August 9) While his daughter\u2019s been busy with her own film (see \u201cThe Watchers\u201d above), M. Night Shyamalan hasn\u2019t slowed down himself, welcoming Josh Hartnett in a plum lead role as a dad taking his kid to the concert of a wildly popular Taylor Swift-like star whose fans are obsessive. Oh, and Hartnett\u2019s character also happens to be a serial killer, and the cops have blockaded the concert venue to trap him (hence the title). The big question is, if we were able to glean all that from the trailer, what could the final Shyamalan twist possibly be at the end? \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 (August 9) Blake Lively stars in this adaptation from the bestselling Colleen Hoover novel, about a traumatized woman torn between her first love and a new relationship, one that reminds her of patterns she\u2019s seen before. Costarring Justin Baldoni, Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj. \u2018Borderlands\u2019 (August 9) In case you\u2019re missing the Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 who took their final bow last summer \u2013 \u201cBorderlands\u201d should have you covered, as the film looks to follow a similarly freewheeling cohort of intergalactic misfits on a valiant quest. Here, they\u2019re led by Oscar-winners Cate Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with Kevin Hart and \u201cBarbie\u201d star Ariana Greenblatt. Based on the bestselling video game. \u2018Alien: Romulus\u2019* (August 16) Just when you thought it was safe to scream in space again, the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise returns, hopefully with a better entry than (at least) the last two. \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe\u201d director Fede Alvarez directs \u201cCivil War\u201d and \u201cPriscilla\u201d star Cailee Spaeny \u2013 who, from the looks of the trailer, seems to be on serious Sigourney Weaver duty \u2013 as she accompanies a group of space colonizers inspecting a derelict space station. It\u2019s a safe bet that they find trouble, and then some. \u2018Close to You\u2019 (August 16) \u201cUmbrella Academy\u2019s\u201d Elliot\u00a0Page stars as Sam, a trans man going home for the first time since transitioning. Once there, he rekindles a romance with an old flame, and must face long-simmering issues. Costarring Hillary Baack and Wendy Crewson. \u2018Blink Twice\u2019 (August 23) Jam packed with a starry cast, \u201cBlink Twice\u201d looks like a perfect late summer movie \u2013 attractive people, elaborate action sequences, and mindless mayhem. This is Channing Tatum\u2019s second entry this summer after \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d here playing a crazy tech billionaire who whisks a cocktail waitress (Naomi Ackie) and her friend (Alia Shawkat) off to his private island for what turns into an insane interlude. Kyle MacLachlan, Christian Slater, Haley Joel Osment and Geena Davis round out the cast. Directed by Zo\u00eb Kravitz. \u2018The Crow\u2019* (August 23) An uber-gory-looking reboot based on the influential James O\u2019Barr graphic novel, which also served as inspiration for the 1994 noir thriller of the same name that starred the late Brandon Lee. The new film stars Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from \u201cIt\u201d) as a brutally murdered man who returns from the dead to avenge his killing and that of his beloved soulmate Shelly (FKA twigs). \u2018Slingshot\u2019 (August 23) Laurence Fishburne and Casey Affleck star in this sci-fi thriller about an astronaut heading to the Titan moon of Saturn who loses his grip on reality when his mission becomes compromised. \u2018Reagan\u2019 (August 30) Dennis Quaid plays Ronald Reagan, a 1950s-era actor who eventually became the 40th President of the United States. Prepare for extensive debates on how the figure is portrayed here. With Penelope Ann Miller as Nancy Reagan.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/summer-movie-preview-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_10_entertainment_subtitles-movies-tv", "text": "One of the benefits of streaming has been an increased flow of series and movies from around the globe, as services try to keep their shelves filled with fresh alternatives. Subscribers in the US, moreover, seem much less resistant than in years past when it comes to watching shows either entirely or heavily in languages other than English, as evidenced by the popularity of titles like \u201cSquid Game,\u201d \u201cLupin\u201d and most recently \u201cShogun.\u201d Yet even shows produced in English in other countries, like the UK and Australia, can become a little thick for an American ear trying to sort out the idiomatic quirks and other differences. If you paused a few times to catch lines in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d or \u201cBodkin,\u201d or Paramount+\u2019s \u201cSexy Beast,\u201d rest assured, you are not alone. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason why data indicate more people \u2013 especially young adults, who are more prone to second-screen viewing and multitasking \u2013 are watching shows in their primary language with the subtitles on. According to a 2023 survey by YouGov, nearly 40% of US respondents preferred having the subtitles on when watching TV in a language they speak, with those under 30 employing that practice by a better than two-to-one margin compared to those age 45 to 64. The survey found that those using subtitles cite two primary factors in equal measure: Subtitles enhance their comprehension, and they help them understand accents. Netflix, as the most widely distributed streaming service, has cast its net farther and wider in terms of offering programs produced around the world, and it has taken note of changes in the way people consume its content. The service has increased the number of films and series that support audio descriptions (AD) and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing (SDH). Kathy Rokni, Netflix\u2019s senior director of globalization, said the service employs an in-house team of \u201csubtitling experts and language managers,\u201d designed to enhance the viewing experience while remaining faithful to the filmmakers\u2019 intentions. \u201cWe believe great stories transcend borders, cultures, abilities, and languages,\u201d Rokni said via email, noting that 40% of viewing hours on Netflix now happen with subtitles, including SDH, over half of which involves members employing subtitles in their primary language. Certainly, it\u2019s a long way back to 1979, when the Australian movie \u201cMad Max\u201d was dubbed into American English because the distributor feared Americans wouldn\u2019t be able to understand the Aussie accents. British series obviously have a long history in the US \u2013 look no further than \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and the period dramas presented by \u201cMasterpiece Theater\u201d \u2013 but they traditionally tended to operate within a relatively narrow swatch of audience and genres. By contrast, it\u2019s notable today that a wider variety of imports, either in English or other languages, are organically finding success with little advance fanfare and promotion, as \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and before that \u201cSquid Game\u201d did. The trend suggests viewers are actively sampling internationally produced material as they seek (and often stumble upon) options via streaming platforms. For streaming services, there\u2019s a clear benefit to that, since series already produced elsewhere generally cost less to acquire than homegrown product, particularly with the production pipeline having slowed due to last year\u2019s twin and prolonged actors and writers strikes. So if the best show you\u2019ve seen lately also happens to be one where you find yourself reading along while watching, either to assist your understanding or simply by choice?

{"id": "2024_06_12_entertainment_the-boys-season-4-review-political-drama", "text": "\u201cThe Boys\u201d began with an intriguing question for our superhero-infused pop culture \u2013 namely, what would happen if extraordinary powers were wedded with corruption, neuroses and corporate greed. Yet that dark, satirical take on the genre has blossomed into TV\u2019s most political drama, a quality even more overtly on display in its much-anticipated fourth season. Put more simply, don\u2019t let the masks and capes fool you. The fact that the latest episodes drop as the US braces for a presidential campaign only magnifies elements that have existed throughout the show\u2019s run on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, becoming the service\u2019s signature series, including the spinoffs \u201cGen V\u201d and \u201cThe Boys Presents: Diabolical.\u201d The fourth season features the usual conflict between superheroes in the uneasy employ of Vought International and those who oppose them. The former cohort begins with the near-invincible, psychopathic Homelander (Antony Starr), whose Superman-like public persona is carefully manicured to hide those qualities, while the latter take their lead from Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), even if they frequently question his methods. The Butcher-Homelander standoff is complicated by their battle for the soul of the latter\u2019s biological son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), which itself encompasses consideration of the question of nature versus nature. More than any season before it, the new arc leans into the political realm thanks to the involvement of politician Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), and efforts by Vought and Homelander to impact the political debate. That includes thinly-veiled references to a group clearly intended to represent QAnon, the conspiracy-minded movement, and the use of propaganda tactics to manipulate the public and voters. At one point, the characters attend an event called Truthcon, where a banner that reads \u201cThere are no conspiracies \u2013 or coincidences\u201d is prominently flown. The show also reveals the private disdain of those in (and with) power toward their supporters, a point made in a uniquely \u201cThe Boys\u201d-esque manner. To punctuate that, there\u2019s a new hero, Firecracker (Valorie Curry), whose political leanings echo Vought News\u2019 conservative commentators (she even gets her own show). As series creator Eric Kripke told Entertainment Weekly, the character serves as a surrogate for \u201cconspiracy-minded movements and the super extreme right-wing news media.\u201d Dispensing with subtlety, Kripke and company have surrounded that satire in violence and excess, qualities that feel organic to this world, where the traditional ideal of heroism is used to obscure brutal realities. Although the Deep (Chace Crawford), an Aquaman-like member of the Vought-backed superhero team known as the Seven, is often a semi-pathetic sources of derision, he sums that mentality up when he comes to the realization, as he puts it, \u201cViolence is power.\u201d Inevitably, the new season involves new, unexpected and uneasy alliances, as well as the thorny (and seemingly perennial) issue of finding ways to neutralize Homelander, which hardly feels like a fair fight. Having earned its reputation as the most gruesome and kinky show on television, \u201cThe Boys\u201d grapples with a certain pressure to fulfill those expectations for the faithful. In its totality, the eight-episode season largely manages to clear that bar (or should one prefer, limbo under it), including a few explosively funny (and not incidentally, grisly) visual gags. Success has also enabled \u201cThe Boys\u201d to play a long game, meaning nobody should expect too much closure from this season when there\u2019s a fifth and final season to come. From that view, the series might have lost some of its freshness but not its ability to surprise and provoke, peeling back its mask a little further to issue a warning about the danger of brightly colored fascism, a message clearly intended to echo beyond its world and into ours. \u201cThe Boys\u201d begins its fourth season June 13 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/entertainment/the-boys-season-4-review-political-drama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_entertainment_house-of-the-dragon-season-2-review", "text": "If the first season of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d challenged viewers with its dizzying list of introductions and disorienting time jumps, the second involves a more straightforward build-up toward a great civil war, where strategy often takes a back seat to vengeance and emotion. Still not the series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was, this prequel now mirrors its barbaric take on palace intrigue well enough to have become bloody good. Once again, the battle for the throne has \u201cYou win or you die\u201d stakes, pitting Queen Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy), her uncle/husband Daemon (Matt Smith) and their assorted forces against Rhaenyra\u2019s childhood friend Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and her sons (who happen to be Rhaenyra\u2019s half-siblings), one of whom, Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), currently claims their late father\u2019s mantle. Living up to the show\u2019s title, both sides of this Targaryen-on-Targaryen faceoff have an arsenal of dragons, which amount to a version of air power in these medieval times, and an almost nuclear-style deterrent against ill-thought-out behavior. While the dragons took a while to grow into players in the original series, here they figure prominently in calculations about military action and seldom disappoint once unleashed. In that sense, while other series have sought to match \u201cThrones\u201d in conjuring spectacle and grandeur (none more so than \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, whose deficiencies owe more to character and story), little on television can truly rival \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u2019s\u201d scope and scale. Happily, under executive producer Ryan Condal (who shares \u201ccreated by\u201d credit with author George R.R. Martin), the new season feels cleaner and more tightly focused, despite juggling existing players while adding a few key new ones. At its core, the women still hold the center, as the initially grieving Rhaenyra must deal with the headstrong Daemon, while Alicent and her father, Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), struggle to manage Aegon, another weak, erratic ruler prone to actions and decisions that risk undermining their cause. HBO made four episodes available, or half of this season, and they certainly don\u2019t rush things in setting up the chess pieces. Still, each hour contains at least one jaw-dropping moment, clearing the high bar set by the pilot episode\u2019s child-birth sequence with this season\u2019s not-for-the-faint-of-heart first episode, which nicely sets the table for much of what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe path to victory now is one of violence,\u201d the Hand to the King, Hightower, muses with grave seriousness. As the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d series, \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d reminds us, going back in time (in \u201cDragon\u2019s\u201d case, about two centuries) in some respects means starting from scratch, at least developing audience allegiance to the characters and keeping track of elaborate timelines and mythologies. After a somewhat rocky takeoff, \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d has seemingly reached its cruising altitude, while continuing to take big creative swings. Although the Emmy-winning \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d might not have stuck the landing, that clearly did little to dampen demand for its muscular, visceral brand of storytelling. Prosecuting the Targaryen war comes with risks, both for those in the show and those responsible for making it. For now, though, this has become a genuinely worthy successor, allowing those with a taste for the wickedness of Westeros to kick back and enjoy the ride. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d begins its second season June 16 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

But, she adds \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate that the studios will be giving us that reason.\u201d Either way, she continued, the union intends to \u201cfight for everything that we can get\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019re done being disrespected.\u201d While entertainment consumers would never know it from their still-plentiful streaming carousels, industry professionals across the many trades that are essential to the DNA of a Hollywood movie and TV sets say their industry is on crutches. The studios and streamers are buying and producing fewer projects. A lot of projects are being filmed out of California and out of the country, resulting in fewer  job opportunities for those living in the heart of the entertainment industry. \u201cSome of these proposals we have made for 50 plus years so this fight was always going to happen, but now the fight is different because our members have suffered such financial hardship in the last year from not working \u2013 and at the hands of the studios,\u201d Dougherty said. \u201cThe studios are the ones that, in my opinion, could have deterred that from happening or prevented a dual strike from happening.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the entity that represents the studios and streamers, for comment on the start of the Teamsters\u2019 and Basic Crafts\u2019 negotiations. The negotiations between Hollywood\u2019s leading crew unions \u2013 including IATSE, Teamsters Local 399 and Basic Hollywood Crafts \u2013 and the AMPTP will culminate by the end of July, when the current contracts expire. Here\u2019s what to know about who is negotiating, what they\u2019re fighting for and what another potential strike would mean for viewers. Who are the Teamsters? Nearly 5,000 members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters\u2019 (IBT) motion picture division include drivers, dispatchers, Department of Transportation (DOT) administrators, animal trainers, wranglers, mechanics and location managers who work in Hollywood. They are represented by Teamsters Local 399, with the drivers making up the largest portion of their membership. What is Hollywood Basic Crafts? Hollywood Basic Crafts is coalition of crew unions that include: Who is in IATSE? The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) represents nearly 170,000 members working in Hollywood as hair and makeup artists, wardrobe department workers, broadcast techs, designers, animators, AV techs, scenic artists and more. Who are the AMPTP? The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) is the entity that represents the major Hollywood studios and streamers in negotiations with the entertainment industry unions and guilds. When did negotiations start? Hollywood Basic Crafts and Teamsters Local 399 began June 10. IATSE began the first phase of their negotiations earlier in March, which \u201chave largely been productive,\u201d according to a news release on Friday. Some tentative agreements were reached in April, but overall negotiations remain ongoing. Basic Crafts, Local 399 and IATSE are negotiating some specific provisions of their respective contracts alongside each other, but their members will be voting on each union\u2019s respective contract separately. What the unions want Fair wages, working conditions, residual distribution, pensions, health funds and job security provisions, among other topics, are all topics that are on the table, according to Dougherty. They are also seeking \u201cadditional compensation\u201d for the financial impact that the work-stoppage from last year\u2019s dual strikes had on members, she said. Dougherty said crew member unions aim to be \u201cproperly compensated for all the hard work that they do on a day-to-day basis.\u201d When would a potential strike begin? IATSE, Teamsters Local 399 and Hollywood Basic Crafts\u2019 respective contracts expire on July 31. Unless they agree to extend negotiations beyond that deadline, the unions and the AMPTP would need to agree on a new contract prior to that date to avoid a strike. What happens to TV show/movie productions if there\u2019s a strike? Hollywood would probably shut down again just like last year, causing industry-wide delays and putting thousands of people out of work again. What would that look like for entertainment consumers? It could mean waiting yet another year to watch the final season of \u201cStrangers Things,\u201d for example, which is set to stream in 2025 but will still be in production come July. If the production is halted due to a strike, that just further pushes back the release date. This is the case for any other project that\u2019s in production at the time of a strike.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/entertainment/teamsters-iatse-union-hollywood-crew-strike/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
