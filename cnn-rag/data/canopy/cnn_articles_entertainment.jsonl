Adapted by author Blake Crouch (whose page-to-TV credits include \u201cWayward Pines\u201d) from his novel, the story centers on Jason Dessen (\u201cThe Boys in the Boat\u2019s\u201d Joel Edgerton, living out the actorly dream of playing multiple versions of the same character), a physicist/professor seemingly living an idyllic life with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and teenage son (Oakes Fegley, who in his even-younger days fought \u201cThe War With Grandpa\u201d). Suddenly, Jason is not only abducted but replaced by a version of himself, having conjured a box that allows him to navigate between multiverses and an infinite assortment of possibilities, altered \u2013 sometimes dramatically, others almost imperceptibly \u2013 by individual choices and pivotal moments. Why this has happened \u2013 and what Jason can do to reclaim his life \u2013 presents what is at first an intriguing mystery, as well as a rumination on how one decision here or there can change our personal trajectory and relationships, coupled with broader questions of what the future might collectively hold. Once all that is established, though, \u201cDark Matter\u201d becomes less provocative over the course of its nine episodes, while embarking on a perhaps unavoidable series of tangents and detours that don\u2019t accomplish much more than killing time as Jason tries to work his way back home. The main problem, which nags at this entire subgenre of science fiction, is the sense that nothing really matters, since every new door/chapter \u2013 with doors that literally lead into alternate universes \u2013 feels as if it\u2019s just a step away from being rewritten or undone. As those scenarios and \u201cwhat ifs\u201d pile up, Jason\u2019s plight becomes as disorienting for the viewer as it is for him. \u201cDark Matter\u201d also has an overtly sentimental side in its rumination on what\u2019s important in life, which skews the story more toward Jason\u2019s particular journey than the jaw-dropping implications of what this portal to parallel worlds means (or could mean) for humanity. Apple has gambled on several ambitious science fiction projects of varying scope and scale, yielding mixed results, including \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d \u201cInvasion,\u201d \u201cConstellation,\u201d \u201cFoundation,\u201d \u201cSeverance\u201d (the true standout on this list) and \u201cSilo.\u201d \u201cDark Matter\u201d falls somewhere in the middle of that pack, which is to say, you ultimately won\u2019t miss all that much if you leave this door closed. \u201cDark Matter\u201d premieres May 8 on Apple TV+.

Her sharp quips about the former NFL quarterback gained her thousands of new followers on Instagram and a hilarious appearance on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show.\u201d Glaser, however, is taking it all in stride. She\u2019s been doing standup long enough to know the ups and downs of the entertainment industry. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like when are people gonna get it? I\u2019m not one of those people.

So, I took it really seriously.\u201d Glaser also took her preparations seriously for her new special, \u201cSomeday You\u2019ll Die.\u201d In it, she covers substantive topics like having kids, body image and death, but promises fans both old and new will find plenty of laughs, too. \u201cIt\u2019s just a look at my life right now as I\u2019m approaching 40 and all my friends are having kids and starting families, getting married. I don\u2019t really have any of that,\u201d she said. \u201c[The special explores] how I suffer with depression, despite the fact that my life is great, my fear of death, my longing for it at times, [with] really hard jokes in between.\u201d Glaser describes her new work as \u201chonest, raw, really tight comedy,\u201d two years in the making. \u201cSomeday You\u2019ll Die\u201d debuts May 11 on Max, which like CNN is part of Warner Bros.

{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_bodkin-review-will-forte-obama", "text": "The latest Netflix project falling under the Obamas\u2019 production deal, \u201cBodkin\u201d initially possesses an intriguing \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d-like vibe with a touch of \u201cLocal Hero,\u201d the classic 1983 film about a young executive dispatched to a Scottish village. Here, it\u2019s an American podcaster invading a quirky Irish town, nosing around a cold case that yields a steadily diminishing drip from this Irish spring. Said podcaster Gilbert (Will Forte) comes with his share of baggage, as does Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), the investigative reporter grudgingly assigned to accompany him. They\u2019re joined by Emmy (Robyn Cara), a bright-eyed young researcher who looks up to Dove, which doesn\u2019t make the more seasoned journalist\u2019s treatment of her any less frosty. Indeed, Dove makes clear she feels like she\u2019s slumming in pandering to this request (order, actually) from her bosses to squire Gilbert through his mission, at least until they begin to chip away at the layers surrounding what might have happened to three people who disappeared a quarter-century earlier. As with \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and \u201cLocal Hero,\u201d there\u2019s an odd quaintness to the town Gilbert finds charming, but as is so often the case, the cheery exterior for tourists and rubes hides a darker underbelly. That includes guardedness toward outsiders that introduces a pinch of \u201cAn American Werewolf in London\u201d into the stew as well. Gilbert approaches the whole exercise from a very different perspective than Dove, who becomes engaged by the prospect of cracking the case, while he simply wants to put on a good show, prompting her to liken his work less to journalism than pornography. \u201cHe thinks Ireland is some kind of Disneyland,\u201d she grumbles, which is understandable given the \u201cDarby O\u2019Gill and the Little People\u201d setting, with even more heavy drinking and pounding hangovers. Forte is happily more subdued than he often tends to be, but Gilbert is still a reluctant sleuth, which makes Dove (played with a nicely crusty edge by Cullen, an Irish actor) the true driver of this story. Over the seven episodes, that arc becomes increasingly convoluted and a trifle far-fetched \u2013 not fatal flaws, but not helpful ones either. The Obamas\u2019 Higher Ground production company has become a prolific supplier to Netflix, from movies like \u201cLeave the World Behind\u201d to award-winning documentaries. Created by Jez Scharf, \u201cBodkin\u201d represents a low-key addition to that slate, but still makes for a passable binge; still, what looks like a distinctive show gradually blends into its saturated genre \u2013 less a commentary on true-crime podcasts than a reminder that even with series that start out well, there\u2019s not always a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. \u201cBodkin\u201d premieres May 9 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/bodkin-review-will-forte-obama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_tattooist-of-auschwitz-review", "text": "Something as simple as a framing device elevates \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d \u2013 which stands out from a host of recent Holocaust tales \u2013 thanks in part to Harvey Keitel, starring as the elderly Lale Sokolov who recounts his remarkable story of life in a concentration camp to an unlikely interviewer. Jumping around in time, this British production captures the horror of that experience while finding notes of grace in its narrator\u2019s survival. That\u2019s in part because this six-part series is at its core a love story, unfolding under the most horrible of circumstances. Assigned to tattoo identification numbers on the arms of other prisoners, the the young Lale, or Lali (\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u2019s\u201d Jonah Hauer-King, who lost a noticeable amount of weight for the role), meets Gita (Polish actress Anna Pr\u00f3chniak) while in the camps, becoming almost instantly smitten. \u201cI want you to live to be an old man,\u201d Gita tells him at one point, a wish that seems all the more tenuous as he deals with the sadistic guards, while she grapples with illness and those around them keep meeting terrible ends. Their interactions take place tenderly against a backdrop of pain, suffering and the constant threat of quick and arbitrary death, which leads the elder Lali to be haunted by visions of those he knew and lost. In a stark device, the victims (and in some instances, perpetrators) appear to Lali, like photographs etched in his mind, as he grapples with those memories and feelings of survivor\u2019s guilt. His story pours out, gradually, to aspiring author Heather Morris (\u201cYellowjackets\u201d star Melanie Lynskey), who is understandably overwhelmed by this flood of memories. \u201cI haven\u2019t got long,\u201d Lali tells her, fueling her commitment to ensure his story gets told. As noted, there have been several recent productions dealing with similar material, including Netflix\u2019s \u201cAll the Light We Cannot See\u201d and Hulu\u2019s \u201cWe Were the Lucky Ones.\u201d On top of that, the 80th anniversary of D-Day is prompting an onslaught of documentary fare devoted to World War II. Nevertheless, \u201cTattooist of Auschwitz\u201d stands apart from the crowd, thanks in part to the quality of its performances, not just by documenting the barbarity of the Nazis but the sprigs of humanity that managed to bloom during the darkest of times. Featuring a new song from Barbra Streisand, the series closes with footage of the real Sokolov being interviewed. Those clips drive the point home, in a way that demonstrates why even for those resistant to sitting through another Holocaust drama, there ought to be room for a really good one. \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d premieres May 2 on Peacock.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/tattooist-of-auschwitz-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Barrymore adores animals. She said she wept the most writing her memoir \u201cWildflower\u201d when she shared a story about her beloved dog, Flossie, who lived to be almost 17. So, it made sense for Barrymore to partner with Ring for a new campaign announced Monday. \u201cRing Pet Portraits\u201d invites pet parents to join the company in raising funds for animal shelters in need by sharing their favorite pet videos and pictures. When people share a pet video or photo post on Instagram or TikTok using #RingPets through June 14, Ring will make a donation to support ASPCA\u00a0and local animal shelters across the US. Barrymore even filmed a commercial with her dog, Douglas, in support of the campaign (Jeremy, her bearded dragon, makes a cameo) in which she has to explain to her pup that she can\u2019t submit his photo because he\u2019s a \u201cnepo puppy.\u201d She recently lost her golden retriever, Lucy, a month ago, an experience Barrymore said \u201cwas so hard.\u201d \u201cThe whole show built like a memorial wall to her, which was so sweet. \u2018cause everyone in the building was so affected,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we all started in Covid, we weren\u2019t allowed to have guests or people. So, I would bring the dogs and they just made everything feel so much safer and cozier.\u201d Barrymore has been connected to animals almost since the beginning. She began her acting career as an infant and her first commercial was for a Purina puppy chow when she was a toddler. As a young adult she shared her home with cats and now as a 49 year-old mother of two young daughters her pets are a big part of the family. \u201cThere\u2019s just this like, unspoken relationship that you have this connection, this constant companion, this love that is just so profound,\u201d Barrymore said. \u201cMy dogs sleep in my bed with me and so do my cats and it makes me feel like a whole human being.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I won\u2019t sleep with my friends,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m weird about sharing a bed, but with my kids and animals, I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d She joked that she could have used a Ring camera on set as Lucy loved to wander around her daytime talk show. \u201cWe use cameras to watch babies.

I was legally allowed to do everything, but I didn\u2019t know s**t.\u201d That relationship was with singer/songwriter Perrie Edwards who was a member of the girl group Little Mix. Their romance coincided with Malik being a boyband member. His subsequent relationship with model Gigi Hadid \u2013 with whom he shares a young daughter \u2013 gained him even more attention. \u201cFrom 21 to 27, I was with Gi, and we had a kid, and\u00a0I didn\u2019t really take much time to get to know myself,\u201d Malik said in the Nylon interview. He made headlines in 2015 in when he left One Direction to go solo, and his upcoming project, \u201cRoom Under The Stairs,\u201d is stirring excitement. But his new album is the only way to connect with him, which may lead some more hopeful fans to disappointment, as he\u2019s not trying to meet people on dating apps for the time being. \u201cI\u2019m really content and happy with being single for the first time in my life,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/entertainment/zayn-malik-kicked-off-tinder/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_entertainment_star-wars-phantom-menace-turns-25", "text": "The teeth-gnashing aspects of \u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d have been chewed upon for a quarter century, from Watto to Anakin Skywalker\u2019s Midi-chlorian count (and miracle birth) to almost everyone\u2019s favorite punching bag, Jar Jar Binks. Yet as the movie that kicked off George Lucas\u2019 prequel trilogy hits theaters to commemorate its 25th anniversary for the de facto \u201cStar Wars\u201d holiday May the Fourth, let\u2019s accentuate the positive by identifying a half-dozen things the film, and the franchise\u2019s patriarch, got decidedly right. Each of these elements have echoed through \u201cStar Wars\u201d lore, and in most instances been put to better use elsewhere (in sequels, the various animated series overseen by Dave Filoni and the recent live-action ones, like \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\u201d) than they were in the original film. Think of them as creative building blocks, which overcame clunkier parts of the script and awkward performances to influence the rest of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d timeline. They\u2019re presented here in ascending order of significance: 6. The Emperor\u2019s long game. The idea that Palpatine/Darth Sidious (played by Ian McDiarmid) would spend years undermining the Republic from the inside got a bit wonky, but it created a fertile backdrop for how the Sith could outmaneuver the Jedi. 5. The digital effects. Admittedly, this was a bit of a mixed bag, since Lucas\u2019 emphasis on the visual components seemed to come at the expense of paying attention to the acting and performances, and in ways to overwhelm them. Yet he credibly moved the bar forward in terms of digital effects and design, which paid off in the scale of the action sequences. 4. Mace Windu. Samuel L. Jackson didn\u2019t have much to do in this first movie, but the Jedi master became a vital part of the mythology and had opportunities to demonstrate his power later (perhaps foremost in the animated \u201cThe Clone Wars\u201d), while padding the actor\u2019s formidable resume when it comes to appearing in blockbuster franchises. 3. Darth Maul. As played by Ray Park, the mostly silent Sith apprentice represents one of the most visually striking characters introduced over the course of the entire series \u2013 including that way-cool double-sided lightsaber \u2013 so much so that Filoni went to great lengths to revive him after what certainly appeared to be a glass-half-empty exit at the end of \u201cPhantom Menace.\u201d 2. Casting Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. Although Lucas tilted the plot toward Darth Vader\u2019s origin story, finding the young Obi-Wan Kenobi was a major challenge, and McGregor gave the first trilogy dramatic ballast even in its weaker moments, as did Neeson as his master. Those qualities were underscored by their brief reunion in the recent Disney+ series. 1. The lightsaber duels. In the original trilogy, lightsaber duels were essentially just basic sword fights, with a few acrobatic maneuvers and uses of telekinesis. The battle between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan \u2013 set to composer John Williams\u2019 evocative \u201cDuel of the Fates,\u201d one of his finest musical contributions in a long line of them \u2013 lifted that to dazzling heights, not only in the use of \u201cForce\u201d abilities as an organic form of fighting but through the choreography and physicality. (Give much credit for the latter to Park, who put his experience as a martial artist and stunt double to excellent use.) Every lightsaber fight since then \u2013 including the memorable image of Yoda energetically leaping around in \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d and \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d \u2013 has built upon the framework that sequence established. It\u2019s also likely a key reason why \u201cStar Wars\u201d has continued to flourish as parents pass it on to their kids. Not everything in \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d aged well, but that climactic duel is one of those scenes that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. \u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d will play in select theaters beginning May 3.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/entertainment/star-wars-phantom-menace-turns-25/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_entertainment_golden-bachelorette-joan-vassos", "text": "A longtime viewer of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d franchise and a true believer in the show\u2019s ability to help people find and meet their match, newly minted Golden Bachelorette Joan Vassos saw an ad seeking contestants for \u201cThe Golden Bachelor\u201d as a sign she should apply. \u201cI would love to say one of my kids did it and they thought it\u2019d be perfect, but I did it on my own,\u201d Vassos told CNN in her first interview, recalling when she filled out her application form for \u201cThe Golden Bachelor,\u201d which starred 72-year-old widower Gerry Turner, who dated more than 20 women on national TV \u2013 including Vassos. Vassos, a 61-year-old Maryland school administrator, remembers the night she applied for the show. Her husband of 32 years had passed away two years prior, and she had not yet been ready to date again. She was at a restaurant with a friend, and realized she wanted to put herself out there. \u201cI did not want to spend my life alone, so I knew that I had to take action, but my heart wasn\u2019t there at all,\u201d Vassos said. \u201cI was saying to my friend, \u2018How in the world do you date now? Look around this restaurant. Everybody here is a couple. Everybody my age is married. All my friends are married.\u201d When Vassos got home from dinner, she saw the casting call on TV for the new reality series about finding love in the second part of your life. \u201cI was like, \u2018The universe is talking to me,\u2019\u201d Vassos said. On \u201cThe Golden Bachelor,\u201d Vassos, who has four grown children and two grandchildren, was a fan-favorite who formed an early connection with Turner. But her time on the inaugural season was cut short when she made the decision to leave the show to return home to her family. Now, Vassos has been selected to star in the first season of \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette,\u201d a female-fronted spinoff that will feature Vassos dating men in their fifties through seventies. With nothing to lose and ready for love after healing from loss, Vassos told CNN about what she hopes to achieve on her televised journey when \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette\u201d premieres this fall on ABC. From life in \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d mansion to debunking ageist tropes \u2013 and her thoughts on Turner\u2019s three-month marriage and subsequent divorce \u2013 here are key takeaways from CNN\u2019s conversation with Vassos. The\u00a0women of \u201cThe Golden Bachelor\u201d formed a sisterhood \u201cI remember the first night I walked into the mansion, and I was really nervous because I didn\u2019t really know how Bachelor Nation was going to portray us \u2013 we\u2019re going to look like foolish older people dating \u2013 I was just a little apprehensive. I walked into this room and I met all these lovely women and it was the first time since my husband had passed away that I felt like I was in a room with people that were just like me. They were single women in their sixties and seventies, and we all were looking for love. It\u2019s not necessarily like a very dignified thing that you\u2019re doing at this age. It\u2019s kind of awkward honestly, so it was so comforting to be like \u2013 we were instant friends.\u201d Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist\u2019s split after a three-month marriage surprised Vassos \u201cI loved watching their journey. I saw them fall in love. I believed just, like \u2013 they did that. They were like the perfect couple. I applaud that they jumped into this process with both feet and they were ready to find love and they knew what true love was. They both had it in their previous lives. So, I applaud them for doing that and I also applaud them when they discovered it wasn\u2019t perfect. That they called it quits and it\u2019s not the end of the world, and we have to let them live their journey and follow their hearts and it wasn\u2019t right for them. I did not see it coming. They\u2019re still good friends. I\u2019m good friends with both of them.\u201d Her four kids all want her to find love. Making out on TV, not so much \u201cMy first and third children are very into this. They think it\u2019s really fun and like, what a cool experience for mom. My daughter Erica and my son Luke are a little, like a little cringey. Like, \u2018Don\u2019t kiss a guy on TV. This is gonna be really embarrassing. My friends are watching.\u2019 But overall, all of them want me to find love.\u201d She wants to redefine what it means to be in your sixties \u201cI think there\u2019s cultures in the world that revere the older people and they think that they have knowledge and they have this experience of life, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s super true in our society. So, I think (\u201cThe Golden Bachelor\u201d) showed the side of, we\u2019re not old. We don\u2019t have canes. Some people on the show had hearing aids, but nobody could even see they had them. Growing old now is very different. We were all very fit, we exercised, we shared great stories about raising our kids and we learned so much from each other. There\u2019s a lot of knowledge that we have inside of us because we\u2019ve lived life. In our culture, I feel like growing old is not a dignified thing. You\u2019re just supposed to kind of fade in the back, take a backseat to the next generation. I\u2019m hoping that we change that a little bit. We\u2019re still fun and energetic and we know how to use our phones.\u201d She will never move away from her family for a man \u201cThat was\u00a0actually the\u00a0first question that Gary asked me.\u00a0We sat down for the first time together and he said, \u2018You live in\u00a0Maryland,\u00a0I live in Indiana.\u00a0How do you see something like this working?\u2019 \u2026 My answer to him was \u2013 and it still is my answer \u2013 I think you almost\u00a0have to\u00a0live a dual life. I\u2019ll never leave my family.\u00a0They are the most\u00a0important people\u00a0in the world to me obviously, and I would expect that to be the same for the person that I end up with because  family is so important to me, that would have to be a key part of their personality. You have to be willing to \u2026 travel and be with that person and maybe spend a couple of months or a couple of weeks at a time \u2026 and then maybe eventually, you figure out a destination that would work for you and your families or have another house where everybody gets together.\u201d She wants ABC to greenlight \u201cGolden Bachelor in Paradise\u201d \u201cOh, my gosh.\u00a0I\u00a0want to be on it!\u00a0Hopefully,\u00a0I\u2019ll have a husband and not (be) eligible. I would love it.\u00a0And I know the women that I was on the season with would be so much fun on \u2018Bachelor In Paradise.\u2019 I think if it does happen that Susan (Noles) should be the bartender. She should step in. She\u2019s Wells (Adams), right? That\u2019d be great. But I think she\u2019s going to want to be on it as a contestant. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to work. Maybe I\u2019ll be the Wells! I\u2019ve got to take a bartending lesson.\u201d She\u2019s hoping to find her life partner on \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette\u201d \u2013 but isn\u2019t rushing into marriage \u201cIf it ends up in engagement, I\u2019m open to that.\u00a0I do believe this process works.\u00a0I\u2019ve seen it work for so many couples on \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 so\u00a0I believe in the process. If\u00a0it ends up in engagement, that\u2019s great. If\u00a0it ends up in, you and I are\u00a0going to\u00a0get to know each other better in the outside world, that\u2019s perfect also.\u00a0I probably won\u2019t rush into a marriage right away \u2013\u00a0and not only because of what happened with Gerry and Theresa. I think it takes some time to really get to know somebody. Out\u00a0in the wild, in the real world, you need to spend some time there.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/entertainment/golden-bachelorette-joan-vassos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_entertainment_ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes", "text": "Audiences will be forgiven if they forget that Ilana Glazer and Michelle Buteau are actually playing roles in their new film \u201cBabes.\u201d The raunchy comedy about a pair of childhood friends who navigate two life-changing pregnancies is right in the wheelhouse for the actors, who have known each other since they were up-and-coming comics and have now both become moms in real life. So is it easier or harder playing roles that might in some ways mimic their real lives? Turns out, it\u2019s both. \u201cI would say easier,\u201d Glazer, of \u201cBroad City\u201d fame, told CNN. \u201cSo much easier.\u201d \u201cEasier to play, easier to understand how tired, how confused, how frustrated, how grateful you are to pump and dump (breastmilk), to have a shot (of alcohol) when you\u2019re off the clock,\u201d Buteau chimed in. \u201cAnd also harder because then you\u2019re away from your kids.\u201d The film \u2013 which is being compared to \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and marketed as \u201ca hilarious and heartfelt comedy about the bonds of friendship and the messy, unpredictable challenges of adulthood and becoming a parent\u201d \u2013 was written by Glazer and actor/producer Josh Rabinowitz, who also worked with her on her famed \u201cBroad City\u201d series. That series, which ran from 2014 to 2019, has a cult following, as does Buteau\u2019s recently renewed Netflix series \u201cSurvival of the Thickest\u201d based on her book of essays of the same title. Suffice it to say with two such funny performers working together, not to mention the other cast members including Hasan Minhaj, Oliver Platt and John Carroll Lynch, it was a rollicking good time on the \u201cBabes\u201d set. \u201cWe were cracking up, like crying,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cMy co-writer Josh Rabinowitz famously during the plumber scene laughed so hard he smacked his head on his chair. He like injured his forehead, we were laughing so hard.\u201d Shooting in 25 days, with Buteau only being available to film for 15, heightened both the tension and the hilarity, they said, and Glazer confirmed that some of the best of those funny moments are being put together as extras for streaming. Director Pamela Adlon, best known for her starring role on acclaimed series \u201cBetter Things,\u201d said it was challenging getting the project done in such a short period of time. Yet the timing couldn\u2019t have been better given that she had just wrapped the final season of her show. Plus, the script really spoke to her, she told CNN. \u201cI read it and it was emotional besides all the comedy. And there was an edginess to it,\u201d Adlon said. \u201cAll those things have to go together for me to really respond to something. I gotta have the dark, I gotta have the funny, I gotta have the heart. It\u2019s gotta hit you in the gut to make you feel, make you cry, but then you gotta have a little light.\u201d Glazer should be proud to know that, as she said she, Rabinowitz and their producer Susie Fox worked really hard to mine their own life experiences as parents to craft a relatable script. \u201cIt was really important for us to have something so funny, but to balance it with heart and emotional heft,\u201d she said. \u201cThose were our guideposts.\u201d \u201cBabes\u201d is in theaters Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/entertainment/ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_06_entertainment_kendrick-lamar-drake-explainer", "text": "Two of hip-hop\u2019s biggest stars have beef and people are taking sides. Kendrick Lamar and Drake have been engaged in a lyrical battle in recent weeks that escalated over the weekend. The two artists each released songs about the other, in one case with Lamar not even waiting a full hour before he dropped a track in response to one of Drake\u2019s. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the verses that have been a hot topic of cultural conversation. Early collaborations There is plenty we don\u2019t know in terms of why there is apparent animosity between the two superstar rappers, but we do know that there is history. Back in 2011, Lamar appeared on Drake\u2019s second album \u201cTake Care\u201d on \u201cBuried Alive Interlude.\u201d It was the same year Lamar released his debut studio album \u201cSection.80.\u201d The two men were both carving a place for themselves in the industry at the time, with Drake then best known as an actor for his role as student Jimmy Brooks in the Canadian teen TV series, \u201cDegrassi.\u201d The pair would go on to tour together and collaborate on the track \u201cPoetic Justice\u201d on Lamar\u2019s sophomore studio album, \u201cGood Kid, M.A.A.D. City.\u201d \u201cKing of New York\u201d tries to take \u201cControl\u201d As one of hip-hop\u2019s rising stars, Lamar leaned into his growing success with the swagger one would expect in the rap game during a guest appearance on Big Sean\u2019s 2013 single, \u201cControl.\u201d Multiple artists are name-checked in the song, including Drake. The lyrics include, \u201cI got love for you all but I\u2019m tryna murder you,\u201d a euphemism for besting them professionally. Lamar proclaims himself both \u201cKing of New York\u201d and \u201cKing of the Coast.\u201d Drake told Billboard of the verse, \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anything to say about it.\u201d \u201cIt just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That\u2019s all it was,\u201d Drake said at the time. \u201cI know good and well that Kendrick\u2019s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic.\u201d An \u2018Infinity War\u2019 of rappers The pair have continued to take shots at each other on tracks over the years, but this latest skirmish appears to have begun in October 2023, when rapper J. Cole collaborated with Drake on the song, \u201cFirst Person Shooter.\u201d On the track, Cole refers to himself, Lamar and Drake as the \u201cBig three\u201d in rap. Drake likened his own popularity in the game to the stardom of the late singer Michael Jackson. Lamar seemingly took exception to the comparisons and hit back on a collaborative track with Future and Metro Boomin that caught fire in March 2024, titled \u201cLike That.\u201d Lamar makes clear on the song that there is no \u201cBig three\u201d just \u201cBig me.\u201d He casts himself as Prince to Drake\u2019s Jackson, noting that the former outlived the latter. \u201cLike That\u201d is a cut on the album \u201cWe Don\u2019t Trust You,\u201d which many believe is filled with disses aimed at Drake. The apparent jabs surprised some listeners as Drake and Future have been longtime collaborators. Things got even more heated when Future and Metro Boomin released the followup \u201cWe Still Don\u2019t Trust You,\u201d which Billboard magazine declared is \u201cfilled with Drake disses, not only from Future, but from The Weeknd and A$AP Rocky as well.\u201d With so many coming after the Canadian rapper lyrically, it started feeling like Marvel Infinity War of hip-hop superheroes battling it out. The man who helped kick it all off, J. Cole, quickly exited the battle. Cole released \u201c7 Minute Drill\u201d on a surprise project \u201cMight Delete Later\u201d in which he came after Lamar, only to later declare the song lame. He removed it from streaming services, publicly apologized and has gone quiet since. Drake pushes back Last month, Drake dropped the diss track \u201cPush Ups\u201d in which he poked fun at Lamar\u2019s shoe size to his past collaborations with pop stars. \u201cMaroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\u201d Drake raps, appearing to mock Lamar\u2019s work with Maroon 5 on their song \u201cDon\u2019t Wanna Know\u201d and with Swift on her song \u201cBad Blood.\u201d Drake also took a swipe at Rick Ross, who was featured on \u201cWe Don\u2019t Trust You.\u201d Ross then began a social media war of words with Drake, which included accusing Drake of having undergone plastic surgery. K.Dot\u2019s onslaught Lamar, known also as K.Dot, responded with multiple volleys. First there was \u201cEuphoria,\u201d which is now as famous for the insults lobbed at Drake as it is for making the general public aware that the rapper was also an executive producer on the hit HBO drama. (HBO is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company.) Within days, Lamar followed that with \u201c6:16 in LA,\u201d which many interpreted to be making fun of Drake\u2019s penchant for titling songs with times and locations. Drake gets personal with \u201cFamily Matters\u201d Things got increasingly personally in this rap battle on Saturday, when Drake dropped the eight-minute diss track, \u201cFamily Matters.\u201d He makes allegations about abuse and infidelity involving Lamar and his fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Alford, on the song. Don\u2019t mess with a Pulitzer Prize winner Lest we forget that Lamar made history in 2018 by becoming the first rapper to win a prestigious Pulitzer Prize for his album \u201cDAMN,\u201d he didn\u2019t even let an hour go by after the release of \u201cFamily Matters\u201d to drop a response, titled \u201cMeet The Grahams.\u201d (Drake\u2019s legal name is Aubrey Graham.) The song gets heavy as Lamar addresses Drake\u2019s parents and Drake\u2019s parenting, accusing him of have a secret daughter. Lamar followed that within hours with another song, titled \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d in which accuses Drake of being attracted to underage girls. Drake responds Drake again had his say on Sunday with \u201cThe Heart Part 6.\u201d On this song, Drake claims he\u2019s the one who fed Lamar fake information about a secret child. \u201cWe plotted for a week and then we fed you the information/A daughter that\u2019s 11 years old, I bet he takes it,\u201d Drake raps.

Far from a passion project, this Netflix film distinctly feels \u2013 as one of its writers says in the production notes \u2013 like a punchline in search of a movie, built on a soggy parade of sugary cameos that doesn\u2019t provide much snap, crackle and pop. Charitably, \u201cUnfrosted\u201d serves as a disjointed send-up of the 1960s, using a war between cereal companies \u2013 and the idea that for kids watching TV during those years, \u201cBattle Creek, Michigan\u201d seemed like a magical place \u2013 as its backbone. In that sense the ostensible plot, involving a race to develop what became the Pop-Tart, is really more a point of entry than a true recipe. Sharing script credit with a trio of writers (two of them \u201cSeinfeld\u201d alums, as well as collaborators on the animated \u201cBee Movie\u201d), Seinfeld more than anything seems to have wanted to make a modern-day Marx Brothers movie, where the gags fly fast and furious. That includes plenty of lines made funny by hindsight, like someone reading a newspaper in the early \u201860s and saying, \u201cVietnam, now that seems like a good idea.\u201d The problem is mastering that sort of tone is a lot harder than Groucho and company made it look. Sneaking in a bunch of old-movie references (\u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d among them), or jokes about John F. Kennedy (Bill Burr) being a philanderer, might provoke a chuckle or two in Seinfeld\u2019s demo, but the free-associating, madcap pacing feels like overkill in a way that gets old awfully fast. A fictionalized story with a tiny grain of truth, \u201cUnfrosted\u201d focuses on Seinfeld\u2019s Bob Cabana, an executive at Kellogg\u2019s who is horrified to discover that rival Post, and its scheming chief executive Marjorie Post (Amy Schumer), might be on the verge of marketing a breakfast pastry that could revolutionize the business. Determined to level the playing field, Bob enlists a former colleague (Melissa McCarthy) to join the effort to thwart Post, as the two embark on what amounts to a pop-culture tour of the 1960s. While some of those digressions are clever, most come across as arbitrary and odd, veering off course to include gags about everything from the space program to fitness guru Jack LaLanne. Of all the casting surprises, one stands head and shoulders above the rest (you\u2019ll know it when you see it), but that moment mainly highlights what \u201cUnfrosted\u201d could have been had the movie been able to sustain that. While it\u2019s possible to get into the nostalgic spirit, the question Seinfeld doesn\u2019t bother trying to address is \u201cWhy?,\u201d or at least, why now? Perhaps curiosity about the whole directing thing simply got the better of him, but it\u2019s a self-indulgent exercise, informed by a sense that Netflix would have said \u201cyes\u201d to anything he pitched them. (Seinfeld does include one sweet wrinkle, naming a character \u201cRick Ludwin\u201d after the late NBC executive who ordered \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d) In promoting the film, Seinfeld recently lamented the current state of TV comedy, so it\u2019s not surprising he\u2019d be drawn to the past. Still, while \u201cUnfrosted\u201d isn\u2019t wholly unfunny (or at least, not consistently so) it is, more than anything, just plain unnecessary. \u201cUnfrosted\u201d premieres May 3 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/entertainment/unfrosted-review-jerry-seinfeld/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The show, which Seymour also executive produces, has humor as well as mystery and it\u2019s a natural fit for the \u201cDr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\u201d actor, who says many didn\u2019t realize she could do comedy until her breakout role in the 2005 film \u201cWedding Crashers.\u201d \u201cEveryone was shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t believe I could be funny and so I did a ton of comedy after that. And actually comedy, really good comedy in my opinion, is grounded.\u201d That\u2019s one of the things that attracted Seymour to the role of Harry, because she \u201cloved the idea of playing a very independent woman who doesn\u2019t need to get married, does drink too much red wine and changes career paths in her seventies.\u201d It\u2019s the same type of fearlessness Seymour displays in real life, and she believes the full life she lives helps make her a better performer. \u201cI have children, I have grandchildren, I do other things. I paint, I design, I do philanthropy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never sort of sat by the phone hoping it would ring. I\u2019m always creating something, or if somebody offers me something that\u2019s wacky and a tiny little thing I\u2019ll do it. There\u2019s no too small a role.\u201d And there\u2019s no role too emotional for Seymour either. She plays a grandmother with dementia in both the new film \u201cRuby\u2019s Choice\u201d and a forthcoming short film titled \u201cAnd You Are?\u201d She knows about the disease having been good friends with singer Glen Campbell whose journey with Alzheimer\u2019s was the focus of the CNN documentary \u201cGlen Campbell I\u2019ll Be Me,\u201d a project she was passionate about that was directed by her now ex-husband James Keach. These days Seymour has found love with her boyfriend John Zambetti, who is a doctor and a musician. She chuckles when she recounts how she famously played a physician on \u201cDr. Quinn,\u201d a role Zambetti wasn\u2019t familiar with before they started dating, but now loves. \u201cWhen he met me and decided he wanted to go out with me, he barely remembered seeing [the James Bond film she starred in] \u2018Live and Let Die\u2019 and watched it again,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d never seen or heard of anything like \u2018Dr. Quinn\u2019 or anything and he\u2019s a doctor, so you\u2019d think he would\u2019ve known.

{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review", "text": "Seven years after a trilogy that ended with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d didn\u2019t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it\u2019s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity \u2013 the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren \u2013 the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What\u2019s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) \u2013 an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom \u2013 attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (\u201cThe Witcher\u2019s\u201d Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing \u201cThe Planet of the Apes\u201d but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run. Hollywood blockbusters aren\u2019t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these \u201cApes\u201d prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don\u2019t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it\u2019s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d premieres May 10 in US theaters.

During the show, which was hosted by comedian Kevin Hart and livestreamed on Netflix on May 5, Brady was roasted about his divorce from Brazilian supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, his appearance, his two retirements,\u00a0\u201cDeflategate\u201d\u00a0and his\u00a0FTX investment, among many other sore topics. Speaking on an episode of \u201cThe Pivot Podcast\u201d with Fred Taylor, Ryan Clark and Channing Crowder, released Tuesday, Brady said the jokes about his divorce had not gone down well with his family. \u201cI loved when the jokes were about me. I thought they were so fun,\u2019 he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way that it affected my kids.\u201d Brady and B\u00fcndchen\u2019s divorce provided a lot of roast-fodder throughout the night, with Brady frequently shown sipping his drink when it was mentioned. The former couple, who have two children together \u2013 Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11 \u2013 jointly\u00a0announced\u00a0in October 2022 they were parting ways. Brady said he had a moment of realization that the roast hadn\u2019t turned out the way he thought it would. \u201cIt was the bittersweet aspect of when you\u2019re doing something you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize I wouldn\u2019t do that again because of the way it affected actually the people I care about the most in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you\u2019re na\u00efve,\u201d added Brady. \u201cIt\u2019s a good lesson for me as a parent, I\u2019m gonna be a better parent as I go forward because of it.\u201d Brady had a remarkable 23-year career as the NFL\u2019s leading quarterback, winning seven Super Bowl rings \u2013 six with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He is also a five-time Super Bowl MVP and won three NFL MVP awards. He first announced his retirement in February 2022. He ended up reversing his decision and returned to the field for one more season with the Bucs before officially retiring last year. At the end of the roast, Brady finally had the chance to defend himself, saying people had asked him why he agreed to do the event. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI can take all the hits.

{"id": "2024_05_10_entertainment_interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review", "text": "After a dazzling first season, \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d moves in a lower-key mode through its second, a perhaps inevitable byproduct of Lestat\u2019s diminished role. Yet this AMC adaptation of Anne Rice\u2019s books remains a tasty trip through history and geography, having changed venues from New Orleans to Europe and the \u201cOld World Vampires\u201d on the prowl there. Although the logistics of an ageless vampire child weren\u2019t cited as the cause, the new season brings one major change, with Delainey Hayles sliding seamlessly into the role of Claudia (replacing Bailey Bass). Trapped forever in her youthful form, she accompanies Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) on his travels, and often drives the narrative with her desire for community. As for Lestat (Sam Reid), the conclusion of Season 1 largely confines his appearances to what\u2019s going on in Louis\u2019 head and flashbacks, though the nature of the show makes that a more effortless process than most. Indeed, despite the challenging task of turning Rice\u2019s books into an open-ended series, the framing device \u2013 as Louis and Armand (Assad Zaman) walk their human interviewer, Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian), through their bloody past \u2013 provides an opportunity to take off in all sorts of interesting directions and digressions. There\u2019s also some new blood (heh heh), as Claudia falls in with the Theatre des Vampires, whose leading man Santiago (Ben Daniels) brings an additional sense of menace as well as theatricality to the proceedings. A separate strand also beefs up Molloy\u2019s thread and backstory, including details about his earlier life that inform the perilous line he\u2019s walking in becoming Louis\u2019 skeptical biographer, with good reason to question what details his immortal subjects might be conspicuously omitting. Through the six episodes previewed, the story proceeds at a languid, almost dream-like pace, and while there\u2019s perhaps a little too much vampire theater, its contours remain engrossing in ways the 1994 movie wasn\u2019t, despite the starry pairing of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Thirty years have passed since then, but the series has still managed the difficult feat of putting its own distinctive stamp on the source material and justifying the vote of confidence AMC gave it by ordering a second season ahead of the first\u2019s debut. While vampires might have seemed like a no-brainer next step after AMC\u2019s long reliance on zombies, this version of \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d has found the right resting place, and the creative team has sunk its teeth into a concept that, against the odds, appears to be aging remarkably well. \u201cAnne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u201d begins its second season May 12 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC and AMC+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling", "text": "Superhero movies have seen better days at the box office, but an action-comedy based on a 1980s TV show still feels like an unlikely candidate to kick off the summer. Buoyed by the lure of what Ryan Gosling can do for a post-\u201cBarbie\u201d encore (or Ken-core), \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d is too flat in the early going to fully meet that challenge, rallying toward the end without reaching the heights required to make a really big splash. At its best, director David Leitch (\u201cDeadpool 2\u201d) has served up a movie defined by its love for the movies, and specifically, the stunt work where he cut his professional teeth before shifting into the big chair. In that sense, the TV series that starred Lee Majors (a show most memorable for its theme song, which is featured) creates a very loose template to set up a vehicle about a stuntman whose troubles spill off the screen into real life, forcing him to put his skills to use dealing with real bad guys. Getting there requires some buildup, with Gosling\u2019s Colt Seavers introduced serving as the stunt double for a typically self-absorbed star, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), while becoming involved with Jody (Emily Blunt), a fellow member of the crew. An accident derails Colt\u2019s plans and indeed life, and time passes before he\u2019s called out of retirement by Gail (\u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham), the fast-talking, troubleshooting producer on all of Ryder\u2019s films. Of course, he\u2019d probably stay safely at home if the space epic in question didn\u2019t mark Jody\u2019s directing debut, offering the prospect of a reunion that, naturally, doesn\u2019t go as smoothly as he hoped. There are also hidden reasons for the renewed interest in Colt, which has to do with offscreen shenanigans and Ryder becoming involved with some nefarious characters. That forces Colt into what amounts to private-eye mode, using his movie-trained skills to get himself both into and out of perilous situations. Setting all that up, including the romance, results in some arid stretches between the elaborate stunts, which are ultimately the main source of \u201cThe Fall Guy\u2019s\u201d appeal and certainly its comedy. Gosling imbues Colt with a goofy charm and amusing neediness, but the underlying premise was a trifle strained even back in the Reagan era, and putting the whole thing on steroids for the movies doesn\u2019t completely address those issues. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d thus stands out primarily for smaller moments and wrinkles, such as Colt\u2019s boss (Winston Duke) constantly quoting movie lines to him, Taylor-Johnson sounding a whole lot like Matthew McConaughey, and a stunt dog trained to respond to French, including an especially juvenile command. Perhaps foremost, \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d feels burdened by the weight of expectations and its positioning as a major blockbuster when the movie really operates as a light-hearted ode to the unknown stuntman, in a way that\u2019s basically just amiably OK. Gosling has broad shoulders, but trying to make it anything more than that is, even for him, a heavy lift. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d premieres May 3 in US theaters.

Seduction and sex are again at the heart of this film from \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d director Luca Guadagnino, who also throws in twists of fate, paths not taken and \u2013 in the case of the central character played by Zendaya \u2013 a burning desire to win and exercise control over those around her, exploring how that elite-athlete mentality bleeds into her personal life. The framing device is a singles match between Art (\u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d Mike Faist), a decorated superstar who might be nearing the end, at least in his mind, of his tournament-winning career; and Patrick (\u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Josh O\u2019Connor), who arrives at the off-the-beaten-track tournament where they end up facing off in a run-down car that, his finances being what they are, doubles as his hotel room. Flashing back 13 years, we discover that the two were bosom pals as junior tennis players when they first set their eyes \u2013 springing out of their heads almost cartoon-like \u2013 on Tashi (Zendaya), a rising star whose game provokes as much lust from them as her striking looks. Back in the present, Tashi is Art\u2019s wife and coach, having lost her own career to a devastating knee injury. Yet it\u2019s pretty obvious that she\u2019s living through him \u2013 he addresses the point overtly, saying, \u201cI\u2019m playing for both of us\u201d \u2013 which only makes how she wound up with him, as well as the outcome of Art and Patrick\u2019s (very) protracted match, more intriguing. While sexual tension plays a central role in the movie (and certainly the marketing of it), \u201cChallengers\u201d is as much about blurring the lines between sex and the seductive power of big-time sports, with winning and success as the ultimate aphrodisiac. Add to that the two boys/men being pretty transparent about what they want, Tashi remains a source of mystery, in part because of the unscheduled detour her career has been forced to take. After his fine young cannibals romance \u201cBones and All,\u201d Guadagnino, working from a script by playwright Justin Kuritzkes, occupies more conventional and commercial territory here, while doing all he can to sex up how he films the tennis sequences. Despite the zooming angles and whizzing balls, there\u2019s no escaping the sheer abundance of those scenes, especially for anyone who has never sat through an entire US Open or Wimbledon final. Even using the sport as a metaphor, \u201cChallengers\u201d might become a bit of a challenge for those who show up eager to see the principals sweat for different reasons. Because she\u2019s playing more complicated angles, Zendaya\u2019s Tashi is the most interesting character as well as a source of frustration. Then again, the details regarding all three of the key figures stay somewhat vague thanks in part to the structure, though all are prone to the occasional racket-mangling tantrum. While the build-up proves effective, the payoff simply feels too precious, in a way that\u2019s particularly unsatisfying. That misstep doesn\u2019t invalidate sitting through this otherwise neatly choreographed match, but in tennis terms, it\u2019s the kind of unforced error that prevents Guadagnino\u2019s latest film from ranking as an unqualified winner. \u201cChallengers\u201d premieres April 26 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/25/entertainment/challengers-review-zendaya/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The \u201cSNL\u201d alum, who hosted for the third time on Saturday, came out to greet the audience after a delightful cold open during which the cast welcomed their real-life mothers onto the stage to tell jokes in honor of Mother\u2019s Day.

Part business meltdown, part crime mystery, part media critique, and part \u201ctales of Ashley Madison,\u201d it\u2019s a look at the married-people hookup site that\u2019s plenty salacious and definitely not monotonous. Founded on the theory that a surprising number of married people were signing up for dating sites, Ashley Madison (taken from two popular girl names) began with the slogan \u201cWhen monogamy becomes monotony\u201d before its evolution under CEO Noel Biderman to the more in-your-face line, \u201cLife is short. Have an affair.\u201d Yet while the company enjoyed explosive subscriber growth, and Biderman became media catnip by making the rounds subjecting himself to the righteous indignation of (mostly outraged) TV interviewers, the dirty secret was that Ashley Madison hadn\u2019t taken the promised steps to protect its data, leaving itself vulnerable to a 2015 hack that exposed thousands of clients. \u201cIt was like gambling with people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Evan Back, a sales executive and strategist who is one of the former employees interviewed. In one respect, director Toby Paton approaches the new docuseries in a manner that\u2019s very much of a piece with the daytime-TV mentality Biderman successfully exploited at the time from a marketing standpoint, working off the theory that there was no such thing as bad publicity for a site offering the prospect of adulterous hookups made easy. \u201cAshley Madison\u201d thus spends a lot of time chronicling a few specific soap-opera-worthy tales of lives that were upended when the hacked information went public, such as the fallout for Sam Rader, a Dallas area Christian vlogger who had secretly signed up, and his wife, Nia. At the same time, the docuseries both builds a kind of strange suspense toward the hack, on multiple levels, while providing a pointed media dissection of the voyeurism, with a touch of schadenfreude often masquerading as journalism that made this story so irresistible. As the cherry on top, Paton also devotes a portion of the series to the investigation into the hackers, self-identified as The Impact Team, which didn\u2019t behave like most corporate hackers in the way it presented its demands, leaving lingering questions and speculation regarding its motives. Put all that together, and \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\u201d lives up \u2013 or perhaps better, down \u2013 to its name. Like the ad said, life is short when it comes to committing to another docuseries. Still, people will no doubt be willing to take the leap for a story with such delicious \u201cThere but for the grace of God\u2026\u201d overtones. \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\u201d premieres May 15 in Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/entertainment/ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Nicely played by the leads, this tale of a 40-year-old woman swept off her feet by a 20-something boy-band star amounts to playing the genre\u2019s hits while following all the same old steps. Destined for Amazon, it\u2019s a competent date-night or gals\u2019-night movie for those who don\u2019t want to leave the house \u2013 Chardonnay optional, but recommended \u2013 which makes practical sense, landing as it does in a middle ground that has struggled at the box office. Cheated on and left by her husband, Sol\u00e9ne (Hathaway) is a successful art-gallery owner who gets roped at the last-minute into squiring her teenage daughter and the kid\u2019s friends to Coachella, where her ex has purchased a meet-and-greet experience with the members of August Moon, whose following might lean more toward the tween crowd. A reluctant attendee, Sol\u00e9ne has the ultimate meet-cute moment with band member Hayes (Galitzine, of \u201cMary & George\u201d and \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d renown), stumbling into his trailer thinking it\u2019s the restroom. After some awkward banter and obvious chemistry \u2013 which with the benefit of hindsight is about as good as the movie gets \u2013 Hayes shows up unexpectedly (by her, that is) at Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s gallery, telling her shyly, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t meet people like you very often.\u201d For a pop star, he\u2019s an endearingly sensitive soul, which doesn\u2019t do much to quell her reticence, due both to their age gap and his fame. Romance and complications ensue, with writer-director Michael Showalter (\u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and \u201cSpoiler Alert,\u201d sharing script credit with Jennifer Westfeldt) adapting Robinne Lee\u2019s novel in part by relying on the customary montages to handle some of the heavy lifting. If only the garnishes were a little less tired, including the prying paparazzi and Reid Scott as Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s no-right-to-be-bent-out-of-shape ex. All that really leaves, then, is the interplay between Hathaway and Galitzine, with the latter (starring in his second Amazon movie in a year\u2019s time about a romance complicated by fame) performing double duty on the songs. The problem is however well they might work in terms of rooting for them as a couple, it\u2019s hard to avoid the very real issue that the world he inhabits and indeed people in general can be pretty lousy. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d will likely be most satisfying for those who choose not to sweat the details, enjoying the scenery and fantasy wrapped up in it. Think of it as one of those movies that really reinforces the adage there are no new ideas, just fresh versions of old ones set to different beats. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d premieres May 2 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.

{"id": "2024_05_15_entertainment_wicked-trailer-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo", "text": "\u201cAre people born wicked?\u201d It certainly seems like Glinda \u2013 as played by Ariana Grande \u2013 might be in the latest trailer for the movie spectacle based on the Broadway musical (which, in turn, is based on the bestselling book by Gregory Maguire). At first glance, the trailer released on Wednesday is a glorious dance of color and a symphony of two of the most revered musical voices in the business, that of Grande and Oscar-nominee and Tony-winner Cynthia Erivo. Watch the preview again, however, and you notice the nuanced performances, with Grande\u2019s Glinda seeming to be a bit pricklier than the Glindas we\u2019ve seen on stage portrayed by actors like the bubbly Kristin Chenoweth \u2013 who originated the role on Broadway. Assigned to be roommates, Glinda brings her new green friend Elphaba (Erivo) to her pink-drenched room in the trailer. The clip even highlights a particularly salty moment when Glinda quips that she would give away a decidedly ugly hat \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t \u201chate anybody that much\u201d \u2013 subsequently entrusting it to Elphaba. It\u2019s just one of the moments that suggest a bit more mean girl energy than simply \u201cpopular\u201d energy from the Good Witch of the North. Later on in the trailer, Elphaba\u2019s notably strong powers are exposed, much to Glinda\u2019s chagrin, leading headmistress Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) to take notice and tell Elphaba, \u201cYou\u2019re the one the Wizard has been waiting for.\u201d Elphaba brings Glinda along when she is summoned to the Emerald City to meet the powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum), and it is here that they both begin to realize that, as Elphaba says, \u201cSomething bad is happening in Oz.\u201d \u201cThe best way to bring folks together is to give them a real good enemy,\u201d the Wizard says, in a nod to some of the more political tones that suggest director Jon M. Chu\u2019s cinematic retelling (over two parts) of a notoriously digestible Broadway musical will, perhaps, not shy away from highlighting the darker themes explored in the book. Examples of that come in shots of disturbing propaganda imagery painting Elphaba as somebody to fear, including a large, scary banner of Elphaba draped over a building and a giant wooden effigy of her set on fire in the town square. As the \u201cWicked\u201d story goes, Glinda eventually does establish a sisterly bond with Elphaba, and that becomes clear in the trailer. But it\u2019s Elphaba\u2019s character arc that is the most compelling when Erivo\u2019s chilling rendition of \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d rings out at the end of the preview. As Elphaba takes flight on her broomstick, she says, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Wizard,\u201d she continues, \u201cwho should be afraid of me.\u201d The hotly anticipated two-part \u201cWicked\u201d movie is a cinematic adaptation of the famed Broadway musical, which is a prequel to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d It tells an alternate version of events in Oz before Dorothy\u2019s arrival, exploring how Glinda and Elphaba\u2019s \u201cunlikely but profound friendship\u201d evolves as their lives take different paths, according to an official synopsis. \u201cTheir extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d the synopsis reads.

As the young Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) prepared to head off to college, he and his family learned that his father (Lance Barber) has died of a heart attack, the aftermath of which will be addressed in the two-part series finale on May 16. The moment seemed particularly cruel, inasmuch as the father, George Sr., had just been offered a long-sought opportunity to move up from coaching high school football into the college ranks, receiving an offer from Rice in Houston. \u201cWe always knew that there were a couple big moments that happened in Sheldon\u2019s life, his father passes away and he goes to Caltech,\u201d executive producer Steve Holland told CNN, adding that the decision was made to have that happen now \u2013 as opposed to during the final two episodes \u2013 so the characters could deal with its aftermath in the finale. According to Holland, series co-creator Chuck Lorre suggested that schedule of events, saying that after seven seasons of comedy (allowing for the occasional poignant moment), \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t want to leave the audience wallowing in grief at the end.\u201d The elder Sheldon (Jim Parsons) had referenced his father\u2019s death, and when it happened, during \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d although with the benefit of hindsight he wasn\u2019t always the most reliable narrator regarding his father and his perceived shortcomings \u2013 at least, based on how they played out in the second series. Although \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d is wrapping up, CBS viewers haven\u2019t seen the last of the Coopers: the network has ordered another spinoff, featuring the characters of Georgie (Montana Jordan) and Mandy (Emily Osment) for the 2024-25 TV season \u2013 \u201cGeorgie & Mandy\u2019s First Marriage\u201d \u2013 which merely adds to the needle-threading act performed by the producers. Still, any concerns about setting up what comes next didn\u2019t play into the \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d ending, Holland said, noting, \u201cWe were really just focused on ending this show as strong as we could.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/young-sheldon-episode-12-shock/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
