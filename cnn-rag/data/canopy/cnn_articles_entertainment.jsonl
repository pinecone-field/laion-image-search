During a recent interview with Howard Stern, the actor addressed chatter he\u2019s dating singer Jewel. \u201cJewel and I are friends. We\u2019ve never gone out ever,\u201d Costner said. \u201cShe\u2019s special, and I don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want these rumors to ruin our friendship because that\u2019s what we have. She\u2019s special to me. She\u2019s beautiful enough to go out with.\u201d Costner, who is promoting his new film \u201cHorizon: An American Saga,\u201d explained that the speculation started after he, Jewel, Emma Watson and seven other people \u201cwho weren\u2019t celebrities\u201d were invited by mogul Richard Branson to visit his Necker Island. Costner said he had \u201ctremendous conversations\u201d with her and Watson. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with [Jewel] text wise, and she\u2019s so smart, and she\u2019s been through a lot herself, and so we have a friendship,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a romance, and we\u2019ve not dated.\u201d Not that he doesn\u2019t find her attractive. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful and smart enough for all those things. It just has never happened for us,\u201d Costner said. \u201cShe\u2019s everything you might think, but it just hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d As for his other loves, he counts \u201cYellowstone\u201d among them. After Stern said he is a fan of the popular Paramount series Costner starred in for five years, the actor said he loves it too.

According to police, the singer was observed around 12:37 a.m. Tuesday morning \u201coperating his vehicle in an intoxicated condition,\u201d in Sag Harbor, New York. Timberlake was driving a 2025 BMW when he allegedly failed to stop at a stop sign and failed to maintain in his lane of travel, a statement from Sag Harbor Police reads. An officer initiated a traffic stop, Timberlake told police he \u201chad one martini and I followed my friends home,\u201d according to court records. Timberlake\u2019s eyes were \u201cbloodshot and glassy\u201c and there was a \u201cstrong odor of an alcoholic beverage\u201d emanating from his breath, its alleged in court records. A Sag Harbor Village Police Department officer described him as \u201cunable to divide attention,\u201d adding \u201che had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests.\u201d Timberlake also rejected a chemical test three times, the first time saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not doing a chemical test.\u201d The report contains details of his field sobriety tests. He was placed under arrest and held overnight for arraignment, according to police. He was also cited for running the stop sign and failure to keep in his lane, his attorney Ed Burke told CNN. Timberlake was released without bail. His next court appearance is scheduled\u00a0for\u00a0July\u00a026, the Suffolk\u00a0County district attorney\u2019s office told CNN. The appearance is expected to be virtual. Sag Harbor is a village located in the Hamptons on eastern Long Island.

Timberlake is currently on tour with his most recent album,\u00a0\u201cEverything I Thought It Was.\u201d He is next scheduled to perform in Chicago at the United Center on Friday.

The result has that calculated, tired feel about it, with a few moments of kinetic action but not enough to make the film play like anything more than a relic. On the plus side, Smith and Martin Lawrence, now in their 50s, still credibly pull off their characters, although frankly, the most memorable action scene \u2013 so good it seems to have parachuted in from another movie \u2013 doesn\u2019t involve them. Everything else about this reunion, including their old-married-couple squabbling and the various callbacks to previous films, has a perhaps inevitably stale quality, from the strains of the familiar song to the bikini-clad background actors the camera scans by to reflect the Miami locale. \u201cBad Boys\u201d begins with Smith\u2019s Mike settling down and Lawrence\u2019s Marcus experiencing a near-death scare that changes his outlook \u2013 a comedic flourish that, like almost everything else, proves underdeveloped. The latest threat, meanwhile, comes by way of a case their late captain (Joe Pantoliano) had investigated involving drug cartels and a ruthless killer (Eric Dane, here portraying the kind of stock villain that might as well be called McBaddie), exposing a web of corruption that forces Mike to reconnect with his son Armando (Jacob Scipio) and the buddy cops to go on the run. Back in the saddle after \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (Michael Bay having established the template on the first two movies), directing team Adil & Bilall don\u2019t scrimp on action and stunts, and unlike the movie they helmed in between, the much-discussed and lamented \u201cBatgirl,\u201d at least this film is getting released. That said, their efforts to bring a hyper-cinematic quality to the action yields a mixed bag, including a sequence that resembles a first-person shooter game. Despite all the blood, the comedy quotient in Chris Bremner and Will Beall\u2019s screenplay also qualifies as being largely anemic. The supporting players, similarly, have relatively little to do, including returnees Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Paola Nu\u00f1ez, a fleeting cameo by Tiffany Haddish, and a puzzling, wasted role for Rhea Seehorn (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d). In a classic example of bad-guy dialogue, Dane\u2019s character mutters after a failed attempt to eliminate Mike and Marcus, \u201cThese guys just refuse to die.\u201d The fourth \u201cBad Boys\u201d might not be enough to kill them, but it does suggest they should emulate much of the Florida population and, when it comes to the buddy-cop biz, consider retiring. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d premieres June 7 in US theaters.

But let\u2019s back up first. Last season, Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) was crowned king, Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy) crowned herself Queen, Aemond Targaryen\u2019s dragon ate Rhaenyra\u2019s son Lucerys (Elliot Grihault) for lunch, and, basically, war is on the precipice. When we meet Rhaenyra in the Season 2 premiere episode, she\u2019s overcome with grief about the death of Lucerys. After she finds some closure and Lucerys\u2019 remains, she returns to Dragonstone to hold a Team Black council meeting, clearly still grief-stricken and mad. Like, mad-mad. \u201cI want Aemond Targaryen,\u201d Rhaenyra says at the council meeting. If \u201can eye for an eye\u201d seemed to be the approach to justice in Season 1, this season it\u2019s \u201ca son for a son.\u201d Rhaenyra\u2019s uncle/husband \u2013 welcome back to incest-laden Westeros \u2013 Daemon (Matt Smith) is happy to help and hires a rat exterminator and an accomplice, who may be better known to book readers as \u201cBlood and Cheese,\u201d to kill Prince Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), on the advice of the White Worm (Sonoya Mizuno). Daemon explains to the rat guy that Prince Aemond has \u201csilver hair and one eye\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t be hard to find.\u201d \ufeffBut he was. While rat guy does successfully sneak into the Red Keep, he does not find and slay one-eyed Aemond. He instead finds Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) in her bedroom with her two young children and proceeds to slay young Prince Jaehaerys, King Aegon\u2019s heir. The unintended death of King Aegon\u2019s heir might complicate Rhaenyra\u2019s Realm-wide quest for loyalty because murdering an innocent child isn\u2019t a good look. Solid cliffhanger, though!

{"id": "2024_06_17_entertainment_tehrangeles-porochista-khakpour-cec", "text": "Looking back, the early pandemic period seems almost like a fever dream. In the first half of 2020, we hunkered down in our homes. The outside world brimmed with a perilous danger we didn\u2019t quite understand, so we spent our days connecting with friends and family over screens. For writer Porochista Khakpour, the period presented an ideal parameter for a plot. And thus it\u2019s the setting of her latest novel \u201cTehrangeles,\u201d a portmanteau of Tehran and Los Angeles, named for the large Iranian community in the US city. The book, released last week, revolves around the Milanis, an ultra-rich Iranian family \u2014 think Bravo\u2019s \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d\u00a0\u2014 on the verge of launching their own reality TV show. Shifting through the perspectives of each character in the family, \u201cTehrangeles\u201d unveils the threads of the family\u2019s dynamics, weaving together a collage of secrets and mishaps, with the internet as a driving force. Case in point: In one scene, TikTok dancer Addison Rae, whose popularity soared in early 2020, makes an appearance at a party hosted by the Milanis. \u201cI felt really compelled to sort of freeze this moment, to really take a close look at this exact moment without thinking far in the future,\u201d Khakpour told CNN, speaking of internet culture in the early pandemic era.\u00a0\u201cI wasn\u2019t seeing it enough in books around me, so I really wanted to do it with, of course, an Iranian American twist, because those are my people, and I was seeing them trying to take part in this just as eagerly.\u201d The end result is a satirical look at how celebrity, wealth and social media operate together, especially against the backdrop of a super rich Iranian community in Los Angeles. Similar to our fascination with real-life reality stars\u00a0(from the Kardashians to former president Donald Trump), we can\u2019t seem to look away from the Milanis and their obsessive pursuit of status. CNN spoke with Khakpour about early pandemic influencers, Iranian American assimilation and spending eight hours a day on TikTok for research on the book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. What made you choose to set \u201cTehrangeles\u201d during the early stages of the pandemic as opposed to pretending it doesn\u2019t exist?\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s actually a period piece. The pandemic was absolutely personally devastating. I mean, I lost seven friends. I was in Queens (New York), at the heart of it, it was a horrific experience, and I have chronic illness issues. But I was really wanting to write a satire around the mishaps around the pandemic. For instance, the influencers throwing super spreader parties. I was watching that with absolute horror on TikTok every day, just thinking, \u201cWhat is going on? How is this real?\u201d I started this book in 2011 and I really didn\u2019t know what the setting was going to be. I had the characters set. I had the basic scenario set with reality TV, the potential of war with Iran, aspects like that. But I really had no idea about when, in time, it was going to take place. And so I was constantly redrafting it, revisiting aspects of the plot. And then when the pandemic hit, I was like, \u201cOh, wait a sec, this is the setting.\u201d You have the ultimate restriction, a bunch of people who are confined to their homes. It just was, to me, an ideal conceit for a novel, because you can really turn up the heat and get things to a boiling point where family dynamics are concerned. What were you trying to say here about the ultra rich? Well, I\u2019ve always been an outsider to this class, the upper class. But I\u2019ve definitely been an observer. I\u2019ve had some relatives that have punctured this class here. I\u2019ve been a shop girl on Rodeo Drive. When we grew up in the San Gabriel Valley part of LA, we would drive out the 40 minutes or so to the Tehrangeles neighborhood (Westwood), and I would be in contact with these extremely wealthy Iranian Americans all the time. So I really got a good look at them. And then, of course, on the total flip side, watching the world of reality TV or the world of TikTok and influencers and all that. Again, I\u2019ve been an observer. I\u2019ve never really been a part of that. In fact, I don\u2019t share an age with any character in this book. So I\u2019m a complete outsider to this. But I often think it\u2019s the outsiders who have a really good lens at stories like this. So it was very important for me to convey that this is definitely satire. The challenge, though, was how to write satire that still has some heart, because it\u2019s very easy for me to poke fun at the rich. I can do that all day. I don\u2019t believe in billionaires. I think there should be none, so I have very different politics than most of my cast. It\u2019s very easy for me to just be very disdainful of these types of people, but really it was the other end of it that became the real challenge. How do you then make this a more worthwhile ride for the reader, where they actually have moments of empathy with these characters? You mentioned it took you over a decade to write this book. Do you think that your own changes over the course of the decade influenced your characters and the world you were creating? Actually, the characters didn\u2019t change too much, but how I wrote them changed. There was a long period where the central protagonist, Roxanna, was so reprehensible to me. I just dreaded writing her sections. I found her so irritating. I found her just to be unacceptable in every area. And I had to figure out, \u201cHow do I find a way to feel for her, even though she would have been the girl in high school that bullied me?\u201d It\u2019s more like what was going on in the world that helped shift things for me. I mean, the central anxiety for me originally was war with Iran. It\u2019s interesting how that comes and goes in news cycles. Like in January of 2020, a lot of us Iranians were pretty convinced the US was going to go to war with Iran after Soleimani\u2019s assassination. We were very prepared for that. And then, recently, with what\u2019s been going on in Gaza, again, I\u2019m like, \u201cHuh, looks like the US really wants, sometimes, war with Iran.\u201d So we go back and forth with this. The political climate, the socioeconomic climate, of the US actually swayed me. Also, TikTok really affected how I saw the book and the characters, too. I was on TikTok very, very early on, just lurking. And that was the only way I had access to Gen Z creators with tens of thousands, some hundreds of thousands, some millions of followers, and I got a real sense of how they lived and how they saw the world. Some of them were, I thought, pretty smart. They\u2019re pretty interesting. They\u2019re pretty good people. But some of them, just the prospect of getting rich and monetizing their every thought \u2014 everything from a little dance move to like a funny quip \u2014 the way that every aspect of their being could be monetized, watching that transform these young people was really fascinating to me. It horrified me on one level, but on another level, I wanted to know how the story would end. What are these young people going to be like when they hit middle age like me? I don\u2019t really know. I hope they\u2019ll be okay. Some of the characters that show up in the book are so indicative of that specific time, and I\u2019m not even sure if we have even had time to go back and think about it and process it. So much has changed. During the fact-checking process, it was so funny, like Kim Kardashian was Kim Kardashian West in this book; we had to look back to make sure. There\u2019s an emoji we use at a certain point \u2014 did it exist, as we put it, in 2020? I mean, it was wild, the process we had when we were going through it all, the type of research we had to do to make sure it was a proper period piece. Because already, the trends on TikTok are completely different. When I see the words \u201chype house\u201d \u2014 that was all over my notes very much when I was writing this book \u2014 I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to remember what I\u2019m even talking about. I had to really get to a point where I was consuming this stuff like someone in their teens and early 20s. I spent a lot of time, sometimes eight-hour days, on TikTok. And I do have an interest in pop culture. I was a music journalist for a while. I did a lot of entertainment journalism. So it\u2019s not totally outside of my area of interest, but I felt my age. But maybe that was part of why I could do it, because I had a healthy distance. I can definitely understand that. In a piece for the Los Angeles Times ahead of this book\u2019s release, you wrote, \u201cI never had to go far to find Iran. I did, however, have to go far to find Iranian America.\u201d What is Iranian America versus Iran? I think the problem with Iranian American cultural representation is that it\u2019s focused on a certain type of Iranian and we saw that very clearly with \u201cShahs of Sunset.\u201d But even before that, in \u201cClueless,\u201d when they talk about the Persian mafia and that. I\u2019ve seen all sorts of comedy shows and sketches where they want to have an Iranian character, and it\u2019s really one of two things \u2014 it\u2019s either some rich Beverly Hills guy in a white BMW, slicked back hair and tacky designer clothes, or it\u2019s just a straight-up terrorist. The terrorist one, I feel like we got somewhere with pushing back on to some degree, although, obviously for us Muslims, Islamophobia is a constant. It comes back every few years, of course. But the other thing, this affluent Iranian that has made it \u2014 and Americans get a kick out of that caricature \u2014 it\u2019s become a sort of acceptable caricature, even within Iranian communities at times, because they see that as someone that\u2019s non-threatening, that can still get good jobs, still make money. But the reality is, there\u2019s tons of Iranian Americans, like my family. Lots of us don\u2019t fit into that picture at all. And actually we are really the majority. Some might argue and say, \u201cLook, Tehrangeles, that\u2019s the biggest population of Iranians outside of Iran.\u201d But they\u2019re not all 90210 Iranians. I lived in the greater Los Angeles area. Would I be included in that? Visibility has been a big problem for us, and at times, I\u2019ve argued for no visibility. I\u2019ve hoped that we could be kind of invisible, because the minute in America there\u2019s a spotlight on a culture, it\u2019s a matter of time before recognition turns into hate. So I\u2019ve been very nervous about that for years. Iranian America, like any diaspora, is huge, it\u2019s diverse. But because these very affluent Iranians get the most visibility, there\u2019s maybe an attempt to assimilate into Iranian America, versus just trying to be Iranian in America. Is that it? That\u2019s a really great way to put it. When I came to the US, and I was in ESL classes, fresh from Iran, I heard all sorts of things. People call me FOB (fresh off the boat), all sorts of awful things in that era. But at the same time, it made sense to me. I was a foreigner here. I was learning English. My family ate very different food. I had a different first language. I had a different culture. We had different celebrations. It all made sense. But what really created that cognitive dissonance for me was then seeing other Iranians who were way ahead of us in assimilation, who were desperate for assimilation in a way that we really weren\u2019t. It was almost that uncanny feeling when you see something that kind of looks like you, but completely acts different. It\u2019s adjacent, but off. It wasn\u2019t a mirror image. I was really surprised by it. And I\u2019ve never really found a community in the more conservative Tehrangeles wealthy Iranians; I think that goes for a lot of us. A lot of Iranians are also ashamed to admit that their communities would reject them. So the shame, combined with just these major cultural gaps that have to do with class, as well as ethics and all sorts of things, it just creates a really weird type of alienation that really hasn\u2019t gotten better for me as I\u2019ve gotten older. I\u2019ve just found a place for myself as a writer and observer of all that. But creating community has always been hard for me as an Iranian American. Every time I go to these readings, I meet Iranian Americans and I\u2019m so excited. I\u2019m like, \u201clet\u2019s keep in touch!\u201d because it\u2019s always hard to find us, even though the numbers tell a different story. We are here. A friend of mine jokes there\u2019s a lot of stealth Iranians. They don\u2019t want to fit in with the Tehrangeles set. They\u2019re so afraid of being filed under those, whereas it used to be a fear of being filed under the terrorists. So now they just become stealth Iranians, and they\u2019re just hoping that people will only see them as maybe Muslim or Jewish or just an artist or queer or whatever it is, because it\u2019s gotten so confusing. Right. Like with your book, you\u2019re holding up a mirror to the Tehrangeles Iranian American side, but then there\u2019s all these other Iranian Americans that exist, living their life, maybe in contrast to the Tehrangeles Iranian America. Yeah. The boy in my first novel, \u201cSons and Other Flammable Objects,\u201d grew up in an apartment district like the one I grew up in in the San Gabriel Valley. That guy has no intersection with these young women in Tehrangeles. They will probably never meet in their life, and they probably won\u2019t really know they even exist. And yet, they are technically in the same city. They technically have a lot in common, actually.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/entertainment/tehrangeles-porochista-khakpour-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Small wonder that there would be comfort in reaching back to a hit from 2015, one that highlighted Pixar\u2019s inventiveness as well as its ability to tap into childhood concerns \u2013 by bringing to life the conflicting emotions within them \u2013 in a way that resonated with adults as well. Under the stewardship of first-time feature director Kelsey Mann, \u201cInside Out 2\u201d re-introduces Riley (voiced by Kensington Tallman) as a now-teenager, playing hockey, excelling in school and enjoying a sense of self that hinges on thinking of herself as a good person. Joy (Amy Poehler) remains the maestro among her various emotions, accentuating the good and pushing the bad into the recesses of her mind. That equilibrium is instantly thrown for a loop, however, when (in one of several laugh-out-loud visual gags) the puberty button lights up, unleashing a new group of emotions, including Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Shame (Paul Walter Hauser) and Ennui (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, who is, naturally, French). Anxiety leads the newcomers in taking over the command center, telling Joy and the old guard, \u201cRiley\u2019s life is more complex now.\u201d That seems especially true as she\u2019s dealt unexpected news on the verge of arriving at hockey camp, where her performance, she fears, could have implications for her whole middle-school-to-high-school transition. While there have certainly been no shortage of movies dealing with those delicate coming-of-age years, the central device of \u201cInside Out\u201d provides an especially good way of exploring questions about growing up, the desire to fit in and still preserving some sense of the child you were as you mature. Pixar notably grappled with similar issues in \u201cTurning Red,\u201d one of its better recent efforts, which happened to arrive at an inopportune time and lack the established qualities that would help lure audiences to go see it. On the bright side, even with studios struggling at the box office there\u2019s evidence of a not-terribly-discriminating hunger for kid-friendly fare based on results for \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d with the latest edition of \u201cDespicable Me\u201d still to come. Whether \u201cInside Out 2\u201d translates that into the hoped-for commercial success \u2013 as last year\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ultimately did after a disappointing start \u2013 the film happily meets the high creative standards and expectations that Pixar has established. Whatever Riley\u2019s going through, there\u2019s nothing particularly complicated about that. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d premieres June 14 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/entertainment/inside-out-2-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_entertainment_brats-review-brat-pack-andrew-mccarthy", "text": "Deeply personal approaches worked beautifully in nostalgic Michael J. Fox and Val Kilmer documentaries, but \u201cBrats\u201d turns Andrew McCarthy\u2019s near-40-year-old beef about \u201cthe Brat Pack\u201d label into an exercise in self-indulgence, too heavily skewed toward his point of view. While it\u2019s fun seeing \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d as they near \u201cThe Early-Bird Dinner Club\u201d years, this is one of those projects that would have benefited from a more journalistic tone. The origin of the term dates back to a New York magazine story with the headline \u201cHollywood\u2019s Brat Pack,\u201d which lumped together stars of movies like \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d and \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d playing off the \u201cRat Pack\u201d nickname that defined Frank Sinatra and his celebrity pals. McCarthy and his contemporaries, however, found the designation dismissive and insulting, underscored by rapid-fire video clips with news/\u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d types throwing it around in the \u201880s, and the young actors fidgeting through questions about it from the likes of Phil Donahue, Charlie Rose and Merv Griffin. Now in their early 60s, McCarthy \u2013 having written a memoir, \u201cBrat: An \u201880s Story,\u201d about his experiences \u2013 transforms that into this ABC News documentary for Hulu, which is presented almost entirely looking over his shoulder. That includes an extended sequence of him on the phone trying to set up interviews with his contemporaries, which is every bit as scintillating as that sounds. A hit-miss collection of conversations follows, with some of the key players (Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson notable among them) taking a pass, while Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Lea Thompson, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer and Rob Lowe \u2013 some of whom question their own \u201cBrat Pack\u201d credentials \u2013 walk down memory lane, generally exhibiting less animus toward being \u201cbranded\u201d that way than McCarthy appears to harbor. As it happens, the most interesting exchanges come from third-party voices, such as authors Malcolm Gladwell and Bret Easton Ellis, which underscores that a sense of distance and perspective can be helpful in these situations, from noting how director John Hughes avoided issues of race to the significance of music in films of that era. As the actors acknowledge, they benefited from a shift that saw Hollywood chasing their demographic, an emphasis on catering to youth that permeated TV as well as movies and persists to this day. Gladwell makes the astute case that such productions will never be quite the same as they were back then thanks to fragmentation brought about by streaming and an abundance of choices. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a relatively unified youth culture \u2026 to everything\u2019s all over the place,\u201d Gladwell observes. \u201cThere\u2019s no common denominator.\u201d Mostly, \u201cBrats\u201d plays like a latter-day therapy session like the one the kids underwent in \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d only with the benefit of four decades of hindsight. It certainly feels like McCarthy seeks to build toward that by meeting with the writer of the article who coined \u201cBrat Pack,\u201d David Blum, who understands how the young actors might have seen it as dismissive or \u201cunjust,\u201d as Moore puts it, but doesn\u2019t apologize for something that amounted to a playful turn of phrase half a lifetime ago. As noted, \u201cBrats\u201d joins a long list of confessional and/or nostalgic documentaries, with Soleil Moon Frye\u2019s \u201cKid 90\u201d and Alex Winter\u2019s \u201cShowbiz Kids\u201d among other examples. \u201cWe fit a niche that needed to be filled in pop culture at that moment,\u201d McCarthy says of himself and his peers back in their heyday. Don\u2019t look now, but \u201cBrats\u201d does much the same thing, filling a slightly different niche as streaming services look for ways to garner attention and distinguish themselves from the Subscription Pack. \u201cBrats\u201d premieres June 13 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/entertainment/brats-review-brat-pack-andrew-mccarthy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_10_entertainment_teamsters-iatse-union-hollywood-crew-strike", "text": "The members of Hollywood\u2019s crew member unions include people who \u2013 literally \u2013 help keep the lights on around town on film and television show sets, the same ones that will go dark again if the unions\u2019 contract negotiations fail and another strike descends upon an industry still sore from last summer\u2019s historic strikes. \u201cThere\u2019s always a reason to strike,\u201d Lindsay Dougherty, Teamsters Local 399 principal officer and chairperson of the Hollywood Basic Crafts, said in a recent interview with CNN ahead of Monday\u2019s start of the unions\u2019 negotiations with major studios. But, she adds \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate that the studios will be giving us that reason.\u201d Either way, she continued, the union intends to \u201cfight for everything that we can get\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019re done being disrespected.\u201d While entertainment consumers would never know it from their still-plentiful streaming carousels, industry professionals across the many trades that are essential to the DNA of a Hollywood movie and TV sets say their industry is on crutches. The studios and streamers are buying and producing fewer projects. A lot of projects are being filmed out of California and out of the country, resulting in fewer  job opportunities for those living in the heart of the entertainment industry. \u201cSome of these proposals we have made for 50 plus years so this fight was always going to happen, but now the fight is different because our members have suffered such financial hardship in the last year from not working \u2013 and at the hands of the studios,\u201d Dougherty said. \u201cThe studios are the ones that, in my opinion, could have deterred that from happening or prevented a dual strike from happening.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the entity that represents the studios and streamers, for comment on the start of the Teamsters\u2019 and Basic Crafts\u2019 negotiations. The negotiations between Hollywood\u2019s leading crew unions \u2013 including IATSE, Teamsters Local 399 and Basic Hollywood Crafts \u2013 and the AMPTP will culminate by the end of July, when the current contracts expire. Here\u2019s what to know about who is negotiating, what they\u2019re fighting for and what another potential strike would mean for viewers. Who are the Teamsters? Nearly 5,000 members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters\u2019 (IBT) motion picture division include drivers, dispatchers, Department of Transportation (DOT) administrators, animal trainers, wranglers, mechanics and location managers who work in Hollywood. They are represented by Teamsters Local 399, with the drivers making up the largest portion of their membership. What is Hollywood Basic Crafts? Hollywood Basic Crafts is coalition of crew unions that include: Who is in IATSE? The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) represents nearly 170,000 members working in Hollywood as hair and makeup artists, wardrobe department workers, broadcast techs, designers, animators, AV techs, scenic artists and more. Who are the AMPTP? The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) is the entity that represents the major Hollywood studios and streamers in negotiations with the entertainment industry unions and guilds. When did negotiations start? Hollywood Basic Crafts and Teamsters Local 399 began June 10. IATSE began the first phase of their negotiations earlier in March, which \u201chave largely been productive,\u201d according to a news release on Friday. Some tentative agreements were reached in April, but overall negotiations remain ongoing. Basic Crafts, Local 399 and IATSE are negotiating some specific provisions of their respective contracts alongside each other, but their members will be voting on each union\u2019s respective contract separately. What the unions want Fair wages, working conditions, residual distribution, pensions, health funds and job security provisions, among other topics, are all topics that are on the table, according to Dougherty. They are also seeking \u201cadditional compensation\u201d for the financial impact that the work-stoppage from last year\u2019s dual strikes had on members, she said. Dougherty said crew member unions aim to be \u201cproperly compensated for all the hard work that they do on a day-to-day basis.\u201d When would a potential strike begin? IATSE, Teamsters Local 399 and Hollywood Basic Crafts\u2019 respective contracts expire on July 31. Unless they agree to extend negotiations beyond that deadline, the unions and the AMPTP would need to agree on a new contract prior to that date to avoid a strike. What happens to TV show/movie productions if there\u2019s a strike? Hollywood would probably shut down again just like last year, causing industry-wide delays and putting thousands of people out of work again. What would that look like for entertainment consumers? It could mean waiting yet another year to watch the final season of \u201cStrangers Things,\u201d for example, which is set to stream in 2025 but will still be in production come July. If the production is halted due to a strike, that just further pushes back the release date. This is the case for any other project that\u2019s in production at the time of a strike.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/entertainment/teamsters-iatse-union-hollywood-crew-strike/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

She slipped, went down, hit that on her eye, then fell on the floor and broke her cheek.\u201d The comedian further explained what happened in a subsequent conversation with TMZ, explaining that he used the term \u201ctipsy\u201d to mean impaired and not specifically drunk. \u201cFirst of all, she wasn\u2019t drunk,\u201d Mandel said. \u201cShe\u2019s so worried people are going to intervene with her \u2018alcohol problem,\u2019 she doesn\u2019t have an alcohol problem. I\u2019m gonna tell you the truth \u2013 she took gummies.\u201d When he first recounted the incident on \u201cLive With Kelly and Mark,\u201d he detailed how his wife Terry Mandel had bashed her head open. Mandel recounted how when he then turned on the light, he saw her lying with \u201cblood pooling\u201d around her head. \u201cYou could actually see her skull,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt opened up.\u201d He shared a photo from the accident, showing his wife Terry Mandel with a gash on her forehead and a bloody and blackened eye. \u201cI freaked out,\u201d he said. \u201cI picked her up, I put her on the bed. There\u2019s blood everywhere. I went and grabbed all the towels, and all the towels are covered with blood. And she\u2019s going, \u2018Get me ice. Get me ice.\u2019\u201d He grabbed cold soda cans from the mini fridge, before she needed to seek emergency care at a hospital. Mandel says she is doing better now and doens\u2019t have any scarring. The couple have been married since 1980. They share three children, a son, Alex and daughters Jackie and Riley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/entertainment/howie-mandel-wife-accident/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

On Tuesday, which would have been Takeoff\u2019s 30th birthday, Quavo co-hosted the firstRocket Foundation Summit in collaboration with US Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention at The Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia. At the event, Quavo told reporters he\u2019s been working to make sure he \u201cturned tragedy into triumph.\u201d Takeoff was shot and killed during a private party in Houston, Texas, in 2022. He was 28. \u201cMy nephew is a legend. He died for a cause and right now we gonna change the world for him,\u201d Quavo said this week. Quavo and Takeoff were part of the rap trio Migos along with fellow rapper and relative Offset. Quavo said he felt \u201coverwhelmed\u201d on Tuesday, but is committed to helping to reduce gun violence. Part of his goal, he said, is \u201cjust to change lives, change our community.\u201d \u201cWe gotta start here in Atlanta,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gotta start here with the culture and making sure we have money for resources.\u201d That initiative includes handing out $20,000 grants to several organizations who are also on the mission to stop gun violence. \u201cWe have more work to do, but good work is happening and let\u2019s not let anybody make us think that we cannot make a difference,\u201d Harris said at the summit this week. \u201cIt\u2019s never-ending in some ways, but we can\u2019t let these circumstances take away our purpose and our knowledge that we can make a difference.\u201d She announced that AmeriCorps is partnering with the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention to establish the \u201cSafer America Network,\u201d which aims to prevent gun violence by providing resources to at-risk youth. Last year, Quavo traveled to Washington, DC, where he met with members of Congress for a panel discussion on gun violence prevention. That helped establish a dialogue with Vice President Harris, who joined the rapper Tuesday for a discussion as she continues to mark National Gun Violence Awareness Month. The new collaboration announced by Harris on Tuesday will consist of AmeriCorps members and volunteers working with schools and mental health providers by training schools and families on trauma-informed care, and prevent violence from occurring in the first place by increasing the resources available to at-risk young people. Harris emphasized that gun violence \u201crequires everybody\u2019s priority in terms of addressing it and there are many ways to do it. That includes also what we need to do around election time.\u201d She continued, \u201cToo many people \u2013 who I will call cowards \u2013 have been pushing this false choice to suggest you\u2019re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone\u2019s guns away. That\u2019s a false choice.

One of the people that has helped Dion find hope amid her health struggle is neurologist Dr. Amanda Piquet, who the singer highlighted in a moving speech on Monday ahead of a screening of her upcoming documentary about her life with the condition. Dion spoke at a screening of \u201cI Am: Celine Dion\u201d in New York that was also live streamed at an event in Los Angeles, which CNN attended. During her at-times tearful speech, Dion said that Piquet has \u201chelped me tremendously (and) solved this mystery about my health.\u201d \u201cIn finding ways to manage and treat my condition, Dr. Piquet has delivered a very, very important result for me: She has replaced my fear with hope,\u201d Dion said, as the crowd whistled and cheered for her. Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is \u201ca rare, progressive syndrome that affects the nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord,\u201d according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Dion announced in 2022 that she was diagnosed with the condition and that she was taking time off from professional commitments to focus on her health.

{"id": "2024_06_10_entertainment_subtitles-movies-tv", "text": "One of the benefits of streaming has been an increased flow of series and movies from around the globe, as services try to keep their shelves filled with fresh alternatives. Subscribers in the US, moreover, seem much less resistant than in years past when it comes to watching shows either entirely or heavily in languages other than English, as evidenced by the popularity of titles like \u201cSquid Game,\u201d \u201cLupin\u201d and most recently \u201cShogun.\u201d Yet even shows produced in English in other countries, like the UK and Australia, can become a little thick for an American ear trying to sort out the idiomatic quirks and other differences. If you paused a few times to catch lines in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d or \u201cBodkin,\u201d or Paramount+\u2019s \u201cSexy Beast,\u201d rest assured, you are not alone. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason why data indicate more people \u2013 especially young adults, who are more prone to second-screen viewing and multitasking \u2013 are watching shows in their primary language with the subtitles on. According to a 2023 survey by YouGov, nearly 40% of US respondents preferred having the subtitles on when watching TV in a language they speak, with those under 30 employing that practice by a better than two-to-one margin compared to those age 45 to 64. The survey found that those using subtitles cite two primary factors in equal measure: Subtitles enhance their comprehension, and they help them understand accents. Netflix, as the most widely distributed streaming service, has cast its net farther and wider in terms of offering programs produced around the world, and it has taken note of changes in the way people consume its content. The service has increased the number of films and series that support audio descriptions (AD) and subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing (SDH). Kathy Rokni, Netflix\u2019s senior director of globalization, said the service employs an in-house team of \u201csubtitling experts and language managers,\u201d designed to enhance the viewing experience while remaining faithful to the filmmakers\u2019 intentions. \u201cWe believe great stories transcend borders, cultures, abilities, and languages,\u201d Rokni said via email, noting that 40% of viewing hours on Netflix now happen with subtitles, including SDH, over half of which involves members employing subtitles in their primary language. Certainly, it\u2019s a long way back to 1979, when the Australian movie \u201cMad Max\u201d was dubbed into American English because the distributor feared Americans wouldn\u2019t be able to understand the Aussie accents. British series obviously have a long history in the US \u2013 look no further than \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and the period dramas presented by \u201cMasterpiece Theater\u201d \u2013 but they traditionally tended to operate within a relatively narrow swatch of audience and genres. By contrast, it\u2019s notable today that a wider variety of imports, either in English or other languages, are organically finding success with little advance fanfare and promotion, as \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and before that \u201cSquid Game\u201d did. The trend suggests viewers are actively sampling internationally produced material as they seek (and often stumble upon) options via streaming platforms. For streaming services, there\u2019s a clear benefit to that, since series already produced elsewhere generally cost less to acquire than homegrown product, particularly with the production pipeline having slowed due to last year\u2019s twin and prolonged actors and writers strikes. So if the best show you\u2019ve seen lately also happens to be one where you find yourself reading along while watching, either to assist your understanding or simply by choice? It\u2019s not just you.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/entertainment/subtitles-movies-tv/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_entertainment_presumed-innocent-review-jake-gyllenhaal", "text": "Bearing little resemblance to the 1990 movie starring Harrison Ford, \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d has become an Apple TV+ limited series with an old-fashioned, pulpy feel \u2013 \u201cold-fashioned\u201d in the way classic courtroom dramas incorporated dramatic flourishes that would never, ever happen in a real trial. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the accused prosecutor, in a show that works strictly as a check-your-brain-at-the-courthouse-steps exercise. Filled with florid characters and overheated situations, writer David E. Kelley (whose credits include lots of legal dramas dating back to \u201cL.A. Law\u201d) teams up with producer J.J. Abrams on this adaptation of Scott Turow\u2019s book, which capitalizes on the eight-episode format to take a longer time (too long, frankly) before getting into the courtroom. Mostly, that provides opportunities to get to know Rusty Sabich (Gyllenhaal, having moved into pass-the-popcorn mode between this and \u201cRoad House\u201d) and his family dynamics in a deeper way, before he\u2019s thrown into a tailspin when accused of murdering colleague Carolyn Polhemus (Norwegian star Renate Reinsve), with whom he was having an affair and, by his own admission, obsessed. Rusty\u2019s wife, Barbara (Ruth Negga), doesn\u2019t believe he killed her, but the case drags his infidelity into public view and essentially rubs her nose in it, with plenty of flashbacks of their steamy illicit trysts to put an exclamation point on that because, hey, streaming. Other than Gyllenhaal, whose take on Rusty is decidedly less sympathetic than Ford\u2019s was (albeit with a better haircut, although the rest of the movie feels superior), everyone else appears to be working off cue cards that say \u201cDO IT BIGGER.\u201d That includes Negga as the wounded wife; Gyllenhaal\u2019s real-life brother-in-law, Peter Sarsgaard, as the prosecutor, Tommy Molto, champing at the bit to convict Rusty; and Bill Camp as Raymond Horgan, the former boss who agrees to defend him. Notably, that tonal criticism also applies to Kelley\u2019s other recent drama based on a novel, Netflix\u2019s \u201cA Man in Full,\u201d which, in both cases, somewhat neutralizes an impressive cast. \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d nevertheless proves watchable despite \u2013 and for some, surely, because of \u2013 its excesses. Apple made seven of the eight episodes available, so how this version handles the twisty ending remains to be seen, though it\u2019s fair to say the production takes a few liberties up until that point. \u201cThis is nuts,\u201d Rusty\u2019s teenage daughter says as suspicion falls upon her dad, which makes her sound both like a legal analyst, at least in the context of this trial, and an astute TV critic. \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d does have its moments, but in terms of making a case for committing to sit through eight chapters, Kelley, Gyllenhaal and company haven\u2019t exactly put together an open-and-shut case. \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d premieres June 12 on Apple TV+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/entertainment/presumed-innocent-review-jake-gyllenhaal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

(\u201c#Garfiosa,\u201d anyone?) Some things about this summer\u2019s slate of movies feel similar \u2013 namely, a lot of sequels on offer \u2013 while other elements feel a bit different, like the lingering hangover from last year\u2019s twin strikes that brought movie production to a months-long standstill. Nevertheless, there are more than a few characters sure to distract from that with their showy antics, some masked and mouthy (here\u2019s looking at you, Deadpool) and others aiming to turn our emotions \u201cInside Out\u201d all over again. Behold a list of the most buzzy movies being released theatrically between Memorial and Labor Day Weekends, 2024. For ease of reference, any sequel, prequel or reboot is marked with an asterisk: \u2018Furiosa\u2019* (May 24) George Miller\u2019s fifth foray into the gnarly post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max, \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d explores the origins of the titular character originated by Charlize Theron in 2015\u2019s Oscar-winning epic \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d Here, Furiosa is played to the mettle by Anya Taylor-Joy, with villainous antics (and a prosthetic nose) supplied by Chris Hemsworth. \u2018The Garfield Movie\u2019 (May 24) Chris Pratt gets to add another voice credit to his list of animated roles after last year\u2019s hit \u201cMario Bros. Movie\u201d with \u201cGarfield,\u201d following the famously lethargic ginger cat hailing from the comic strips of yore. Joining Pratt as the titular cat in this family-friendly romp are Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein, along with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Cecily Strong and Bowen Yang. \u2018Ezra\u2019 (May 31) Robert De Niro joins Bobby Cannavale and Rose Byrne in this drama about a comedian who is father to an autistic child, and the unexpected road trip they embark upon. Whoopi Goldberg, Vera Farmiga and Tony Goldwyn (who also directs) costar. Introducing William A. Fitzgerald in the title role as Ezra. \u2018Robot Dreams\u2019 (May 31) Nominated for best animated feature at the Academy Awards earlier this year, \u201cRobot Dreams\u201d is the winsome tale of a dog, named Dog, and his new robot friend named\u2026 you guessed it, Robot. This one gets extra points for being a period piece, of sorts, taking place in New York City in the 1980s. \u2018Summer Camp\u2019 (May 31) This \u201cBook Club\u201d-esque take on three friends from summer camp reuniting later in life for another hurrah stars Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard and Eugene Levy in what (inexplicably) looks to be the role of the hunk they fawned over as youngsters. With this plus \u201cBook Club,\u201d its sequel last year as well as \u201cPoms,\u201d Keaton looks to be launching her very own genre. \u2018Bad Boys: Ride or Die\u2019* (June 7) Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back for a fourth go-round of this buddy comedy/action hybrid, with the twist being that this time, they\u2019re on the run (according to the IMDb logline). The movie, costarring Vanessa Hudgens, follows 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (it seems that title\u2019s promise didn\u2019t quite stick). \u2018The Watchers\u2019 (June 7) The nepo baby phenomenon extends beyond actors, as this June entry marks the feature directorial debut of one Ishana Shyamalan, daughter to M. Night (she gained footing on his Apple TV+ series \u201cServant\u201d). The film looks dutifully creepy, and stars the talented Dakota Fanning (\u201cRipley\u201d) as an artist who finds herself in a strange forest in Ireland. Soon, that becomes the least of her problems. \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 (June 7) You read that right \u2013 this 1999 international classic is being rereleased with a 4K restoration to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie\u2019s original US debut. Starring Franka Potente and directed by the visionary Tom Tykwer, \u201cLola\u201d follows a young woman in Berlin who has 20 minutes to get across town to her boyfriend \u2013 and find 100,000 Deutche Marks on the way \u2013 or else he dies. As time ticks by and Lola makes split-second decisions, her life and that of those around her become remarkably altered. \u2018Inside Out 2\u2019* (June 14) Almost a decade (!!) since Pixar\u2019s Oscar-winning exploration into the mind and emotions of one young Riley, Amy Poehler and company are back as Riley grows into her teen years. Several new emotions will be at play, including Anxiety (voiced by \u201cStranger Things\u2019\u201d Maya Hawke), Envy (\u201cThe Bear\u201d star Ayo Edebiri), embarrassment and even ennui. Oh, to be a teen once again. \u2018Treasure\u2019 (June 14) \u201cGirls\u201d star and creator Lena Dunham and \u201cWilde\u201d actor Stephen Fry play a daughter and father who travel to Poland in the early 1990s to explore the latter\u2019s roots. But the specter of his trauma from surviving the Holocaust causes him to try to sabotage their trip, as the pair nonetheless face the past and grow closer in the process. \u2018Kinds of Kindness\u2019 (June 21) After last year\u2019s surprisingly bizarre and very acclaimed \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is the next team-up between two-time Oscar-winner Emma Stone and \u201cPoor Things\u201d director Yorgos Lanthimos. The new film is billed as a dark \u201ctriptych fable,\u201d costarring Willem Dafoe, \u201cCivil War\u201d actor Jesse Plemons,\u00a0Margaret Qualley, \u201cThe Whale\u201d star Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Mamoudou Athie and \u201cEuphoria\u201d rising star Hunter Schafer. \u2018The Bikeriders\u2018 (June 21) The next starring vehicle for \u201cElvis\u201d actor Austin Butler, \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d looks like a mashup of \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d and \u201cMidnight Cowboy,\u201d with Butler at the head of a rough and tumble biker gang in \u201960s Chicago. Costarring Tom Hardy and \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star\u00a0Jodie Comer. \u2018Thelma\u2019 (June 21) Marking her first lead role, \u201cThelma\u201d stars 94-year-old June Squibb as the titular senior who is targeted in a phone scam and decides to take matters into her own hands to get back what\u2019s hers. The Oscar-nominated \u201cNebraska\u201d star is joined in the new movie by \u201cThe White Lotus\u2019s\u201d Fred Hechinger, who plays her grandson. \u2018A Quiet Place: Day One\u2019* (June 28) This prequel sure looks like it\u2019ll make a lot of noise. The latest entry in John Krasinski\u2019s super sound-sensitive alien invasion franchise, \u201cDay One\u201d stars Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o and will focus on when the vicious beasts first arrive and begin wreaking havoc. \u201cStranger Things 4\u201d breakout star Joseph Quinn, along with franchise returnee Djimon Hounsou, costar. \u2018Horizon: An American Saga\u2019 - Chapter 1 (June 28) Long before \u201cYellowstone,\u201d Kevin Costner roamed the wild American frontier in \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d and he\u2019s clearly not done with the Western genre as this June\u2019s \u201cHorizon\u201d is just the first movie in a series, centered on expansion and settlement both before and after the Civil War. \u201cChapter 2\u201d comes on August 16, with a third installment currently in production. \u2018Despicable Me 4\u2019* (July 3) The Minions are back for another zany romp, with Steve Carell\u2019s Gru and family welcoming a new addition, Gru Jr., and facing off against a new baddie voiced by Well Ferrell. This one is sure to be a known quantity, especially for beleaguered parents looking for a break over July 4th weekend. \u2018MaXXXine\u2019* (July 5) Ti West\u2019s horror trilogy comes to a bloody close with this 1980s Hollywood-set movie starring Mia Goth as an adult film star harboring some killer secrets who is stalked by a slasher. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d comes after West\u2019s impressive 2022 film \u201cX,\u201d and the slightly less convincing \u201cPearl\u201d from later that year. The third entry boasts a phenomenal supporting cast including \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Giancarlo Esposito, Kevin Bacon and singer Halsey. \u2018Fly Me to the Moon\u2019 (July 12) This period piece stars Scarlett Johansson as a PR maven tasked with staging a fake moon landing in case the real one doesn\u2019t take off successfully, opposite Channing Tatum playing the launch director whose job it is to make sure it does. Woody Harrelson costars. \u2018Longlegs\u2019 (July 12) This terrifying-looking thriller stars the prolific Nicolas Cage as a severely demented serial killer leaving occult clues (think \u201cSe7en\u201d) for an FBI agent played by Maika Monroe, the excellent actress who played the final girl in \u201cIt Follows.\u201d The trailer has \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d vibes, in the scariest possible way. \u2018Twisters\u2019* (July 19) Taking a look at weather-related news these days, it\u2019s pretty clear that extreme tornadoes are no longer an odd occurrence deserving of big-budget Hollywood treatment. Nonetheless, \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star Glen Powell is taking over storm-chasing duties from the late Bill Paxton in this almost 30-years-later sequel. Be on the lookout for debris, cows and a possible cameo from Helen Hunt. \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019* (July 26) Almost certainly the blockbuster to beat this summer, the highly anticipated sequel (are you sensing a trend yet?) will see Ryan Reynolds return as the famed Merc with a Mouth, joined for this third go-round by none other than Hugh Jackman, reprising his signature role of Wolverine after (temporarily, anyway) saying goodbye to his claws in 2017\u2019s \u201cLogan.\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is also significant as Marvel\u2019s first R-rated superhero movie, bridging the gap between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the 20th\u00a0Century Fox crop of heroes \u2013 namely the X-Men \u2013 who now belong to Marvel\u2019s parent company Disney. Expect extensive, fourth wall-breaking commentary from Deadpool himself on all of this in the movie. \u2018D\u00ecdi\u2019 (July 26) Coming of age stories are a well-mined area, but this spirited look at a Taiwanese-American 13-year-old boy enjoying the last month of summer before high school in 2008 looks like just the off-kilter and authentic experience that can serve as excellent counter-programming to all the noisier and more mainstream cinematic fare this season. Perhaps make it a double-feature with the aforementioned superheroes, and launch the #DidiPool trend? You heard it here first. \u2018Harold and the Purple Crayon\u2019 (August 2) Based on the popular children\u2019s book by Crockett Johnson, \u201cHarold\u201d stars Zachary Levi (\u201cShazam!\u201d) as the titular owner of a purple crayon that can create anything he imagines. In a bit of a meta moment, he manages to draw himself out of the book and into the real world, where his powers draw the attention of both good and bad players. \u2018Cuckoo\u2019 (August 2) Starring \u201cEuphoria\u2019s\u201d Hunter Schafer in her first lead film role, this horror film looks positively creepy and a bit, well, cuckoo. Schafer plays a young woman visiting a mysterious German Alpine resort with her family. She is soon plagued by horrifically bloody visions and believes a strange woman is following her. The trailer mentions the habits of birds in nature, which definitely ratchets up the ick-factor. Costarring Dan Stevens. \u2018Sing Sing\u2019 (August 2) After his Oscar-nominated turn in last year\u2019s \u201cRustin,\u201d Colman Domingo (who also counts \u201cEuphoria\u201d among his credits) stars in another film based on a true story, this one set at the infamous prison in New York State. In the film, Domingo plays a wrongfully imprisoned inmate who finds meaning through acting in a theatre group alongside other incarcerated men in the penitentiary. Featuring an ensemble cast of formerly incarcerated actors. \u2018Kneecap\u2019 (August 2) This biopic about an Irish rap trio \u2013 who rap in their native Irish tongue \u2013 made a splash at Sundance earlier this year, with the actual trio portraying themselves in the movie. If that\u2019s not enough to pique curiosity, try this \u2013 the film features Michael Fassbender in a supporting role. \u2018Trap\u2019 (August 9) While his daughter\u2019s been busy with her own film (see \u201cThe Watchers\u201d above), M. Night Shyamalan hasn\u2019t slowed down himself, welcoming Josh Hartnett in a plum lead role as a dad taking his kid to the concert of a wildly popular Taylor Swift-like star whose fans are obsessive. Oh, and Hartnett\u2019s character also happens to be a serial killer, and the cops have blockaded the concert venue to trap him (hence the title). The big question is, if we were able to glean all that from the trailer, what could the final Shyamalan twist possibly be at the end? \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 (August 9) Blake Lively stars in this adaptation from the bestselling Colleen Hoover novel, about a traumatized woman torn between her first love and a new relationship, one that reminds her of patterns she\u2019s seen before. Costarring Justin Baldoni, Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj. \u2018Borderlands\u2019 (August 9) In case you\u2019re missing the Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 who took their final bow last summer \u2013 \u201cBorderlands\u201d should have you covered, as the film looks to follow a similarly freewheeling cohort of intergalactic misfits on a valiant quest. Here, they\u2019re led by Oscar-winners Cate Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with Kevin Hart and \u201cBarbie\u201d star Ariana Greenblatt. Based on the bestselling video game. \u2018Alien: Romulus\u2019* (August 16) Just when you thought it was safe to scream in space again, the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise returns, hopefully with a better entry than (at least) the last two. \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe\u201d director Fede Alvarez directs \u201cCivil War\u201d and \u201cPriscilla\u201d star Cailee Spaeny \u2013 who, from the looks of the trailer, seems to be on serious Sigourney Weaver duty \u2013 as she accompanies a group of space colonizers inspecting a derelict space station. It\u2019s a safe bet that they find trouble, and then some. \u2018Close to You\u2019 (August 16) \u201cUmbrella Academy\u2019s\u201d Elliot\u00a0Page stars as Sam, a trans man going home for the first time since transitioning. Once there, he rekindles a romance with an old flame, and must face long-simmering issues. Costarring Hillary Baack and Wendy Crewson. \u2018Blink Twice\u2019 (August 23) Jam packed with a starry cast, \u201cBlink Twice\u201d looks like a perfect late summer movie \u2013 attractive people, elaborate action sequences, and mindless mayhem. This is Channing Tatum\u2019s second entry this summer after \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d here playing a crazy tech billionaire who whisks a cocktail waitress (Naomi Ackie) and her friend (Alia Shawkat) off to his private island for what turns into an insane interlude. Kyle MacLachlan, Christian Slater, Haley Joel Osment and Geena Davis round out the cast. Directed by Zo\u00eb Kravitz. \u2018The Crow\u2019* (August 23) An uber-gory-looking reboot based on the influential James O\u2019Barr graphic novel, which also served as inspiration for the 1994 noir thriller of the same name that starred the late Brandon Lee. The new film stars Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from \u201cIt\u201d) as a brutally murdered man who returns from the dead to avenge his killing and that of his beloved soulmate Shelly (FKA twigs). \u2018Slingshot\u2019 (August 23) Laurence Fishburne and Casey Affleck star in this sci-fi thriller about an astronaut heading to the Titan moon of Saturn who loses his grip on reality when his mission becomes compromised. \u2018Reagan\u2019 (August 30) Dennis Quaid plays Ronald Reagan, a 1950s-era actor who eventually became the 40th President of the United States.

{"id": "2024_06_19_entertainment_justin-timberlake-scandals-timeline", "text": "Justin Timberlake has many fans, along with a few haters. The latter of whom probably aren\u2019t crying a river for the pop singer right now. From a fresh-faced Disney Mouseketeer to a breakout member of NSYNC turned-solo-artist and movie star, Timberlake has had an impressive career spanning three decades. He\u2019s also had more than one moment in an unflattering spotlight. Timberlake survived the public scrutiny about his personal life that follows handsome triple-threats on their rise to fame, an infamous Super Bowl debacle, and, until Tuesday, he made it to age 43 without a mug shot. His arrest in New York for allegedly driving while intoxicated brought out ugly schadenfreude on social media from those who view the incident in which no one was hurt as some sort of pop culture karmic retribution. Timberlake, to them, is perhaps paying for his perceived past treatment of both his former girlfriend Britney Spears and fellow performer Janet Jackson. Some of the same people, undoubtedly, who helped streams of Spears\u2019 2011 single \u201cCriminal\u201d spike after Timberlake\u2019s arrest. Here\u2019s a look back at some of Timberlake\u2019s high and low career moments. Finding love on the job Most boy bands usually have a standout member. Then curly-haired Timberlake vied with JC Chasez for that title when the two, along with Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, came together as NSYNC back in 1995. With hits like \u201cI Want You Back,\u201d \u201cTearin\u2019 Up My Heart,\u201d \u201cBye Bye Bye\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Be Me,\u201d NSYNC rode of wave of popularity in the late \u201990s to become one of the most successful male vocal groups of all time. So it was a match made in paparazzi heaven when Timberlake started dating fellow pop star Britney Spears. The\u00a0pair first met on the set of \u201cMickey Mouse Club\u201d and they reunited in 1998, when Spears opened for NSYNC on tour. Spears and Timberlake made their first public appearance as a couple when they sat together at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, and it wasn\u2019t long before they were memorably wearing matching denim outfits on the red carpet. In fact, 2001 was a big year for the couple: They performed together during the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show, Spears had an iconic performance with an albino Burmese python at the MTV Video Music Awards and it was revealed that she and Timberlake were living together. But they broke up the following year. Timberlake appeared to be pointing fingers at Spears when he released his single \u201cCry Me a River,\u201d which focused on infidelity and featured a Spears look alike in the music video. Success from that single and others on his \u201cJustified\u201d album helped to firmly establish Timberlake as a solo artist. His collaborations with producers The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo), Timbaland and Scott Storch burned up the charts and contributed to the soundtrack for the early 2000s. Years later, in her memoir \u201cThe Woman In Me,\u201d Spears dropped a bombshell, writing that she had become pregnant by Timberlake during their relationship and had an abortion. \u201cIt was a surprise, but for me, it wasn\u2019t a tragedy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I\u2019d anticipated.\u201d Timberlake, she alleged, \u201cdefinitely wasn\u2019t happy about the pregnancy.\u201d \u201cHe said we weren\u2019t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,\u201d she wrote. Timberlake never directly responded to the content featured in Spears\u2019 memoir about their relationship. The end of NSYNC After seven years of making hits, NSYNC stopped performing as a group in the early aughts, but it was a long and loaded goodbye, bye, bye. The band first went on a hiatus in 2002, the same year Timberlake released his first solo album. At the time, Timberlake downplayed how his desires to go solo may affect the band\u2019s future. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason my solo career and NSYNC can\u2019t coexist in the same universe. NSYNC is in no danger. The break we\u2019re on was a conscious move,\u201d he told the New York Post. \u201cWe all wanted to do it, and we were ready to do it. Performing at stadiums every night for 50,000 fans takes a little out of you \u2026 The time was right; we were all in the same zone.\u201d Timberlake never permanently returned to the group, who have over the years spoken more about their split. The five have, however, reunited a few times since, once for a surprise performance at the 2013 MTV VMAs and a decade later to present an award. Fans have been clamoring for new music for years and that intensified after they reunited for the song \u201cBetter Place\u201d for the soundtrack of \u201cTrolls Band Together.\u201d Timberlake stoked that desire this year by including another song with his former group, \u201cParadise,\u201d on his latest album, \u201cEverything I Thought I Was.\u201d He also brought them on stage to perform with him at a show in Los Angeles in March.  Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction It\u2019s been more than 20 years since Justin Timberlake ripped Janet Jackson\u2019s top and exposed her breast during their Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show performance, but many Jackson supporters still aren\u2019t over it. After the incident, hundreds of thousands of complaints flooded into the Federal Communications Commission, CBS (which aired the Super Bowl) was fined and Jackson\u2019s career suffered. Timberlake, then 23, was criticized for not doing more to publicly support Jackson in the aftermath. The pair denied the wardrobe malfunction was a planned publicity stunt and in her 2022 Lifetime documentary, Jackson said she tried to advise Timberlake after the controversy. \u201cWe talked once, and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I should come out and make a statement,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018Listen, I don\u2019t want any drama for you. They\u2019re aiming all of this at me.\u2019 So I just said if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d The event \u201cwas blown way out of proportion,\u201d she added. \u201cOf course, it was an accident. That should not have happened, but everyone is looking for someone to blame, and that\u2019s got to stop,\u201d Jackson said in the documentary. \u201cJustin and I are very good friends, and we will always be very good friends. We spoke just a few days ago, and he and I have moved on, and it\u2019s time for everyone else to do the same.\u201d For his part, Timberlake publicly apologized to both Jackson and Spears in 2021 for his \u201cmissteps\u201d via a social media post. \u201cI specifically want to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed,\u201d Timberlake wrote. \u201cI also feel compelled to respond, in part, because everyone involved deserves better and most importantly, because this is a larger conversation that I wholeheartedly want to be a part of and grow from.\u201d Timberlake did not in his statement offer specific examples of the actions for which he felt regret, but his comments came at a time of renewed conversations about both his performance with Jackson and his breakup with Spears. (Spears was in the midst of a\u00a0high-profile legal battle\u00a0involving to her conservatorship and had found vocal supporters in the wake of the airing of\u00a0\u201cFraming Britney Spears,\u201d\u00a0a documentary examining the singer\u2019s career and the often shameful scrutiny she has faced in the media.) Films and family Beyond No. 1 hits like \u201cSexyBack\u201d off his 2006 album \u201cFutureSex/LoveSounds\u201d and \u201cMirrors\u201d from the \u201c20/20 Experience,\u201d Timberlake found success on the big screen in \u201cThe Social Network\u201d and \u201cBad Teacher.\u201d He also found love, marrying actor and producer Jessica Biel in 2012. The two are parents of sons, Silas, 9, and Phineas, 3. \u201cLove at first sight isn\u2019t limited to the first time you lay eyes on your person. You make me believe that\u2026 because every time I look at you, I fall in love bigger and better than I ever could have imagined,\u201d Timberlake wrote of Biel in a Valentine\u2019s Day post shared on Instagram. \u201cEvery day I get to share with you reminds me how lucky I am to experience love without limits or conditions. You make me laugh like a child and love with a fierceness that takes me aback.\u201d Their affectionate relationship has also faced a few hurdles. In 2019, photographs surfaced of Timberlake holding hands in New Orleans with his co-star Alisha Wainwright while the two were filming the drama \u201cPalmer\u201d in the city. He publicly apologized to Biel in a statement at the time. \u201cA few weeks ago, I displayed a strong lapse of judgment \u2014 but let me be clear \u2014 nothing happened between me and my costar,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should have known better.\u201d He added: \u201cI apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation, and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be. This was not that.\u201d Five years later, Timberlake may be feeling regret once again. He has not yet publicly commented on his DWI charge. An attorney for the singer told CNN Timberlake was also cited for running a stop sign and failure to stay in his lane. Timberlake is currently on his \u201cForget Tomorrow World Tour\u201d and scheduled to perform in Chicago this weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/entertainment/justin-timberlake-scandals-timeline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_entertainment_kevin-costner-horizon-movie", "text": "Kevin Costner wants you to know that his new film, the first part of \u201cHorizon: An American Saga,\u201d is not three hours long. \u201cIt\u2019s two hours and fifty-one minutes,\u201d he told CNN in a recent interview as he sipped on a soothing cup of tea with honey during a busy press tour. \u201cLet\u2019s be really clear about that.\u201d If anyone knows the film\u2019s running time down to the second, it would be Costner. He co-wrote, produced, directed and co-stars in the epic western set around the time of the American Civil War. Costner said he\u2019s been trying to get the film made for decades and has no concerns that the length might be a turnoff to those with short attention spans. \u201cI make movies for people so that they won\u2019t be bored,\u201d he said. \u201cI give them a taste of something in a different direction, which is probably why it\u2019s hard for me to get them made at first \u2018cause they\u2019re a little different.\u201d From any perspective, it\u2019s an ambitious project. There are four planned films with the first \u201cchapter\u201d being released on June 28 and the second in theaters on August 16. The first film sets the scene of a clash between a group of settlers and the indigenous people who already live in the west. Costner is currently filming the third movie. \u201cThese stories and these people, their lives keep evolving and their situations get even more desperate, more thrilling, more is at stake,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because we know them and we care about them, and the third one I\u2019m filming right now is incredibly dynamic.\u201d Fans of Costner\u2019s 1990 film \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d and his role in \u201cYellowstone\u201d are aware of his affinity for westerns, something Costner attributes to the inherent \u201cdrama\u201d of these settings. \u201cIf we can just close our eyes and go back, realize how hard it was because you were going west, but you were also coming up against people who had lived there for thousands of years and didn\u2019t want to let go of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you had no law out there. There was nothing to really protect you. The only thing that was taking you out there was this appetite in America that if you were strong enough and bold enough, you could hold onto something if you were willing to actually defend.\u201d \u201cThat kind of attitude is a recipe for disaster and nothing but clash. And how do you deal with someone who wants what you have? If you do that in a real simple way, it\u2019s boring,\u201d Costner added. \u201cBut if you do that in a way that you realize the dilemma, that must be what  people were going through back then, it can be really very entertaining.\u201d The mix of history and a star-studded cast was heady for Costner, who directs several heavy hitters, including Abbey Lee, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Luke Wilson and more. It\u2019s the kind of film he\u2019s long wanted to see and make. So with all the work directing entails, why did Costner also decide to take on the role of cowboy Hayes Ellison in the film? It was personal, he said. \u201cI felt like I was the guy to play this guy,\u201d Costner said. \u201cYou know, I named my son after him, who\u2019s in the movie [Hayes Costner, 15, makes his acting debut in \u2018Horizon\u2019] and it\u2019s just been a journey for me, too. I just believe in the power of movies.\u201d And while he\u2019s no historian, Costner recognizes the importance of releasing films set pre- and-post-Civil War at a time when America feels divided. He\u2019s hopeful that his project will spark audiences to reflect on how the states came to be united in the first place. \u201cWhat has to occur in any culture in life is a level of empathy, a level of understanding history, really understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can have empathy when you understand history. It\u2019s like we are in this together and we can flourish. If we don\u2019t, we will be divided.\u201d \u201cHorizon: An American Saga\u201d debuts in theaters on June 28.

In the letter, viewed by CNN, Adams wrote that he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the video. \u201cI strongly condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with all survivors of domestic and gender-based violence,\u201d the letter reads. The letter adds: \u201cAfter internal deliberations, the Key to the City of New York committee recommended nullifying and rescinding Mr. Combs\u2019 key.\u201d Combs previously apologized for his actions in the video. Combs, who grew up in Harlem,\u00a0was awarded the key\u00a0in\u00a0September 2023. The award is a \u201csymbol of civic recognition and gratitude reserved for individuals whose service to the public and the common good rises to the highest level of achievement,\u201d according to a press release at the time.

{"id": "2024_06_06_entertainment_house-of-the-dragon-season-2-review", "text": "If the first season of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d challenged viewers with its dizzying list of introductions and disorienting time jumps, the second involves a more straightforward build-up toward a great civil war, where strategy often takes a back seat to vengeance and emotion. Still not the series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was, this prequel now mirrors its barbaric take on palace intrigue well enough to have become bloody good. Once again, the battle for the throne has \u201cYou win or you die\u201d stakes, pitting Queen Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy), her uncle/husband Daemon (Matt Smith) and their assorted forces against Rhaenyra\u2019s childhood friend Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and her sons (who happen to be Rhaenyra\u2019s half-siblings), one of whom, Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), currently claims their late father\u2019s mantle. Living up to the show\u2019s title, both sides of this Targaryen-on-Targaryen faceoff have an arsenal of dragons, which amount to a version of air power in these medieval times, and an almost nuclear-style deterrent against ill-thought-out behavior. While the dragons took a while to grow into players in the original series, here they figure prominently in calculations about military action and seldom disappoint once unleashed. In that sense, while other series have sought to match \u201cThrones\u201d in conjuring spectacle and grandeur (none more so than \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, whose deficiencies owe more to character and story), little on television can truly rival \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u2019s\u201d scope and scale. Happily, under executive producer Ryan Condal (who shares \u201ccreated by\u201d credit with author George R.R. Martin), the new season feels cleaner and more tightly focused, despite juggling existing players while adding a few key new ones. At its core, the women still hold the center, as the initially grieving Rhaenyra must deal with the headstrong Daemon, while Alicent and her father, Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), struggle to manage Aegon, another weak, erratic ruler prone to actions and decisions that risk undermining their cause. HBO made four episodes available, or half of this season, and they certainly don\u2019t rush things in setting up the chess pieces. Still, each hour contains at least one jaw-dropping moment, clearing the high bar set by the pilot episode\u2019s child-birth sequence with this season\u2019s not-for-the-faint-of-heart first episode, which nicely sets the table for much of what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe path to victory now is one of violence,\u201d the Hand to the King, Hightower, muses with grave seriousness. As the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d series, \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d reminds us, going back in time (in \u201cDragon\u2019s\u201d case, about two centuries) in some respects means starting from scratch, at least developing audience allegiance to the characters and keeping track of elaborate timelines and mythologies. After a somewhat rocky takeoff, \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d has seemingly reached its cruising altitude, while continuing to take big creative swings. Although the Emmy-winning \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d might not have stuck the landing, that clearly did little to dampen demand for its muscular, visceral brand of storytelling. Prosecuting the Targaryen war comes with risks, both for those in the show and those responsible for making it. For now, though, this has become a genuinely worthy successor, allowing those with a taste for the wickedness of Westeros to kick back and enjoy the ride. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d begins its second season June 16 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

{"id": "2024_06_09_entertainment_the-day-after-abc-movie-cec", "text": "In November 1983, the US, Soviet Union and the rest of the world were teetering closer than ever on the edge of nuclear war. A NATO military exercise had spooked the Soviets, who thought the exercise was merely a cover for a real nuclear strike on the USSR, prompting them to ready their own nuclear forces. Who knew, then, that an ABC movie-of-the-week would play a significant role in potentially preventing nuclear war? \u201cThe Day After,\u201d a two-hour epic following a few weeks in the lives of small-town Midwesterners before and after a nuclear strike, was one of the most controversial and most-watched TV movies when it aired on November 20, 1983. In its first hour, the people of Lawrence, Kansas, go about their lives as the threat of nuclear war looms. But when the nuke finally comes to Kansas, the devastation is immediate: Acres of crops are singed and poisoned, homes are leveled, a fifth-grade class is vaporized at school. Characters we come to know in the film\u2019s first half are obliterated in an instant or barely clinging to life as they succumb to radiation poisoning. Even those who survive the attack by the film\u2019s end will soon die, viewers know. It\u2019s an uneasy watch now, but \u201cThe Day After\u201d was even more affecting when nuclear war was on the table and top of mind. It\u2019s still one of the most-watched TV events in US history \u2013\u2013\u00a0more than 100 million viewers tuned into its original broadcast, more half of the country\u2019s adult population at the time. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s credited with changing then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s mind against nuclear war. Getting \u201cThe Day After\u201d to air, though, was fraught. Even Reagan, who praised the film in his private writings, didn\u2019t agree with its bleak and upsetting depiction of nuclear aftermath. But the team who created it knew it could be important, so, after rejecting requests for edits, dodging complaints from conservative groups and acquiescing to the occasional network demand, \u201cThe Day After\u201d finally made it to TV and changed the history of the medium \u2013\u2013\u00a0and potentially the world. \u201cThere were all these behind the scenes (challenges) going on, which we working on the film never really knew at the time,\u201d said Jack Wright, an emeritus professor of theater at the University of Kansas and head of local casting on \u201cThe Day After,\u201d in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that the film came out as strong as it did.\u201d Censors thought the film was too graphic \u201cThe Day After\u201d ends with a written warning to the audience: \u201cThe catastrophic events you have just witnessed are, in all likelihood, less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States.\u201d As a made-for-TV movie airing in a primetime Sunday night slot, \u201cThe Day After\u201d couldn\u2019t depict true nuclear horror, though there were still shocking scenes of mass death and the aftermath of a crumbling society. That was the goal, director Nicholas Meyer said. \u201cI wanted to make it like a public service announcement,\u201d Meyer said in the 2022 documentary \u201cTelevision Event,\u201d about the tumultuous production of the film. The script was sparse and plain. Early scenes include a meeting at an art museum between a doctor and his daughter with plans to leave Kansas and a romantic tryst between a young couple days from getting married. We meet husbands, wives, their children and friends so that when they\u2019re ripped away from each other in the second half, their loss will feel almost as sudden as it would if a real nuclear event had separated them. Wright was tasked with casting thousands of extras from Lawrence. In one pivotal scene, more than 1,000 Lawrence locals were made to lie on cots in the University of Kansas\u2019 basketball arena, wearing tattered clothes and bearing bloody facial injuries as though they\u2019d barely survived the nuclear attack. The intensity of the scenes inspired the cast to discuss what they\u2019d do in the event of nuclear war, he said. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re dealing with that kind of subject matter, it sticks in your craw,\u201d Wright said. After seeing rough cuts of the film, though, the network thought it was a bit too devastating. Executives had notes: No blood, no scarring, no burning, said \u201cThe Day After\u201d producer Bob Papazian in the documentary \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d Many scenes were altered as a result: A long shot of a family burning to death as the nuclear bombs fell, as seen in \u201cTelevision Event,\u201d was scrapped, as were shots that focused on survivors\u2019 melting skin or victims\u2019 charred corpses. \u201cYou had to walk a fine line with this movie,\u201d Meyer told the Outline in 2017. \u201cPeople have a remote control in their hands. So we had to make a movie that conveyed the awfulness of nuclear war without making it so awful that you changed the channel.\u201d Stephanie Austin, an associate producer on the film, conducted extensive research on the devastation in places where nuclear bombs have been dropped, like Hiroshima. After the bombing there, much of the land was leveled. The network asked that \u201cThe Day After\u201d avoid showing the extreme destruction that was closer to reality. \u201cI thought we stopped short of telling the real truth,\u201d Austin said in \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d Lawrence locals were largely unaware of the drama brewing behind the scenes and were more excited about the prospect of making a movie, Wright said. \u201cSomething like this had never been done before,\u201d Wright told CNN of the film. \u201cWe were all just playing it by ear. It was amazing to all of us.\u201d Political interference threatened the final cut Before \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, Reagan\u2019s policy involved investing even more in US defenses, including a missile shield proposed to protect the US from a Soviet attack. But scaling up defenses only heightened tensions with the Soviets, who viewed Reagan\u2019s Strategic Defense Initiative as a threat to their own security. On October 10, while at Camp David, Reagan watched \u201cThe Day After,\u201d weeks before it would air on TV. The film, he wrote in his diary, \u201cleft (him) greatly depressed.\u201d \u201cWhether it will be of help to the \u2018anti nukes\u2019 or not, I cant (sic) say,\u201d Reagan wrote of the film\u2019s potential impact on disarmament supporters. \u201cMy own reaction was one of our having to do all we can to have a deterrent & to see there is never a nuclear war.\u201d Even though \u201cThe Day After\u201d resonated deeply with Reagan, his administration asked ABC to make several edits to the film to make it less upsetting for viewers, former ABC Motion Pictures president Brandon Stoddard said in an interview with the Television Academy Foundation. Conservative groups, too, had viewed the film as a potential threat to support for nuclear deterrence, or the policy of letting the nukes do the talking: Their very existence and the potential to use them was meant to prevent the USSR and other countries from launching their own nuclear weapons. The conservative outlet Human Events declared \u201cThe Day After\u201d to be a \u201cpropaganda spectacular\u201d over a month before it even aired, and others conducted letter-writing campaigns to persuade advertisers not to buy ad time during the film, the New York Times reported in October 1983. ABC refused to acknowledge desired cuts and complaints from the Reagan administration or conservative watchdogs, and the film aired its original two-hour cut just days before Thanksgiving in November 1983. In Reagan\u2019s 1984 State of the Union address, which came two months after \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, Reagan finally committed to preventing nuclear war rather than tease scenarios of survivability: \u201cTo preserve our civilization in this modern age, a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\u201d Three years later, Reagan would sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which saw the US commit to reducing its arsenal of nuclear arms. Advertisers hesitated to buy in Before \u201cThe Day After\u201d had even been completed, there were concerns about its graphic content. Stoddard, who died in 2014, was resolute that ABC would air the film anyway.\u00a0He said in the Television Academy interview that he was the one who wanted to pursue a film about nuclear war in the first place \u2013\u2013\u00a0but advertisers were getting cold feet. A few weeks before \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired, the New York Times published a story about psychologists warning families that the film could potentially devastate young viewers and that children under 12 shouldn\u2019t watch it. \u201dI fear children will have nightmares about the show and worry about it for weeks or even months,\u201d one psychologist told the Times. \u201cOlder children and adults may have a sense of hopelessness.\u201d Fearing that \u201cThe Day After\u201d could isolate large swaths of viewers who didn\u2019t want to witness its bleak depiction of nuclear horror, companies largely resisted buying ad space. Companies also worried that their products would be associated with scenes of the destroyed Heartland or vaporized classrooms. To assuage advertisers, ABC allowed most companies to air their commercials during the first half of the film, before nuclear war came to Kansas, UPI reported after \u201cThe Day After\u201d aired in 1983. That way, Orville Redenbacher could hawk popcorn before any graphic deaths occurred. It was a good deal for the companies, Stoddard said: Since ABC had such trouble finding advertisers, it sold spots for as little as $11,000 \u2013\u2013\u00a0ads that were eventually seen by an audience of 100 million. The film has had a lasting impact \u201cThe Day After\u201d was upsetting, as psychologists warned, but also galvanizing. \u201cI vastly underestimated the importance of \u2018The Day After,\u2019\u201d said Kenneth Adelman, the former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency under Reagan, in \u201cTelevision Event.\u201d \u201cThe Day After\u201d brought discussion of nuclear war and the potential for disarmament to millions of people who viewed it, and became the rare film that \u201cactually became historical text rather than vice versa,\u201d wrote William Palmer, a Purdue University professor who discussed its impact in \u201cFilms of the Eighties: A Social History.\u201d \u201cFrom its earliest frames, \u2018The Day After\u2019 sets out to remove the blinders from an uninvolved American populace,\u201d Palmer wrote. \u201cThe Day After\u201d endures today as an artifact of a tense time and a powerful piece of art that changed minds and even influenced policy changes. By making it, the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Tim Grierson wrote last year, Meyer and his team helped \u201csave the world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/entertainment/the-day-after-abc-movie-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

While there were many show-stopping performances and memorable speeches, there were a couple key moments that stood out. From pop culture reunions to first-time winners, here are some highlights from this year\u2019s Tony Awards. Daniel Radcliffe, Sarah Paulson and more win their first-ever Tony awards It was a magical night for \u201cHarry Potter\u201d star Daniel Radcliffe and other first-time winners. After a cheerful performance of a song from \u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\u201d the play in which he stars, Radcliffe won his very first Tony in the best performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical category. \u201cThis has been one of the best experiences of my life,\u201d he said during his speech. Radcliffe\u2019s co-star Jonathan Groff also won his first-ever Tony in the best performance by an actor in a leading role category. Overcome with emotion, Groff spoke about how being a part of the theater community is the \u201cgreatest gift and pleasure of my life.\u201d Sarah Paulson also became a newly-minted Tony-winner, nabbing her first-ever win for best performance by an actress in a leading role in a play for \u201cAppropriate.\u201d Paulson thanked her cast, crew and long-time partner Holland Taylor during her speech. \u201cSuccession\u201d star Jeremy Strong and Kecia Lewis, who in her speech reflected on her 40-year journey to the Tony stage, were also among the first-time winners. Jay-Z and Alicia Keys reunite The cast of Alicia Keys\u2019 ambitious musical \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d performed an energetic medley of songs from the Broadway production by the Grammy-winner. Keys herself, of course, also graced the stage. Midway through her performance of her 2009 hit \u201cEmpire State of Mind,\u201d Keys told the audience she had to \u201cdo something crazy\u201d to celebrate her hometown of New York City. That\u2019s when Jay-Z, who Keys collaborated with on \u201cEmpire State of Mind,\u201d appeared on stage to rap his verse and close out the performance. \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d won two Tonys on Sunday. Angelina Jolie and daughter Vivienne celebrate a big night for \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d the stage adaptation of S.E. Hinton\u2019s 1967 novel, won four Tonys on Sunday, including the coveted best musical award. Actress Angelina Jolie, a lead producer, and her daughter Vivienne, 15, were among those who celebrated its success, including after director Danya Taymor won the Tony for best direction of a musical. During her speech, the mother-daughter duo could be seen wiping away tears. Jolie previously told People that her daughter inspired her to take on the project. Kecia Lewis thanks her doctor In the amusing speeches department, first-time Tony-winner Kecia Lewis thanked her ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor for helping keep her vocal range \u201calive and well.\u201d Lewis won the award for best performance by an actress in a featured role in a musical for \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen.\u201d A number of actors thanked their assistants and publicists at various award shows earlier this year, sparking a trend of appreciating the the oft-overlooked members of their teams in acceptance speeches. Hillary Clinton reminds everyone to vote Arriving to big cheers from the crowd, former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared on stage to introduce a performance by the cast of \u201cSuffs,\u201d the Broadway play she co-produced with Malala Yousafzai and Tony-winner Shaina Taub. \u201cI know a little bit about how hard it is to make change, so I am extremely proud of this original American musical,\u201d Clinton said. The musical is about the Suffragettes, who Clinton said \u201cfought so valiantly for so long to give women in our country the right to vote.\u201d She went on to acknowledge the upcoming election, saying \u201cwe need to be reminded about how important it is to vote.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/entertainment/daniel-radcliffe-2024-tonys-highlights/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_entertainment_the-boys-season-4-review-political-drama", "text": "\u201cThe Boys\u201d began with an intriguing question for our superhero-infused pop culture \u2013 namely, what would happen if extraordinary powers were wedded with corruption, neuroses and corporate greed. Yet that dark, satirical take on the genre has blossomed into TV\u2019s most political drama, a quality even more overtly on display in its much-anticipated fourth season. Put more simply, don\u2019t let the masks and capes fool you. The fact that the latest episodes drop as the US braces for a presidential campaign only magnifies elements that have existed throughout the show\u2019s run on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, becoming the service\u2019s signature series, including the spinoffs \u201cGen V\u201d and \u201cThe Boys Presents: Diabolical.\u201d The fourth season features the usual conflict between superheroes in the uneasy employ of Vought International and those who oppose them. The former cohort begins with the near-invincible, psychopathic Homelander (Antony Starr), whose Superman-like public persona is carefully manicured to hide those qualities, while the latter take their lead from Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), even if they frequently question his methods. The Butcher-Homelander standoff is complicated by their battle for the soul of the latter\u2019s biological son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), which itself encompasses consideration of the question of nature versus nature. More than any season before it, the new arc leans into the political realm thanks to the involvement of politician Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), and efforts by Vought and Homelander to impact the political debate. That includes thinly-veiled references to a group clearly intended to represent QAnon, the conspiracy-minded movement, and the use of propaganda tactics to manipulate the public and voters. At one point, the characters attend an event called Truthcon, where a banner that reads \u201cThere are no conspiracies \u2013 or coincidences\u201d is prominently flown. The show also reveals the private disdain of those in (and with) power toward their supporters, a point made in a uniquely \u201cThe Boys\u201d-esque manner. To punctuate that, there\u2019s a new hero, Firecracker (Valorie Curry), whose political leanings echo Vought News\u2019 conservative commentators (she even gets her own show). As series creator Eric Kripke told Entertainment Weekly, the character serves as a surrogate for \u201cconspiracy-minded movements and the super extreme right-wing news media.\u201d Dispensing with subtlety, Kripke and company have surrounded that satire in violence and excess, qualities that feel organic to this world, where the traditional ideal of heroism is used to obscure brutal realities. Although the Deep (Chace Crawford), an Aquaman-like member of the Vought-backed superhero team known as the Seven, is often a semi-pathetic sources of derision, he sums that mentality up when he comes to the realization, as he puts it, \u201cViolence is power.\u201d Inevitably, the new season involves new, unexpected and uneasy alliances, as well as the thorny (and seemingly perennial) issue of finding ways to neutralize Homelander, which hardly feels like a fair fight. Having earned its reputation as the most gruesome and kinky show on television, \u201cThe Boys\u201d grapples with a certain pressure to fulfill those expectations for the faithful. In its totality, the eight-episode season largely manages to clear that bar (or should one prefer, limbo under it), including a few explosively funny (and not incidentally, grisly) visual gags. Success has also enabled \u201cThe Boys\u201d to play a long game, meaning nobody should expect too much closure from this season when there\u2019s a fifth and final season to come. From that view, the series might have lost some of its freshness but not its ability to surprise and provoke, peeling back its mask a little further to issue a warning about the danger of brightly colored fascism, a message clearly intended to echo beyond its world and into ours. \u201cThe Boys\u201d begins its fourth season June 13 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/entertainment/the-boys-season-4-review-political-drama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Bonnaroo\u2019s move came days after came after Roan, whose given name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, drew an unexpectedly large crowd at New York City\u2019s Gov Ball Music Festival, where she appeared on stage in head-to-toe green body paint dressed as the Statue of Liberty.

I say that not even fully understanding what that means, though I do know it means plenty to fans of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cHouse of the Dragon.\u201d Bring on the fire breathing, as I am fully prepared to be judged for all of what I am about to say. I completely understand fandom. I better, given that I\u2019m an entertainment reporter by both trade and choice. Not to mention that those two shows have been massive hits for HBO, which shares a parent company with CNN. I also admit to some FOMO when others are all in on pop culture obsessions, because I want to play too! And people love them some \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Like seriously love it. My mom will tell you that pop culture has been in my blood almost since the beginning, especially television shows. If you wanted to keep me quiet as a kid, you either handed me a book or you plopped me in front of a television. Especially anything having to do with historical fiction. So it would make sense that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d would be my jam since it\u2019s based on the incredibly popular \u201cA Song of Fire and Ice\u201d fantasy book series by George R. R. Martin. Upon seeing the promotional photos before the series debuted in 2011, I immediately thought \u201cmedieval drama!\u201d and was ready to be all in, starting with the novels. The struggle began when I was reading the first book in the series. I am that annoying type of person who MUST read the book before the thing it\u2019s based on comes out. (I also have to read book series in strict order, but I digress). The first book is titled \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d and I settled in fully expecting to be engrossed by all 694 pages. I even poured my favorite beverage in my chalice goblet to set the mood for what I had heard was a powerful tale of the inhabitants of the fictitious lands of Westeros and Essos. Things didn\u2019t go as planned. I just couldn\u2019t seem to connect with the book, despite Martin being a fine writer. \u201cMaybe I just can\u2019t read it,\u201d I thought, and downloaded it on Audible to listen instead. Dear reader, it became the first audiobook I have ever fallen asleep to while listening. So my expectations were already low when the series debuted. I tried to watch the first few episodes and they seemed too dark to me \u2014 and I\u2019m not just talking about the subject matter. The cinematography seemed so dark, at times I felt like I was struggling to make out the characters. It all felt so\u2026bleak. Add the fact that, as an empath, I really can\u2019t do beheadings, and I decided to tap out. \u2018Succession\u2019 but with swords The show very quickly began to take over my social media feeds and thus began my feelings of being left out of what plenty of people appeared to be enjoying. I tried to sort out why exactly I wasn\u2019t vibing with the \u201cGOT\u201d franchise. Was it because I\u2019m not the biggest fantasy fan? No, I loved \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cShadow and Bone.\u201d Was it the violence? Perhaps, though anyone who knows me (or followed either my writing and/or my social media) knows that I am a huge fan of mob movies. I even wrote an essay inspired by the fact that I rewatch Martin Scorsese\u2019s classic \u201cGoodfellas\u201d at least once a week even though, in fairness, I watch a sanitized version that I recorded off of television so it\u2019s not as violent as the original. The closest explanation I\u2019ve been able to come up with centers on the fact that \u201cThe Game of Thrones\u201d characters aren\u2019t the greatest people, and even the incredibly handsome visage of Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington) doesn\u2019t change that fact. As my editor Megan Thomas pointed out, it really is like \u201cSuccession\u201d with swords. Almost every character has an angle, and most of them aren\u2019t people you\u2019d want as friends in real life. \u201cSuccession\u201d is another hit HBO show by the way, so make of that pattern what you will. When it comes right down to it, even for someone who enjoys watching any and all things having to do with the mafia, \u201cGame of Thrones\u2019\u201d storylines of rape, war and incest felt way too brutal to me. Solace can often be found in community, and I feel like Adam Elkus nailed it in his 2015 Medium piece titled \u201cWhy Game of Thrones Is Making Us Stupid.\u201d \u201cIt is a form of power pornography in which viwers [sic] watch human beings degrade, hurt, betray, abuse, and destroy each other and then compulsively compete to see how can make the most clever gif or Imgur image out of such depravity,\u201d he writes.  Heavy, right? With this weekend\u2019s premiere of the second season of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spinoff \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d I decided to try again. This is the part where I should write something noble about how I feel like a different person or that I am in a different place years later, having survived the pandemic or something like that. The truth is my friend actress LaNisa Renee Frederick has been documenting watching \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d for the first time on her Instagram account and cracking me up with her comments like \u201cThese people need baths,\u201d \u201cIs he gonna die soon,\u201d and \u201cIs he Black? Are there Black people in this?\u201d With remote and snacks in hand I tried again to binge watch \u201cGOT\u201d and \u2026 nope. Still not for me. Before you suggest that I jump straight to watching \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d and abandon all hopes of its predecessor, scroll back to the portion where I mentioned my obsessive need to read things in order. That goes for watching things in order as well, and while it\u2019s technically a prequel, just thinking about doubling back like that feels like I would be disturbing something in the force. (I know that\u2019s a Star Wars reference but, I\u2019m really trying to placate the fantasy fans who might feel tempted to come for my head.) Plus, these days I\u2019m searching for as many things as possible to feel good about. So sorry \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d it doesn\u2019t appear we\u2019re meant to be. Don\u2019t feel sad for me that I\u2019m missing out on all the action of the eagerly awaited second season, because I\u2019m cool with it. And should anyone try to shame you for the same or express that they can\u2019t believe that anyone wouldn\u2019t love \u201cGOT\u201d or \u201cHOTD,\u201d share this piece with them.

{"id": "2024_06_14_entertainment_jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-relationship", "text": "Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are not talking about their current relationship, but they have already said plenty. With reports the pair have hit a rough patch in their almost two-year marriage, many are trying to read between the \u201cBennifer\u201d lines about the couple reportedly putting their house on the market or Lopez\u2019s recent decision to cancel her tour to be with her family. But it appears that the pair have already given us all we need to know about their romance. Just watch \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told.\u201d The Prime Video documentary first released in February as a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez\u2019s short film that accompanied her latest album, \u201cThis Is Me\u2026Now: A Love Story.\u201d It was a lot of J-Lo at once, some criticized too much, but the documentary, in retrospect, is revelatory. Before they wed (twice) in 2022, Lopez and Affleck were previously engaged two decades prior, only to call it off three days before their planned September 2003 wedding over pressures of living in the spotlight. \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told\u201d explores what brought them back together, along with their bond and even their conflicts - in other words an adult relationship. The title and its meaning No one can say Ben Affleck isn\u2019t romantic. He took their correspondence, every letter and email they had written over 20 years and put it in a memory book he titled, \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told.\u201d He presented it to Lopez for their first Christmas together after they reunited. Lopez used the letters as inspiration for \u201cThis is Me\u2026Now,\u201d sharing it with her creative team. \u201cShe would pick one and she would let us touch them and read them,\u201d one songwriter recounts in the documentary. Affleck shares his reaction when he discovered the book had served as source material for his wife\u2019s work. \u201cShe was like \u2018I\u2019ve been reading and the people\u2026this is the kind of inspiration. I\u2019ve been showing them the book,\u201d Affleck recalls in the film. \u201cI was like \u2018You\u2019ve been showing all the musicians all those letters that\u2026\u2019 and they were like \u2018Yeah, we call you Pen Affleck!\u2019 And I was like \u2018Oh my God.\u2019\u201d Though out of his comfort zone, the Oscar-winning producer and writer seems to understand. \u201cI did really find the beauty and the poetry and the irony in the fact that it\u2019s the greatest love story never told,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a record about it, that seems kind of like telling it.\u201d Their different approaches to creativity and fame are what some observers believe may be the cause of possible conflict in their power-coupledom. \u201cThings that are private, I always felt are sacred and special because, in part, they\u2019re private,\u201d Affleck says at one point in the film. \u201cWe\u2019re just two people with different kinds of approaches trying to learn to compromise.\u201d \u201cGetting back together, I said, \u2018Listen, one of the things I don\u2019t want is a relationship on social media,\u2019\u201d Affleck later says in the project. \u201cThen I sort of realized it\u2019s not a fair thing to ask. It\u2019s sort of like, you\u2019re gonna marry a boat captain and you go, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like the water.\u2019\u201d Lopez expresses her appreciation for Affleck\u2019s support. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Ben] is very comfortable with me doing all of this,\u201d she says in the documentary. \u201cBut he loves me, he knows I\u2019m an artist, and he\u2019s gonna support me in every way he can because he knows you can\u2019t stop me from making the music I made\u2026 he doesn\u2019t want to stop me. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s comfortable being the muse.\u201d All of the emotion \u201cThe Greatest Love Story Never Told\u201d begins with Lopez explaining how her reunion with Affleck inspired her to do her first studio album in a decade. She states that her love for him endured in their years apart, but she put to the side. \u201cWhen her and Ben first broke up it was catastrophic to her constitution,\u201d said Dave Meyers, who both directed her music videos years ago and the \u201cThis Is Me\u2026Now: A Love Story\u201d short film. \u201cEverything that she wanted from what she understood love to be, for that to not work, For the pressures to break it apart. That just spun her out.\u201d Lopez recalls their initial split, noting that she felt she had lost her best friend and weeps as she talks about the love Affleck has shown her. \u201cWhat he saw in me, what he allowed me to believe about myself, only comes from love,\u201d she says as tears roll down her face. \u201cNobody else could make me see that about myself. It\u2019s very moving. Because I didn\u2019t think much of myself, and so the world didn\u2019t think much of me.\u201d In one scene, Lopez, worn down by the stress of the project she self-financed, expresses her fears she\u2019s falling short on set, in her marriage and as a mother. In another scene, Affleck is there to encourage her when she worries the visual representation of her new album is going to \u201csuck.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll be scared it\u2019ll suck until it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he reassures his wife and makes her laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta discern between things that suck DNA-wise, and things that just don\u2019t work right.\u201d There\u2019s also plenty of fun. Affleck notes that Lopez\u2019s character in her short film (which she insists is not completely based on her life) is 28 years old, which is not the age she was when they were first together. \u201cBut you were,\u201d she says to Affleck. \u201cYou were. That\u2019s why you were not as smart as me.\u201d Affleck is now 51 and Lopez is 54. When he teases her in the documentary about \u201cwanting to play younger\u201d even in her semi-autobiographical film, she lovingly calls him an \u201cidiot.\u201d Lopez sums up how the couple found their way back to each other after so many years. \u201cWe\u2019re totally different people now. And we\u2019re the same,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we have the same. One hundred percent.\u201d Enough for more chapters in a story that Affleck and Lopez still appear to be writing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-relationship/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

On Tuesday, the Blink-182 drummer launched a new wellness initiative inspired by his recovery from the accident \u2013 called Run Travis Run \u2013 with events taking place in New York and Los Angeles ahead of the band\u2019s two upcoming concerts in those cities. \u201cAfter my accident in 2008, more than 70% of my body was burnt. I was told by doctors that I may never be able to walk or drum again, so I set out to prove everybody wrong, including myself,\u201d Barker said in a statement. He went on to say that his recovery began with short walks, which turned into daily short runs, and that this past year he ran his first half marathon and participated in a few 5K runs. \u201cThe running community is massive and I loved how everyone from all walks of life ran together and supported one another,\u201d his statement read. \u201cThis is what Run Travis Run was built off of and we\u2019re only getting started.\u201d In 2008, Barker and Adam \u201cDJ AM\u201d Goldstein were critically injured when their charter jet crashed upon takeoff in South Carolina. Four other passengers aboard were killed in the crash, including Barker\u2019s security guard, his assistant and the two pilots. Thirteen years later, Barker flew for the first time since the accident with wife Kourtney Kardashian. On Tuesday, Barker launched the Run Travis Run initiative \u2013 a nod to the beloved film \u201cForrest Gump\u201d \u2013 when he posted a video to his Instagram page in which he\u2019s seen reenacting the \u201crun Forrest, run!\u201d scene from the 1994 Tom Hanks-starring classic. The video, directed by Barker\u2019s frequent collaborator Brandon Dermer, also features Kardashian as love interest Jenny Curran (portrayed in the original movie by Robin Wright). The wellness experiences on each coast will include a morning run with Barker and offers a \u201c360-degree experience of health, wellness and mindful explorations,\u201d according to a news release. The initiative will also include fitness classes and mindfulness workshops, along with \u201cexperiential activations\u201d from top brands.
