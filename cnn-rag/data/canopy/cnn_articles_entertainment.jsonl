The result has that calculated, tired feel about it, with a few moments of kinetic action but not enough to make the film play like anything more than a relic. On the plus side, Smith and Martin Lawrence, now in their 50s, still credibly pull off their characters, although frankly, the most memorable action scene \u2013 so good it seems to have parachuted in from another movie \u2013 doesn\u2019t involve them. Everything else about this reunion, including their old-married-couple squabbling and the various callbacks to previous films, has a perhaps inevitably stale quality, from the strains of the familiar song to the bikini-clad background actors the camera scans by to reflect the Miami locale. \u201cBad Boys\u201d begins with Smith\u2019s Mike settling down and Lawrence\u2019s Marcus experiencing a near-death scare that changes his outlook \u2013 a comedic flourish that, like almost everything else, proves underdeveloped. The latest threat, meanwhile, comes by way of a case their late captain (Joe Pantoliano) had investigated involving drug cartels and a ruthless killer (Eric Dane, here portraying the kind of stock villain that might as well be called McBaddie), exposing a web of corruption that forces Mike to reconnect with his son Armando (Jacob Scipio) and the buddy cops to go on the run. Back in the saddle after \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (Michael Bay having established the template on the first two movies), directing team Adil & Bilall don\u2019t scrimp on action and stunts, and unlike the movie they helmed in between, the much-discussed and lamented \u201cBatgirl,\u201d at least this film is getting released. That said, their efforts to bring a hyper-cinematic quality to the action yields a mixed bag, including a sequence that resembles a first-person shooter game. Despite all the blood, the comedy quotient in Chris Bremner and Will Beall\u2019s screenplay also qualifies as being largely anemic. The supporting players, similarly, have relatively little to do, including returnees Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Paola Nu\u00f1ez, a fleeting cameo by Tiffany Haddish, and a puzzling, wasted role for Rhea Seehorn (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d). In a classic example of bad-guy dialogue, Dane\u2019s character mutters after a failed attempt to eliminate Mike and Marcus, \u201cThese guys just refuse to die.\u201d The fourth \u201cBad Boys\u201d might not be enough to kill them, but it does suggest they should emulate much of the Florida population and, when it comes to the buddy-cop biz, consider retiring. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d premieres June 7 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/entertainment/bad-boys-ride-or-die-review-will-smith-martin-lawrence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_04_entertainment_clipped-review-donald-sterling", "text": "In a rare victory for the Clippers over the Lakers, \u201cClipped\u201d is the second recent drama series devoted to one of Los Angeles\u2019 NBA teams but also the superior one, chronicling the spectacular fall of owner Donald Sterling. Rotating among four principal players, with Ed O\u2019Neill as Sterling, it\u2019s an all-star lineup covering a story filled with the kind of outlandish characters that require little embellishment. The title actually has multiple meanings, since audio clips of Sterling saying wildly racist things about Black people attending Clippers games figured prominently in his downfall. Yet \u201cClipped\u201d operates on four distinct if overlapping tracks, each nicely fleshed out and delineated over a relatively brisk six episodes. There\u2019s Sterling, obviously, whose imperious mentality toward his mostly Black players included parading his wealthy friends into the locker room to let them gawk at the athletes. In one of the creepier moments, he takes star Blake Griffin (Austin Scott) by the hand and leads him around, like a child, at a posh party the players uncomfortably attend. Still, the Sterling story really rests on the two key women in his life at the time: His wife, Shelly (Jacki Weaver), who had long put up with her husband\u2019s infidelities; and his assistant, V. Stiviano (Cleopatra Coleman), an aspiring reality TV star who became the featured player in a different kind of reality show by recording her boss, leading to the revelation of his ugly utterances to the world. Finally, there\u2019s Doc Rivers (Laurence Fishburne), the well-traveled coach who took the Clippers job well aware of the headwinds associated with its eccentric owner (\u201cI like a challenge,\u201d he explains early on). Even before the scandal erupted, Rivers had to deal with Sterling prefacing questions about personnel decisions with lines like, \u201cMy dermatologist says everybody\u2019s looking at this guy.\u201d While there\u2019s less basketball than \u201cWinning Time,\u201d HBO\u2019s series about the 1980s Lakers, \u201cClipped\u201d benefits from the fact so many of those involved with the Clippers during this stretch were so flat-out weird, no one more so than Sterling. (It\u2019s almost helpful to watch old clips of him to fully appreciate that O\u2019Neill\u2019s performance isn\u2019t a major exaggeration.) As for Stiviano, there\u2019s a certain poignance to her strangeness, recognizing the 80-year-old owner \u2013 nearly a half-century her senior \u2013 as a golden goose and ticket to where she longs to be, while watching Shelly fume when she cruises up to an event in her shiny Ferrari. Rivers, meanwhile, found himself in a particularly thorny situation as a Black man working for a demonstrable racist, desperately trying to hold his team together and stave off a walkout during a legitimate playoff run, while having TMZ loiter outside his door. Adapted from the ESPN podcast The Sterling Affairs under executive producer Gina Welch, and premiering a decade after the story broke as well as on the eve of the NBA Finals, the series also delves into the challenge facing the league. Sterling is shown dismissing the whole matter as \u201cA big nothing\u201d almost up to the moment when the NBA, under new commissioner Adam Silver, banned him and forced him to sell the franchise in 2014. Hulu has produced a lot of salacious true stories, but few better suited to the limited-series format than this. The Clippers still haven\u2019t won an NBA championship, but \u201cClipped\u201d takes the mess that Sterling unleashed and turns it into a solid-gold winner. \u201cClipped\u201d premieres June 4 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/entertainment/clipped-review-donald-sterling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_atlas-review-jennifer-lopez", "text": "Say what you want about Jennifer Lopez, but streaming algorithms surely love her, which accounts for her parade of recent movies \u2013 \u201cThe Mother\u201d (Netflix), \u201cShotgun Wedding\u201d (Amazon) and \u201cMarry Me\u201d (Peacock), all in the last two years. Add to that \u201cAtlas,\u201d a nonstop sci-fi action movie that basically gets the job done with a plot that recalls Disney\u2019s \u201cBig Hero 6,\u201d just with a lot more cursing. Although \u201cAtlas\u201d hinges on the now ever-popular \u201cartificial intelligence runs amok\u201d theme, that backdrop becomes a transparent excuse to set up a bonding exercise between Lopez\u2019s Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant data analyst who grew up with the AI robot Harlan (Simu Liu), who in turn has lead the rebellion against humanity. Atlas must then team up with another AI robot (voiced by Gregory James Cohan) in order to survive. The movie begins by racing through the devastating AI attack triggered by Harlan, before jumping 28 years into the future, when its title character gets recruited by a pair of military types (Mark Strong and Sterling K. Brown, both underemployed) regarding an opportunity to locate and stop him. After the obligatory chatter about her bad attitude and being ill-equipped for such a mission, she tags along, at which point the film becomes very Lopez-centric for an extended stretch. Of course, the idea of being forced to get to know the thing the protagonist hates and/or fears is a very old conceit, often explored through the prism of science fiction. In that respect, \u201cAtlas\u201d doesn\u2019t turn over new ground conceptually any more than it does with its robot design, which bears a strong resemblance to the oversized armored suits featured in \u201cAvatar\u201d or \u201cAliens,\u201d take your pick. Still, \u201cAtlas\u201d more than anything wants to operate as an action movie, and director Brad Peyton \u2013 a veteran of the Dwayne Johnson vehicles \u201cRampage,\u201d \u201cJourney 2: Mysterious Island\u201d and \u201cSan Andreas\u201d \u2013 keeps the story moving with a check-your-brain-at-the-door level of efficiency, relying on the shorthand of how familiar almost every beat of it feels. Netflix continues to lay down expensive bets on genre movies, with Zack Snyder\u2019s two-part \u201cRebel Moon\u201d among the more prominent recent examples. For her part, Lopez steps into a slightly different role \u2013 and wisely away from another rom-com \u2013 in her dual capacity as producer and star. While it\u2019s not entirely clear how the math works out on that, one needn\u2019t be a particularly brilliant data analyst to identify the boxes Netflix is hoping to check with the J-Lo + sci-fi equation. \u201cAtlas\u201d premieres May 24 on Netflix.

According to the complaint, obtained by CNN, Gesteelde-Diamant \u201cused his age and influence\u201d in the music industry to \u201cmanipulate\u201d the plaintiff Chanaaz Mangroe, a singer-songwriter from the Netherlands in the US on a O-1B \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d visa. The lawsuit alleges he \u201clured\u201d Mangroe \u201cinto an abusive, violent, and manipulative relationship filled with physical assaults, violent sexual encounters, and horrific psychological manipulation.\u201d On one occasion, according to the lawsuit, Mangroe alleges Gesteelde-Diamant raped her in a van \u201cthe same evening that he forced her to engage in sex acts in a public movie theater.\u201d She has asked for a jury trial and is seeking unspecified damages. CNN has asked representatives for Gesteelde-Diamant for comment but has not heard back.\u00a0In a statement his representative sent to the New York Times, Gesteelde-Diamant denied the allegations. \u201cThese claims are untrue and defamatory,\u201d the statement sent to the Times said. \u201cI oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals. As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Mangroe said she needed to tell her story to heal. \u201cChoosing to speak out about the trauma I survived has been one of the most difficult decisions of my life, but ultimately, what Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter,\u201d Mangroe said in the statement on Tuesday. \u201cUltimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal.\u00a0I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\u201d In her complaint, Mangroe describes meeting Gesteelde-Diamant in 2015, when the producer\u2019s team expressed interest in signing her as an artist. Mangroe, who was 23 at the time, alleges in the lawsuit that Gesteelde-Diamant promised to help secure recording and publishing contracts for her and write songs for her \u201clike he did for Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna.\u201d Instead, the complaint alleges, he subjected her to \u201cviolent sexual acts and vicious psychological torture.\u201d The complaint alleges\u00a0that he \u201ccontrolled all aspects\u201d of her life while she was in the US on a work visa. It also alleges Gesteelde-Diamant committed multiple acts of sexual violence against Mangroe, filmed her during sexual acts and\u00a0also\u00a0forced\u00a0her to drink\u00a0\u201cexcessive amounts of alcohol\u201d\u00a0by pouring it down her throat. \u201cThis is yet another horrific example of how men in the music industry use their power and influence to manipulate and harm others,\u201d Mangroe\u2019s\u00a0attorneys\u00a0Douglas H. Wigdor and Meredith\u00a0A. Firetog told CNN in a statement. \u201cWhile she will never fully recover from what he and those who supported him did to her, her willingness to speak out now is evidence of her extraordinary strength.\u201d Wigdor and Firetog also represent Cassie Ventura, who sued Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs in 2023 for rape and abuse. The complaint was settled out of court one day after it was filed and Combs denied the allegations. Combs later issued an apology on his Instagram page after CNN released surveillance footage from 2016 showing him physically assaulting Ventura. Gesteelde-Diamant is a Grammy-winning artist known for writing songs including \u201cUmbrella\u201d by Rihanna, \u201cBaby\u201d by Justin Bieber and \u201cTouch My Body\u201d by Mariah Carey.

Henson is described as internal and quiet, an unlikely showman who would give the world Kermit the Frog, stumble into a family-friendly producing role with \u201cSesame Street\u201d and try, with some frustration, to branch out beyond that with movies like \u201cThe Dark Crystal\u201d and \u201cLabyrinth,\u201d which have come to be more appreciated in later years than when they were released.

Henson was negotiating to sell his company to Disney, in part to get back to making films and away from being preoccupied with business concerns, when he died of toxic shock syndrome in 1990 at 53. A clip of ABC News anchor Peter Jennings sums up the place Henson had come to occupy in the culture, describing the news as being \u201clike a death in the family.\u201d Those close to Henson speak of his restlessness in the doc, which might explain why and how he accomplished so much in a relatively short span, deftly underscoring that with clips ranging from his earliest works to his directing efforts in the 1980s to Orson Welles interviewing him and Oz.

Simpson\u2019s death, Lifetime revisits \u201cthe trial of the century\u201d with \u201cThe Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson,\u201d a project whose title indicates its desire to paint her as more than just a victim. While the producers can\u2019t bring much new to the case, the docuseries talks to the right people in laying out her side of the story. As vivid as the details were when Nicole Brown was brutally murdered in June 1994 and her husband, football star O.J. Simpson, was charged with the crime, certain aspects have surely faded from memory, such as how she was an 18-year-old hostess when he first approached her \u2013 \u201cjust a girl from Laguna,\u201d her sister Dominique Brown says, who \u201cmet a guy that swept her off her feet.\u201d Nicole\u2019s other sisters, Denise and Tanya, join family friends in remembering her, and there are plenty of tears along the way \u2013 including a visit to her grave near the end of the four chapters \u2013 as well as anger about how the media depicted her. \u201cThey were painting her as this party girl,\u201d Denise says, paired with a tabloid picture of her in a bikini on a boat. \u201cThey were painting her as this person that she was not.\u201d The producers (whose credits include Lifetime\u2019s \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d) use old home movies to flesh out Nicole\u2019s seemingly idyllic upbringing, her initial whirlwind romance and the darker side of her marriage to the footballer and actor. That includes going back to the history of domestic-violence calls beginning with Simpson\u2019s first wife, Marguerite, and talking to a retired LAPD detective, Terry Schauer, who responded to an incident at their house. What follows is a dense dissection of Simpson\u2019s controlling nature (which included, a Brown family friend says, insisting that Nicole not breastfeed), his infidelity and his jealousy regarding other men once they separated, particularly her relationship with another standout USC running back, Marcus Allen. Everyone looks a bit older, but there are few stones unturned by the producing team, incorporating interviews with the Brown sisters, Kato Kaelin, Faye Resnick, detective Tom Lange and other peripheral players who figured prominently in the trial. Some of the anecdotes are heartbreaking, with Denise recalling a \u201cgut-wrenching, curdling scream out of my parents\u2019 bedroom\u201d when they were notified of Nicole\u2019s murder. Simpson\u2019s death in April rekindled discussion regarding the case, although the emphasis here stays squarely on how his actions and behavior impacted Nicole, so much so that Denise \u2013 the most outspoken and visible family member during and after the trial \u2013 states right off the bat that she intends to avoid speaking his name. What \u201cThe Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson\u201d won\u2019t do, almost certainly, is change many minds, or rival the depth associated with other past jumps into this story, from the dramatized \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d to the sweeping ESPN docuseries \u201cO.J.: Made in America.\u201d Simpson\u2019s trial captivated the media in large part due to his celebrity and the televised proceedings, echoing through time with renewed attention arising at each major anniversary in the years since. Having watched more of that than is probably necessary (or healthy), Lifetime has credibly added another chapter to that filmography, without significantly advancing the ball. \u201cThe Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson\u201d will air June 1 and 2 at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/entertainment/the-life-and-murder-of-nicole-brown-simpson-review-lifetime/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Trebek captured that with a sly wit and suave demeanor, creating the impression that he knew all the answers \u2013 or rather, questions \u2013 even if that wasn\u2019t necessarily so. \u201cWheel,\u201d by contrast, caught on because of its simplicity, and like a lot of TV game shows, the rather smug sense of superiority the audience could hold toward many of the players. \u201cSeriously, you couldn\u2019t solve the puzzle with only three letters missing, all of them vowels? You deserve not to win that money!\u201d Sajak reinforced that by hosting the show with what felt like an arched eyebrow, while engaging in interactions with contestants that were frequently playful, if occasionally, particularly in recent years, a trifle odd. The mini-controversies included moments where he crankily snapped at players, and in 2023, awkwardly tried to put one in a headlock after he said he was a wrestler. Sajak was working as a TV weatherman in Los Angeles when Griffin hired him to take over \u201cWheel,\u201d replacing Chuck Woolery in 1981. Blessed with a high profile thanks to the show, CBS even hired him to host a late-night program in 1989, in a direct challenge to Johnny Carson\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d \u201cThe Pat Sajak Show\u201d lasted a little more than a year, offering a pretty good demonstration of the adage, \u201cDon\u2019t quit your day job.\u201d The tandem of \u201cWheel\u201d and \u201cJeopardy!\u201d nevertheless remained a well-oiled moneymaking machine. Beneficiaries included the family-run company that distributed the shows, King World, which also held sway over TV stations by selling rights to \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show.\u201d (Run by brothers Roger and Michael King, CBS acquired the company for $2.5 billion in 2000, and Griffin\u2019s company is now owned by Sony Pictures.) Sajak will be replaced by Ryan Seacrest, who has come as close as anyone to replicating the genial on-air persona of another game-show icon, Dick Clark, who, as host and producer, represented another conspicuous tie to a bygone era. Co-host Vanna White, meanwhile, continues with the show, providing an element of continuity beyond the game itself. In 2023, CBS renewed \u201cWheel\u201d and \u201cJeopardy!\u201d for five years, through the 2027-28 TV season, extending their longtime deal with ABC stations in major cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Even amid turmoil and change for the TV industry, \u201cWheel\u201d still averages more than 8 million viewers each week, ranking behind only \u201cJeopardy!\u201d among syndicated shows. Erosion remains a fact of life for linear TV, but that relative status isn\u2019t likely to change, with or without Sajak behind the wheel. None of that should diminish the durability of his tenure \u2013 being invited into people\u2019s homes night after night \u2013 or Trebek\u2019s 37 seasons with \u201cJeopardy!\u201d before his death in 2020. In a video posted by his daughter, Maggie Sajak, Sajak said the show \u201cbecame part of people\u2019s lives, And that\u2019s been awfully gratifying.\u201d As for whether we\u2019re apt to such runs again, as they might put it on the \u201cWheel\u201d set, \u201cPR_BABL_ N_T.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/entertainment/pat-sajak-leaving-wheel-of-fortune/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_entertainment_ryan-reynolds-deadpool-popcorn-buckets", "text": "Ryan Reynolds this week unveiled arguably the most anticipated and sure-to-be coveted merchandise tied to his upcoming film \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d: the movie\u2019s novelty popcorn bucket. Said to be designed by Deadpool himself, the bucket, modeled after Wolverine, features a large opening akin to the quick-healing mutant\u2019s wide-open mouth, complete with the low-key vulgar suggestion of a tongue (it\u2019s from the famously inappropriate Deadpool, after all). In his social media post announcing the buzzy item, Reynolds wrote, \u201cYears from now they will look back at 2024 as the year the War of the Popcorn Buckets began.\u201d What \u201cwar\u201d could he possibly be referring to and why the hype around these movie snack containers, anyway? Popcorn buckets, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, are having a major moment. The first round of 2024 bucket battles, one might argue, was won in March by a \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d popcorn bucket so strange it spawned a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit). The appeal of these buckets \u2013 also referred to as \u201cconcession vessels\u201d or even \u201cCollectible Concession Vehicles\u201d to include specialty beverage containers and the like \u2013 is wide, attracting both seasoned collectors and casual movie fans. \u201cSeeing an item at the movie theater of my favorite characters draws me in,\u201d said collector Shahji Adam in an email to CNN. Adam, who also collects other pop culture products like Funko Pop figures, described his passion for popcorn buckets as \u201cfun nostalgia\u201d for items that help him remember the feeling of watching a particular movie for the first time. A brief history of the bucket Branded popcorn buckets began popping up in the 1990s at Disney theme parks before they made their way to theaters in marketing campaigns. AMC\u2019s Nels Storm, vice president of food & beverage strategy and leader of the merchandise team, points to 2019 as a turning point in the novelty concession vessel\u2019s evolution. \u201cWe experimented with versions of plastic popcorn tubs and beverage vessels with film branding for years. The real inception of the current program kicked off in 2019 when we introduced the R2-D2 vessel to the movie-going public,\u201d Storm said, in reference to the famous android-shaped popcorn containers that came out in support of that year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.\u201d Noting how the R2-D2 buckets sold out at AMC locations around the country on opening night, Storm added that \u201cit was clear there was bigger potential in this space.\u201d Since then, other in-demand popcorn buckets have included the Ghostbusters Ecto-1 car, Thor\u2019s hammer Mj\u00f6lnir, Dominic Toretto\u2019s Charger, the Wonka hat and a Barbie car, Storm said. AMC even recently brought back the R2-D2 popcorn bucket for this year\u2019s May the Fourth \u201cStar Wars\u201d Day, in support of the rerelease of \u201cStar Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.\u201d That bucket is Adam\u2019s favorite, as seen on his TikTok. \u201cIt\u2019s gigantic and I love that the head of R2 is where you put the drink and the body is for the popcorn!\u201d he said. As with many collectibles, some buckets are hard to come by Roland Romero, a popcorn bucket devotee with a YouTube playlist of his impressive collection, noted the vessels are globally popular and not always easy to obtain. Some movie theater chains might be out of region or make the items available for a limited run, Romero said. \u201cThe only trick is that for nearly all these collectable items, guests wanting to get the latest will want to make sure they\u2019re seeing the movie on opening weekend, and in many cases, opening night,\u201d Storm noted. He added that the R2-D2 buckets sold out both times they were made available to the public, and that the Ecto-1 car popcorn vessel \u201cflew out of the theatres during the initial hours\u201d of \u201cGhostbusters Afterlife\u2019s\u201d opening night in November 2021. What\u2019s coming next in this bucket \u2018war\u2019 Theater chains are eager to entice audiences to come and eat popcorn at the movies instead of on their couches at home, so that means more sassy snack holders to come. \u201cThe sky is the limit,\u201d with where things might go, Storm said, adding that AMC is \u201calways pushing boundaries\u201d to make going to the movies a fun and worthwhile event. And if you thought reaching into the giant mouth of a sandworm from Arrakis was gross, just wait until other horror-related merchandising items come down the pike. Adam said that because he\u2019s a horror movie fan, he\u2019s excited for the \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d bucket, which is rumored to be in the form of a Xenomorph \u2013 or, the extremely dangerous and disgusting, two-mouthed, acid-for-blood extraterrestrial at the center of that storied franchise. Be warned. The battle continues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/entertainment/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-popcorn-buckets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_31_entertainment_the-great-lillian-hall-review-jessica-lange", "text": "Jessica Lange met the movie public perched in King Kong\u2019s giant palm, but her real breakthrough came in 1982 when she played a pair of actresses, earning Oscar nominations for both roles: as a fictional soap-opera star in \u201cTootsie\u201d and the real-life Frances Farmer in the tragic biography \u201cFrances\u201d (she won a statuette for the former). In a way, Lange\u2019s storied career comes full circle with \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall,\u201d playing an aging Broadway star in a movie HBO acquired and is premiering on the final day of Emmy eligibility, no doubt hoping that there are additional accolades, and perhaps awards hardware, in her future. As a format, the TV movie has surely seen better days (limited series have largely supplanted them), and \u201cLillian Hall\u201d is a modestly scaled production, punctuated by a trio of female leads: Lange as the title character, billed as \u201cthe first lady of the American theater;\u201d Kathy Bates as her loyal assistant; and Lily Rabe (like Lange, a veteran of producer Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d repertory company) as her daughter. While rehearsing for a play with an avant-garde director (Jesse Williams), Lillian begins forgetting lines and experiencing other memory lapses, clear signs that she might be in the early throes of dementia. Her first reaction, though, leans toward denial, then defiance, while gradually triggering uncertainty for those around her about a show that suddenly might be as difficult to put on with her as without her. Directed by Michael Cristofer from Elisabeth Seldes\u2019 screenplay, the film doesn\u2019t turn over new ground but nevertheless yields poignant moments, primarily in the interplay between Lange \u2013 a fierce lioness in winter, hungry for one more curtain call \u2013 and Bates, who could play this part in her sleep and still makes the most of it. \u201cWill you remind me who I was?\u201d Lillian asks, a line that beautifully captures the fear associated with her condition. Although Lange has kept busy working for Murphy in recent years \u2013 including her turn as another actor, Joan Crawford, in \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan,\u201d about the rivalry between Crawford and Bette Davis \u2013 the new film feels like a nice bookend to those earlier roles. At the same time, \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall\u201d operates as a love letter to the theater while catering to those who can appreciate an \u201cAll About Eve\u201d reference or two. \u201cI am not some broken-down old Chevy,\u201d Lillian rages at one point. The movie works hard to reinforce that message by providing Lange with a worthy showcase, in a vehicle that might be light on horsepower but feels as polished as its central character. \u201cThe Great Lillian Hall\u201d premieres May 31 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/entertainment/the-great-lillian-hall-review-jessica-lange/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

By the 1994 sequel, the character is implored by her former friends to once again become Sister Mary Clarence to help the choir at the fictitious St. Francis Academy in San Francisco. So it made sense for Goldberg to host a reunion show Wednesday on the ABC daytime talk series she helps moderate. She was joined by cast members Sheryl Lee Ralph, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, Ryan Toby, Tanya Trotter (who was Tanya Blount when she appeared in the film), David Kater, Monica Calhoun, Dionna Nichelle, Alex Martin, Frank Odell Howard, Jermaine Montell, DeeDee Magno Hall, Ashley Thompson and Deondray Gossfield, as well as Marc Shaiman and Mervyn Warren who contributed music for the film The cast members helped Goldberg kick off the show by reenacting their performance of \u201cOh Happy Day\u201d from the movie. Later they were joined by students from New York City\u2019s LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts for a rousing performance of \u201cJoyful, Joyful,\u201d which was also pivotal to the film.

{"id": "2024_05_30_entertainment_young-woman-and-the-sea-review-daisy-ridley", "text": "The only wrinkles in \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d are the ones Daisy Ridley likely developed spending all that time in the water, but the movie presents such a stirring true story, so efficiently told, that really shouldn\u2019t matter. Like Trudy Ederle swimming the English Channel, knowing where you\u2019re going, in this case, isn\u2019t as significant as the near-irresistible, awe-inspiring act of getting there. Granted, the title almost sounds like the marketing department threw in the towel on anything more appealing (its echoes of Ernest Hemingway notwithstanding), except that it\u2019s actually derived from the book, \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea: How Trudy Ederle Conquered the English Channel and Inspired the World,\u201d on which the film is based. In addition, the movie was originally destined to premiere on Disney+, until producer Jerry Bruckheimer (and according to the trade papers, positive audience testing) prompted the studio to give it a shot in the increasingly shark-infested theatrical waters, where its future appears uncertain. Wherever one sees it, \u201cYoung Woman\u201d possesses plenty of old-school charms, reflecting a triumph of the human spirit and endurance that (aided significantly by Amelia Warner\u2019s musical score) buoys the soul. In that regard it joins a long list of classic sports movies, perhaps even more than its recent cousins, the swim-themed Netflix film \u201cNyad\u201d and George Clooney\u2019s Olympic tale \u201cThe Boys in the Boat.\u201d Ridley has stayed busy in smaller films since her high-profile \u201cStar Wars\u201d stint, but few that showcase her innate likability better than this one. Then again, it\u2019s hard not to root for Trudy, born to German immigrant parents, who overcame measles as a child and the \u201cold ways\u201d insisted upon by her father (\u201cKilling Eve\u2019s\u201d Kim Bodnia) to become an Olympic-caliber swimmer, competing in the 1924 Games before undertaking the grueling 21-mile swim of the English Channel two years later. Ederle faced formidable tides in and out of the water, the latter in the form of overt sexism, offset by her steely mom (Jeanette Hain), supportive sister (Tilda Cobham-Hervey, who played Helen Reddy in \u201cI Am Woman\u201d) and demanding coach (Sian Clifford), as well as another swimmer (Stephen Graham) who recognizes her grit and potential. Norwegian director Joachim R\u00f8nning (\u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d) and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (2019\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d) both have Disney credentials, but \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d possesses the throwback feel of live-action fare that flourished long before fretting about theatrical windows became an overriding concern. The inevitable closing crawl and old newsreel footage merely adds heft to the story, in a way that feels a bit timelier 100 years after Ederle competed in the Olympics. Whether destined for consumption in a theater or via streaming, \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d is an exercise in the simple power of a well-told story, the kind that can wash over and uplift you all at once. \u201cYoung Woman the Sea\u201d premieres May 31 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/entertainment/young-woman-and-the-sea-review-daisy-ridley/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_05_entertainment_jake-gyllenhaal-peter-sarsgaard-presumed-innocent", "text": "Jake Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard might be part of the same sprawling showbiz family, but their on-set etiquette is quite different from the dynamic they share as family around the dinner table. When time came for Gyllenhaal to help cast the upcoming Apple TV+ series \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d in which he stars and serves as an executive producer, he knew that Sarsgaard \u2013 who is married to his sister, actor and director Maggie Gyllenhaal \u2013 would be a perfect fit for one of the roles. \u201cPeter is such an incredible actor because he demands, in the space of acting or in the scene, a type of honesty and I think that\u2019s the same thing he asks for as a person,\u201d Gyllenhaal said in a recent interview with CNN. \u201cThe fictional world that you\u2019re working in on a project is a whole other thing, and it\u2019s a craft and it\u2019s something that we gratefully know very well.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m a little bit of a different version of myself when I\u2019m working in general,\u201d Sarsgaard said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to meet in a different place like that with someone that you know so well in your life, and we\u2019ve done a number of things together but it\u2019s not a lot of overall time.\u201d \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d is an eight-part miniseries based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Scott Turow, which was previously adapted into a 1990 feature film starring Harrison Ford. It\u2019s a courtroom thriller that follows Rusty Sabich (Gyllenhaal), a Chicago-based prosecutor who becomes entangled in the horrific murder of one of his colleagues. While the pair of brothers-in-law \u2013 who previously costarred in various films including 2005\u2019s \u201cJarhead,\u201d 2007\u2019s \u201cRendition\u201d and 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Guilty\u201d \u2013 enjoy banter offscreen, in \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard\u2019s characters find themselves at odds, as Sarsgaard plays another prosecutor in Sabich\u2019s office who suspects his colleague of wrongdoing. But when the cameras are off, according to Gyllenhaal, they both agree that family always comes first. \u201cI think most important to both of us, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say this, is our family and loving them and protecting them and being there for them and it takes priority over everything,\u201d he said. The Gyllenhaal siblings previously costarred in the beloved 2001 psychological thriller \u201cDonnie Darko,\u201d among other projects, and Sarsgaard starred in \u201cThe Lost Daughter\u201d in 2021, which his wife directed. The group will continue to keep things all in the family when Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard will reunite on Maggie Gyllenhaal\u2019s next directorial endeavor \u201cThe Bride!\u201d in 2025, according to Collider. And, no \u2013 Sarsgaard did not need to go through the formality of auditioning for his part in \u201cPresumed Innocent.\u201d \u201cWhen he\u2019s the producer, he calls me and asks me if I want to play the part,\u201d Sarsgaard said, with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice.\u201d The first two episodes of \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d will be available to stream on Apple TV+ on June 12, with a new episode streaming each week until July 24.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/entertainment/jake-gyllenhaal-peter-sarsgaard-presumed-innocent/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

On Wednesday, the singer and actor \u2013 who uses the pronouns she/they \u2013 revealed on Instagram that in 2022, they were \u201cfirst diagnosed with Lupus SLE and then a rare T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.\u201d After stating that they were ready to share more about their health after a period of uncertainty, Halsey wrote, \u201cYou\u2019ve all been so kind so I want to share a bit more.\u201d They also wrote that both the lupus and lymphoproliferative disorder \u201care currently being managed or in remission\u201d and that both \u201cI will likely have for the duration of my life.\u201d Lupus is an autoimmune disease in which the body\u2019s immune system attacks healthy cells leading to pain, fever, rashes, organ damage and other symptoms. T-cells are a type of immune cell, and lymphoproliferative disorders are conditions that cause the body to make uncontrolled amounts of white blood cells called lymphocytes. \u201cAfter a rocky start, I slowly got everything under control with the help of amazing doctors,\u201d Halsey continued. \u201cAfter 2 years, I\u2019m feeling better and I\u2019m more grateful than ever to have music to turn to.\u201d On Tuesday, fans of Halsey expressed their support after the singer posted a prior confessional, saying \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be alive.\u201d The \u201cWithout Me\u201d star updated followers, writing: \u201clong story short, i\u2019m Lucky to be alive. short story long, i wrote an album. it begins with The End. out now.\u201d The message was accompanied by a series of short video clips, the first of which showed Halsey sitting down and continuously rubbing their legs. \u201cSeriously, seriously\u2026 like an old lady,\u201d the 29-year-old said in the video. \u201cI told myself I\u2019m going to give myself two more years to be sick. \u201cAt 30 I\u2019m having a rebirth and I\u2019m not going to be sick and I\u2019m going to look super-hot and have lots of energy and I\u2019m just going to get to redo my 20s in my 30s.\u201d One user reacted: \u201cHalsey is the voice for so many chronically ill.

{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_summer-movie-preview-2024", "text": "It may feel like not long ago, but a year has passed since the summer of \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d and Hollywood is hoping for another season of enthusiastic audiences and perhaps an unlikely but viral cinematic pairing. (\u201c#Garfiosa,\u201d anyone?) Some things about this summer\u2019s slate of movies feel similar \u2013 namely, a lot of sequels on offer \u2013 while other elements feel a bit different, like the lingering hangover from last year\u2019s twin strikes that brought movie production to a months-long standstill. Nevertheless, there are more than a few characters sure to distract from that with their showy antics, some masked and mouthy (here\u2019s looking at you, Deadpool) and others aiming to turn our emotions \u201cInside Out\u201d all over again. Behold a list of the most buzzy movies being released theatrically between Memorial and Labor Day Weekends, 2024. For ease of reference, any sequel, prequel or reboot is marked with an asterisk: \u2018Furiosa\u2019* (May 24) George Miller\u2019s fifth foray into the gnarly post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max, \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d explores the origins of the titular character originated by Charlize Theron in 2015\u2019s Oscar-winning epic \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d Here, Furiosa is played to the mettle by Anya Taylor-Joy, with villainous antics (and a prosthetic nose) supplied by Chris Hemsworth. \u2018The Garfield Movie\u2019 (May 24) Chris Pratt gets to add another voice credit to his list of animated roles after last year\u2019s hit \u201cMario Bros. Movie\u201d with \u201cGarfield,\u201d following the famously lethargic ginger cat hailing from the comic strips of yore. Joining Pratt as the titular cat in this family-friendly romp are Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein, along with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars Cecily Strong and Bowen Yang. \u2018Ezra\u2019 (May 31) Robert De Niro joins Bobby Cannavale and Rose Byrne in this drama about a comedian who is father to an autistic child, and the unexpected road trip they embark upon. Whoopi Goldberg, Vera Farmiga and Tony Goldwyn (who also directs) costar. Introducing William A. Fitzgerald in the title role as Ezra. \u2018Robot Dreams\u2019 (May 31) Nominated for best animated feature at the Academy Awards earlier this year, \u201cRobot Dreams\u201d is the winsome tale of a dog, named Dog, and his new robot friend named\u2026 you guessed it, Robot. This one gets extra points for being a period piece, of sorts, taking place in New York City in the 1980s. \u2018Summer Camp\u2019 (May 31) This \u201cBook Club\u201d-esque take on three friends from summer camp reuniting later in life for another hurrah stars Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard and Eugene Levy in what (inexplicably) looks to be the role of the hunk they fawned over as youngsters. With this plus \u201cBook Club,\u201d its sequel last year as well as \u201cPoms,\u201d Keaton looks to be launching her very own genre. \u2018Bad Boys: Ride or Die\u2019* (June 7) Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back for a fourth go-round of this buddy comedy/action hybrid, with the twist being that this time, they\u2019re on the run (according to the IMDb logline). The movie, costarring Vanessa Hudgens, follows 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life\u201d (it seems that title\u2019s promise didn\u2019t quite stick). \u2018The Watchers\u2019 (June 7) The nepo baby phenomenon extends beyond actors, as this June entry marks the feature directorial debut of one Ishana Shyamalan, daughter to M. Night (she gained footing on his Apple TV+ series \u201cServant\u201d). The film looks dutifully creepy, and stars the talented Dakota Fanning (\u201cRipley\u201d) as an artist who finds herself in a strange forest in Ireland. Soon, that becomes the least of her problems. \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 (June 7) You read that right \u2013 this 1999 international classic is being rereleased with a 4K restoration to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie\u2019s original US debut. Starring Franka Potente and directed by the visionary Tom Tykwer, \u201cLola\u201d follows a young woman in Berlin who has 20 minutes to get across town to her boyfriend \u2013 and find 100,000 Deutche Marks on the way \u2013 or else he dies. As time ticks by and Lola makes split-second decisions, her life and that of those around her become remarkably altered. \u2018Inside Out 2\u2019* (June 14) Almost a decade (!!) since Pixar\u2019s Oscar-winning exploration into the mind and emotions of one young Riley, Amy Poehler and company are back as Riley grows into her teen years. Several new emotions will be at play, including Anxiety (voiced by \u201cStranger Things\u2019\u201d Maya Hawke), Envy (\u201cThe Bear\u201d star Ayo Edebiri), embarrassment and even ennui. Oh, to be a teen once again. \u2018Treasure\u2019 (June 14) \u201cGirls\u201d star and creator Lena Dunham and \u201cWilde\u201d actor Stephen Fry play a daughter and father who travel to Poland in the early 1990s to explore the latter\u2019s roots. But the specter of his trauma from surviving the Holocaust causes him to try to sabotage their trip, as the pair nonetheless face the past and grow closer in the process. \u2018Kinds of Kindness\u2019 (June 21) After last year\u2019s surprisingly bizarre and very acclaimed \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is the next team-up between two-time Oscar-winner Emma Stone and \u201cPoor Things\u201d director Yorgos Lanthimos. The new film is billed as a dark \u201ctriptych fable,\u201d costarring Willem Dafoe, \u201cCivil War\u201d actor Jesse Plemons,\u00a0Margaret Qualley, \u201cThe Whale\u201d star Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Mamoudou Athie and \u201cEuphoria\u201d rising star Hunter Schafer. \u2018The Bikeriders\u2018 (June 21) The next starring vehicle for \u201cElvis\u201d actor Austin Butler, \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d looks like a mashup of \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d and \u201cMidnight Cowboy,\u201d with Butler at the head of a rough and tumble biker gang in \u201960s Chicago. Costarring Tom Hardy and \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star\u00a0Jodie Comer. \u2018Thelma\u2019 (June 21) Marking her first lead role, \u201cThelma\u201d stars 94-year-old June Squibb as the titular senior who is targeted in a phone scam and decides to take matters into her own hands to get back what\u2019s hers. The Oscar-nominated \u201cNebraska\u201d star is joined in the new movie by \u201cThe White Lotus\u2019s\u201d Fred Hechinger, who plays her grandson. \u2018A Quiet Place: Day One\u2019* (June 28) This prequel sure looks like it\u2019ll make a lot of noise. The latest entry in John Krasinski\u2019s super sound-sensitive alien invasion franchise, \u201cDay One\u201d stars Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o and will focus on when the vicious beasts first arrive and begin wreaking havoc. \u201cStranger Things 4\u201d breakout star Joseph Quinn, along with franchise returnee Djimon Hounsou, costar. \u2018Horizon: An American Saga\u2019 - Chapter 1 (June 28) Long before \u201cYellowstone,\u201d Kevin Costner roamed the wild American frontier in \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d and he\u2019s clearly not done with the Western genre as this June\u2019s \u201cHorizon\u201d is just the first movie in a series, centered on expansion and settlement both before and after the Civil War. \u201cChapter 2\u201d comes on August 16, with a third installment currently in production. \u2018Despicable Me 4\u2019* (July 3) The Minions are back for another zany romp, with Steve Carell\u2019s Gru and family welcoming a new addition, Gru Jr., and facing off against a new baddie voiced by Well Ferrell. This one is sure to be a known quantity, especially for beleaguered parents looking for a break over July 4th weekend. \u2018MaXXXine\u2019* (July 5) Ti West\u2019s horror trilogy comes to a bloody close with this 1980s Hollywood-set movie starring Mia Goth as an adult film star harboring some killer secrets who is stalked by a slasher. \u201cMaXXXine\u201d comes after West\u2019s impressive 2022 film \u201cX,\u201d and the slightly less convincing \u201cPearl\u201d from later that year. The third entry boasts a phenomenal supporting cast including \u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Giancarlo Esposito, Kevin Bacon and singer Halsey. \u2018Fly Me to the Moon\u2019 (July 12) This period piece stars Scarlett Johansson as a PR maven tasked with staging a fake moon landing in case the real one doesn\u2019t take off successfully, opposite Channing Tatum playing the launch director whose job it is to make sure it does. Woody Harrelson costars. \u2018Longlegs\u2019 (July 12) This terrifying-looking thriller stars the prolific Nicolas Cage as a severely demented serial killer leaving occult clues (think \u201cSe7en\u201d) for an FBI agent played by Maika Monroe, the excellent actress who played the final girl in \u201cIt Follows.\u201d The trailer has \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d vibes, in the scariest possible way. \u2018Twisters\u2019* (July 19) Taking a look at weather-related news these days, it\u2019s pretty clear that extreme tornadoes are no longer an odd occurrence deserving of big-budget Hollywood treatment. Nonetheless, \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star Glen Powell is taking over storm-chasing duties from the late Bill Paxton in this almost 30-years-later sequel. Be on the lookout for debris, cows and a possible cameo from Helen Hunt. \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019* (July 26) Almost certainly the blockbuster to beat this summer, the highly anticipated sequel (are you sensing a trend yet?) will see Ryan Reynolds return as the famed Merc with a Mouth, joined for this third go-round by none other than Hugh Jackman, reprising his signature role of Wolverine after (temporarily, anyway) saying goodbye to his claws in 2017\u2019s \u201cLogan.\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d is also significant as Marvel\u2019s first R-rated superhero movie, bridging the gap between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the 20th\u00a0Century Fox crop of heroes \u2013 namely the X-Men \u2013 who now belong to Marvel\u2019s parent company Disney. Expect extensive, fourth wall-breaking commentary from Deadpool himself on all of this in the movie. \u2018D\u00ecdi\u2019 (July 26) Coming of age stories are a well-mined area, but this spirited look at a Taiwanese-American 13-year-old boy enjoying the last month of summer before high school in 2008 looks like just the off-kilter and authentic experience that can serve as excellent counter-programming to all the noisier and more mainstream cinematic fare this season. Perhaps make it a double-feature with the aforementioned superheroes, and launch the #DidiPool trend? You heard it here first. \u2018Harold and the Purple Crayon\u2019 (August 2) Based on the popular children\u2019s book by Crockett Johnson, \u201cHarold\u201d stars Zachary Levi (\u201cShazam!\u201d) as the titular owner of a purple crayon that can create anything he imagines. In a bit of a meta moment, he manages to draw himself out of the book and into the real world, where his powers draw the attention of both good and bad players. \u2018Cuckoo\u2019 (August 2) Starring \u201cEuphoria\u2019s\u201d Hunter Schafer in her first lead film role, this horror film looks positively creepy and a bit, well, cuckoo. Schafer plays a young woman visiting a mysterious German Alpine resort with her family. She is soon plagued by horrifically bloody visions and believes a strange woman is following her. The trailer mentions the habits of birds in nature, which definitely ratchets up the ick-factor. Costarring Dan Stevens. \u2018Sing Sing\u2019 (August 2) After his Oscar-nominated turn in last year\u2019s \u201cRustin,\u201d Colman Domingo (who also counts \u201cEuphoria\u201d among his credits) stars in another film based on a true story, this one set at the infamous prison in New York State. In the film, Domingo plays a wrongfully imprisoned inmate who finds meaning through acting in a theatre group alongside other incarcerated men in the penitentiary. Featuring an ensemble cast of formerly incarcerated actors. \u2018Kneecap\u2019 (August 2) This biopic about an Irish rap trio \u2013 who rap in their native Irish tongue \u2013 made a splash at Sundance earlier this year, with the actual trio portraying themselves in the movie. If that\u2019s not enough to pique curiosity, try this \u2013 the film features Michael Fassbender in a supporting role. \u2018Trap\u2019 (August 9) While his daughter\u2019s been busy with her own film (see \u201cThe Watchers\u201d above), M. Night Shyamalan hasn\u2019t slowed down himself, welcoming Josh Hartnett in a plum lead role as a dad taking his kid to the concert of a wildly popular Taylor Swift-like star whose fans are obsessive. Oh, and Hartnett\u2019s character also happens to be a serial killer, and the cops have blockaded the concert venue to trap him (hence the title). The big question is, if we were able to glean all that from the trailer, what could the final Shyamalan twist possibly be at the end? \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 (August 9) Blake Lively stars in this adaptation from the bestselling Colleen Hoover novel, about a traumatized woman torn between her first love and a new relationship, one that reminds her of patterns she\u2019s seen before. Costarring Justin Baldoni, Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj. \u2018Borderlands\u2019 (August 9) In case you\u2019re missing the Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 who took their final bow last summer \u2013 \u201cBorderlands\u201d should have you covered, as the film looks to follow a similarly freewheeling cohort of intergalactic misfits on a valiant quest. Here, they\u2019re led by Oscar-winners Cate Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with Kevin Hart and \u201cBarbie\u201d star Ariana Greenblatt. Based on the bestselling video game. \u2018Alien: Romulus\u2019* (August 16) Just when you thought it was safe to scream in space again, the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise returns, hopefully with a better entry than (at least) the last two. \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe\u201d director Fede Alvarez directs \u201cCivil War\u201d and \u201cPriscilla\u201d star Cailee Spaeny \u2013 who, from the looks of the trailer, seems to be on serious Sigourney Weaver duty \u2013 as she accompanies a group of space colonizers inspecting a derelict space station. It\u2019s a safe bet that they find trouble, and then some. \u2018Close to You\u2019 (August 16) \u201cUmbrella Academy\u2019s\u201d Elliot\u00a0Page stars as Sam, a trans man going home for the first time since transitioning. Once there, he rekindles a romance with an old flame, and must face long-simmering issues. Costarring Hillary Baack and Wendy Crewson. \u2018Blink Twice\u2019 (August 23) Jam packed with a starry cast, \u201cBlink Twice\u201d looks like a perfect late summer movie \u2013 attractive people, elaborate action sequences, and mindless mayhem. This is Channing Tatum\u2019s second entry this summer after \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d here playing a crazy tech billionaire who whisks a cocktail waitress (Naomi Ackie) and her friend (Alia Shawkat) off to his private island for what turns into an insane interlude. Kyle MacLachlan, Christian Slater, Haley Joel Osment and Geena Davis round out the cast. Directed by Zo\u00eb Kravitz. \u2018The Crow\u2019* (August 23) An uber-gory-looking reboot based on the influential James O\u2019Barr graphic novel, which also served as inspiration for the 1994 noir thriller of the same name that starred the late Brandon Lee. The new film stars Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from \u201cIt\u201d) as a brutally murdered man who returns from the dead to avenge his killing and that of his beloved soulmate Shelly (FKA twigs). \u2018Slingshot\u2019 (August 23) Laurence Fishburne and Casey Affleck star in this sci-fi thriller about an astronaut heading to the Titan moon of Saturn who loses his grip on reality when his mission becomes compromised. \u2018Reagan\u2019 (August 30) Dennis Quaid plays Ronald Reagan, a 1950s-era actor who eventually became the 40th President of the United States. Prepare for extensive debates on how the figure is portrayed here. With Penelope Ann Miller as Nancy Reagan.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/summer-movie-preview-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_entertainment_queer-planet-review-pride-month", "text": "The expected conservative media quadrants lashed out at \u201cQueer Planet,\u201d a Peacock documentary about queer behavior in the animal kingdom, which, in terms of getting attention, already represents a kind of win for the NBC-owned streaming service. Yet the Pride month-themed special does represent an intriguing wrinkle on the nature documentary \u2013 providing more depth and nuance than the occasional headline about \u201cgay penguins\u201d \u2013 while adopting a playfully irreverent tone that seeks to make the material more accessible than what viewers have come to associate with, say, Sir David Attenborough\u2019s body of work. While casual viewers of nature fare will likely be familiar with the aforementioned penguins and the extremely sexual bonobos, \u201cQueer Planet\u201d casts a much wider net, incorporating footage documented in the wild about coalitions of male lions, giraffes (\u201csuper queer,\u201d says biologist Antonia Forster), flamingos, dolphins, hyenas, bighorn sheep, macaques, and more. There\u2019s even a section about clownfish, with a researcher noting the males can change gender, suggesting wryly that the dad in \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d might have easily become a mom after he was widowed. Actor Andrew Rannells gets into the spirit with his narration \u2013 which begins by noting that nature is \u201cmore queer than you could possibly imagine\u201d \u2013 as do some of the academics interviewed. The most interesting aspect of \u201cQueer Planet,\u201d though, is how the Victorian mores of early scientists, beginning with Charles Darwin (\u201cHe was of his time,\u201d Forster notes), informed and influenced the way they addressed \u2013 and for the most part, ignored \u2013 evidence of queer behavior in animal populations, writing them off as dominance displays or aberrations. \u201cBiological reality explodes the Victorian heteronormative myth,\u201d says author/naturalist Bradley Trevor Greive. At its core, \u201cQueer Planet\u201d is indeed pushing a political agenda, making the case that criticism of LGBTQ+ communities on moral or religious grounds occasionally \u2013 and erroneously \u2013 cite survival-of-the-species issues to bolster those arguments. Seeing various animals engaging in what the producers call \u201cunconventional sexualities\u201d indicates that humans aren\u2019t necessarily outliers in that regard. The producers and interviewees appear to have anticipated and perhaps relished the notion that the doc\u2019s very existence would provoke pundits like Fox News\u2019 Tomi Lahren and groups like the conservative Media Research Center in advance of its premiere, with the latter describing it as a \u201cdocumentary\u201d in quotes, and Pride Month as \u201cthe weeks-long onslaught of LGBTQ propaganda force-fed to weary Americans.\u201d Yet in this golden age of nature documentaries unleashed by technological advances and the appetite for streaming content, \u201cQueer Planet\u201d deserves credit for trying to connect those dots back to our lives in a somewhat different way. As for the naysayers, the beauty of the modern media environment is such programs needn\u2019t be all things to all people. To the extent \u201cQueer Planet\u201d leverages those political and cultural dynamics to let detractors help promote it, Peacock looks like a pretty savvy bird. \u201cQueer Planet\u201d premieres June 6 on Peacock.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/entertainment/queer-planet-review-pride-month/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_entertainment_hacks-season-3-finale", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The following contains spoilers about the \u201cHacks\u201d Season 3 finale, \u201cBulletproof,\u201d which premiered May 30. The third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d the Emmy-nominated Max comedy series, has in one respect felt strangely dated, with veteran comic Deborah Vance pursuing a late-night TV show as a capper to her career, at a time when those series have lost much luster from their heyday. Yet the show also contains what feels like a timeless lesson about Hollywood and doing anything to get ahead. The finale articulated that clearly, after Deborah (Jean Smart) lied to her writer/confidant Ava (Hannah Einbinder), telling her that the network had prevented her from installing Ava as the head writer on her show. As luck would have it, Ava had an encounter with the network boss (Helen Hunt), who made clear that choice belonged to Deborah, who later admitted as much, saying she didn\u2019t want to do anything that might risk her blowing this belated shot at late-night stardom. \u201cYou have to be selfish,\u201d she told Ava, adding, \u201cThis show has to be bulletproof, and it has to work. I\u2019ve lost way too much for it not to.\u201d While Ava\u2019s first impulse was to quit out of principle over Deborah\u2019s betrayal, the final scene marked a turning of the tables, with Ava blackmailing Deborah into giving her the head-writer position. When Deborah asks if she\u2019s willing to use that tactic to get what she wants, Ava responds pointedly, \u201cI would. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d What that means for their uneasy alliance going forward remains to be seen, although the two have experienced enough ups and downs that they seem unable to quit each other, for good or ill. Yet what \u201cHacks\u201d has nicely captured is the mix of narcissism and self-absorption that often feel like prerequisites to achieving show-business success, in this latest season somewhat mirroring another series set in the world of late-night TV, \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show,\u201d whose titular host (played by the late Garry Shandling) possessed all kinds of power that barely concealed his neuroses, descriptions that also applied to those around him. The irony is that \u201cLarry Sanders\u201d (which premiered in 1992 on HBO, while \u201cHacks\u201d occupies its streaming service, Max) came about during a very different time in late night, when the image of Johnny Carson as a comedy kingmaker still loomed over the business. The series made its debut a few months after Carson\u2019s final episode, playing as what became known as the \u201clate-night wars\u201d raged on. Today, names like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel still command prestige and respect, but the audience has dwindled among overwhelming audience fragmentation, and other late-night shows featuring James Corden and Samantha Bee have been swept away amid less hospitable economics for such fare. There\u2019s also a collegiality among the current hosts, who even teamed up during the writers strike, that bears scant resemblance to David Letterman and Jay Leno\u2019s famous feud. Although Deborah appears to be living in the past, \u201cHacks\u201d hasn\u2019t been, as evidenced by its penultimate episode, which dealt with the comic having to address the fallout from resurfaced old jokes that hadn\u2019t aged well, similar to the scenario that prompted Kevin Hart to withdraw as the host of the Oscars. Then again, after the show\u2019s Christmas episode, perhaps it\u2019s appropriate that \u201cHacks\u201d would find a way to live in the past, present, and to the extent these dynamics persist, maybe the future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/entertainment/hacks-season-3-finale/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_entertainment_baby-reindeer-you-stalking-netflix-cec", "text": "With Netflix\u2019s \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d captivating audiences \u2014 nearly 60 million viewers watched it in its first month \u2014 and the fifth and final season of \u201cYou\u201d set to release this year, stories about stalkers have clearly struck people\u2019s attention. But some experts warn that what you see on your screen isn\u2019t always representative of reality. Many Hollywood-ified dramatizations lean into storylines of extreme behaviors and sometimes don\u2019t include appropriate warnings, leading to misconceptions about what stalking actually is. For some victims, this could lead to more harm than good. Real-life stalking, experts say, can be more subtle than what is usually portrayed in popular media \u2014 though just as damaging and dangerous. How stalking is portrayed in popular media \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is a dramatized version of real events that happened to series creator and actor Richard Gadd. In the show, Gadd\u2019s character, Donny, meets Martha at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. The TV series \u201cYou,\u201d based on the 2014 novel of the same name, follows the perspective of stalker Joe Goldberg as he tracks, manipulates and murders his victims, often using romance and his good looks as a lure. Forensic psychologist Dr. Lorraine Sheridan says stalking is not always the cookie-cutter formula audiences are enthralled by. \u201cA lot of it (the media) is all killer, no filler. You don\u2019t get the more mundane aspects of stalking. You just get the really, really dramatic bits,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cThat means it is often quite misrepresented because the everyday, boring, hideous, demeaning, fear-inducing \u2014 but ultimately kind of predictably miserable \u2014 aspects of stalking does not make good TV.\u201d Gadd\u2019s story is real, but he says the version that appears in \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. \u201cI\u2019ve put out a statement publicly saying I want the show to be received as a piece of art, and I want the show to people (sic) to enjoy as a piece of art,\u201d Gadd told The Hollywood Reporter, speaking about those who aim to find the show\u2019s real life counterparts. \u201cI\u2019m called Donny Dunn. It exists in a sort of fictional realm, even though it\u2019s based on truth, it exists in a fictional realm, let\u2019s enjoy the world that I\u2019ve created.\u201d \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d comes with a standard post-credits disclaimer that says, \u201cThis program is based on real events; however certain characters, names, incidents, locations and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.\u201d One notable change is in the show: Martha is charged with three counts of harassment and stalking, found guilty and sent to prison. In real life, Gadd says the legal situation with his stalker was simply \u201cresolved.\u201d Stalking has always been a subject of popular media, even before many viewers can grasp the actual concept, since so much of it appears in content aimed at young people. In \u201cTwilight,\u201d the main character Edward breaks into his school crush Bella\u2019s room to watch her sleep. In \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d Emilio Estevez\u2019s character follows Andie MacDowell\u2019s character across town to crash her and her boyfriend\u2019s vacation. These representations can lead to confusion about what is stalking and what is romantic, according to the Stalking Prevention, Awareness and Resource Center (SPARC), which issued a discussion guide in 2019 that noted, \u201cRomantic films often include protagonists who are \u2018guys like Joe (Goldberg),\u2019 ones who stop at nothing to get the girl. Usually there is no negative consequence for their actions \u2014 in fact, the stalking is successful, and they persuade their initially reluctant romantic interests that they should be together.\u201d For its part in reducing victim blaming, Sheridan says that \u201cYou\u201d makes viewers \u201cquestion ourselves and (it) demonstrates how we can get taken in by somebody who is so cruel, selfish, sadistic and evil.\u201d Stalkers don\u2019t only take the shape of dashing, cunning men. In \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d Gadd\u2019s stalker is portrayed as unattractive and mentally ill \u2014 someone whom her victim actually feels sorry for. While both male and female fictional stalkers are portrayed as dangers, Sheridan notes\u00a0 that, typically, only women stalkers are portrayed in a way that gives audiences license to laugh and ridicule them. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth noting those more nuanced, less sensational, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to do something about this\u2019 kind of pieces of media (like \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cLover Stalker Killer\u201d) are both showing men as the victims,\u201d said Dana Fleitman, a SPARC training and awareness specialist. \u201cWhen we see women as victims, it is often on other networks that are a lot more campy (and) sensational.\u201d While 1 in 3 women will experience stalking in their lifetime, 1 in 6 men will as well, making it not a fully gendered issue. Some argue that stories where males are the victims may lend extra legitimacy to the problem. Anna Nasset, a stalking survivor and founder of Stand-Up Resources, watched \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d upon the recommendation of her colleagues and thought the show was \u201creally good.\u201d \u201cHaving the male victim in \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is going to do more than if the gender was switched. It just is,\u201d Nasset said. \u201cI hate to say it that way, but I think there\u2019s still that narrative of \u2018Well, this is just part of being a woman, this what you get!\u2019 Media portrayals of stalking aren\u2019t always accurate Media representations can also cause victims to believe they are not actually being stalked if\u00a0 their situation doesn\u2019t seem as severe as what they see on screen. \u201cStalking is very underreported and under-identified and so people kind of think they know what it is, but they\u2019re actually very unlikely to have received any sort of formal or real education on it. So, where are we learning what stalking is? It\u2019s often from these (media) misrepresentations,\u201d Fleitman said. Fleitman believes these dramatizations cause the public to confuse stalkers with sexy, romantic and heroic leads (much like Edward Cullen of \u201cTwilight\u201d) and think real-life victims are overreacting to a harmless, awkward attachment. With the exclusion of a US National Stalking Hotline and stalking public service announcements, Fleitman wishes there were more content warnings and resources around stalker-centered media so that audiences and organizations didn\u2019t have to do the bulk of the work. \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d rated TV-MA by Netflix for \u201clanguage, nudity, sex, sexual violence, substances,\u201d only has a viewer discretionary warning before \u201cEpisode 4\u201d wherein Gadd\u2019s character is sexually assaulted. In the series finale, the resource, wannatalkaboutit, pops up in the credits. Created by Netflix, it includes round tables and discussions guides of other Netflix shows and films, links to resources such as the National Suicide Hotline, Crisis Text and the Domestic Violence Hotline. Information is also available on sexual assault, sexual violence and relationship abuse. Yet no mention of stalking, despite it being the main subject matter of the show. Neither Netflix nor the \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d teams responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Nasset echoes that educating people about stalking is difficult but believes \u201cwe\u2019re on track\u201d to be able to have more public awareness around stalker-centered media, noting that content warnings or PSAs around sexual violence, which are now common, were rare as recently as 10 to 20 years ago. Fletiman calls stalking shows without PSAs and resources \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Sheridan argues that such efforts at public awareness are important, and reflect changing outlooks on what issues are worth talking about. \u201cI love the way the young people are standing up. I don\u2019t see it that they\u2019re soft and easily offended. I\u2019m seeing they\u2019re just not going to take that crap anymore and I\u2019m loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the PSAs, all the content warnings, bring it on. Because that comes with an opportunity for education as well.\u201d Fleitman also believes these stories have an opportunity: \u201cI think that the media can be a really good starting place for discussion, for learning, for empathizing with victims and survivors (and) for understanding stalking, but only if it\u2019s used that way.\u201d she said. The realities of stalking Stalkers are often imagined as hooded strangers in a secret lair but the reality is less dramatic \u2014 though just as scary. According to Fleitman, stalkers are more likely to be a current or past partner or acquaintance \u2014 a situation represented in both \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d and \u201cYou.\u201d Stalking is about scaring or upsetting somebody, she says. SPARC defines stalking as \u201ca pattern of behavior directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress.\u201d Although the definition varies for different areas, Sheridan hopes to defy its notorious murkiness. \u201cA lot of things are hard to define. The bloody weather is hard to define, and people know what that is,\u201d she said. Fleitman hopes \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d can raise awareness for stalking victims, like men and so-called \u201cimperfect victims\u201d whose stories may not look like the ones we\u2019re used to seeing. The term \u201cimperfect victim\u201d refers to people who may be seen by those outside of the situation as not doing enough to prevent their abusers\u2019 actions \u2014 in some cases, they are even accused of doing something themselves to incite the stalker, such as not establishing boundaries or sharing too much private information. Fleitman said what someone chooses to share on the Internet can be seen as the new \u201cwell, what were you wearing?\u201d when it comes to stalking. The narrative enforces that victims are to be seen as blameless and innocent with no prior indiscretions of their own. Nasset often gets called a \u201cperfect victim\u201d because she was quick to report her situation to law enforcement, but she thinks the moniker is a \u201chorrible term.\u201d \u201c[A] stalker is going to do what the stalker is going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re trying to bargain with them or be nice to them, [it\u2019s] not necessarily going to change the trajectory.\u201d In fiction, stalking may make for tense drama, but in reality it is so insidious that it is often called \u201cslow motion homicide.\u201d And, indeed, stalking often ends with violence and death. 76% of intimate partner femicides included stalking in the year prior to their death and stalking increases the risk of intimate partner homicide by three times, according to SPARC. Nasset\u2019s stalker is currently serving 10 years in prison after being sentenced in 2019. He was a stranger who hung around her art gallery and began stalking her in 2011. Stalking is illegal in all US states and territories, but the topic is still under-researched and awareness resources are scant. In fact, stalking first became a crime in the US less than 35 years ago \u2014 in 1990 in the state of California. In Edinburgh, Scotland, where \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d takes place, harassment laws weren\u2019t introduced until 1997 before being amended in 2010 to more accurately reflect stalking\u2019s danger, validity and to call it out by name. This was just five years before the real-life Martha started stalking Gadd and four years before \u201cYou\u201d hit shelves in its first novel incarnation. While stalking makes for compelling storylines, the real-life issue is difficult to navigate. Representation in TV shows or movies could change this for the better by raising awareness about the nuances of predatory behavior. Or, it could perpetuate outdated and dangerous ideas about what stalking really is.

While the industry needs to seriously adjust expectations, and perhaps begin to accept what was once considered box-office mediocrity as the new normal, it\u2019s probably too soon to panic (yet). Thus far, the numbers look pretty grim. Surveying the four weekends in May, box-office totals plummeted roughly 35% versus last year, according to the site Box Office Mojo, with the average for the No. 1 new movie down almost 50%. For Memorial Day weekend the top two titles, \u201cFuriosa\u201d and \u201cGarfield,\u201d combined for only a little more than half of what Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d swam off with in 2023, marking the weakest official kickoff to summer in more than 30 years. Despite the dismal start, there is promise of bright spots ahead, with \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d clawing out record advance ticket sales, and the animated \u201cInside Out 2\u201d likely to be a major draw for families. Still, as the Hollywood Reporter noted, $100 million opening weekends, which once occurred with some regularity, increasingly feel like an artifact of the pre-Covid, less-streaming past. For those who follow movie grosses \u2013 a pastime as popular in certain circles as baseball stats \u2013 a few key factors should be considered, in roughly descending order of importance: Habits have changed, perhaps for good. It takes more to get people to go to the theater, and consumers who aren\u2019t dying to see something know thanks to shrinking theatrical windows that the film will be more conveniently available at home soon enough. They still want to watch movies, but on their terms, not Hollywood\u2019s. The strikes made things even worse. Studios have sought to spread out releases to ensure a steady flow of new product, but the six-month work stoppage slowed the pipeline, resulting in delayed premieres that have given people less reason to venture out. So far, there\u2019s no substitute for Marvel. Disney\u2019s superhero cash cow had a terrible 2023 by its standards, and the studio has vowed to be more selective in the future. But the company\u2019s enviable run of hits from \u201cIron Man\u201d in 2008 through \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d in 2019 filled theaters, and its sagging returns \u2013 whether that\u2019s due to \u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d or a more complicated list of factors \u2013 can\u2019t easily be replicated. Unproven ideas are hard. People like to grouse about Hollywood\u2019s reliance on sequels, but selling audiences on something new \u2013 even if that\u2019s a remake of an \u201880s TV show (\u201cFall Guy\u201d), or a prequel featuring a secondary character (\u201cFuriosa\u201d) \u2013 feels particularly challenging in light of overall box-office struggles. It\u2019s not all bad news. But there\u2019s a \u201cbut.\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d brightened summer 2023, and \u201cDeadpool\u201d and other highlights looming on the horizon this year, like \u201cWicked,\u201d could fill that role again. Still, true \u201cevents,\u201d the kind that fill theaters, are rare and getting rarer. As for identifying what will break through, screenwriter William Goldman\u2019s famous observation \u201cNobody knows anything\u201d has never sounded more accurate. The stars don\u2019t shine like they used to. Ryan Gosling flexed his muscles in \u201cBarbie\u201d and owned the Oscars by singing \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken.\u201d But even his star wattage didn\u2019t bring people to \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d in vast numbers, any more than Ryan Reynolds or Anya Taylor-Joy/Chris Hemsworth could lift \u201cIF\u201d and \u201cFuriosa,\u201d respectively. Making less is going to mean spending less. Blockbuster movies take a long time to produce, requiring decisions years before they hit screens, so the boat can\u2019t be quickly turned to avoid icebergs ahead. Although the notion \u201cYou have to spend money to make money\u201d applies, if movies keep earning less there\u2019s going to be a need to make them more inexpensively. The tradeoff, of course, is audiences have come to expect a certain level of opulence from their summer action. No one said these choices are easy, but studios can\u2019t blip back, \u201cEndgame\u201d style, to 2019. About all we know is that consumers will have the final say on just how cruel this summer will be, and where the movie business goes from there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/entertainment/box-office-summer-furiosa-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_entertainment_sean-diddy-combs-cases-future", "text": "Months after singer Cassie Ventura filed suit against her ex-boyfriend Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, his life looks very different. The man who rose from an intern at a record label to building his own music empire in Bad Boy Records, was once a beloved figure who held enough influence to launch recording careers, successful fashion and spirits lines, and even a voting movement. Those days seem over. In her now-settled claim filed in November, Ventura accused Combs of raping her in 2018 and years of abuse over the course of their relationship. In the past six months, he has been named in seven other lawsuits in which he has been accused of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity. Combs has vehemently denied claims from many of the civil suits but has not responded to all of the allegations. After CNN published a 2016 surveillance video that showed Combs physically assaulting Ventura, the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office said the incident they described as \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d was outside the statute of limitations to prosecute. But the video could become evidence in an ongoing federal investigation related to Combs and allegations of sex trafficking. CNN has learned that investigators are preparing to bring accusers of Combs before a federal grand jury in New York, according to two sources familiar with the probe. This signals that the US Justice Department is moving toward potentially seeking an indictment of Combs. Authorities are \u201cdigging deeper\u201d into the civil suits and mining them for potential witnesses and evidence against the star, one of the sources told CNN. Federal investigators are also looking into allegations of money laundering and illegal drugs, CNN has learned. \u201cIt\u2019s much bigger than just these lawsuits,\u201d one of the sources familiar with the scope of the investigation said. Here\u2019s a closer look at what has been revealed about the federal case so far. The searches Authorities\u00a0searched Combs\u2019 homes in Miami and Los Angeles on March 25, because he is a target of a federal probe carried out by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the lead investigative arm of the US Department of Homeland Security, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the case. The investigation stems from many of the same sexual assault allegations put forth in\u00a0the\u00a0civil lawsuits, according to a second law enforcement source familiar with the searches. HSI is responsible for investigating transnational crime and threats, including human trafficking, terrorism, narcotics smuggling and other organized criminal activity. A spokesperson for\u00a0HSI\u00a0declined to comment on the existence of a grand jury,\u00a0but noted the investigation remains ongoing. A lawyer for Combs objected to how the searches were conducted. \u201cThere was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs\u2019 residences,\u201d Aaron Dyer, Combs\u2019 attorney, said in a statement to CNN at the time. \u201cThere is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.\u201d Two of Combs\u2019 adult sons, Justin, 30, and Christian, 26, were detained and briefly handcuffed during the search warrant execution at his Los Angeles mansion. They were not arrested or charged. Justin\u2019s mother, stylist Misa Hylton, also took exception to how her son and his brother were treated. \u201cThe overzealous and overtly militarized force used against my sons Justin and Christian is deplorable,\u201d she wrote in a social media post in April. \u201cIf these were the sons of a non-Black celebrity, they would not have been handled with the same aggression. The attempt to humiliate and terrorize these innocent young BLACK MEN is despicable!\u201d Hylton is not Christian Combs biological mother. He is the son of the late Kim Porter with whom Sean Combs also shared now 17-year old twin daughters, D\u2019Lila and Jessie. Potential evidence The raids on Combs\u2019 homes came weeks after a lawsuit filed against him by Rodney \u201cLil Rod\u201d Jones, a former producer and videographer for the music mogul. Jones accuses Combs and others of racketeering, sexual assault and sex trafficking in 2022 and 2023 as Jones worked on Combs\u2019 most recent album \u201cLove.\u201d Jones also alleges Combs did not compensate him for his music producing work. Ventura, too, accused Combs of sex trafficking, allegedly forcing her to engage in various sex acts with male sex workers through threats of violence. \u201cA decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing,\u201d Ben Brafman, an attorney for Combs, said when Ventura\u2019s lawsuit was settled. Another attorney for Combs denied Jones\u2019 allegations and called his claims \u201clies.\u201d \u201cHis reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines. We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies,\u201d attorney Shawn Holley told CNN when the lawsuit was filed. Authorities searching during raids are usually seeking evidence to confirm that laws have been broken. Examples of what is often seized include computers, cell phones and documents. Both Jones and Ventura claimed video evidence exists of some of the alleged crimes. Potential video evidence is center stage at the moment as a source has told CNN that federal agents are in possession of video taken inside of Combs\u2019 recently searched residences. It\u2019s unclear whether the video was seized during the raids, or whether investigators obtained video from individuals they have been questioning. \u201cThey are contacting people that they\u2019ve found on the tapes,\u201d a source told CNN. At least one male sex worker, who claims he has been victimized by Combs, has been questioned during the investigation, one source said. The source added that this individual was seen in footage that is in possession of the federal investigators. Building a \u201cbulletproof\u201d case While no federal criminal charges have been filed against Combs, law enforcement sources indicated the Justice Department\u2019s successful efforts to prosecute disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly in 2022 could serve as a model for the current sex trafficking investigation of Combs, depending on what evidence is discovered. In the case involving Kelly, federal agents with HSI secured a conviction on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from Kelly\u2019s efforts over years to use his fame to ensnare victims he sexually abused. The federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \u2013 also known as RICO \u2013 is a statute that targets so-called criminal enterprises, and provides for steep penalties that can also be a point of leverage for prosecutors wishing to flip potential co-conspirators or encourage defendants to take plea deals. There is no known timeline for possible federal charges against Combs, however, approaching his sex trafficking investigation as an effort to illuminate a criminal enterprise involving others would require a more robust effort by federal agents to prove the elements of any conspiracy. \u201cWhen prosecutors charge RICO, they have to prove more to make their case \u2013 that a criminal enterprise exists, that the defendant was a member of it, and that the crimes are related to that enterprise,\u201d said Elie Honig, CNN Senior Legal Analyst and former federal prosecutor. \u201cBut it also gives prosecutors a powerful tool to take down large criminal operations.\u201d One source told CNN investigators are being thorough and taking their time to ensure that an indictment, should there be one, is \u201cbulletproof.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sandra Gonzalez, John Miller, Elizabeth Wolfe, Eric Levenson, Denise Royal, Holmes Lybrand and Carlos Suarez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-cases-future/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_05_entertainment_checkpoint-zoo-joshua-zeman-russia-ukraine-war", "text": "Filmmaker Joshua Zeman didn\u2019t tell his parents that he was traveling to Ukraine in the fall of 2022, just months after Russia had launched a full-fledged military operation in the country. So when his phone kept pinging while on location, he knew it wasn\u2019t them. It was the app used by many locally that tells users when a bomb is incoming. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, and I didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Zeman, director of the upcoming film \u201cCheckpoint Zoo,\u201d told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe went and wore flak jackets and helmets and we were there filming and bombs were going off, the whole nine yards.\u201d The notifications went off so frequently that the crew had to turn them off at times, hoping to earn a moment of silence until the inevitable sound of the bombs exploding miles away from their filming location broke it. Both the bombs and the notifications were a constant reminder to Zeman that he was trying to make a movie during a 21st century war. Zeman made multiple trips Ukraine to capture footage for \u201cCheckpoint Zoo,\u201d a documentary that tells the story of the harrowing rescue of thousands of animals that were trapped inside Kharkiv\u2019s Feldman Ecopark zoo amid the conflict. It will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on June 6. The story in his film, he said, was too important not to tell. The victims you never see Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022 launched an assault on Ukraine by land, air and sea. The ongoing conflict, over two years later, has since left tens of thousands of troops and civilians dead. The Feldman Ecopark facility, located in Kharkiv near the Russian border, became one of the unwitting casualties of the war when the heavy fighting in the area left the park\u2019s 5000 animals with little food, water and caretakers. But after the park\u2019s founder, businessman and philanthropist Oleksandr Feldman, posted a video to his social media pages asking the world for help, resources were sent and a group of volunteers showed up to help bring the animals to safety. Six people died during the evacuation, including a 15-year-old boy. Zeman first learned of Feldman Ecopark\u2019s animal rescue after he saw a video of a Chimpanzee named ChiChi wandering around Kharkiv\u2019s Freedom Square. Intrigued, he was determined to find the Chimp\u2019s origin story, which led him to learning the full scope of Feldman Ecopark\u2019s animal evacuation. Soon thereafter, Zeman connected with a representative for the park and traveled to Kharkiv with his crew to film. \u201cThis is a film about the unintended victims of war that you don\u2019t quite see,\u201d Zeman said. Zeman reconstructs the events of the evacuation in \u201cCheckpoint Zoo\u201d using interviews conducted under the constant threat of artillery fire while on the ground in Ukraine and footage filmed by volunteers. Led by a team of heroic zookeepers and volunteers, the film highlights the people who risked their lives to save the animals of Feldman Ecopark. But getting there was no easy task. Zeman spent 12 hours at the Warsaw border on his way into Ukraine trying to explain to border officials that his luggage was full of film equipment. Peppered with questions about why he was trying to cross into Ukraine and what he was trying to film, Zeman attempted to explain that he was not a journalist, nor was he heading to the front lines \u2013 a concept that he remembers being confusing to officials. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to film a zoo,\u2019\u201d Zeman recalled telling officials at the time. \u201cThat just blew everybody\u2019s mind at the border.\u201d In what ultimately turned into a five day trek from Warsaw to Kharkiv, the filmmaker was finally on-site to capture footage of the park, which was beholden to the scars of war and empty of the 5000 animals that were re-homed to safer havens across the country months prior. \u201cIt was crazy that this was going on,\u201d Zeman said. \u201cI spoke to so many people whose lives had been impacted\u2026It was horrific what was going on and coming from the United States, coming from New York, it\u2019s just shocking.\u201d The language barrier at times presented a challenge. Zeman relied heavily on his translator to relay his questions and the subject\u2019s answers. But, he said, \u201cI just knew that the story was important and that the people were important and what they were saying was emotional.\u201d The footage Feldman, a Ukrainian businessman and Jewish philanthropist, first opened the park in 2011 with the initial vision that it\u2019d be a small park for children to play with animals, according to producers of the documentary. It eventually evolved into a sprawling facility that housed everything from moose and kangaroos to lions and monkeys. Feldman Ecopark also focused on rehabilitation and instituted programs for special needs children and for people struggling with addiction. During the evacuation, Feldman and his team relocated a significant amount of the animals from the park to his nearby home. In the film, Feldman\u2019s home \u2013 full of animals \u2013 is highlighted as he tearfully speaks about his connection to them and his quest to save them. The human cost of Feldman\u2019s grand effort was spoken about by many in the documentary but shown in graphic detail through the story of 15-year-old Denis Selevin, who was killed in a strike on the facility\u2019s grounds. In one scene, the child\u2019s father, Vitalii Selevin, confronts a Russian prisoner of war who was captured by the Ukrainian military following the strike. \u201cThis is the blood of my child,\u201d Vitalii Selevin tells man the restrained in the clip, after kneeling down to show him his bloodied hands. \u201cHow am I supposed to feel about you?\u201d Denis Selevin had died just minutes before this encounter. He had been at the facility that day helping evacuate and feed the animals when the park had come under fire by Russian troops. \u201cThe footage was unbelievable, it was shocking,\u201d Zeman said. \u201cIt was also amazing too because it happened on the last day of the evacuation. It\u2019s like a script.\u201d Zeman said he didn\u2019t even realize they had this footage at the time. He and his team knew at the time that Denis Selevin lost his life and thought they\u2019d have to tell his story through photographs. So when an editor first uncovered the footage, Zeman said he felt that it was \u201cvery important\u201d that they spoke to his parents on their next trip to Ukraine. \u201cI was surprised that they agreed to speak on camera,\u201d he said. They ultimately agreed, according to Zeman, because \u201cthey wanted the world to see what war can do.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment that is consistent through each testimonial featured in \u201cCheckpoint Zoo.\u201d Andrii Tyvaniuk, a Feldman Ecopark employee who helped with the evacuation says at one point in the film that \u201cnot all animals are animals, and not all humans are humans.\u201d \u201cBut many animals are humans,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd a whole lot of people are animals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/entertainment/checkpoint-zoo-joshua-zeman-russia-ukraine-war/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

In 2019, frontman Chris Martin announced that the band was putting touring on hold while considering how to make their performances more environmentally friendly. Two years later, Coldplay announced its Music of the Spheres tour - and with it a pledge to halve\u00a0emissions generated by show production, freight and the travel for band members and crew. The achievement is partly down to audience participation, which has seen fans producing energy by jumping up and down on kinetic dance floors and cycling on specially modified bikes. The band also promised to plant a tree for every single ticket sold for their shows. The range of innovative measures during the tour, which have encouraged the audience to take part in the eco-friendly initiative, have led to them producing 59% less than on their previous stadium tour in 2016-17, Coldplay said. The band said that the figures have been verified by the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative. Quoted in the statement on Coldplay\u2019s website, John E. Fernandez, director of the MIT initiative, congratulated the band on their \u201cdedication to positive and meaningful actions,\u201d adding that they have been \u201csetting a new standard for the entire music industry.\u201d Coldplay thanked \u201call the brilliant people who\u2019ve made this possible.\u201d \u201cMost of all, we\u2019d like to thank everyone who\u2019s come to a show and helped charge the show batteries on the power bikes and kinetic dance floors; everyone who\u2019s arrived by foot, bike, ride share or public transport; everyone who\u2019s come with refillable water bottles or returned their LED wristband for recycling; and everyone who\u2019s bought a ticket, which means you\u2019ve planted one of 7 million trees so far,\u201d the band added. The global stadium tour kicked off in Costa Rica in March 2022 and will continue until later this year, playing to fans in venues as far afield as Finland, Greece, Australia and New Zealand. In a more detailed breakdown of measures taken, the band said that 7 million trees have been planted, 18 shows in 2023 were powered completely by a system using recycled BMW i3 batteries and that 72% of all tour waste has been diverted from landfill. Nevertheless, Coldplay admitted that more remains to be done, saying: \u201cAs a band, and as an industry, we\u2019re a long way from where we need to be on this. But we\u2019re grateful for everyone\u2019s help so far, and we salute everyone who\u2019s making efforts to push things in the right direction.\u201d In an interview with CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson in 2022, Martin said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a purely charitable exercise. We are trying to prove that capitalism can be a bit more compassionate and eco-conscious.\u201d Green touring has been around for decades, with musicians including Neil Young and Bonnie Raitt among the pioneers. But as the effects of climate change continue to intensify, the music industry is now bringing this approach mainstream. Among those who have taken measures to make their performances are more eco-friendly are Billie Eilish and Maroon 5.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/entertainment/coldplay-emissions-world-tour-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_entertainment_house-of-the-dragon-steven-toussaint-representation", "text": "\u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d actor Steven Toussaint is sailing into Season 2 of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel series buoyed by the positive response to his powerful performance. It\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s starting the sophomore season of \u201cDragon\u201d on a more positive note than Season 1, which was marred by racist backlash to Toussaint\u2019s casting. According to Toussaint, the \u201cnegative response\u201d he initially received when his casting was announced before the series debuted in 2022 has since been drowned out by the praise and appreciation expressed by viewers who celebrate on-screen representation. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of people \u2013 and not just people of color \u2013 who have contacted me through social media or through letters and said how pleased they are to see this representation in this world,\u201d said Toussaint during a \u201cDragon\u201d press conference held on Monday. Toussaint plays Lord Corlys Velaryon \u2013 the high-born leader of House Velaryon of Driftmark \u2013 in the HBO series, which is based on the book \u201cThe Targaryen Dynasty: The House of the Dragon\u201d by George R.R. Martin. (HBO is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, which also owns CNN.) In the book, members of House Velaryon are described as White but in the series, the members of House Velaryon are portrayed by Black actors. The choice to veer from the source material sparked an often racist discourse among book loyalists. Toussaint later told The Hollywood Reporter that he was \u201cracially abused on social media\u201d following his casting. \u201cDragon\u201d showrunner Ryan Condal acknowledged in a 2022 interview with Entertainment Weekly that the criticism that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d received for its lack of diversity, in part, inspired the decision to cast more people of color in this series. \u201cThe world is very different now than it was 10 years ago when [\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019] all started,\u201d Condal said at the time. He added that it was important to \u201ccreate a show that was not another bunch of White people on the screen, just to put it very bluntly.\u201d Toussaint had a similar take at the press conference on Monday, saying, \u201cwe are living in a world in which everybody\u2019s here and I think everybody has a right to be represented\u2026 There are voices out there that would argue against that but I think those of us who want to see that world, I think history is on our side.\u201d Set 200 years before the events of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cDragon\u201d tells the story of House Targaryen and the ensuing, epic civil war. The series stars Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke, Emma D\u2019Arcy, Eve Best, Bethany Antonia and Fabien Frankel, among others. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d Season 2 will be available to stream on Max on June 16.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/entertainment/house-of-the-dragon-steven-toussaint-representation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_entertainment_eric-review-benedict-cumberbatch", "text": "Weird, dark but compulsively watchable, \u201cEric\u201d stars Benedict Cumberbatch and a hulking foul-mouthed puppet, not necessarily in that order. Set amid a dystopian vision of a dangerous, corrupt 1980s New York, it\u2019s part mystery, part satire and part right-wing fever dream about crime-infested cities, powered by the parental nightmare fuel of a missing child. That child is nine-year-old Edgar (Ivan Howe), whose father, Vincent (Cumberbatch), is the cranky, authority-flouting creator and lead puppeteer behind a popular children\u2019s show, \u201cGood Day Sunshine.\u201d The title and occupation both prove ironic, given that everything about the show is awash in grime and darkness, including the constant bickering between Vincent and his wife Cassie (Gaby Hoffmann), trapped in a broken marriage that isn\u2019t lost on their son. When Edgar abruptly goes missing, both parents blame Vincent, who becomes convinced his child\u2019s drawings of an ogre-like puppet named Eric are somehow the key to finding him. As Vincent turns to self-medication to ease his anxiety and guilt, Eric appears to him, and him alone, ostensibly to help him locate the boy. However, talking to an invisible creature \u2013 whose language would make the \u201cAvenue Q\u201d gang blush \u2013 isn\u2019t necessarily the way to win the trust of those around him, including Vincent\u2019s work partner Lennie (Dan Fogler), whose efforts to cover for Vincent\u2019s bad and erratic behavior face growing strain. The other major strand of \u201cEric,\u201d created by Welsh writer Abi Morgan (\u201cThe Iron Lady\u201d), involves the detective (McKinley Belcher III) assigned the case, a closeted Black man dealing with a racist and homophobic police department. In addition, there\u2019s the matter of a missing Black teenager \u2013 whose story, notably, hasn\u2019t received nearly as much media attention \u2013 creating the possibility that Edgar\u2019s disappearance might be somehow linked to a sordid web of child exploitation and trafficking. While Cumberbatch (whose recent dances with Netflix include \u201cPower of the Dog\u201d and \u201cThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\u201d) nails his performance as a guy slowly unraveling, the police investigation and its various twists, turns and red herrings animate \u201cEric,\u201d figuratively and literally. Through its six-episode run, Morgan impressively weaves in peripheral characters and seemingly minor players in unexpected ways. In this iteration of New York, nobody is above suspicion, the wealthy and influential \u2013 a roster that includes Vincent\u2019s well off and politically connected family \u2013 are the real monsters, and almost everyone gives the impression of being guilty of something. At times \u201cEric\u201d feels so relentlessly grim as to become almost oppressive, feeding the popular impression of New York (especially during the period in question) as a modern-day dystopia. The payoff, however, reveals method in that madness, in a way that brings the discordant elements together \u2013 with a few hiccups \u2013 in surprisingly effective fashion. Eric might need somebody to pull his strings, but give credit to \u201cEric\u201d \u2013 especially considering the challenging nature of the concept \u2013 for so effectively tying those threads together. \u201cEric\u201d premieres May 30 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/eric-review-benedict-cumberbatch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
