Chronicling Steven Van Zandt\u2019s colorful life as Bruce Springsteen\u2019s frequent collaborator, \u201cThe Sopranos\u2019\u201d weirdest mobster and an outspoken activist, \u201cDisciple\u201d plucks the right notes in a 2 1/2-hour marathon that\u2019s still shorter than an average night\u2019s work for the E Street Band. Broken into rough chapters, the HBO presentation begins with Van Zandt\u2019s formative musical years in New Jersey, his bromance with Springsteen and the various characters and players that circled in and out of their respective endeavors. Once Van Zandt had achieved a measure of success as an artist, his political interests consumed him, advocating for the anti-apartheid campaign in South Africa and on behalf of imprisoned Native-American activist Leonard Peltier, among other causes. Finally, there\u2019s \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d with series creator David Chase having seen Van Zandt during an awards ceremony, and deciding he belonged in the mob drama. \u201cThat guy\u2019s gotta be in the show,\u201d Chase recalls thinking in the doc \u2013 crafting a character for him when the musician insisted he didn\u2019t want to take a job away from a working actor. All those elements would be plenty entertaining on their own, frankly, but what really elevates \u201cDisciple\u201d is the dizzying list of bold-faced names that pop up seemingly at the drop of a guitar pick. When Van Zandt mentions the seminal experience of seeing the Beatles on Ed Sullivan\u2019s show, it\u2019s almost immediately followed by an interview with Paul McCartney. Ditto for other singers that Van Zandt mentions, like Dion DiMucci, Darlene Love and Gary U.S. Bonds. For many, the foundational part of Van Zandt\u2019s career, despite his solo efforts fronting Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul, remains his participation in the E Street Band, even if that meant living to an extent in Springsteen\u2019s shadow. Notably, he chose to strike out on his own at the apex of Springsteen\u2019s success with the \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d album, an act of independence, restlessness and, in the eyes of some of his friends and associates interviewed here, borderline insanity. Now in their 70s, Van Zandt and Springsteen can discuss each other in a way that speaks to the depth of their bond and the creative shorthand they enjoy, having lived lives they could have scarcely imagined back when they were knocking around clubs together in Asbury Park. The documentary bills Van Zandt as \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s most famous consigliere to Bruce Springsteen and Tony Soprano,\u201d but proceeds to show there\u2019s much more to him than that. Like his trademark bandanas, \u201cDisciple\u201d wears its soul, and its love for the music these artists created, brightly displayed where all the world can see it. \u201cStevie Van Zandt: Disciple\u201d premieres June 22 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/entertainment/stevie-van-zandt-disciple-review-springsteen-sopranos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_horizon-an-american-saga-review-kevin-costner", "text": "Nobody has done more to keep the western flame kindling on the big screen than Kevin Costner, but the audacity of his latest rodeo \u2013 a planned 12-hour story for theatrical release, spread over four parts \u2013 feels like overreach, if not outright folly. \u201cHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1\u201d teems with old-fashioned values, but the prospect of nine more hours to reach the journey\u2019s end might have looked daunting even to intrepid pioneers. In some respects, testing the kind of longform storytelling associated with limited series in a theatrical format \u2013 with part two of \u201cHorizon\u201d set to premiere just seven weeks after this first installment \u2013 represents a bold, perhaps even necessary gamble. The fact that Costner, as director, producer, co-writer and star, has ponied up by investing his own money in the project makes that dice roll even more conspicuous. Yet \u201cHorizon\u201d tells such a sprawling story that this introductory chapter, despite strong moments, proves especially scattered, rolling out numerous characters on separate fronts without connecting them. Costner himself doesn\u2019t arrive on screen for an hour, and just when there\u2019s a sense the threads might start to coalesce, an entirely new one emerges regarding a wagon train. While there have been other \u201cTo be continued\u201d movies lately, those have been built around established franchises, like \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d \u201cFast & Furious\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\u201d Attempting to do so with an original idea is, by any measure, a big ask, even from western fans inclined to give Costner \u2013 thanks to \u201cOpen Range,\u201d \u201cWyatt Earp\u201d and \u201cDances With Wolves\u201d \u2013 the benefit of the doubt. Beginning in 1859, \u201cHorizon\u201d serves as the name of a town being sold as the embodiment of the American dream and manifest destiny to pioneers, with enticing promises of \u201cvirgin land\u201d and a better future leading to an ill-advised settlement that prompts a swift and brutal raid from a rogue Native-American band. Elsewhere, Costner\u2019s laconic cowboy gets reluctantly drawn into a dispute involving a young child, forcing him and the woman who watches the boy, Marigold (Abbey Lee), to go on the run, while the aforementioned wagon train grapples with its own issues. The sprawling cast includes several of Costner\u2019s former co-stars (Will Patton, Jeff Fahey and James Russo among them), as well as Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Luke Wilson, Jamie Campbell Bower and Michael Rooker. Unlike westerns of old, Costner also seeks to portray the frontier with greater complexity, from providing the Native-American perspective to touching upon bigotry against the Chinese and the encroachment of the Civil War. All that might work more effectively as a Ken Burns documentary, however, than it does as a movie, at least in this initial form. And while \u201cHorizon\u201d closes with what amounts to a coming attraction for what lies ahead, set to John Debney\u2019s soaring score, the connections forged with this sprawling roster of players don\u2019t ensure the level of investment that will bring people back for more. Costner has underscored his commitment to \u201cHorizon\u201d by walking away from \u201cYellowstone,\u201d a modern western that has bookended a near-40-year career of stardom that began with \u201cSilverado.\u201d With little left to prove, he has earned the right to take chances, which might explain why Warner Bros. (like CNN, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery) signed on as his distribution partner in this venture. Practically speaking, though, if Costner really intends to finish 12 hours of \u201cHorizon,\u201d the logical home for the second half of it would be back on television, via the studio\u2019s HBO, rather than a theatrical setting. Because while it\u2019s easy to applaud Costner\u2019s ambitions, based on \u201cHorizon\u2019s\u201d part one, that\u2019s where this American saga belonged from the opening gun. \u201cHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/horizon-an-american-saga-review-kevin-costner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_entertainment_the-bear-season-2-recap-cec", "text": "Plug your ears: TV\u2019s screamiest series is back. \u201cThe Bear,\u201d the FX-on-Hulu kitchen-set dramedy, returns Wednesday night for its third season. No doubt it\u2019ll be just as stressful, loud and appetizing as ever. When we last left Carmy and co. a year ago, it was friends-and-family night at The Bear, the new restaurant made from the ashes of the sandwich joint that Carmy inherited from his late brother. But things are never calm for long in this kitchen, so in the last 10 minutes of the finale, Carmy got in a scream-fight with \u201ccousin\u201d Richie, accidentally broke up with his childhood crush Claire and got stuck in the walk-in refrigerator. But what of Marcus\u2019 ailing mom and Sydney\u2019s dreams of a Michelin star? Can The Bear survive in the cutthroat world of fine dining? And will anyone on this show ever learn the meaning of \u201cinside voice\u201d? Before you binge Season 3 of the Emmy-winning \u201ccomedy,\u201d here\u2019s where our favorite dysfunctional Chicagoans left off in the second season. The Bear is almost open for business After weeks of failing fire inspections, knocking down walls and generally fighting over every detail of the restaurant, the staff of the restaurant formerly known as The Beef are finally ready to open The Bear, their new fine dining destination in Chicago\u2019s River North neighborhood. Sydney wants a Michelin star. Carmy wants to prove to himself, his callous former boss and his deceased brother Mikey that he can run the restaurant of his dreams. And Uncle Jimmy Cicero wants them to make him some money, because they owe him $800,000. Yeesh. At least The Bear looks great, and the staff are in top form on family-and-friends night, where we end the season. Sydney is the chef de cuisine under executive chef Carmy (and she\u2019s rocking a new Thom Browne uniform), Tina is her sous, and the rest of the crew, from Ebra and Marcus to Richie and Fak, are newly confident in their talents. Their first-night menu includes a gorgeous \u201cseven fishes\u201d plate (a nod to the season\u2019s nightmarish Christmas episode), perfectly al dente bucatini and Marcus\u2019 doughnut that Carm angrily destroyed last season. (Remember, in the episode when Syd accidentally stabbed Richie? Just the ha-ha hilarity Emmy voters love.) There are some bumps \u2013\u2013\u00a0they run out of forks and fire a chef after they find him doing meth in the alley \u2013\u2013\u00a0but otherwise, everything looks fairly functional for this rage-prone team. Until \u2026 Carmy melts down in the cooler The Bear\u2019s family-and-friends night should be an exciting one for Carmen Berzatto, but then, he never really lets himself feel anything other than paralyzing anxiety and anger. Throughout Season 2, Carmy left planning for The Bear to Sydney while he pursued a relationship with Claire, the young doctor he\u2019s crushed on since they were kids. Of course, his happiness is short-lived. Carm quickly finds that he\u2019s the most ill-prepared chef in the kitchen. If The Bear fails, he thinks, it\u2019ll be his fault. And then, when he goes to grab something from the walk-in cooler, he gets locked inside \u2013\u2013\u00a0and that\u2019s his fault, too, because he never fixed the handle. Carm dramatically spirals while he\u2019s locked in there, venting about how he\u2019s a \u201cpsycho\u201d and doesn\u2019t \u201cneed to receive any amusement or enjoyment.\u201d He also, in his anxiety-spiral, refers to his relationship with Claire as \u201call this bulls**t.\u201d She\u2019s standing on the other side of the walk-in and hears the whole thing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way,\u201d she says, and leaves in tears. Richie and Carm then take turns yelling unforgivable things at each other through the door. We leave Carmy in the walk-in to sit with his mistakes. An Emmy-award winning comedy, everybody! Richie gets his groove back In a standout episode near the end of the season, Richie stages at a Michelin-starred restaurant headed by Carmy\u2019s former mentor (played by Oscar winner Olivia Colman). Though he resists the gig at first, assuming Carmy just wanted to get rid of him for the week, Richie eventually finds the job revitalizing. He polishes the prongs of forks with delicate gusto, learns how to be an expediter (the meticulously organized kitchen staffer who keeps everyone on time and in check) and even runs all the way to his favorite Chicago deep-dish joint to pick up a pizza for a guest who said she didn\u2019t want to leave the city without it \u2013\u2013\u00a0only for the chef to deconstruct it, which, depending on your pizza allegiances, is bordering on sacrilegious. But the experience worked wonders for Richie, culminating in a cathartic singalong to Taylor Swift\u2019s early hit \u201cLove Story.\u201d This was especially important since, earlier in the season, Richie asked his young daughter if they could please listen to someone other than Swift. He returns to The Bear with a new swagger and an all-black suit, and he\u2019s confident enough to handle both front-of-house service and expediting behind the scenes. Sydney tastes success Chef Syd devoted the entire season to dreaming up a new menu she hoped would be worthy of a Michelin star. But she finds an unreliable partner in Carmy, who keeps ignoring her to spend time with his new girlfriend. Luckily, she can trust the rest of the kitchen, especially Tina, to keep things afloat \u2013\u2013 except maybe Marcus, who kind of asked her out. Syd awkwardly rebuffed him, and things were tense between them in the finale. Syd throws up from nerves behind the restaurant on family-and-friends night, but then she gets right back to work. It\u2019s enough to prove to her dad, who was so scared for Sydney to fail earlier in the season, that this is \u201cthe thing\u201d she\u2019s meant to do. Sydney may not have needed any more validation for her culinary ambitions, but it still means a lot that her dad finally gets it. Marcus\u2019 mom might be in danger \u2026 The final episode of the season focuses for too long on pastry chef Marcus\u2019 phone, buzzing with missed calls from his mom\u2019s nurse. Marcus\u2019 mom was seriously ill throughout season two, so it was a huge deal when, earlier in the season, Carmy sent our doughnut-loving chef to Copenhagen for a dessert apprenticeship. He was so hesitant to leave his mom, but the experience was creatively fulfilling and inspiring for sweet Marcus. Couldn\u2019t \u201cThe Bear\u201d let him hold onto that happiness? Multiple messages from his mother\u2019s nurse is definitely not a good sign for The Bear\u2019s chillest employee. \u2026 while Carmy\u2019s mom is still starting drama Things are \u2026 not great between the surviving Berzatto children and their mother, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Last season\u2019s Christmas flashback episode introduced us to Donna Berzatto as the hard-drinking, emotionally vampiric and deeply depressed mother who broke down while cooking the traditional Italian \u201cfeast of the seven fishes\u201d and drove her car through her own house. Merry Christmas, indeed. When we meet Donna in the present day, she\u2019s hiding outside the restaurant. She can\u2019t bring herself to come in because she doesn\u2019t want to ruin the nice thing her kids made together. Maybe she\u2019ll let her kids feed her at The Bear this season. What\u2019s on the menu in Season 3 The interpersonal dynamics in The Bear\u2019s kitchen are perhaps more fragile than the electrical wiring Mikey bungled to burn the restaurant down. Will Sydney and Carmy find a professional arrangement that works for them? Will Carmy win Claire back, or even try? What will become of Marcus\u2019 mom, and how will that affect him in the kitchen? Will The Bear earn that Michelin star and stick it out in the Chicago restaurant scene? Will Curtis, Colman, John Mulaney, Bob Odenkirk and Sarah Paulson return as guest stars, or will a new slew of celebs cameo? And which Taylor Swift song will Richie rock out to this season? All will be revealed (we hope) when \u201cThe Bear\u201d returns.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/entertainment/the-bear-season-2-recap-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

He was 90. The news was confirmed by Cobbs\u2019 brother Thomas Cobbs, who wrote on Facebook that the actor died on Tuesday \u201cpeacefully at his home in California.\u201d \u201cA beloved partner, big brother, uncle, surrogate parent, godfather and friend, Bill recently and happily celebrated his 90th birthday surrounded by cherished loved ones,\u201d the post continued. CNN has reached out to Cobbs\u2019 representatives for further comment. With a career spanning five decades, Cobbs had nearly 200 film and TV credits, and appeared in many beloved titles including the 1993 action-thriller \u201cDemolition Man\u201d and the Oscar-nominated 1996 classic \u201cThat Thing You Do!\u201d The Cleveland-native\u2019s career began in the mid-1970s when he got his start on the stage, appearing in Broadway productions including \u201cBlack Picture Show\u201d and \u201cThe First Breeze of Summer.\u201d He also later appeared in stage productions for \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom.\u201d Throughout the \u201970s and into the \u201880s, Cobbs\u2019 career took off.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_the-bear-season-3-review-jeremy-allen-white", "text": "A posted sign in a kitchen reads \u201cEvery Second Counts,\u201d but \u201cThe Bear\u201d is clearly in no hurry during its third season, proceeding at the slow-cooked pace of a show simmered in accolades and Emmys. Granted, the awards have come in a category in which the Hulu series doesn\u2019t really belong, but it remains TV\u2019s version of fine dining: big white plates with small but mouth-watering dollops of food on them. As noted, labeling the FX-produced program a comedy has more to do with award politicking than content, since the show merits that categorical designation less than almost any of the acclaimed series submitted on comedy ballots for award purposes, shows like \u201cBarry\u201d and \u201cNurse Jackie\u201d among them. Like the last streaming comedy awards darling, \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cThe Bear\u201d also manages to be very good and still feel a touch over-praised, perhaps in part because the adjectives thrown around to describe it understandably seek to match the volume of coverage devoted to it. The latest season\u2019s first episode nicely sets the table for the nine episodes to come, playing almost like a visual poem while reintroducing the characters. At Hulu\u2019s request, any spoiler-ish specifics need to be scarce, but series creator Christopher Storer (who directed seven of the new season\u2019s 10 installments) has the luxury of playing the long game, indulging in episodes devoted to individual players, while teasing out various threads without feeling compelled to pay everything off. The season\u2019s theme centers on the pursuit of dreams, both for chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and his able right hand Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), as they continue the process of transforming the restaurant into a fine-dining destination. Woven into that, given the recurring ghosts from Carmy\u2019s past, is the question of whether one must become a jerk to succeed in this business, contemplating distinctions between leading employees with a firm rein and a suffocating, soul-crushing one. The cast remains splendid and the storytelling moody and lyrical, in a way that both challenges the audience and rewards them for paying attention to small details. What \u201cThe Bear\u201d has lost is the element of surprise that greeted its arrival. By now there\u2019s less novelty in its fly-on-the-wall access to what goes on inside a kitchen, and once your leading man has become a marquee Calvin Klein model and high-level celebrity cameos (some new, others familiar) start piling up, it\u2019s harder to position the show as a plucky underdog. The world occupied by \u201cThe Bear\u201d is also a place where reviews matter very much, an attribute the Michelin-star-obsessed business of high-end restaurants shares with the awards-chasing strategies of streaming. At this point, though, the series has surely become review-proof, having earned the loyal patronage of those viewers happy to watch Storer and company spin plates, even during those meticulously prepared stretches, narratively speaking, when \u201cThe Bear\u201d is just spinning its wheels. \u201cThe Bear\u201d launched its third season June 26 on Hulu.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/the-bear-season-3-review-jeremy-allen-white/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The intrepid actor does, however, consider his role of Axel Foley in the \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d franchise to be one that stands out among the rest. \u201cBefore \u2018Beverly Hills Cop,\u2019 there had never been a movie that starred a Black man, a Black person, that was successful all around the world,\u201d Murphy said in a recent interview with Extra, pegged to the upcoming fourth installment of the movie series titled \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\u201d Murphy went on to say that \u201ceven still to this day, when Black folks, we make movies, most of the time they work in the States and outside of the country, they don\u2019t work.\u201d The Oscar-nominated actor mentioned his previous work in \u201cThe Nutty Professor\u201d and \u201cComing to America\u201d as examples of movies he starred in that were global hits, but said that \u201c\u2019Beverly Hills Cop\u2019 started it and started that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where you get Will (Smith) and The Rock, they do it now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2018Beverly Hills Cop\u2019 is the first one that did it.\u201d Capping on that worldwide love for the franchise, Murphy also confirmed that a fifth installment is currently in the works, and that the film\u2019s producer Jerry Bruckheimer is \u201cworking on the script.\u201d \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d first premiered in 1984 and became a career-defining role for Murphy. It earned an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay and spawned two sequels \u2013 1987\u2019s \u201cBeverly Hills Cop II\u201d and 1994\u2019s \u201cBeverly Hills Cop III\u201d \u2013 before the impending fourth entry.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far", "text": "As we hurtle headlong into summer, we\u2019re dully aware six months\u2019 worth of new content has already hit our streaming platforms and our feeds this year \u2013 and in some rare cases, even gotten us out of the house and into a movie theater. While consensus seems to be that a lot of what pop culture has brought forth thus far in 2024 has been a bit \u201cmeh,\u201d there have also been standouts, triumphs and attention-getting titles worth of celebrating. Here\u2019s our list of some the year\u2019s best performances and content so far: MOVIES Best (or, most chillingly effective) cameo - Jesse Plemons in \u2018Civil War\u2019 The Oscars \u201cconversation\u201d already includes \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star Plemons delivering a brief performance so menacing, it calls to minds the scant 24 minutes Anthony Hopkins spent on screen before clinching an Academy Award for \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d Plemons\u2019 demented \u201csoldier\u201d in a crumbled and war-torn version of the near-future US, dispensing life and death with callous disdain, more than drives home the point filmmaker Alex Garland was trying to make with his latest movie. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how \u201cCivil War\u201d star Kirsten Dunst \u2013 who is married to Plemons in real life \u2013 felt comfortable going home with him after shooting his scene. Best genre-defying comedy -\u00a0\u2018Problemista\u2019 Writer, director and actor Julio Torres is an exceptional cinematic voice who has actually been around for awhile, creating excellent content for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and series such as \u201cLos Espookys\u201d and the soon-to-be released \u201cFantasmas.\u201d \u201cProblemista,\u201d which won acclaim at several festivals in 2023, features Torres as a toy designer from El Salvador trying to find opportunities to unleash his creative vision in the US, while also figuring out a way to stay in the country. He runs into both expected roadblocks as well as ones that are frustratingly inane, like a poorly designed grant website with a broken drop-down menu that makes it impossible for anyone located outside of country to apply. With artfully realized details like that, \u201cProblemista\u201d does the remarkable job of remaining universally engaging while exploring a very specific and individual experience. Plus, Tilda Swinton turns in one of her best idiosyncratic and delightfully deranged performances opposite the gifted Torres. Best meet-cute -\u00a0\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Not since \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d has Anne Hathaway captured the zeitgeist like this, and we\u2019re here for it. In \u201cIdea,\u201d she has a run-in at Coachella with It-Boy Nicolas Galiztine (of \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d and \u201cMary & George\u201d fame) that is so silly, and so disarming, it\u2019s hard not to go along for the gender-flipped \u201cNotting Hill\u201d (plus a few age-gap years) that follows. Other reasons to watch include the music performance scenes (the fictional boy band in the film isn\u2019t so fictional in that it was essentially created for the movie and has actually released music) and Hathaway\u2019s character\u2019s positively enviable Los Angeles enclave. Best visuals\u00a0- The Harkonnens in \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 It\u2019s getting harder and harder to dazzle with a truly original vision on the silver screen, but Denis Villeneuve pulls it off in his epic sci-fi sequel, which had been drastically delayed for a variety of reasons but finally dawned in the theaters this past spring. The sequences depicting the villainous Harkonnens \u2013 mostly monochromatic and overexposed to create an off-putting yet hypnotic ambiance \u2013 simply look like nothing else, and succeed in imparting a foreboding and terrifically extraterrestrial feel. Actor Austin Butler\u2019s improvised kiss planted on his uncle Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) helps as well. Honorable mentions: Best sports-infused romance/romance-infused sports movie\u00a0- \u201cChallengers\u201d Best use of profanity -\u00a0Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley in \u201cWicked Little Letters\u201d Best music documentary\u00a0- \u201cIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\u201d Best horror film - \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d Best animated film\u00a0- \u201cOrion and the Dark\u201d TV Best production - \u2018Shogun\u2019 The series production of the year, FX\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d managed to create the second showstopping television event based on the acclaimed James Clavell novel, after the first series did way back in 1980. CNN\u2019s Brian Lowry wrote in his glowing review that the new show \u201cblends an intoxicating combination of action, romance and political intrigue, majestically spread over 10 parts that, unlike most limited series, sustain that weight and then some.\u201d Best show (somewhat) inspired by real life\u00a0- \u2018Baby Reindeer\u2019 While \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d is by no means an easy watch, Richard Gadd\u2019s (true to an extent, that will surely be battled over for some time) recounting of his experience with a stalker \u2013 and how a previous experience of abuse played into it \u2013 is ultimately gratifying for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Gadd\u2019s layered and vulnerable performance anchors the show, and serves as the perfect foil for the brilliant Jessica Gunning \u2013 who plays his increasingly menacing stalker Martha \u2013 to truly shine and chew scenery at the same time. Best visuals -\u00a0\u2018Ripley\u2019 In a very different way from the villainous Harkonnen family in \u201cDune\u201d \u2013 but still depicting a nefarious villain nonetheless \u2013 the black-and-white Netflix series \u201cRipley\u201d can draw you in at practically any juncture, with stunningly ornate stylistic details and seaside Italian locations that are gasp-inducing maybe partially because they lack color. You could take screenshots from almost any scene and frame them as fine art, and the show \u2013 an austere retelling of the Patricia Highsmith novel after Anthony Minghella\u2019s far more colorful (literally and figuratively) film from 1999 \u2013 has the beguiling ability to make your eyes crave its somehow comfortable, monochromatic simplicity when you\u2019re not watching it. Best sophomore season -\u00a0\u2018Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire\u2019 \u201cInterview\u201d has only improved on what\u2019s come before \u2013 its first season, as well as the 1994 Neil Jordan movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt \u2013 and continues to be one of the best-acted and best-written shows on TV, while also remaining the juiciest. Vamps have never been more compelling than the iterations of the Anne Rice characters depicted here. Alternating between notes that are tragic, beautiful and sometimes hilarious, it\u2019s got a bit of everything. Which means its no surprise that AMC announced a third season renewal just this week. \u2013 Scottie Andrew Best cameo -\u00a0Carrot Top on \u2018Hacks\u2019 When Mr. Top (real name Scott Thompson, who while you weren\u2019t looking has become a major fixture in Las Vegas) comes out on screen in the second episode of this well-received third season of \u201cHacks,\u201d double-takes abound as to whether that\u2019s \u201creally him.\u201d His commitment in the scene is top notch, and stick around for the post-show featurette to watch him take director notes and do great line readings. Honorable mentions go to Dierdre Hall playing herself, sort of, as Paul W. Downs\u2019 mother in the Christmas episode, along with Christopher Lloyd as her maybe-new paramour. \u201cHacks\u201d also enjoys featured guests J. Smith-Cameron from \u201cSuccession,\u201d who finally gives (great) face to Kathy \u2013 Deborah\u2019s detested and two-timing sister \u2013 and Helen Hunt as a ball-busting network exec. Honorable mentions: Best documentary portrait of a living artist -\u00a0\u201cSteve! (Martin): A documentary in two pieces\u201d Best unabashed romance series -\u00a0\u201cOne Day\u201d Best mindless guilty summer reality obsession -\u00a0\u201cSummer House\u201d Best mystery - \u201cMonsieur Spade\u201d MUSIC Best musical genre reinvention - Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 A truly monocultural moment in music, Queen Bey\u2019s landmark eighth studio album took the old \u2013 like the Beatles\u2019 \u201cBlackbird\u201d and Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene\u201d \u2013 and made it new and vital again. It shined a light on both trailblazers and up-and-coming artists that normally aren\u2019t associated with the ever-changing genre that is \u201ccountry,\u201d while betraying a very personal story from Beyonc\u00e9 herself about her own experience in the music world as an artist of color. Best album that\u2019s definitely not for everyone - Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018Only God Was Above Us\u2019 There are few immediately hummable songs on the new record that call to mind \u201cHarmony Hall\u201d off of their last album in 2019, and the instrumentation is rich and complex and strangely captivating, like the band wanted to stuff as many distinctive sounds into each song as they could. And their trademark clever wordplay is very much on display in songs like \u201cGen-X Cops.\u201d \u2013 Brandon Griggs Best breakout - Chappell Roan While her debut album \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d was released late last year, Roan has been steadily gaining attention ever since \u2013 and rightfully so \u2013 with viral performances at Coachella, the Governors Ball and Bonnaroo, along with a wonderful (and also very viral) set on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series in March. With a queer-centric performance style that is very drag-inspired, her latest single \u201cGood Luck Babe!\u201d epitomizes her fiercely independent, raw and authentic vibe. Plus, rock legend Elton John has already given his seal of approval. We\u2019re so in.  \u2013 Scottie Andrew and Alli Rosenbloom BOOKS \u2018Margo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u2019 by Rufi Thorpe Soon to be a TV series starring Elle Fanning, this novel \u2013 following a young, single, new mother with no job who joins OnlyFans and begins creating sexual content to stay afloat \u2013 toys with our perceptions of power and morality. What does it mean to be a good person, and who gets to decide? Over the course of the book, readers see Margo desperately trying to survive her situation, contending with the difficult \u2013 and sometimes unconventional \u2013 choices she makes in order to do so. \u2013 Leah Asmelash \u2018Sociopath: A Memoir\u2019 by Patric Gagne The release of \u201cRipley\u201d in April coincided with the arrival of the memoir\u00a0\u201cSociopath,\u201d\u00a0which offers a quite different case for demythologizing what it means to be a sociopath. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who\u2019s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and\u00a0argues that\u00a0the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed. \u2013 Sara Stewart PODCAST Best and most hilarious podcast about nothing in particular - \u2018The Bald and the Beautiful\u2019 The beloved queens from \u201cDrag Race\u201d Trixie and Katya blather on about nothing, and it\u2019s just everything. Their conversations get extremely raunchy and graphic, so be warned, but there are few funnier people on the planet than these two drag legends. \u2013 Scottie Andrew", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/entertainment/the-best-movies-tv-music-and-more-of-2024-so-far/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_entertainment_eddie-murphy-david-spade-saturday-night-live", "text": "Eddie Murphy is reflecting on some of the \u201ccheap shots\u201d he feels he\u2019s taken over the years. The Oscar-nominated actor and comedian \u2013 whose new film, \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d hits Netflix next week, was asked in an interview with the New York Times if he feels he\u2019s received unfair treatment from the press and his peers over the years. \u201cBack in the old days, they used to be relentless on me, and a lot of it was racist stuff,\u201d Murphy said. After mentioning how it \u201cwas a whole different world\u201d when he was coming up in the 1980s, Murphy brought up an instance \u201cwhen David Spade said that s-\u2013t about my career on \u2018SNL.\u2019\u201d The segment in question, from a December 1995 episode in which Spade did a year-in-review during \u201cHollywood Minute,\u201d included a picture of Murphy on which Spade commented, \u201cLook children, it\u2019s a falling star. Make a wish.\u201d Murphy told the Times the joke came after his film, \u201cVampire in Brooklyn,\u201d had flopped at the box office. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Yo, it\u2019s in-house! I\u2019m one of the family, and you\u2019re f-\u2013king with me like that?\u2019 It hurt my feelings like that,\u201d Murphy said. He rose to stardom on \u201cSNL\u201d as part of the core cast between 1980 and 1984, and is often cited as the reason the show was at one point saved from going off the air. \u201cThe producers thought it was OK to say that. All the people that have been on that show, you\u2019ve never heard nobody make no joke about anybody\u2019s career. Most people that get off that show, they don\u2019t go on and have these amazing careers. It was personal,\u201d Murphy later added. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Yo, how could you do that?\u2019 My career? Really? A joke about my career? So I thought that was a cheap shot. And it was kind of, I thought \u2013 I felt it was racist.\u201d Spade later wrote about receiving a phone call from an upset Murphy after the bit and feeling horrible about his \u201cstupid joke.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve come to see Eddie\u2019s point on this one, \u201d Spade wrote. \u201cEverybody in showbiz wants people to like them. That\u2019s how you get fans. But when you get reamed in a sketch or online or however, that s\u2014t staaaangs. And it can add up quickly.\u201d Murphy has mostly stayed away from the long-running NBC sketch show over the years, though he appeared briefly in the \u201cSNL\u201d 40th anniversary special in 2015 and returned as a host to much fanfare in 2019. \u201cIn the long run it\u2019s all good, worked out great. I\u2019m cool with David Spade, I\u2019m cool with Lorne Michaels. I went back to SNL,\u201d Murphy said this week. \u201cIt\u2019s all love\u2026 but I had a couple of cheap shots!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/entertainment/eddie-murphy-david-spade-saturday-night-live/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_entertainment_inside-out-2-box-office-disney-critics-woke", "text": "As emotions go, Disney\u2019s loudest critics might sound angry, but \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is bringing the studio nothing but joy. The Walt Disney Co. has often found itself cast as a reluctant participant in the culture wars, yielding occasional calls for boycotts and proclamations the company has become \u201ctoo woke.\u201d Yet the explosive box-office success of \u201cInside Out 2\u201d provides necessary perspective about a vast audience that remains hungry for Disney content, certainly enough to generate a major hit. Granted, those who regularly rail against Disney \u2013 which was drawn into a political battle with Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, beginning in 2022 over the state\u2019s so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill \u2013 have sought to rationalize the performance of the Pixar sequel, insisting its plot doesn\u2019t toe the \u201cwoke\u201d line the way something like the studio\u2019s latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d series, \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d does. Notably, a review-bombing campaign has been waged against the latter, depressing its score on the critic-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes to almost comical levels. Look a little closer, though, and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d features an effortless emphasis on values like diversity and inclusion that have helped make Disney a target. The Disney unit behind it, Pixar, also enjoyed a less-ostentatious box-office win last summer with \u201cElemental,\u201d a movie that used an allegorical relationship between characters made up of fire and water to explore bigotry, the immigrant experience, and a love story about overcoming differences. Whatever the reason \u2013 and with the sequel coming nine years after the original, pent-up demand is surely a part \u2013 there\u2019s no denying \u201cInside Out 2\u2019s\u201d results, with the movie adding $100 million at the North American box office during its second weekend \u2013 a record for an animated film \u2013 bringing its domestic total to $355 million, eclipsing \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d as the year\u2019s top movie in just 10 days of release. Worldwide, the film\u2019s haul has ballooned to nearly $725 million. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d will almost surely join the increasingly rare list of $1 billion-plus grossers since the Covid outbreak, which consists of sequels to \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cJurassic World\u201d as well as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting Disney has consciously sought to shy away from engaging in political battles, with CEO Robert Iger, who rejoined the company in that capacity in 2022, telling CNBC in November, \u201c\u201cWe have to entertain first. It\u2019s not about messages.\u201d In essence, Iger simply stated the obvious: That Disney, like any major corporation, prioritizes its profits and stock price, which means trying not to alienate potential customers, no matter how eager some of them are to be offended. Disney employees represent another constituency, which offers some context regarding why former CEO Bob Chapek finally chose, belatedly and under pressure from them, to criticize Florida. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d certainly looks like a triumph for Iger\u2019s strategy, while still conveying messages in a more subtle (and for those seeking any opportunity to pounce, less inflammatory) manner. Indeed, summer 2024 is shaping up to be a banner one for Disney, with the superhero satire \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d expected to another major attraction when the film opens in July, catering to an R-rated crowd that underscores the demographic reach of its assorted assets. That doesn\u2019t mean those who have turned Disney\u2019s Mouse ears into targets will be less inclined to rail against something like \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d distorting what the \u201cStar Wars\u201d show does and doesn\u2019t do in the process. It\u2019s a reminder, though, that plenty of people still see in the Disney name the ideal of entertainment that they can share with loved ones, and that as long as the studio fulfills that implied contract, woke or otherwise, Mickey and friends won\u2019t be going broke anytime soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/entertainment/inside-out-2-box-office-disney-critics-woke/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_entertainment_the-boys-season-4-review-political-drama", "text": "\u201cThe Boys\u201d began with an intriguing question for our superhero-infused pop culture \u2013 namely, what would happen if extraordinary powers were wedded with corruption, neuroses and corporate greed. Yet that dark, satirical take on the genre has blossomed into TV\u2019s most political drama, a quality even more overtly on display in its much-anticipated fourth season. Put more simply, don\u2019t let the masks and capes fool you. The fact that the latest episodes drop as the US braces for a presidential campaign only magnifies elements that have existed throughout the show\u2019s run on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, becoming the service\u2019s signature series, including the spinoffs \u201cGen V\u201d and \u201cThe Boys Presents: Diabolical.\u201d The fourth season features the usual conflict between superheroes in the uneasy employ of Vought International and those who oppose them. The former cohort begins with the near-invincible, psychopathic Homelander (Antony Starr), whose Superman-like public persona is carefully manicured to hide those qualities, while the latter take their lead from Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), even if they frequently question his methods. The Butcher-Homelander standoff is complicated by their battle for the soul of the latter\u2019s biological son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), which itself encompasses consideration of the question of nature versus nature. More than any season before it, the new arc leans into the political realm thanks to the involvement of politician Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), and efforts by Vought and Homelander to impact the political debate. That includes thinly-veiled references to a group clearly intended to represent QAnon, the conspiracy-minded movement, and the use of propaganda tactics to manipulate the public and voters. At one point, the characters attend an event called Truthcon, where a banner that reads \u201cThere are no conspiracies \u2013 or coincidences\u201d is prominently flown. The show also reveals the private disdain of those in (and with) power toward their supporters, a point made in a uniquely \u201cThe Boys\u201d-esque manner. To punctuate that, there\u2019s a new hero, Firecracker (Valorie Curry), whose political leanings echo Vought News\u2019 conservative commentators (she even gets her own show). As series creator Eric Kripke told Entertainment Weekly, the character serves as a surrogate for \u201cconspiracy-minded movements and the super extreme right-wing news media.\u201d Dispensing with subtlety, Kripke and company have surrounded that satire in violence and excess, qualities that feel organic to this world, where the traditional ideal of heroism is used to obscure brutal realities. Although the Deep (Chace Crawford), an Aquaman-like member of the Vought-backed superhero team known as the Seven, is often a semi-pathetic sources of derision, he sums that mentality up when he comes to the realization, as he puts it, \u201cViolence is power.\u201d Inevitably, the new season involves new, unexpected and uneasy alliances, as well as the thorny (and seemingly perennial) issue of finding ways to neutralize Homelander, which hardly feels like a fair fight. Having earned its reputation as the most gruesome and kinky show on television, \u201cThe Boys\u201d grapples with a certain pressure to fulfill those expectations for the faithful. In its totality, the eight-episode season largely manages to clear that bar (or should one prefer, limbo under it), including a few explosively funny (and not incidentally, grisly) visual gags. Success has also enabled \u201cThe Boys\u201d to play a long game, meaning nobody should expect too much closure from this season when there\u2019s a fifth and final season to come. From that view, the series might have lost some of its freshness but not its ability to surprise and provoke, peeling back its mask a little further to issue a warning about the danger of brightly colored fascism, a message clearly intended to echo beyond its world and into ours. \u201cThe Boys\u201d begins its fourth season June 13 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/entertainment/the-boys-season-4-review-political-drama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Part of the problem is the perspective tilts heavily toward the Kidman character\u2019s daughter, Zara (Joey King), who works as an assistant to actor Chris Cole (Efron), best known for playing a superhero called Icarus Rush. To Zara\u2019s chagrin, he\u2019s prone to stereotypical excesses, sending her on menial errands like running to a store to buy him isolated whey protein. (If you have to ask, it\u2019s not for you.) Zara has watched Chris use and dump women, threatening to quit almost as often as he talks about firing her. Their latest spat brings him to the house she shares with her mom, Kidman\u2019s Brooke, a successful and conveniently widowed author. After some mild awkwardness, Chris and Brooke wind up in bed together, leaving her, as she says, \u201cstarting to feel things again.\u201d Zara is understandably horrified by the prospect of the two hooking up, prompting her mom to offer that their age difference is a mere 16 years, not 20 (which is more accurate in reality, but never mind), so maybe just May-September in calendar terms. Directed by Richard Lagravenese \u2013 whose most pertinent credit here might be adapting the screenplay for \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d \u2013 \u201cA Family Affair\u201d suffers from the wholesale self-absorption of all concerned, which makes the notion of this as some grand romance harder to swallow. Not that the director along with writer Carrie Solomon don\u2019t try, including a dinner scene with Zara\u2019s grandma (Kathy Bates, again underemployed) that works hard at humanizing Chris beyond just Efron\u2019s \u201cIron Claw\u201d-sculpted physique. While there are a few amusing lines scattered along the way (when Brooke says she\u2019s Australian, Chris asks if she knows Margot Robbie), the comedy largely fizzles beyond the initial introductions, and the romance \u2013 after that first encounter \u2013 doesn\u2019t come across as terribly convincing. That leaves some star charisma, but not enough chemistry, to propel this across the finish line, dragging the customary Hollywood cliches \u2013 and lots of musical montages, seemingly to fill out the running time \u2013 along with it. Granted, \u201cA Family Affair\u201d probably qualified as a win for Netflix as soon as Kidman and Efron signed on the dotted lines, at least in terms of the algorithm and minutes-watched totals their pairing will generate. Even setting the expectations bar at a modest height, though, the movie doesn\u2019t quite clear it \u2013 another case, in rom-com terms, where the idea of them, as a marquee matchup, proves superior to the execution. \u201cA Family Affair\u201d premieres June 28 on Netflix. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/entertainment/a-family-affair-review-nicole-kidman-zac-efron/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Devoid of surprises, it\u2019s an efficiently violent return for Alba after a lengthy acting hiatus, briefly interrupted by the cop show \u201cL.A.\u2019s Finest.\u201d Coming a few months after she stepped back from her other vocation as founder of The Honest Company, \u201cTrigger Warning\u201d essentially plays like a minor variation on the Dwayne Johnson remake of \u201cWalking Tall,\u201d which is to say, there\u2019s nothing new here, and scant suspense about the contours of the plot. Still, Alba comes armed with a steely attitude and strong revenge motivation as Parker, a Special Forces commando who \u2013 following a brief introduction in the field \u2013 gets summoned back to her hometown after her father\u2019s death, which quickly appears to be more serious than an accidental mine-shaft cave-in. In addition to the mine, dad ran the local watering hole, though Parker has little interest in taking over her inheritance. The longer she hangs around, though, the more suspicious she becomes, which is complicated by her history with the local sheriff (Mark Webber), the fact his brother (Jake Weary) looks to be up to no good and that their father (Anthony Michael Hall) is a conservative senator who asks rude questions like what \u201cLatinx\u201d means. Parker also receives some help from one of her dad\u2019s employees, Mike (\u201cThe Night Agent\u2019s\u201d Gabriel Basso), but eventually she\u2019s going to have to Schwarzenegger her way through all this, having already exhibited a knack for close-quarters combat and wielding a knife. Making her US debut, Indonesian director Mouly Surya brings a kinetic (if slightly repetitive) quality to the action for those weaned on the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d style of fight choreography, where stabbing or shooting someone once never quite seems to be good enough. Alba credibly tackles that aspect, while portraying Parker as a grieving daughter (complete with gauzy flashbacks) to give her a bit more depth than the customary killing automaton. Netflix has found a fertile niche by featuring promotable stars in such genre fare where reviews, frankly, don\u2019t matter much, with Jennifer Lopez\u2019s sci-fi adventure \u201cAtlas\u201d among the recent examples. \u201cTrigger Warning\u201d might not be packing anything unexpected in the chamber, but for those who come to it with the proper mind-set, the movie doesn\u2019t wind up firing blanks either. \u201cTrigger Warning\u201d premieres June 21 on Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/entertainment/trigger-warning-review-jessica-alba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

And now, it\u2019s becoming just that. Well\u2026 sort of. The Hallmark Channel, along with the NFL, Skydance Sports and the Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 otherwise known as the team Kelce plays football for \u2013 announced on Tuesday that they\u2019ve joined forces to produce an upcoming holiday movie titled \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d which is set to start production next month. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d follows Alana Higman (Hunter King), who \u201cis sure that her family\u2019s lifelong history as Kansas City Chiefs superfans makes them a frontrunner to win the team\u2019s \u2018Fan of the Year\u2019 contest,\u201d according to a news release. The team\u2019s director of fan engagement, Derrick (Tyler Hynes), is tasked with evaluating how Alana\u2019s family measures up, and \u201cas the pair spends time together, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a spark between them.\u201d According to the release, the movie will honor the Chiefs\u2019 hometown by filming entirely in Kansas City, including at the team\u2019s home turf GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. Romance took center stage at many Chiefs games last year, with Swift and Kelce becoming romantically linked in September and the pop megastar being seen in attendance at several games to support the Super Bowl champ, who serves as the team\u2019s star tight end. Their relationship has since become a public spectacle as the couple are frequently seen at each other\u2019s events. Most recently, Kelce made his on-stage debut at Swift\u2019s concert in London on Sunday, just one day after the pair went \u201cInstagram official.\u201d While the plot of \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t exactly based on Kelce and Swift\u2019s ongoing romance, it seems fair to presume that this Hallmark movie perhaps was inspired by it \u2013 especially given the Chiefs\u2019 involvement. The announcement does not specify whether Swift and Kelce are directly involved in the project or gave it their blessing, but CNN has reached out to representatives of each for comment.

{"id": "2024_06_26_entertainment_judy-garland-trolley-song-pride-cec", "text": "It was 1944 when the trolley first started to clang. \u201cThe Trolley Song,\u201d a second-act standout from the 1944 movie musical \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d was sung by Judy Garland in striking Technicolor. It was released back when gay was more commonly understood to mean \u201chappy,\u201d a rainbow was just a weather phenomenon and a trolley was just another mode of transportation. And yet it has found new life online nearly 80 years later as an unlikely anthem for LGBTQ Pride. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d has been making the rounds again this year among young queer people who can\u2019t resist the brassy gift of Garland\u2019s vocal performance, its campy, heightened atmosphere and its timeless fun. \u201cHappy pride month (sic) to Judy Garland in the trolley song. And also to the trolley,\u201d one person wrote on X. \u201cThere\u2019s no pride month without the trolley song,\u201d said another. Some hope \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d will be a featured lip-sync on the next season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d while others believe the song deserves to be released as several club-ready remixes. At least one person called it Garland\u2019s version of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s summer smash \u201cEspresso,\u201d a frothy single about a fling that\u2019s a staple on many Pride playlists. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is not the most obvious candidate for a Pride playlist. It lacks the overt LGBTQ imagery of \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d perhaps Garland\u2019s most famous song, or the appeal of Garland\u2019s live performances toward the end of her life, which were heavily attended by her gay fans. But a closer read reveals why it resonates with LGBTQ fans today. \u201cThe tempo, the lyrics, the onomatopoeia \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s all super gay,\u201d said Dave Karger, a Turner Classic Movies host who frequently presents movie musicals, including \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d on the channel. (CNN and TCM share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.) Patrick Kelleher, a social justice organizer in Ireland who\u2019s written about his relationship with Garland and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d has noticed it popping up more frequently in his online circles, even declaring it \u201cthis year\u2019s Pride anthem.\u201d It\u2019s thrilling, he said, that the song that\u2019s brightened his life for so many years is now bringing other young LGBTQ people the same joy. \u201cAs someone who has been obsessing over this song for more than a decade, I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s getting all this renewed attention,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cAnd honestly, if \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 came on at a Pride event, I think the crowd would go absolutely wild.\u201d It\u2019s a campy crowd-pleaser Though \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is a rollicking crowd-pleaser, the scene in which it takes place starts out with Garland in a huff. Her character, Esther Smith, is a lovestruck teenager in Missouri, months before the 1904 World\u2019s Fair. She begins the song somberly traipsing around the trolley, wondering why her love interest has not boarded with her. When she finally spots him running to catch the caboose, the song revs up as Esther\u2019s excitement grows. \u201c\u2018Clang, clang, clang\u2019 went the trolley, \u2018ding, ding, ding\u2019 went the bell, \u2018zing, zing, zing\u2019 went my heartstrings \u2014 from the moment I saw him, I fell!\u201d she sings, wide-eyed and moony. In her \u201chigh-starch collar\u201d and periwinkle gloves, her giddiness radiates off the screen. The song\u2019s age hasn\u2019t diminished its appeal. Paige Turner, a seasoned New York-based drag queen, has been performing \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d for 10 years. Every time she steps onstage in her own \u201chigh-starch collar\u201d and costume made to look like Esther\u2019s trolley outfit, she says her audience starts \u201cscreeching\u201d with glee. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018Oh my God, is she doing \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019? Oh my God, is she coming out like that?\u2019 And it\u2019s a familiarity you want to give people\u2026\u201d Turner told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s respectable camp.\u201d \u201cThe Trolley Song\u2019s\u201d campiness lies in its hyper-stylized, theatrical, exaggerated quality that tips into fantasy. Kelleher likened it to Cher\u2019s 1998 autotune fantasia \u201cBelieve\u201d but \u201csomehow even more gay.\u201d Like Cher\u2019s hit, \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is dripping in artifice. But Garland\u2019s earnest delivery cuts through what could be considered corny to deliver a classic. \u201cWhen you take the musical theatre leanings out, \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 isn\u2019t all that different to some of the big pop songs queer people have tended to gravitate towards in more recent years,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cThe song and the clip from the film that accompanies it are instantly iconic.\u201d It\u2019s upbeat and joyful \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis\u201d was one of Garland\u2019s signature songs even before her death. Culture writer and critic Manuel Betancourt, who wrote a 33 1/3 book on the seminal live album from 1962, \u201cJudy at Carnegie Hall,\u201d said that the song received an \u201corgiastic reaction\u201d from her audience when it appeared in her opening medley. The singer Rufus Wainwright has covered \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d at least twice \u2013\u2013 once in 2007, when he covered \u201cJudy at Carnegie Hall,\u201d and again in 2022 with his live album \u201cRufus Does Judy at Capitol Studios.\u201d Both are open-hearted homages to the diva and her 1960s live performances, which were embraced by her gay fans. Earlier this month, Wainwright shared a TikTok of himself singing the song once again, eyes closed in bliss. \u201cI have had the most fun ever in my life singing that song,\u201d Wainwright told CNN in an email. \u201cOnce you get on that trolley with Judy, there is no getting off. Same with your sexuality.\u201d \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is one of Garland\u2019s \u201cbest-known, truly upbeat and celebratory numbers,\u201d Karger said, which makes it especially fitting for a month meant to honor the LGBTQ community and its hard-won victories, though the work toward equality is still in progress. With its quick tempo and spirited delivery, Turner said \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d can make her \u201cforget that the world is a crappy place sometimes.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re almost running to catch up and get on the ride with her, and we feel a part of it,\u201d she said. It\u2019s gay history Dee Michel, author of \u201cFriends of Dorothy: Why Gay Boys and Gay Men Love \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019\u201d was mystified as to why young queer people are meme-ing an 80-year-old song and praising it as a Pride anthem. He posits that the young LGBTQ community might be taking history that is not necessarily rooted in fact (such as the myth that Garland\u2019s death kickstarted the Stonewall riots or that \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d is the inspiration for the Pride flag) because they want to feel closer to their community. According to Michel, these \u201cmyths\u201d can be powerful stories that a culture uses to \u201chelp explain their place in the universe.\u201d Without a monolithic gay history lesson or a one-size-fits-all cultural landscape to guide them, queer youth may choose to believe in \u201cfolklore\u201d about the gay archives, Michel said. \u201cThere\u2019s this drive to be part of gay history and part of gay culture and feel like there\u2019s something larger than you that you\u2019re participating in,\u201d Michel told CNN. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what folklore does.\u201d Believing in Garland\u2019s influence can mean believing in something comforting. \u201cWhether (the history) was true or not, it doesn\u2019t really matter to people, because they want it to be true and it makes sense to them,\u201d Michel said. And \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d and its rapturous response at Garland\u2019s concerts, attended by supportive gay fans, are a part of her legend as a gay icon. \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d has been adopted by LGBTQ people since Garland first started singing it in concert. Jim Bailey, a legendary Garland impersonator, often performed \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d dressed for adoring crowds that included the likes of Princess Diana, King Charles and Garland\u2019s daughter Liza Minnelli. It\u2019s been covered by various gay men\u2019s choruses, including those in London and Los Angeles. The song was even included in a medley on an \u201cAll Stars\u201d season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d in a challenge inspired by Garland. Though Garland rarely publicly voiced her support for LGBTQ people, queer people for decades have gravitated toward her because she\u2019s a \u201cwoman of resilience\u201d who endured abuse and tragedy throughout her life and was still a consummate artist, said Turner, the drag performer. And maybe she\u2019s still inspiring a sense of belonging among young queer people who are jamming to \u201cThe Trolley Song,\u201d whether it\u2019s their first listen or the 100th replay. \u201cIf there are young people out there \u2026 who are putting \u2018The Trolley Song\u2019 out, how fantastic is that?\u201d Turner said. No matter that \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d is nearly 80 years old. It\u2019s a cultural artifact that\u2019s still ripe for discovery \u2013\u2013 and a certified banger. \u201cGay people simply have great taste and to have great taste is to love Judy,\u201d Karger said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/entertainment/judy-garland-trolley-song-pride-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

SXSW organizers\u00a0in March\u00a0expressed support for the right of artists to express \u201cfree speech,\u201d but also defended its US Army sponsorship, describing it as part of their \u201ccommitment to bring forward ideas that shape our world.\u201d Three months after the protests, SXSW announced this week that they had dropped the US Army as a sponsor ahead of the 2025 festival. \u201cAfter careful consideration, we are revising our sponsorship model,\u201d read an official statement shared on the\u00a0SXSW website. \u201cAs a result, the US Army, and companies who engage in weapons manufacturing, will not be sponsors of SXSW 2025.\u201d When reached by CNN, a spokesperson for SXSW declined to comment further on the decision. In a statement, a spokesperson for the US Army did not address the separation from SXSW, but said they will continue to seek opportunities in creative industries. \u201cWe appreciated the opportunity to join South by Southwest in 2024. With U.S. Army Futures Command headquartered in Austin, we value any opportunity to join with our community to ignite discovery and make new connections,\u201d Lt. Col. Jamie Dobson, US Army Futures Command spokesperson, said. \u201cThe Army will continue to seek opportunities to meet technology innovators and leaders, explore new ideas and insights, and create dynamic industry partnerships because tomorrow is worth protecting.\u201d Two\u00a0sources familiar with the festival\u2019s change in sponsorship\u00a0told CNN\u00a0that the move was not a criticism of the Army, and should not be seen as a victory for protesters against\u00a0the\u00a0festival or the US government. One source noted that the change signals a desire to find a commercial sponsorship partner for SXSW\u2019s future. The Texas-based\u00a0music and tech\u00a0festival has expanded\u00a0in recent years to include screenings and events from major Hollywood studios and networks. The festival brings more than 300,000 attendees to Austin for a lineup of conferences, panels, music showcases, film premieres and exhibitions.\u00a0Selena Gomez,\u00a0Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\u00a0and investor\u00a0Mark Cuban\u00a0were among the\u00a0participants\u00a0at this year\u2019s festival.\u00a0SXSW recently announced a European expansion of the festival, which will host its first London edition in June 2025. Music group insults Israel while hailing SXSW\u2019s decision to drop US Army Shortly after SXSW\u2019s announcement that the festival was parting ways with the US Army, one of the most vocal bands to boycott the 2024 festival earlier this year took to social media to comment on the change\u00a0with an inflammatory\u00a0message. \u201cUS ARMY is OUT of SXSW,\u201d the Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap posted to X\u00a0on Wednesday,\u00a0with a handshake emoji next to an emoji of a Palestinian territory flag. \u201cF\u2013K ISRAEL,\u201d the post concluded. Though Kneecap is just one smaller-known band, their rhetoric in response to SXSW dropping army and weapons manufacturing sponsorship reflects the tension felt across creative industries, which has hit an all-time high during the Israel-Hamas war. A spokesperson for SXSW declined to comment on Kneecap\u2019s post or whether the band would be invited back next year, but a source indicated that the anti-Israel language displayed in the group\u2019s post would be in violation of the festival\u2019s code of conduct. Known\u00a0for their provocative lyrics and strident messaging on politics and social causes, Kneecap has\u00a0a history, prior to October 7, of criticizing Israel and flying\u00a0Palestinian flags during their concerts and wearing Palestinian colors during public appearances. Earlier this year, the rap trio wore pro-Palestine badges on Ireland\u2019s\u00a0\u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d\u00a0\u2013 after Irish news outlets reported that the performers had been warned by producers that their late-night performance would be cancelled if they wore the\u00a0badges on live TV \u2013 but they did so anyway. A spokesperson for the Irish broadcasting company, RT\u00c9, told Ireland\u2019s The Journal at the time, \u201cDuring the live performance and the subsequent interview,\u00a0the band chose not to comply with that agreement.\u201d The pro-Palestinian movement is popular among some Irish who view Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians as analogous to Britain\u2019s historical relationship with Ireland. In\u00a02023, The Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) announced that their\u00a0\u201cIrish Artists Pledge to Boycott Israel\u201d\u00a0had passed 1,500 signatories, including Kneecap. When contacted by CNN, Kneecap manager Dan Lambert said the group stands by their\u00a0social media\u00a0post. Lambert added that the group has not been contacted by SXSW or asked to perform at next year\u2019s festival, but noted \u201cit is way too early\u201d and said if they should receive an invite, they have not decided whether they would attend. Festival sponsorship criticisms SXSW isn\u2019t the only music festival that has seen artists pull out over sponsorships since the Israel-Hamas war began. This past May, more than 100 artists pulled out of The Great Escape festival in the UK, due to the event\u2019s sponsorship by Barclays Bank over alleged ties to arms manufactures that work with the Israeli\u00a0military.\u00a0Barclays later\u00a0suspended its sponsorship\u00a0of all music festivals put on by Live Nation,\u00a0according to Reuters, and says it does not invest its own money in defense companies supplying Israel in Gaza. However, unlike other artists who boycotted The Great Escape, Kneecap continued their participation in that festival,\u00a0offering an explanation\u00a0that their livelihood depends on festival performances. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for middle class people with a steady nine-to-five income to write online that we should be boycotting stuff,\u201d one of the bandmates told\u00a0The Irish News\u00a0in an interview in May. \u201cBut this is our work. Obviously, we pulled out of SXSW because it was literally sponsored by the American army, but we\u2019re not f\u2013kin\u2019 ridiculous either.\u201d Back in March when artists were boycotting SXSW, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott took to social media to comment on the SXSW protesters, prompting the festival to publicly disagree with the governor. \u201cBye. Don\u2019t come back,\u201d Abbott wrote on X at the time. \u201cWe are proud of the U.S. military in Texas. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t come here.\u201d \u201cSXSW does not agree with Governor Abbott,\u201d the festival\u2019s X account posted in response.\u00a0\u201cWe fully respect the decision these artists made to exercise their right to free speech.\u201d At that time, SXSW said it supports \u201chuman rights for all,\u201d adding that \u201cthe situation in the Middle East is tragic, and it illuminates the heightened importance of standing together against injustice.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/entertainment/sxsw-us-army-sponsorship-political-tightrope-festivals/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Her advisors originally wanted to try and position her as the next Barbra Streisand. \u201cLook, you already had a Streisand,\u201d Lauper recalled telling them. Next, she said they pitted her against Madonna, as the two women rose to fame around the same time. \u201cAs if you could only have one woman who is successful. What the hell is that about?\u201d  Lauper told the publication. \u201cThat woman\u2019s been entertaining us for years. She\u2019s made great pop songs.

{"id": "2024_06_23_entertainment_orphan-black-echoes-review-krysten-ritter", "text": "Cloning is a pretty good metaphor for one of the key methods employed to populate TV these days, but \u201cOrphan Black: Echoes\u201d at least tries to distinguish itself from its predecessor, which ran five seasons and provided an Emmy-winning showcase for Tatiana Maslany. Starring Krysten Ritter, the new AMC series prints out its share of twists without possessing the DNA to launch another clone army. Adopting a somewhat tighter focus, the show is set in 2052, with Lucy (Ritter, a.k.a. Marvel\u2019s \u201cJessica Jones\u201d) fleeing a facility where she appears to have sprung fully formed from some kind of pink ooze with no memory of who she is, told only that she\u2019s been through \u201ca procedure.\u201d Flash forward, and after her escape she\u2019s found a modicum of normalcy in the outside world with Jack (Avan Jogia) and his teenage daughter (Zariella Langford-Haughton). Alas, secrets don\u2019t stay buried in sci-fi dramas, and Lucy is discovered by the scientist, Dr. Kira Manning (Keeley Hawes), who \u201cprinted\u201d her, while being pursued by operatives that compel her, as Lucy says, to \u201cfind out who I was to protect who I am.\u201d Doing so raises plenty of questions about her past identity, who\u2019s responsible for this elaborate (and illegal) technology and what the shadowy \u201cthey\u201d behind it want with her. The answers prove somewhat unexpected, including those pertaining to a teenager, Jules (Amanda Fix), also reluctantly drawn into the plot. Details dribble out gradually over the 10-episode season while providing an emotional hook that brings some welcome depth to the characters, which include the obligatory billionaire (an appropriately creepy James Hiroyuki Liao) who has championed Manning\u2019s work but whose motives remain suspect. As noted, while \u201cOrphan Black\u201d enjoyed a devoted cult following that even developed its own hashtag-anointed nickname \u201cClone Club,\u201d its narrative contortions became less engaging over time, a trap that \u201cEchoes\u201d mostly avoids, at least coming off the assembly line. Inevitably, though, the cloning concept has a way of diluting drama, as variations on the theme involving multiple versions of the same identity (HBO\u2019s take on \u201cWestworld\u201d comes to mind) have discovered, mostly the hard way. Created by Anna Fishko (\u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d), who produces the series along with the original\u2019s co-creator John Fawcett, the new show does a decent job threading the needle in terms of providing a connection to its namesake while establishing a separate set of stakes and characters that stand on their own. That said, Ritter\u2019s role isn\u2019t as conspicuously showy as Maslany\u2019s was, which largely defined that series. More broadly, AMC has also found a fertile niche in genre fare, with its Anne Rice series \u201cInterview With the Vampire,\u201d its acquisition of \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d and now this show to help flesh out its still-\u201cWalking Dead\u201d-heavy lineup. That\u2019s not an unqualified endorsement of sending in the clones, but tasked with giving \u201cOrphan Black\u201d an updated genetic makeover, \u201cEchoes\u201d credibly takes on what is, however one splices it, a challenging and complicated procedure. \u201cOrphan Black: Echoes\u201d premieres June 23 at 10 p.m. ET on AMC, BBC America and AMC+.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/entertainment/orphan-black-echoes-review-krysten-ritter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_entertainment_angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-key-moments", "text": "It was a seemingly perfect family in a picture-perfect magazine feature. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie sat in their sunlit glory, playing with their pretend children in their pretend backyard in a now-legendary 60-page photo spread titled \u201cDomestic Bliss\u201d in the July 2005 issue of W Magazine. The scenes of make-believe family depicted in the pages of the fashion magazine, published nearly 19 years ago, foreshadowed what went on to become a reality for the \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith\u201d co-stars: Six children between them and a loving relationship that saw the pair experience professional successes and weather personal hardships in seemingly equal measure. Once Hollywood\u2019s most glamorous power couple, Pitt and Jolie have been locked in a fraught web of legal proceedings since 2016. The divorce of the couple once dubbed Brangelina is not yet finalized and a painful family rift remains. A source close to Pitt told CNN that the actor \u201cloves his family\u201d and \u201dwants what\u2019s best\u201d for them. \u201cAnd so he\u2019s stayed silent on discussing anything about his kids even though it\u2019s obviously very upsetting,\u201d the individual said. The length of their ongoing divorce can be attributed to a number of factors, including a contentious custody trial, fallout from a 2016 incident on a plane and a complicated legal dispute relating to Jolie\u2019s sale of her stake in Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, the French winery that the former couple once co-owned and the property on which they were married in 2014. All Jolie has ever wanted, a source close to Jolie told CNN, \u201cis peace for her family and she hopes [Pitt] will eventually want that too.\u201d CNN has reached to representatives for both Pitt and Jolie for comment. Their Hollywood love story may have been photogenic, but their split has been nothing less than a legal drama with no end yet written. Here\u2019s a look back at their legal feud so far: The 2016 plane incident What could be considered the end of Brangelina allegedly took place on a private plane in September 2016. Details surrounding the circumstances of the incident emerged in August 2022, when a heavily redacted FBI report, provided to CNN by a source at the time, revealed that Jolie had accused Pitt of physically assaulting her and verbally abusing their children while they were aboard the private jet, traveling to the US from France. Pitt became the center of a probe related to the incident but was never arrested or charged, according to an FBI statement at the time. Jolie alleged that Pitt \u201cgrabbed her by her head,\u201d \u201cgrabbed her by the shoulders,\u201d shook her, pushed her into the plane\u2019s bathroom wall and was yelling profanities at her, according to the FBI report, which also stated Pitt allegedly lunged toward one of their children, resulting in Jolie suffering a physical injury after she tried to intervene. In an October 2022 countersuit in a legal case involving their winery (more on that in a bit), Jolie alleged that Pitt \u201cchoked one of the children and struck another in the face\u201d during the incident. In response, a representative for Pitt told CNN in a statement at the time that, \u201cBrad has accepted responsibility for what he did but will not for things he didn\u2019t do.\u201d In April, Jolie claimed in another legal filing from the winery case that Pitt\u2019s \u201chistory of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family\u2019s September 2016 plane trip.\u201d The filing did not go into further detail about the alleged prior abuse. According to that filing, Jolie chose not to press charges against Pitt in relation to the plane incident at the time because she believed \u201cthe best course was for Pitt to accept responsibility and help the family recover from the post-traumatic stress he caused.\u201d Jolie files for divorce In September 2016, just days after the incident on the private jet, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences. According to the petition, Jolie asked the court to grant her sole physical custody of the couple\u2019s then-minor children \u2013 Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivienne, who were between the ages of 8 and 15 at the time \u2013 with visitation rights for Pitt, who would retain joint legal custody. In a 2020 interview with Vogue India, Jolie said that she \u201cseparated\u201d from Pitt for the \u201cwellbeing\u201d of her family. \u201cIt was the right decision. I continue to focus on their healing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are six very brave, very strong young people.\u201d Custody battle Four of Jolie and Pitt\u2019s six children have turned 18 during the course of their ongoing divorce proceedings and their custody arrangement today pertains only to their twins Vivienne and Knox, who are now 15. According to a 2016 court order obtained by CNN at the time, their initial custody arrangement awarded Jolie physical custody of the children. Pitt would, according to the order, have \u201cagreed upon therapeutic visitation\u201d with the minor children and was ordered to undergo random drug and alcohol testing. Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he\u2019d quit \u201cboozing,\u201d saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just become a problem. And I\u2019m really happy it\u2019s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I\u2019ve got my feelings in my fingertips again.\u201d In 2018, a court order obtained by CNN outlined a shared custody schedule for that summer, with Jolie maintaining primary physical custody and Pitt being granted unrestricted phone access to the children. The order also required Jolie to tell their children that the court determined they\u2019re \u201csafe\u201d with their father and that having a healthy relationship with both parents is \u201ccritical.\u201d Following a privately arbitrated custody trial, Pitt was awarded temporary joint custody of the children in May 2021, two sources with knowledge of the case told CNN at the time. Jolie appealed the custody ruling, alleging the judge who had overseen the custody trial had a conflict of interest with Pitt\u2019s legal team. Jolie won her appeal and a California appeals court disqualified the judge. Jolie retains primary custody, and a distance between Pitt and their children has become more apparent in recent months. Vivienne reportedly cited her name as \u201cVivienne Jolie\u201d in the playbill for \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d the Tony-winning musical she helped produce with Jolie. And Shiloh, 18, last month filed a petition to legally drop Pitt from her last name. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard for him,\u201d said the source close to Pitt. \u201cThis is a really hard period.\u201d They become legally single Though their divorce proceedings are ongoing, through what is called a \u201cbifurcated\u00a0judgment,\u201d Pitt and Jolie were declared legally single in 2019. As part of the filing, Jolie officially dropped \u201cPitt\u201d from her last name. New York matrimonial and family law attorney Sophie Jacobi-Parisi, who is not affiliated with either Pitt or Jolie\u2019s legal matters, told CNN a bifurcated divorce is \u201cunique\u201d to California divorces in that it allows former couples to \u201cbreak the bonds of matrimony\u201d while other issues \u2013 be they financial or otherwise \u2013 remain outstanding. But it can sometimes have a detrimental effect on proceedings, she added, because it may remove \u201cincentive to keep people rational,\u201d further prolonging the time it takes to finalize a divorce. The slow pace of the divorce proceedings, even after the bifurcated judgement, is \u201cunusual,\u201d according to Jacobi-Parisi. \u201cIt\u2019s all of these unique little situational aspects of this that have completely exacerbated a super high-conflict divorce from the very beginning \u2013 and they both have the money to fight,\u201d she said. The Ch\u00e2teau Miraval winery lawsuit Much of Pitt and Jolie\u2019s legal saga has centered on the battle over their country estate in the south of France, Ch\u00e2teau Miraval. The suits and filings relating to this matter have also been the vehicles through which many details about their split and ongoing issues have been made public. Their fight over the property began in February 2022, when Pitt sued Jolie and her former company, Nouvel LLC, over what he claimed was the \u201cunlawful\u201d sale of her stake in Miraval, acquired by the couple in 2008. Pitt\u2019s lawsuit alleged that he and Jolie had agreed when they purchased the winery that neither would sell without the other\u2019s consent. According to a subsequent 2023 court filing, attorneys for Pitt called Jolie\u2019s sale \u201cvindictive\u201d after an \u201cadverse custody ruling.\u201d A countersuit filed by Nouvel LLC in September 2022 accused Pitt of \u201cwaging a vindictive war against\u201d Jolie and claimed that there was never any such agreement. The countersuit alleges that Jolie attempted to sell her share of the winery to Pitt but the deal fell apart over a provision in a non-disclosure agreement \u201cdesigned to prohibit Jolie from publicly speaking about the events that had led to the breakdown of their marriage.\u201d Jolie sold Nouvel LLC and its stake in the winery to Tenute del Mondo, a subsidiary of Stoli Group, controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler, in October 2021. Jolie notified Pitt in a January 2021 email about her intention to sell her share in the winery, stating that she no longer wanted to be involved with a business \u201cbased on alcohol, when alcoholic behavior harmed our family so deeply.\u201d The email was an exhibit submitted to the court by Jolie\u2019s attorneys in October 2022. More details about the former couple\u2019s home life may soon emerge. In April, Pitt filed a motion requesting Jolie produce years worth of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), according to a legal filing obtained by CNN. The court granted Pitt\u2019s motion in May and set a deadline for Jolie to submit the NDAs by mid-July, according to the order, obtained by CNN. These NDAs have become the center of the Miraval case, which in itself has felt like \u201can extension of their divorce,\u201d according to Jacobi-Parisi, who clarified that the Miraval case and the divorce are technically separate court actions. Jacobi-Parisi added:\u00a0\u201cUnder the Miraval court action, [the NDAs] can then bring up and dredge up all of the information that was probably sealed in their divorce.\u201d In other words, there may be more to come before Jolie and Pitt truly close this chapter and find their bliss, domestic or otherwise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/entertainment/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-key-moments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_06_28_entertainment_rust-film-shooting-armorer-filing", "text": "A judge in New Mexico on Friday denied the latest motion from Alec Baldwin seeking to dismiss his indictment ahead of the scheduled start of his criminal trial next month. Baldwin\u2019s team had asked the court to dismiss the case, claiming because the gun used in the shooting that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI, it was impossible for the defense to attempt to recreate the examination. CNN has reached out to Baldwin\u2019s attorneys for comment on the judge\u2019s ruling. Baldwin\u2019s team filed a separate motion on Monday seeking to dismiss the indictment claiming prosecutors failed to properly turn over evidence required by court procedure \u2013 accusations the state\u2019s lawyers rebutted in a filing of their own late Thursday. The judge has not indicated whether she will entertain the new motion before the start of trial. Last week, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied an earlier motion from the actor\u2019s team seeking to throw out the case. Baldwin\u2019s lawyers had argued the shooting death of Hutchins on the set of \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 was an accident and Baldwin was not criminally liable. Reed requests release from prison Meanwhile, attorneys for Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer of the film \u201cRust\u201d who was sentenced in connection with the 2021 fatal on-set shooting, said in a Thursday court filing that prosecutors withheld evidence that would have favored the defendant during her manslaughter trial and requested she be released from prison, Reuters reported. Gutierrez Reed became the\u00a0first person to stand trial\u00a0and was convicted in the case, which has captured national attention for more than two years. She was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year for the on-set shooting and sentenced by a New Mexico judge to 18 months in prison, the maximum possible punishment. As the armorer, Gutierrez Reed was responsible for firearm safety and storage on set. According to the fling obtained by Reuters, prosecutors had a report from their own weapons experts that the gun used on \u201cRust\u201d set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear.\u201d That is evidence that the gun could have accidentally fired and could have led to her not being found guilty in the case, Gutierrez\u2019s attorney Jason Bowles said, according to Reuters. At trial, prosecutors argued she repeatedly violated safety protocol and acted without caution in performing her duties, leading to Hutchins\u2019 death. Her defense attorney argued she has been scapegoated for the safety failures of film set management and other crew members. Gutierrez Reed did not testify. Prosecutors had asked she be sentenced to the maximum prison time, citing a \u201ccomplete and total failure to accept responsibility for her actions.\u201d In contrast, the defense had asked she be released on probation, arguing she has no prior criminal history and has a \u201crecord of prior good works and positive things.\u201d CNN has reached out to Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys for comment on the Reuters report. Baldwin attempts to dismiss case Prosecutors and Baldwin\u2019s attorneys sparred Monday in a hearing, with the actor\u2019s team claiming the prosecution acted in bad faith when it ordered a testing procedure that could destroy the firearm. The special prosecutors insisted the burden should have been on the defense team to convey the firearm\u2019s significance to their case before the testing. The judge admonished both sides to continue preparing for the start of legal proceedings next month, telling attorneys: \u201cDo not think that that means stop working for trial.\u201d Last week, the actor lost a separate bid to have the case dropped. His legal team argued the shooting was an accident and Baldwin is \u201cnot criminally liable.\u201d Prosecutor Kari Morrissey countered Baldwin is experienced in the movie business. \u201cMr. Baldwin knew he had a real gun in his hand. Mr. Baldwin specifically asked for the biggest gun that was available. Mr. Baldwin knew and understood that dummy rounds look identical to live ammunition,\u201d Morrissey said. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied that Baldwin motion. His trial is expected to begin in July.

{"id": "2024_06_26_entertainment_marilyn-monroe-home-saved-from-demolition", "text": "The Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted on Wednesday to preserve Marilyn Monroe\u2019s Brentwood home, where the star lived and died, as a Historic-Cultural Monument, saving it from demolition. The vote ends a nearly year-long saga and effort to save the home from destruction. Last summer, the city\u2019s Department of Building and Safety issued a demolition permit for the home. The city council then unanimously approved\u00a0Councilwoman Traci\u00a0Park\u2019s emergency motion to block demolition and begin the process of designating the house as a historic building, CNN previously reported. Park represents the district where the house is located. This week\u2019s preservation vote was the final step in the process for designation, the city\u2019s planning department\u00a0told\u00a0CNN. The home\u2019s owners sued the city over the matter in May, claiming \u201cabuse of power.\u201d A motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the city council\u2019s vote to preserve the home was denied by a judge earlier this month, but the case remains ongoing and should be set for trial later this fall, according to Peter C. Sheridan of Glaser Weil Fink Howard Jordan & Shapiro LLP, an attorney representing the owners. During a speech in front of the council before the vote Wednesday, Park urged her colleagues to preserve the LA landmark. She referred to the home, like Monroe, as \u201ciconic.\u201d \u201cThere is likely no woman in history or culture who captures the imagination of the public the way Marilyn Monroe did. Even all these years later, her story still resonates and inspires many of us today,\u201d she said. \u201cTo lose this piece of history, the only home Marilyn Monroe ever owned, would be a devastating blow for historic preservation, and for a city where less than 3% of historic designations are associated with women\u2019s heritage.\u201d Park said that she did not take the matter lightly and that she has been in communication with nearby residents about their concerns over traffic and safety. She introduced another motion Wednesday to evaluate tour bus restrictions on the street and surrounding areas, she said. \u201cMy team and I have worked closely with the property owners to assess potentially moving the home to a place where the public might actually be able to visit and spend time,\u201d she said. \u201cI remain hopeful and committed to work with the property owners to see if this can be done in the future, but today, let\u2019s preserve this essential piece of LA\u2019s history and culture.\u201d Sheridan said in a statement that neither Park \u201cnor her staff have worked closely with the owners, throughout this process or anytime else, to relocate the house to allow for public access.\u201d \u201cIn fact, the opposite is true,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cMs. Park has ignored the fact that her constituents \u2013 civic and homeowner\u2019s groups in the community \u2013 are adamantly against the designation of the home. Ms. Park has also ignored that the City granted dozens of permits to over 14 different prior owners to change the home through numerous remodels, resulting in there being nothing left reflecting Ms. Monroe\u2019s brief time there 60 years ago.\u201d With the ongoing lawsuit, the homeowners are hoping that the court declares the entire process to save the home from demolition illegal, and directs the city to withdraw its designation, Sheridan said. The Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving historic places in the city, called Wednesday\u2019s vote a \u201csuccess.\u201d \u201cThis designation is proof that community advocacy WORKS,\u201d the organization said in an\u00a0Instagram post, thanking Park for her efforts. The Brentwood bungalow was built in 1929 and is valued at about $8 million, according to property records. Monroe lived there for just months before she died in 1962 at the age of 36, Park said. The pop culture icon died at the home after overdosing on barbiturates.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/entertainment/marilyn-monroe-home-saved-from-demolition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_entertainment_kinds-of-kindness-yorgos-lanthimos-cast-interviews", "text": "Jesse Plemons is thrilled to learn he can make someone faint. In an interview promoting his latest movie \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d I share an incident that took place at a screening I attended, in which I\u2019m all but certain he sent an audience member over the edge. \u201cAt what part? Do you remember?\u201d the actor says eagerly, eyes lighting up. It wasn\u2019t even something his character did, I reply, just something he said \u2013 a grisly bit of foreshadowing. \u201cWow,\u201d says Plemons, beaming. \u201cOh, I like that.\u201d The film\u2019s writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos, a connoisseur of Biblical violence and creator of cursed demimondes, likes to push viewers to the limit. But for Plemons to do so with a line reading is an achievement. No wonder he was awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival in May for his performance. Plemons joins Lanthimos regulars Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe, supported by Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Margaret Qualley and Mamoudou Athie, in the Greek filmmaker\u2019s prickliest and most transgressive work since \u201cDogtooth,\u201d his Oscar-nominated breakthrough from 2009. Group sex, cannibalism and suicidal animals all feature. As one critic succinctly put it, \u201cSicko Yorgos is back.\u201d After writing two films with Tony McNamara (yielding the career-boosting \u201cThe Favourite\u201d and \u201cPoor Things\u201d) Lanthimos has reunited with his old writing partner Efthimis Filippou to create a diabolical comedy triptych. Set in contemporary America, the three short stories feature the ensemble cast playing different roles in each story. In one, a man (Plemons) whose life is dictated by his boss (Dafoe) suffers the consequences when he disobeys an order. In another, a man (Plemons) is overjoyed by the return of his missing wife (Stone), only to start believing she\u2019s an imposter. And in the last, two disciples of a sex cult (Plemons and Stone) search for a prophesized messiah at the instruction of their mercurial leader (Dafoe). Although each actor is re-cast, a mysterious character known only as \u201cR.M.F\u201d features fleetingly in each story, suggesting all three take place in the same universe. The interconnect-ness doesn\u2019t stop there, but nor does the film lock together in a neat way. Instead, themes and arcs are mirrored and connect, moments firing off against each other like synapses. If this is as close as we\u2019ve yet come to seeing inside Lanthimos\u2019 brain, he staunchly refuses to spoon feed it to his audience. Paired with a coy marketing campaign, this has led some to question what the film is all about. Alwyn concedes that it took a couple of watches to start unpacking it. At first blush, \u201cit was just a visceral experience, which I think is the case with a lot of his films.\u201d \u201cHe really isn\u2019t pretentious,\u201d says Dafoe of his director. \u201cIt really is that classic thing of he\u2019s an artist that is putting stuff out there that\u2019s really rich. I think people will bring their experience to it and come to different interpretations.\u201d Athie, whose most prominent role is as Plemon\u2019s cop partner and very, very close friend in the second story, has the neatest interpretation of the film: \u201cThis is a real exploration of control, and how willing people are to give it away,\u201d he says. Fittingly, Plemons describes preparing for a project so open to interpretation in much the same way. \u201c(Yorgos) has a lot of ideas, but isn\u2019t married to any one of them,\u201d he explained. As an actor, \u201cit is this sense of surrender and abandon, and stepping off a ledge and hoping for the best.\u201d In \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d Lanthimos injects Old Testament logic into everyday life in twisted parables about the social contracts we write one another. He suggests we\u2019re all in dom-sub relationships with each other, the only debate being what the boundaries of each relationship may be. Plemons\u2019 character is calling the shots in the second story, but in the first and third that falls to Dafoe. If God had a face, he might look like Willem Dafoe, according to Lanthimos, who has the actor let rip with two very different God complexes. As horrible boss Raymond he is imperious; as spiritualist leader Omi he is seductive, budgie smugglers, eyeliner and all. \u201cHe finally got to play himself,\u201d Plemons jokes. \u201cYeah, yeah. Shhh!\u201d Dafoe replies, laughing. In the cut and thrust of the shoot, who knows who chose what for the amorous cultist, says Dafoe, but Lanthimos \u201cdoes give you room,\u201d turning you in \u201can accomplice.\u201d \u201cMaybe my biggest contribution was really liking those orange Speedos and saying, \u2018I want to wear those!\u2019\u201d All three of the film\u2019s main doms are merciless but pose as loving. Love in its ickiest and stickiest forms is a throughline of Lanthimos\u2019 films (see: Colin Farrell and a steak knife in \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d or Christos Stergioglou\u2019s fabulist father in \u201cDogtooth\u201d). Here, the screenplay puts characters in deplorable situations for their love of work, spouse and faith. Some do deplorable things to hold on to that love; others do deplorable things when that love curdles. This idea reaches a nadir with one of Alwyn\u2019s characters, in a scene shared with Stone. It involves an assault; a moment of standout awfulness in a film that thinks nothing of showing us self-mutilation and horrific traffic accidents. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do scenes that are nasty and explore really dark corners, then, touch wood, you\u2019re going to be in a room of people that you really like,\u201d says Alwyn. \u201cKnowing Emily (Stone\u2019s birth name) as a friend, and Yorgos too, and having worked with them before, that comfort was kind of built in.\u201d \u201cAlthough it\u2019s nasty on camera, the atmosphere (was) light on set \u2013 or trie(d) to be,\u201d he promises. Alwyn, a veteran of \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d is in many ways the typical Lanthimos actor. A repeat performer, his characters have been humiliated, shot for laughs, or acted in the worst way imaginable (\u201cYeah, he does have it in for me maybe,\u201d Alwyn quips). But like so many actors in the director\u2019s growing troupe, he keeps coming back for more. \u201cHe\u2019s so singular as an artist and a creator,\u201d says the actor. \u201cAnd although you\u2019re going to probably be asked to do some pretty uncomfortable things or be pretty unpleasant at some point in a project of his, he\u2019s actually a nice guy.\u201d Now try telling that to the audience members fainting in the aisles. \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is available in select US cinemas from June 21, and released nationwide and in the UK on June 28.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/entertainment/kinds-of-kindness-yorgos-lanthimos-cast-interviews/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

The beloved romance movie, starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple separated by class, released on June 25 2004. Directed by Nick Cassavetes, the movie is based on the 1996 Nicholas Sparks book of the same name and follows an elderly man, played by James Garner, reading aloud from a notebook to a woman in a nursing home with dementia, played by Gena Rowlands. As he reads, the movie flashes back to 1940s South Carolina, where Gosling\u2019s lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun falls in love with rich girl Allie Hamilton, whose parents try to keep them apart. Cassavetes credited the film\u2019s costars with its staying power. \u201cThey\u2019re both the greatest actors in the world, and some of the things that I asked them to play were so difficult, and there was nothing they couldn\u2019t do,\u201d the director recalled in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly. \u201cIf you want to know why\u00a0The Notebook\u00a0is considered kind of a romantic classic, the answers are Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, and that\u2019s the beginning and the end of it.\u201d Cassavetes told the publication that Rowlands, who is his mother, is now currently living with Alzheimers. \u201cI got my mom to play older Allie, and we spent a lot of time talking about Alzheimer\u2019s and wanting to be authentic with it, and now, for the last five years, she\u2019s had Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Cassavetes said. \u201cWe lived it, she acted it, and now it\u2019s on us.\u201d Sparks drew inspiration from a real couple to pen the touching love story. \u201cIt is a story of young love, it\u2019s a story of reunited love, it\u2019s a story of everlasting love,\u201d the author told CBS Sunday Morning. \u201cIt\u2019s also a story of memory.\u201d Here are five unforgettable exchanges from \u201cThe Notebook\u201d movie: \u2022 \u201cSo it\u2019s not gonna be easy.

{"id": "2024_06_27_entertainment_a-quiet-place-day-one-review", "text": "Like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d pries opens the door to a world with a host of possibilities, some of them \u2013 including the premise of a new prequel subtitled \u201cDay One\u201d \u2013 already touched upon in the two previous movies. Set in New York, the latest film begins from a slightly unexpected premise, but then efficiently spins it to yield additional horror while giving theater-goers every reason to keep their mouths shut. The 2021 sequel actually opened with a muscular flashback sequence to that moment when the grotesque, sound-sensitive alien invaders descended upon Earth, so the new film\u2019s tag line, \u201cExperience the day the world went quiet,\u201d reflects a bit of a conceptual echo. Introducing new characters, the main wrinkle in the new prequel \u2013 and it\u2019s a questionable one at first \u2013 involves telling the story from the perspective of Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a dying woman enduring hospice care with her cat, who serves as the de facto guide to all hell breaking loose. At a time when people are dying right and left, \u201cDay One\u201d thus uses a woman already close to death as the audience\u2019s surrogate. She interacts with various people along the way, but it\u2019s a fair stretch until she encounters the most significant one, Eric (Joseph Quinn, on a genre tear with \u201cStranger Things\u201d behind him and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d to come), who doesn\u2019t want to leave her side however much she tries \u2013 quietly \u2013 to chase him away. While the Emily Blunt- and John Krasinski-anchored family\u2019s sign-language fluency gave the original movie its gateway into an original-feeling twist on minimalist horror, this third film relies heavily on Nyong\u2019o\u2019s facial reactions, and it\u2019s hard to think of an actor who can say more with an expression. Written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\u201cPig\u201d), who shares story credit with original director/producer Krasinski (whose summer dance card also includes \u201cIF\u201d), the film does let viewers see more of the horrifying creatures, although their lightning-quick attacks often keeps those images brief. There\u2019s also the matter of how the invaders manage to seemingly be everywhere at once, to the point where the slightest sound on screen provokes a sense of dread. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d takes advantage of those attributes, and even finds a way to use Sam\u2019s condition, somewhat awkwardly, to consider our humanity. If there\u2019s one clunky flourish, it\u2019s been clear going back to \u201cAlien\u201d that cats and sci-fi horror don\u2019t mix, and while her feline companion provides a periodic source of unpredictable tension, it\u2019s one of those devices that probably should have been left in the litter box. Unfortunately, everything that enjoys a modicum of success these days triggers talk of its own \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is no exception. Practically speaking, \u201cDay One\u201d takes a step toward demonstrating that this perilous post-invasion world offers no shortage of streets and hallways to tiptoe down, where nobody needs to ask \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d when they are greeted with silence. \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d premieres June 28 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_06_21_entertainment_summer-anthem-2024-song-tiktok-cec", "text": "You know a song of the summer when you hear it. It\u2019s the song that drags you off the sidelines and onto the dancefloor. A song that sounds best when it\u2019s being sung by the people you love, cups in hand, in sticky heat. It worms its way into your brain and stays there, and, even years later, takes you right back to the summer you first heard it. Songs of the summer, at their best, are sonic representations of the hottest months of the year, says Mike Errico, a songwriter and instructor at New York University\u2019s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. \u201cThey\u2019re upbeat, extroverted, bright and fun, with a big, repeatable chorus that even the most musically challenged can join in on,\u201d Errico tells CNN. \u201cBeing danceable is a big plus, because it can work on the beach in the day, or in the clubs at night.\u201d Interestingly, most of these songs were released weeks or months before the first day of summer. And more than a few of them received a major boost from TikTok, where their catchiest 15 to 30 seconds have found a massive (and influential) audience. It was easier even a decade ago to settle on the song of the summer. \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d was inescapable in 2013; so was \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d the year before. But there are fewer and fewer breakouts like those as monoculture shrinks \u2014\u00a0now, TikTok is perhaps the most influential decider of a song\u2019s success, and with its ever-quickening trend cycle, it\u2019s easy for songs even by major artists to get lost in the shuffle. And yet, some bangers have broken through. The contenders for this year\u2019s song of the summer are soaring up Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, soundtracking videos online and inspiring us to work up a sweat offline. Now that summer has officially started, sample these musical confections and decide for yourself \u2014\u00a0what\u2019s destined to become the song of summer 2024? \u2018Espresso,\u2019 Sabrina Carpenter Carpenter\u2019s cotton candy-light single sounds like a summer fling feels: Fairly brief, nothing deep and just plain fun. That most of the lyrics are sugary nonsense \u2014\u201cI know I Mountain Dew it for ya\u201d and \u201cMy \u2018give-a-f**ks\u2019 are on vacation,\u201d for two \u2014\u00a0only adds to its frothy charm. It all works, though, because Carpenter\u2019s in on the joke, wryly playing the part of a resistant love interest who\u2019s putting up with a man\u2019s attention if only because it boosts her own ego. \u201cIsn\u2019t that sweet? I guess so!\u201d \u2018Lunch,\u2019 Billie Eilish This culinary-themed cut from the young Grammy winner\u2019s latest album is propulsive, buoyant and slyly sexual \u2014\u00a0certainly the closest to summer that Eilish\u2019s sound has ever come. She\u2019s downright giddy with lust on \u201cLunch,\u201d a track that flirts between heavy bass and feathery piano as though it\u2019s riding the peaks and valleys of passion. It\u2019s a song that feels destined to end in a mosh pit, bodies jumping and writhing to Eilish\u2019s version of lovestruck pop. \u2018Nasty,\u2019 Tinashe Finally, after years of grinding out reliably dancey R&B anthems, Tinashe\u2019s viral moment has arrived \u2014\u00a0with a major assist from a British TikTok dancer. Crafty TikTok-ers layered Tinashe\u2019s new single on top of a video of a dancer named Nate thrusting and grinding in a soca dance class. Even without the meme treatment, though, Tinashe\u2019s latest seems made for shaking it in the summer \u2014\u00a0Janet Jackson proved as much when she blended the new \u201cNasty\u201d with her own track of the same name at a recent live show. Over a clean, sophisticated beat, Tinashe matter-of-factly asserts her badness. And its suggestive, quotable refrain is born to endure beyond TikTok: \u201cIs somebody gonna match my freak?\u201d \u2018Good Luck, Babe!\u2019 Chappell Roan Where previous entries on this list were more ambivalent on the subject of love, Roan\u2019s anthem is this summer\u2019s bleeding heart. \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d boasts the musical theatrics of Kate Bush, \u201880s synths straight out of Cyndi Lauper\u2019s catalog and a queer point of view all Roan\u2019s own. In its most thrilling moment, Roan fantasizes the woman she loves waking up in the future next to a man she loathes: \u201cYou know I hate to say, but, I told you so,\u201d she sings, suddenly breaking into a high belt. If summer is about taking it easy, Roan didn\u2019t get the memo: She\u2019s doing vocal gymnastics here. (And at Roan\u2019s increasingly popular live shows, thousands of people are belting along with her.) \u2018Million Dollar Baby,\u2019 Tommy Richman This ubiquitous TikTok banger became a hit seemingly overnight. But it\u2019s a smash from the first listen, with its arresting falsetto chorus, trap-funk undercurrent and vague but relatable lyrics about making it. The song itself is a self-fulfilling prophecy, perhaps, for Richman: Before it went stratospheric on TikTok (there are at least five million videos set to a clip of the song) and streaming platforms, he was virtually unknown. Here, he borrows sounds from more established artists like Sampha and Brockhampton, building a track that evokes sweaty, striving summer nights. \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019 Kendrick Lamar Here\u2019s a song of the summer that breaks all the rules. At 4:33, it\u2019s the longest song in the bunch by a minute. \u201cNot Like Us\u201d doesn\u2019t really have a chorus, and the closest thing to it \u2014 Lamar chanting the title \u2014 only appears two minutes into the song. It\u2019s got three verses that, typical of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Lamar, are stuffed with verbose slant rhymes. And yet, the latest of Lamar\u2019s diss tracks against Drake, himself a longtime song of the summer contributor, has turned into a bonafide hit (albeit a wordy one). With its surgical disassembly of the man behind \u201cOne Dance\u201d and \u201cHotline Bling,\u201d \u201cNot Like Us\u201d forces listeners to pay close attention throughout its runtime. Even without a hook, it\u2019s a song that\u2019s meant to be rapped along to with a crowd \u2014 maybe that\u2019s why Lamar performed it five times at his Juneteenth show in LA. His audience knew every word. \u2018A Bar Song (Tipsy),\u2019 Shaboozey Fresh off a recent feature on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter,\u201d Shaboozey\u2019s summer hit is a countryfied take on J-Kwon\u2019s immortal club hit \u201cTipsy.\u201d But unlike J-Kwon\u2019s celebration of the club circa 2004, Shaboozey is decidedly glummer on his post-workday drinking binge. \u201cEverybody at the bar gettin\u2019 tipsy,\u201d he laments. Still, lyrics about dragging your increasingly drunk self from bar to bar in a desperate attempt to shed the stress of your 9-to-5 are not unrelatable. It might not be as feather-light as \u201cEspresso\u201d or danceable as \u201cNasty,\u201d but \u201cA Bar Song\u201d has an easy-to-sing hook that\u2019s destined to play at closing time at a Nashville honky tonk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/entertainment/summer-anthem-2024-song-tiktok-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

We sure hope so, because this week\u2019s episode of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d is filled with just as much horror. Understandably, King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) is distraught over the death of his heir. In what can only be described as a royal temper tantrum, he shouts, \u201cThis is war! I declare war!\u201d Convinced this is the work of Rhaenyra (Emma D\u2019Arcy), Aegon is out for vengeance and wants to \u201cdracarys\u201d Team Black. But Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) swoops in to pour some water on his grandson\u2019s fiery impulses and tells King Aegon to chill for a minute, reasoning that \u201csome good may come of this.\u201d He concocts a plan to blame it all on Rhaenyra by holding a public funeral procession through the streets of King\u2019s Landing. Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and Helaena (Phia Saban) sit behind Jaehaerys\u2019 coffin in the wagon while a King\u2019s Guardsman shouts, \u201cBehold the works of Rhaenyra Targaryen, pretender to the throne, King slayer!\u201d It\u2019s an effective measure. Word quickly gets back at Dragonstone, where Rhaenyra is learning about the death of Jaehaerys for the first time and that she\u2019s being blamed for it. As a mother still grieving the death of her own child, she is aghast that anyone would think that she was behind it. It isn\u2019t until she glances over at Daemon (Matt Smith) to find that smug little smirk on his face for Rhaenyra to immediately figure out that he had something to do with this. This revelation spawns a nasty spat between the pair. Daemon denies that he told anyone to kill Jaehaerys, and Rhaenyra refuses to believe him. Daemon insists he only commissioned his assassins to kill Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) and that this was all one big misunderstanding, but Rhaenyra accuses Daemon of taking her \u201cI want Aemond Targaryen\u201d statement as an excuse to seek his own revenge against her for her late father choosing her as his heir instead of him. \u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Daemon says. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic,\u201d Rhaenyra retorts. The lovers\u2019 quarrel ends there, with Daemon flying out of Dragonstone on Caraxes. Otto may have been calling the shots at the start of the episode, but he wasn\u2019t by the end of it. He confronts King Aegon about having every single ratcatcher in King\u2019s Landing publicly hanged in town, saying it was a reckless decision and that, unlike his late father, he has no dignity. \u201cF\u2013k dignity. I want revenge,\u201d Aegon says. This ends with King Aegon firing Otto as his Hand and replacing him with Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), who Aegon says has proven to be \u201cof more worth than a hundred old men\u201d because of his plan to send Arryk Cargyll (Luke Tittensor) to Dragonstone, posing as his twin brother Erryk (Elliott Tittensor), to kill Rhaenyra. Elsewhere in Westeros Maybe Otto said it best when he mused that these folks are not peacocks, rather \u201cthey\u2019re all shrieking and feathers.\u201d Sounds about right. \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d airs Sunday nights on Max, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.

{"id": "2024_06_21_entertainment_chinatown-water-wars-fifty-years-later", "text": "In the 1974 film \u201cChinatown,\u201d there\u2019s deceit, deception and murder, as well as a timeless Los Angeles protagonist \u2013 water. Having debuted 50 years ago this week, \u201cChinatown\u201d is set against a race for control of water in arid LA, and some of the devious power players who are after that control, along with the money that goes with it. An Oscar-winner for Robert Towne\u2019s original screenplay (out of 11 total Academy Award nominations), \u201cChinatown\u201d remains an indelible entry in the film noir genre, updating it with a complex and emotional story, while also shedding light on some of the real-life history of the city\u2019s rise. Intrinsic to LA\u2019s story is how water was \u2013 and still is \u2013 accessed by the city, a history riddled with disaster and corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing in the way (\u2018Chinatown\u2019) centralizes water as a character in the growth of Los Angeles,\u201d William Deverell, co-director of\u00a0the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West and professor of history at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant movie that gives us the feel of this water capture from the early 20th century, bringing the Sierra snow melt river 250 miles down to Los Angeles.\u201d The movie follows private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) as he crosses paths with a wronged woman (Faye Dunaway) and gets drawn into the complicated criminal underbelly of 1930s-era Los Angeles. In the process, he unwittingly uncovers a secret plan on the part of some men in power to buy up cheap, dry land on the outskirts of the city and divert much-desired water from even further away to those areas, thereby causing the value of that land to skyrocket. Drops of truth in a Hollywood fable While the broad strokes of that story are true, they deviate from what actually happened in two ways, according to Deverell. \u201cThe movie shrouds the scheme in secrecy and conspiracy \u2013 enough to provoke murder \u2013 but Angelenos basically knew that a set of already rich men would get richer when the water came (and watered their lands in the newly-annexed San Fernando Valley),\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t much care, as they knew that there was water and land enough to float many more boats, so to speak, than the oligarchs in on the ground floor.\u201d Essentially, the pursuit to bring water \u2013 which Deverell referred to as \u201cthe coin of the realm\u201d \u2013 to LA and its outskirts was not a secret. \u201cDeliberate, planned, carefully executed, thoughtfully engineered, sneakily done,\u201d he said, just not clandestine. The other main deviation that \u201cChinatown\u201d takes is the era in which much of this long-distance irrigation was done. The efforts to divert water from the faraway Owens Valley near Mammoth Lakes, CA \u2013 some 230 miles from Los Angeles \u2013 began as early as 1908, with the start of the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Deverell called the project \u201cthe prime infrastructural focus\u201d or inspiration of \u201cChinatown.\u201d The Roman Polanski-directed film, meanwhile, takes place some 25 years later. Uprisings, disasters and mayhem But regardless of these meanderings from the truth, the \u201cWater Wars\u201d (as they came to be known) that inspired the movie reflected real-life mayhem. The aqueduct opened in 1913, and swiftly desiccated the areas where it originated, resulting in an uprising in 1924 on the part of local farmers who used dynamite in an attempt to blow up part of the infrastructure that was routinely drying up their land. \u201cTensions and litigation continue well into contemporary times: the desiccated Owens Lake is getting some water put back in, but the issues continue to be hotly debated and contested,\u201d Deverell explained. \u201cIt\u2019s moved generally from riparian tugs of war into deep environmental terrain, all having to do with essentially picking up a river and moving it hundreds of miles away.\u201d In \u201cChinatown,\u201d the murder of Hollis Mulwray \u2013 Dunaway\u2019s character\u2019s husband (played by actor Darrell Zwerling) \u2013 incites much of the movie\u2019s action. His death follows his refusal to endorse a dam that he believed would prove faulty. In actuality, celebrated SoCal engineer William Mulholland built the St. Francis Dam that failed in 1928, resulting in the \u201clargest single loss of life in California history,\u201d according to Deverell. \u201cHis career was shattered,\u201d he said, adding that even though we have things named for him, like the famed Mulholland Drive, \u201cthere is this darker, obviously tragic past.\u201d The \u2018Water Wars\u2019 of today As the dry, hot periods get drier and hotter due to climate change \u2013 ask any longtime Los Angeleno about the recent wet weather in LA, and they will be quick to tell you drought-like conditions will indeed return as they always do \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise, perhaps, that the pursuit of water in the region has continued to inspire people to act outside of the law to grab some of the \u201cliquid gold.\u201d Take Dennis Falaschi, the former general manager of the Panoche Water District in the Central Valley. In a 2022 federal indictment, Falaschi was accused of conspiring to steal more than $25 million in water over a 20-year period. Late last month, he struck a deal and pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return and to conspiring to steal water valued somewhere between $1.5 million and $3.5 million. He awaits sentencing in September. His attorney had no comment when reached by CNN. The indictment also indicates \u201cthat Mr. Falaschi was just one of several individuals\u201d who were illegally drawing water from the federally-owned canal. \u201cThere was an old, rusted kind of former piece of irrigation equipment that was taking in some water from the Delta Mendota Canal,\u201d said Jessica Garrison, a Northern California correspondent for the Los Angeles Times who reported on the Falaschi case extensively. Garrison explained that after the faulty piece of equipment was discovered, instead of fixing it, \u201cthey put a gate in and they started just taking water out of the canal without a meter, without anybody knowing, often in the dead of night.\u201d Sounds worthy of a Hollywood tale on its own. \u201cIf you start looking for it, people are stealing water all over the place,\u201d Garrison also said. \u201cI mean, it is everybody from farmers to movie stars, anyone who\u2019s trying to grow anything in California, many of those people have been caught up in various water theft schemes.\u201d Even actor Tom Selleck was caught up in one, settling with the Calleguas Municipal Water District in July 2015 after allegedly diverting water to his ranch during an ongoing drought. And that\u2019s not to mention other Hollywood figures who made headlines for allegedly violating local drought restrictions, from Sylvester Stallone and Kevin Hart to the Kardashians. A \u2018takeaway for the ages\u2019 \u201cI think the beauty of \u2018Chinatown\u2019 is that California is to some extent built on stolen water,\u201d Garrison noted, going on to say \u201cthere\u2019s lots of different ways to steal water.\u00a0You can steal it legally, you can steal a little bit, you can steal a lot.\u201d Deverell echoed the sentiment. \u201cWe have \u2018water on the brain\u2019 \u2014 which is one of the lines from the movie, yes, because we have to,\u201d he said of Southern Californians. \u201cThere\u2019s a presumption\u2026 that water is dull, and it\u2019s anything but dull. The legal record around water, the fights, the manipulations, the engineering, the uncertainties. Water is fascinating. It\u2019s because it\u2019s so fundamental.\u201d Although \u201cChinatown\u201d is now half a century old, its themes endure. \u201cFifty years later\u2026 The deeper story about water and intrigues around water, its importance, Its fundamental quality, what people will do to get it, how depraved they will be,\u201d Deverell said. \u201cThat is a takeaway for the ages. That is something we can all think hard about to make sure in our town, our community, our county, our states, our region that the depravity is kept to a minimum.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/entertainment/chinatown-water-wars-fifty-years-later/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
