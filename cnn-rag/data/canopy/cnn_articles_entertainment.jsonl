{"id": "2024_05_19_entertainment_the-simpsons-american-sitcom-cec", "text": "Toward the end of its 35th season, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d made a move that rankled some fans: It killed a longtime resident of Springfield. Larry the Barfly died in Moe\u2019s Tavern, where he\u2019s been a mostly wordless mainstay since the 1989 pilot. Even longtime \u201cSimpsons\u201d fans would be forgiven for never learning Larry\u2019s name \u2013\u2013 Homer and the other Moe\u2019s regulars certainly didn\u2019t know anything else about their drinking buddy, as was made mournfully clear at Larry\u2019s poorly attended funeral. And though Larry made little-to-no impact on Homer and his family over 35 seasons, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d gave him a moving sendoff anyway and even a reason for being. In death, he brings the men of Moe\u2019s together outside of the bar to reaffirm that they do, in fact, like each other \u2014 even when they\u2019re not drunk on Duff. After a winding journey to scatter Larry\u2019s ashes at a waterfall they assume he liked (they barely spoke to the man, after all) and narrowly escaping jewel thieves and a fall off of a cliff, the men return Larry\u2019s urn to the place they\u2019re sure he loved: Moe\u2019s. \u201cHow many people were thinking, \u2018I like Larry the Barfly,\u2019 before the episode aired? I would say under 10,\u201d said Matt Selman, sardonic showrunner of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d in an interview with CNN. \u201cBut I guess it\u2019s a testament to the episode that after we killed him, people discovered that they cared about him.\u201d Episodes like \u201cCremains of the Day,\u201d which aired on April 21, are part of why \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d endures \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s still mining depth from characters we\u2019ve known for decades and finding new stories in the corners of Springfield that viewers think they know well. Viewers have followed the buffoonish Homer, devoted Marge, mischievous Bart, socially conscious Lisa, observant Maggie and their hundreds of eccentric neighbors for more than 30 years. There have been hundreds of couch gags, celebrity guest stars and strangling incidents that have inspired a cultish obsession among protective fans. It birthed a 2007 film that made over half a billion dollars worldwide and rides at two Universal theme parks. Oh, and it popularized the now-booming subgenre of the adult animated comedy. But the trick to keeping \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d relevant and exciting all these years later, Selman said, is to keep the show\u2019s tremendous legacy out of mind as much as possible. \u201cWe have to be honest with ourselves: Most comedic language invented by \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 is from its \u2018glory years,\u2019\u201d Selman said, referring to the first eight to 10 seasons of the show that many fans and critics consider its best. \u201cWe don\u2019t create as many memes and things your dad quotes anymore. I think if we set that as a goal, it would be a very hard goal.\u201d So rather than dwell on all the milestones his series has set \u2013\u2013\u00a0it\u2019s the longest-tenured animated series ever and the longest-running sitcom on TV \u2013\u2013 Selman and his writers approach \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d as if it does not have nearly 35 years of history (and a fervent, opinionated fanbase) behind it: \u201cIf the show was brand new today, how would we write it?\u201d Writers new and familiar keep \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 fresh Part of keeping \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d current requires Selman, who\u2019s written for the show since 1997, to find a balance between the series\u2019 greatest hits and big swings. It\u2019s what the show\u2019s earliest seasons did well: Classic episodes like \u201c\u2018Round Springfield\u201d from the sixth season was a bittersweet departure from the show\u2019s antic tone as Lisa mourned the death of her jazz hero, Bleeding Gums Murphy, and season seven\u2019s \u201c22 Short Films About Springfield\u201d traded the show\u2019s typical narrative structure for vignettes about supporting characters like Principal Skinner and Bumblebee Man. Selman wanted \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d to rediscover its experimental streak. So, over the last few seasons, the show has hired new writers who grew up watching\u00a0it \u2013\u2013\u00a0people like Loni Steele Sosthand, Cesar Mazariegos and Broti Gupta \u2013\u2013\u00a0to share the room with \u201cSimpsons\u201d stalwarts like John Frink and Mike Price, who\u2019ve written for the show since the 2000s. There are around 16 writers per season, typically made up of 22 episodes, though this season has just 18 due to the 2023 writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes. \u201cWhatever it takes to keep the show vital and original, we do,\u201d he said. There are rarely guidelines for what makes a good episode of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d but encouraging writers to bring what they love about the show to the fore and try new things has vastly expanded \u201cThe Simpsons\u2019\u201d universe and the kinds of stories it can tell. Recent seasons of the show have followed up the aforementioned classic episodes with spiritual successors that are still decidedly contemporary \u2013\u2013 \u201cThe Sound of Bleeding Gums\u201d follows Lisa\u2019s tentative new friendship with her idol\u2019s deaf son, while fake hackers derail the metafictional episode \u201cLisa the Boy Scout\u201d with clips from episodes that don\u2019t exist. \u201cHow do you tell a story that hasn\u2019t been told already?\u201d said Sosthand. \u201cThe way you do that is by bringing some of your unique point of view to it but also still respecting the world that exists.\u201d Sosthand, who joined the show in 2020, pulled from her own life for a lauded recent episode about Carl Carlson, one of Homer\u2019s drinking buddies and one of the only major Black characters on \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d A 2013 episode revealed that Carl was adopted by a White couple from Iceland and later moved to Springfield to pursue nuclear physics. But Sosthand, who is mixed race, wanted Carl to find his roots, so she wrote him an episode in which he visits Springfield\u2019s hitherto unexplored Black neighborhood, which inspires him to learn about his ancestors, who were Black cowboys in the West. Last month, Sosthand won a Writers Guild Award for the episode, beating out three other nominees from the \u201cSimpsons\u201d writers room. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to show the inner life of a character who you didn\u2019t think had an inner life,\u201d Selman said, pointing to similarly revealing episodes about Moe, Rev. Lovejoy and Krusty the Klown. \u201cYou unpeel the onion about these goofy people\u2019s inner lives; you find pathos, pain, joy and failures \u2013\u2013 that\u2019s one of the luxuries of our universe.\u201d New episodes embrace the \u2018Treehouse of Horror\u2019 chaos Instead of one writer going off on their own to pen a script, the creative process is more collaborative now than it has been in past seasons. Someone might have a \u201cbare wisp of an idea,\u201d Price said, and Selman will jot it down in a notebook or start a discussion with the writers\u2019 room. They\u2019ll finesse the idea together or hold onto something they think might be a thread to follow in a later episode, but a script is rarely the brainchild of just one writer. \u201cMost of the time, it kind of belongs to everybody,\u201d said Mazariegos, whose first joke made it into an episode that had already been written and animated, when he suggested that Homer send a text with the ubiquitous meme of himself slowly backing into a bush. To keep the process from getting stale, when Selman became primary showrunner around 2021, he urged the writers to pursue \u201cblue-sky\u201d ideas that before might\u2019ve seemed too out-there. The writers wanted to harness the energy that surrounded the making of the famed \u201cTreehouse of Horror\u201d Halloween episodes, which takes the show in zanier directions, thematically and visually, than a typical episode does, Mazariegos said. (This season\u2019s installment killed off Bart in an alternate version of the classic episode \u201cCape Feare\u201d and featured a virus that turned everyone into copies of Homer.) \u201cEvery show should be an event in some way,\u201d Price said of the new mindset in the writers\u2019 room. \u201cWe\u2019re almost 800 episodes in. How do you make 801 stand out?\u201d The real world comes to Springfield in recent seasons Some of the most successful new episodes have put a Simpsonian twist on real-life themes that already feel stranger than fiction. In the 35th season alone, Marge has taken a job at a food delivery ghost kitchen and encourages her coworkers to unionize, Bart turned into an NFT in a \u201cTreehouse of Horror\u201d segment and DJ Crazy Times of \u201cPlanet of the Bass\u201d fame turned up to sing a Europop song about tipping culture. \u201c(Selman is) always encouraging us to think that way \u2013\u2013 what are things the Simpsons could do that is engaging with the world now?\u201d Price said. Price wrote last season\u2019s \u201cHostile Kirk Place,\u201d a riff on book banning and modifications to the way history is taught in some public schools. Milhouse\u2019s dad Kirk turns Springfield into a dictatorship after he attempts to censor Milhouse\u2019s history lesson. It turns out Milhouse\u2019s lack of luck is a family curse: His ancestor was responsible for a shoddy gazebo that fell and crushed a happy crowd \u2014 an embarrassing fact that Kirk would like excised from Springfield Elementary\u2019s history curriculum. But there are timeless episodes that could work in any year of the show\u2019s run. This season, Price gave Groundskeeper Willie a starring role in a sweet story about the misunderstood janitor\u2019s lost Scottish love. \u201cThe show is capable of holding all these things in it, which I think makes it still feel like something that you want to watch every Sunday night,\u201d Price said. This season ends on May 19 with \u201cBart\u2019s Brain,\u201d in which Bart bonds with a brain in a jar, an episode Selman said feels like \u201cclassic Simpsons.\u201d It\u2019s got all the ingredients of early season highlights: The entire Simpsons brood is in the episode, and it balances emotional heft with typical Bart hijinx. When \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d returns in the fall for its 36th season, though, it\u2019ll shift gears once again into the fantastical. Its first several episodes are detours through sci-fi and horror, plus a sequel of sorts to one of the classic episodes named here. (No spoilers!) The writers are even ceding an episode next season to Ned Flanders, who will finally reflect on the deaths of his wives Maude Flanders and Edna Krabappel, because it\u2019s \u201cnever too late to emotionally address a past trauma,\u201d Selman said. And those are just from the first half of the season. Some critics have praised \u201cThe Simpsons\u2019\u201d current era as a creative renaissance for the show. It\u2019s nice that their hard work has been noticed, Selman said, but critical appraisal of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d is always in flux. Better to mostly ignore the hype and keep doing the difficult but exceptionally gratifying work of keeping \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d funny. \u201cWe have been written off many times,\u201d Selman said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s going to be around for a while. I think we can stay relevant.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/entertainment/the-simpsons-american-sitcom-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

He was 92. Coleman died on Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, according to a statement from his daughter Quincy Coleman sent to CNN by the late actor\u2019s manager Jeff Goldberg. \u201cMy father crafted his time here on Earth with a curious mind, a generous heart and a soul on fire with passion, desire and humor that tickled the funny bone of humanity. As he lived, he moved through this final act of his life with elegance, excellence and mastery,\u201d Quincy Coleman\u2019s statement read. \u201cA teacher, a hero and a king, Dabney Coleman is a gift and blessing in life and in death as his spirit will shine through his work, his loved ones and his legacy \u2026 eternally.\u201d An Austin, Texas native, Coleman studied law and served in the US Army before pursuing acting as a career, according to a biography. His Hollywood career spans decades, beginning in the early 1960s up until his final credit in 2019, when he appeared on an episode of \u201cYellowstone.\u201d A gifted comedic actor who moved between movies and television, Coleman was often cast as a bad guy or at best, a lovable jerk. That included roles in the Academy Award-winning film \u201cOn Golden Pond,\u201d the sci-fi drama feature \u201cWarGames\u201d and perhaps most famously as the firmly pre-#MeToo, highly lecherous boss in the movie \u201c9 to 5,\u201d in which he starred opposite Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. Coleman worked extensively in television through the 1960s and \u201870s, often in guest roles before landing the soap-opera spoof \u201cMary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\u201d He appeared in a recurring part on the sitcom \u201cThat Girl\u201d in the mid-1960s, but another decade passed before he landed the role of Merle Jeter on \u201cHartman\u201d in 1976, which Coleman, in a 2012 interview, would call \u201cthe turning point in my career.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where it all started, as far as people\u2019s belief that I could do comedy, particularly that negative, caustic, cynical kind of guy,\u201d he told the AV Club, in a nod to some his note notable roles like in \u201c9 to 5.\u201d Coleman really broke out, though, in the 1980s, including supporting roles in the Oscar-winning comedy \u201cTootsie\u201d opposite Dustin Hoffman, \u201cThe Muppets Take Manhattan,\u201d and starring in a pair of critically acclaimed if relatively short-lived TV series, \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d and \u201cThe Slap Maxwell Story.\u201d Coleman received Emmy nominations for both of those series, but won his only Emmy \u2013 out of six total nominations \u2013 for \u201cSworn to Silence\u201d a 1987 dramatic TV movie. Coleman also won a Golden Globe in 1988 for his performance in \u201cSlap Maxwell.\u201d Other roles included playing Mr. Drysdale in the movie version of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d and the ruthless Commodore in the HBO drama \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d along with his more recent turn in the hit drama \u201cYellowstone.\u201d On Friday, Goldberg added that \u201cit has been a great privilege to have represented Dabney and to have been able to call him my friend.

Clifton Williams, 50, is facing charges of assault in the second degree and assault in the third degree in the two incidents last week, the New York Police Department told CNN in a statement. The NYPD told CNN Williams allegedly punched Buscemi in the face as the actor was walking in midtown Manhattan last week.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish", "text": "Billie Eilish has always done things her own way. Whether it be releasing her 2016 viral hit \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d onto Soundcloud, a DIY music streaming site, or writing and recording her record-breaking debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u201d with her collaborator and brother Finneas O\u2019Connell in her childhood bedroom, Eilish, 22, has never been shy about straying from industry norms \u2013 and it seems to be working well for the two-time Oscar-winner. With her third studio album \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d which drops on Friday, she\u2019s remained consistent. The sound of the album is sure to be a surprise to all, because Eilish intentionally chose to not release a single prior to launching the album \u2013 again, a rather unorthodox move. \u201cI wanna give it to you all at once,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram page last month when announcing the album. Her 2019 debut album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,\u201d along with 2021\u2019s \u201cHappier Than Ever\u201d and the new record, were all co-written and produced by O\u2019Connell. It follows Eilish and O\u2019Connell\u2019s Oscar win in March for their original song for the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie,\u00a0\u201cWhat Was I Made For,\u201d which was one of 2023\u2019s biggest hits. The duo previously won the Oscar for original song in 2022 for \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d However \u201cHard and Soft\u201d sounds, which we shall soon find out, Eilish hinted in an interview with Rolling Stone last month that she found herself harkening back to her roots with this record, bringing to mind a time in Eilish\u2019s musical journey where she first set her own precedent for being in control. \u201cI feel like this album is me,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a character. It feels like the \u2018When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u2019 version of me. It feels like my youth and who I was as a kid.\u201d Her penchant for bucking the norm is continuing into her plans for her upcoming \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d tour, which kicks off in Baltimore this fall. Eilish is choosing to skirt scalpers by restricting ticket transfers for those purchasing tickets to her shows. \u201cThe tour wants to give fans, not scalpers, the best chance to buy tickets at face value. To make this possible, they have chosen to use Ticketmaster\u2019s Face Value Exchange,\u201d Ticketmaster\u2019s Eilish ticket page reads. It further notes that if fans can\u2019t attend shows in the US or Canada that they\u2019ve purchased tickets for, they have the option to resell them at face value. The move comes nearly two years after the fervor surrounding the purchase of tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour crashed the Ticketmaster site, resulting in fans not having access to tickets, scalpers trying to resell the tickets at ungodly prices and a subsequent congressional hearing. Eilish was clearly paying attention and appears to be one of the only major mainstream artists to adapt, in hopes of preventing scalpers being able to hawk tickets at exorbitant resale fees. And with \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d Eilish is also trying to stand out and apart in the industry with her effort to protect something else she\u2019s historically passionate about: the environment. The \u201cBad Guy\u201d singer made waves when she lamented in a March interview with Billboard about the \u201cwasteful\u201d practice of releasing a multitude of album variants which, in turn, \u201cgets them more money.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so wasteful, and it\u2019s irritating to me that we\u2019re still at a point where you care that much about your numbers and you care that much about making money \u2013 and it\u2019s all your favorite artists doing that s\u2014,\u201d she said at the time. To back up her complaint, Eilish posted a manifesto on her website describing her sustainability plan for the release of \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft\u201d after announcing the album. She wrote that she will only release eight vinyl variants \u201ceach on the same day, containing the same track-listing across the board\u201d \u2013 to remove the incentive for die-hard fans who would purchase all the variants for any differing bonus tracks \u2013 \u201cand all produced with the most sustainable practices available.\u201d Environmental sustainability has remained at the forefront for Eilish to the current moment, as on her Instagram stories on Wednesday, she included sustainable transport plans to her New York album listening event. Perhaps emboldened by the two Oscars or nine Grammys that she\u2019s won, or the fact that her first two albums have hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the young entertainer has a proven track record of success doing things her way. And why should she change now, if it\u2019s working?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/hit-me-hard-and-soft-billie-eilish/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_young-sheldon-series-finale-review", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The following contains spoilers about the \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d series finale. Seventeen years after \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d made its debut, spinoff \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d has remained one of the bigger hits that network TV can still produce in this diluted day and age. Yet the CBS comedy has seldom figured in the awards conversation, something that its emotionally wrenching yet satisfying series finale should remedy, but probably won\u2019t. A master class on weaving comedy with grief and regrets, the two-part conclusion to the series, after seven seasons, dealt with the aftermath of central character Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) losing his father (Lance Barber) as he prepares to head off to Cal Tech. That includes reliving his final exchange with his dad over and over, thinking about all the things he could have said \u2013 and wished that he had \u2013 but didn\u2019t. The finale also revealed that the voiceover throughout the series by the older Sheldon (Jim Parsons, reprising his \u201cBig Bang\u201d role along with Mayim Bialik) actually came as he was writing his memoir, a middle-aged Nobel prize winner but still as persnickety as ever. Perhaps most interestingly, the arc of the later seasons of \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d also exposed him as a not-entirely-trustworthy source in regard to his father when speaking about him, usually not very charitably, during \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d with George emerging as a much more sympathetic character as the show progressed. Series co-creator Chuck Lorre addressed the challenge in his end-of-show vanity card on the penultimate episode, saying when writing Sheldon\u2019s backstory in \u201cBig Bang\u201d that he didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d be grappling with this challenge years later. (Both shows were produced by Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.) In an interview with CNN, \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d executive producer Steve Holland said the producers decided that the older Sheldon might have been focusing on his father\u2019s failings as a way of dealing with his grief. Holland also noted that the young actors in the series, including Armitage and Raegan Revord as his sister Missy, had grown up since the show began and were able to handle the heavy dramatic scenes they shot as the family remembered and eulogized George, prompting his wife Mary (Zoe Perry) to break down and embrace religion even more fiercely as an emotional balm. The finale managed to give practically everyone an opportunity to shine, from Georgie (Montana Jordan) saying \u201cI won\u2019t let you down, dad\u201d to the assortment of \u201csupporting legends\u201d \u2013 as Holland called them \u2013 who fleshed out the cast, including Annie Potts, Craig T. Nelson, Wallace Shawn, Ed Begley Jr., and Wendie Malick. \u201cIt was important for us in these last few episodes to give people their moments,\u201d Holland said. For all the tears (and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to get through this hour without shedding a few), the episode ended on a sweetly hopeful and uplifting note, using the Dire Straits song \u201cWalk of Life,\u201d which, Holland noted, was the very first heard on the series. Arriving at Caltech, Sheldon is asked by a passing stranger if he\u2019s lost, to which he says, \u201cI\u2019m exactly where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d Ending shows is always hard, and especially so with a prequel series constrained by 12 seasons of the show that preceded it \u2013 the TV version of adding a higher degree of difficulty to an Olympic dive. Given that, \u201cYoung Sheldon\u2019s\u201d finale found the right equation, splashing down almost exactly where it needed to be.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/young-sheldon-series-finale-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_entertainment_the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling", "text": "Superhero movies have seen better days at the box office, but an action-comedy based on a 1980s TV show still feels like an unlikely candidate to kick off the summer. Buoyed by the lure of what Ryan Gosling can do for a post-\u201cBarbie\u201d encore (or Ken-core), \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d is too flat in the early going to fully meet that challenge, rallying toward the end without reaching the heights required to make a really big splash. At its best, director David Leitch (\u201cDeadpool 2\u201d) has served up a movie defined by its love for the movies, and specifically, the stunt work where he cut his professional teeth before shifting into the big chair. In that sense, the TV series that starred Lee Majors (a show most memorable for its theme song, which is featured) creates a very loose template to set up a vehicle about a stuntman whose troubles spill off the screen into real life, forcing him to put his skills to use dealing with real bad guys. Getting there requires some buildup, with Gosling\u2019s Colt Seavers introduced serving as the stunt double for a typically self-absorbed star, Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), while becoming involved with Jody (Emily Blunt), a fellow member of the crew. An accident derails Colt\u2019s plans and indeed life, and time passes before he\u2019s called out of retirement by Gail (\u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Hannah Waddingham), the fast-talking, troubleshooting producer on all of Ryder\u2019s films. Of course, he\u2019d probably stay safely at home if the space epic in question didn\u2019t mark Jody\u2019s directing debut, offering the prospect of a reunion that, naturally, doesn\u2019t go as smoothly as he hoped. There are also hidden reasons for the renewed interest in Colt, which has to do with offscreen shenanigans and Ryder becoming involved with some nefarious characters. That forces Colt into what amounts to private-eye mode, using his movie-trained skills to get himself both into and out of perilous situations. Setting all that up, including the romance, results in some arid stretches between the elaborate stunts, which are ultimately the main source of \u201cThe Fall Guy\u2019s\u201d appeal and certainly its comedy. Gosling imbues Colt with a goofy charm and amusing neediness, but the underlying premise was a trifle strained even back in the Reagan era, and putting the whole thing on steroids for the movies doesn\u2019t completely address those issues. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d thus stands out primarily for smaller moments and wrinkles, such as Colt\u2019s boss (Winston Duke) constantly quoting movie lines to him, Taylor-Johnson sounding a whole lot like Matthew McConaughey, and a stunt dog trained to respond to French, including an especially juvenile command. Perhaps foremost, \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d feels burdened by the weight of expectations and its positioning as a major blockbuster when the movie really operates as a light-hearted ode to the unknown stuntman, in a way that\u2019s basically just amiably OK. Gosling has broad shoulders, but trying to make it anything more than that is, even for him, a heavy lift. \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d premieres May 3 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/entertainment/the-fall-guy-review-ryan-gosling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_entertainment_diddys-bet-award-speech-cassie", "text": "When Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was presented with a lifetime achievement recognition at the BET Awards in 2022, his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, was among the people he thanked. \u201cI\u2019mma keep it a hundred with y\u2019all, I was in a dark place for a few years,\u201d Combs said at the time. \u201cAnd also Cassie for holding me down in the dark times. Love.\u201d The moment has been revisited through a different lens since Ventura first came forward in November with allegations of rape and abuse against Combs in a since-settled lawsuit and CNN\u2019s publication on Friday of video showing Combs physically assaulting her in 2016. Combs and Ventura dated off and on from 2007 to 2018. In her complaint that was settled with in a day of its filing, Ventura alleged Combs raped her in 2018 and subjected her to years of repeated physical and other abuses over the course of their relationship. \u201cA decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing,\u201d Ben Brafman, an attorney for Combs, told CNN in a statement in November. \u201cMr. Combs\u2018 decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.\u201d However, Combs apologized Sunday for his actions in the video. Ventura\u2019s allegations had not yet surfaced publicly in 2022, when Combs accepted the BET Award meant to mark his decades of success in the music industry. That night he came out on stage with much exuberance and to a standing ovation. His then-girlfriend, rapper Yung Miami, held up a red sign while in the audience which read \u201cGo Papi\u201d and he had the family support of his mother, Janice Combs, and two\u00a0of his sons, Christian Combs\u00a0and Justin Combs, who were\u00a0also present. Diddy\u00a0responded to the warm welcome\u00a0on stage\u00a0by yelling, \u201cWhat up though?!\u201d He began by thanking God. \u201cAnything I do is through God,\u201d Combs said. \u201cAnything I do is through love. That\u2019s what I evolve to be. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now.\u201d Combs legally changed his middle name to \u201cLove\u201d in 2020. During his speech, he also thanked his mother, his former mentor, the late Andre Harrell, and the late rapper, the Notorious B.I.G. But it was his \u201cshout out\u201d to Ventura \u2013 coming about 17 months before she filed her lawsuit \u2013 that has sparked new conversation and comments on social media now describing his reference to her that night as \u201cdiabolical\u201d and \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Combs released a video apology on Sunday in which he called his behavior toward Ventura in the 2016 surveillance footage \u201cinexcusable.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\u201d Combs said in his video statement posted to Instagram. \u201cI was f**ked up \u2014 I hit rock bottom \u2014 but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\u201d He continued: \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I am disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d This time, Combs did not mention Ventura by name. Their November 2023\u00a0settlement states that neither of them can speak about each other in any way,\u00a0according to\u00a0multiple sources familiar with the agreement. \u201cHe\u2019s not allowed to say Cassie\u2019s name,\u201d a source familiar with the terms of the settlement\u00a0told\u00a0CNN on Monday. Meredith Firetog, an attorney for Ventura, said in a statement that the apology was \u201cmore about himself than the many people he has hurt.\u201d CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/entertainment/diddys-bet-award-speech-cassie/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_if-review-ryan-reynolds-john-krasinski", "text": "Occasionally a movie gets misleadingly marketed for understandable reasons, and so it is with \u201cIF,\u201d a sweetly sentimental film from writer-director John Krasinski that the ads make look like a madcap romp. The best parts should strike a mildly receptive chord with parents while potentially boring younger kids, a prescription that could subject the movie\u2019s imaginary friends to a harsh reality once audiences in summer-movie mode get a good look at it. After his breakout success with \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (whose delayed prequel will arrive in June), Krasinski shifts toward a PG-rated movie built around animated characters, infused with a family-friendly vibe. Yet it\u2019s no accident that the classic James Stewart movie \u201cHarvey\u201d at one point plays on the TV, since \u201cIF\u201d seeks the same whimsical tone, while owing perhaps its strongest debt to the 1995 film adaptation of \u201cA Little Princess\u201d \u2013 which also focuses on a young girl dealing with grief, loss and uncertainty \u2013 brightened by detours into the fantastic. Bea (Cailey Fleming, delivering a splendid anchoring performance after growing up among \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) has already lost her mom, and now her dad (Krasinski) is hospitalized as he awaits heart surgery. Forced to stay with her grandma (Fiona Shaw), Bea discovers a neighbor (Ryan Reynolds in kinder, gentler mode) who works to find new homes for imaginary friends (or IFs) whose kids have grown up and forgotten them. The imaginary friends, not surprisingly, turn out to be an eclectic and colorful lot, featuring a wide assortment of celebrity voices, among them Krasinski\u2019s wife, Emily Blunt, and the late Louis Gossett Jr. The most prominent imaginary pair each have notable connections to other cast members: Krasinski\u2019s \u201cThe Office\u201d co-star Steve Carell, whose needy Blue bears a too-strong resemblance to McDonald\u2019s Grimace; and Blossom, voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who produced \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d which co-starred Shaw. As Bea states at the outset, she no longer considers herself a kid given what she\u2019s endured, which makes the dual mission pretty overt \u2013 not just finding kids to go with these eccentric monsters, but helping the girl rediscover the wonders of childhood. In that latter regard, Krasinski conjures some touching, lovely moments, although they coexist awkwardly with the imperative to wring laughs and sight gags out of the computer-generated characters, which, however impressively they\u2019re rendered, has the effect of flattening the movie. In one respect, it\u2019s admirable that Krasinski would try to parlay whatever clout he\u2019s amassed into something more heartfelt, but that approach might have fared better by sparing the demands and expectations that go with lining up all those big names, lavish premieres, colorful character posters and marketing tie-ins. Simply put, it\u2019s a tough needle to thread. \u201cSometimes, life doesn\u2019t always have to be fun,\u201d Bea somberly tells her dad early on, as he tries to lift her spirits and allay her fears. \u201cIF\u201d does make the case for finding the fun in life, but in a movie that needs to be more fun than it is. \u201cIF\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_bridgerton-season-3-review-penelope-colin", "text": "Once you\u2019ve mastered basic \u201cBridgerton,\u201d it\u2019s possible to sit back and let each new season predictably wash over you, its level of satisfaction dictated simply by how much one connects with the latest characters to be paired off. Fortunately, the third round (after a \u201cQueen Charlotte\u201d detour) has the highly sympathetic Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) at its core, adding some additional sweetness to the formula. For the uninitiated, poor Penelope has spent two seasons secretly moonlighting as the acid-tongued gossip Lady Whistledown (still voiced by Julie Andrews, because, well, Julie Andrews!), using her access to the coming and goings and romances among the elite to greatly irritate many (the queen foremost among them) while titillating them at the same time. Penelope has channeled her creative energies in this direction in part because of her skepticism that she\u2019ll ever find a match for herself, a process made no easier by her infatuation with Colin (Luke Newton), the latest of the seemingly endless parade of dashing Bridgerton progeny to brave the matrimonial dance. (There\u2019s a praying mantis quality to Bridgertons, since while mating doesn\u2019t lead to death, they do tend to lose their heads and then mostly disappear.) As usual, there are complications and hurdles thrown at Colin and Penelope, including the latter finding a new potential suitor after experiencing the disgrace of having Colin\u2019s gallant efforts to help her find a match exposed. The whole interlude prompts him to begin grasping his own complicated feelings, although in keeping with its Jane Austen-flecked roots, the course of true love never runs smoothly. To their credit, the producers juggle a few extra balls (debutante and otherwise) this time around, including subplots involving Colin\u2019s sister Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and even the family matriarch Violet (Ruth Gemmell), which, given the contortions surrounding the central duo, come across as prudent distractions. Frankly, the level of heat generated by \u201cBridgerton\u201d still remains something of a mystery, not because the show isn\u2019t well done \u2013 possessing the customary trappings for which producer Shonda Rhimes is known \u2013 but simply because everything about it feels so familiar to anyone who ever watched \u201cMasterpiece Theater,\u201d other than a bit more latitude when it comes to the ripping and removal of bodices and the clever use of contemporary music. Give some credit to the casting and, more pragmatically, the strength of Netflix as a platform relative to the more rarefied homes for such fare. Underscoring the show\u2019s value, the service will divide the eight-episode season into two drops, emulating its strategy with shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d to lengthen its hold on viewers beyond an instant binge. If the storytelling has already begun to feel a trifle tired, Coughlan\u2019s vulnerability (and the semi-adorable note that she has asked for an edited version to show her parents) provides a welcome infusion. By sustaining and indeed replenishing those soap-opera qualities, the series seems likely to exhaust its roster of marriage-eligible Bridgertons before Netflix will need to find some buzzworthy new bauble to beguile those who have bought into this world. \u201cBridgerton\u201d begins its third season May 16 on Netflix, with the second half to premiere on June 13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/entertainment/bridgerton-season-3-review-penelope-colin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

So is it easier or harder playing roles that might in some ways mimic their real lives? Turns out, it\u2019s both. \u201cI would say easier,\u201d Glazer, of \u201cBroad City\u201d fame, told CNN. \u201cSo much easier.\u201d \u201cEasier to play, easier to understand how tired, how confused, how frustrated, how grateful you are to pump and dump (breastmilk), to have a shot (of alcohol) when you\u2019re off the clock,\u201d Buteau chimed in. \u201cAnd also harder because then you\u2019re away from your kids.\u201d The film \u2013 which is being compared to \u201cBridesmaids\u201d and marketed as \u201ca hilarious and heartfelt comedy about the bonds of friendship and the messy, unpredictable challenges of adulthood and becoming a parent\u201d \u2013 was written by Glazer and actor/producer Josh Rabinowitz, who also worked with her on her famed \u201cBroad City\u201d series. That series, which ran from 2014 to 2019, has a cult following, as does Buteau\u2019s recently renewed Netflix series \u201cSurvival of the Thickest\u201d based on her book of essays of the same title. Suffice it to say with two such funny performers working together, not to mention the other cast members including Hasan Minhaj, Oliver Platt and John Carroll Lynch, it was a rollicking good time on the \u201cBabes\u201d set. \u201cWe were cracking up, like crying,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cMy co-writer Josh Rabinowitz famously during the plumber scene laughed so hard he smacked his head on his chair. He like injured his forehead, we were laughing so hard.\u201d Shooting in 25 days, with Buteau only being available to film for 15, heightened both the tension and the hilarity, they said, and Glazer confirmed that some of the best of those funny moments are being put together as extras for streaming. Director Pamela Adlon, best known for her starring role on acclaimed series \u201cBetter Things,\u201d said it was challenging getting the project done in such a short period of time. Yet the timing couldn\u2019t have been better given that she had just wrapped the final season of her show. Plus, the script really spoke to her, she told CNN. \u201cI read it and it was emotional besides all the comedy. And there was an edginess to it,\u201d Adlon said. \u201cAll those things have to go together for me to really respond to something. I gotta have the dark, I gotta have the funny, I gotta have the heart. It\u2019s gotta hit you in the gut to make you feel, make you cry, but then you gotta have a little light.\u201d Glazer should be proud to know that, as she said she, Rabinowitz and their producer Susie Fox worked really hard to mine their own life experiences as parents to craft a relatable script. \u201cIt was really important for us to have something so funny, but to balance it with heart and emotional heft,\u201d she said. \u201cThose were our guideposts.\u201d \u201cBabes\u201d is in theaters Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/entertainment/ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-babes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_entertainment_the-big-cigar-review-huey-p-newton", "text": "Long before \u201cfake news,\u201d \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d looks back to the time of a fake movie \u2013 specifically, one designed to provide Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton cover to flee America for Cuba. Yet what should be an enticing mashup of the civil-rights movement and Hollywood in the freewheeling \u201870s doesn\u2019t entirely ignite, in a limited series whose underlying true story packs more of wallop than the finished product. The story, certainly, has a stranger-than-fiction aspect, and anyone familiar with this period will likely be fascinated by the bold-face names that basically just pass through. That said, the Apple TV+ show provides a snapshot of a window in time that doesn\u2019t quite come to life. At its core, \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d resembles the recent Paramount+ series \u201cThe Offer,\u201d about the making of \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d in capturing the rebel spirit that swept through Hollywood in the early \u201870s, fueled by the anti-war movement. Here, that mentality is embodied by the colorful Bert Schneider (\u201cThe Many Saints of Newark\u201d star Alessandro Nivola), the counterculture producer of \u201cEasy Rider\u201d and \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d who went on to make headlines with his controversial 1975 Oscar acceptance speech for the latter. Before that, Schneider was connected to Black Panther leader Newton (Andr\u00e9 Holland), who had already done time in prison and faced an additional sentence when the police framed him, he maintained, for the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Deciding to seek exile, he warily becomes involved with Schneider, who hatched the plan of faking a movie (\u201cThe Big Cigar,\u201d explaining the title) to obscure the details of their elaborate scheme. In a sign of those times, personalities like Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen and Richard Pryor cross Schneider\u2019s path, but Newton possesses a different kind of real-world star power that the producer clearly finds intoxicating. As Newton reminds him, they\u2019re playing around with his life, not some game, with Schneider often treating the whole experience like a film shoot with production fires to be put out, much to the chagrin of his producing partner Steve Blauner (P.J. Byrne). Consisting of six episodes that generally run 40 minutes or less, \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d moves reasonably well, while boasting star credentials behind the camera as well, with Don Cheadle among the producers and directing the first two episodes. The story, however, bogs down at times as both the producer and revolutionary deal with their respective bureaucracies, while Newton wrestles with paranoia \u2013 much of it admittedly legitimate \u2013 about the police lurking outside every door and listening at every keyhole. Adapted from a magazine article, \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d bills itself as being mostly true, granting it the license to engage in some flights of fancy when the story would have likely been better served by either giving in to those satirical impulses or rigidly adhering to the facts. From that perspective the show peaks early when Newton, as the narrator, expresses skepticism that Hollywood will tell his story right. Landing somewhere in between, \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d justifies those misgivings, presenting a wonderfully rich historical moment in a less than fully engaging way. In terms of reaching the top tier of limited series, score that as close, but no cigar. \u201cThe Big Cigar\u201d premieres May 17 on Apple TV+.

Nicely played by the leads, this tale of a 40-year-old woman swept off her feet by a 20-something boy-band star amounts to playing the genre\u2019s hits while following all the same old steps. Destined for Amazon, it\u2019s a competent date-night or gals\u2019-night movie for those who don\u2019t want to leave the house \u2013 Chardonnay optional, but recommended \u2013 which makes practical sense, landing as it does in a middle ground that has struggled at the box office. Cheated on and left by her husband, Sol\u00e9ne (Hathaway) is a successful art-gallery owner who gets roped at the last-minute into squiring her teenage daughter and the kid\u2019s friends to Coachella, where her ex has purchased a meet-and-greet experience with the members of August Moon, whose following might lean more toward the tween crowd. A reluctant attendee, Sol\u00e9ne has the ultimate meet-cute moment with band member Hayes (Galitzine, of \u201cMary & George\u201d and \u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d renown), stumbling into his trailer thinking it\u2019s the restroom. After some awkward banter and obvious chemistry \u2013 which with the benefit of hindsight is about as good as the movie gets \u2013 Hayes shows up unexpectedly (by her, that is) at Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s gallery, telling her shyly, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t meet people like you very often.\u201d For a pop star, he\u2019s an endearingly sensitive soul, which doesn\u2019t do much to quell her reticence, due both to their age gap and his fame. Romance and complications ensue, with writer-director Michael Showalter (\u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and \u201cSpoiler Alert,\u201d sharing script credit with Jennifer Westfeldt) adapting Robinne Lee\u2019s novel in part by relying on the customary montages to handle some of the heavy lifting. If only the garnishes were a little less tired, including the prying paparazzi and Reid Scott as Sol\u00e9ne\u2019s no-right-to-be-bent-out-of-shape ex. All that really leaves, then, is the interplay between Hathaway and Galitzine, with the latter (starring in his second Amazon movie in a year\u2019s time about a romance complicated by fame) performing double duty on the songs. The problem is however well they might work in terms of rooting for them as a couple, it\u2019s hard to avoid the very real issue that the world he inhabits and indeed people in general can be pretty lousy. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d will likely be most satisfying for those who choose not to sweat the details, enjoying the scenery and fantasy wrapped up in it. Think of it as one of those movies that really reinforces the adage there are no new ideas, just fresh versions of old ones set to different beats. \u201cThe Idea of You\u201d premieres May 2 on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.

{"id": "2024_05_19_entertainment_diddy-combs-apology-video-cassie", "text": "Almost 48 hours after being shown physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016 in a surveillance video obtained exclusively by CNN, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has apologized. Just before 1pm ET on Friday, CNN published the video in which Combs is seen grabbing, shoving, dragging and kicking Ventura during an altercation that matches allegations in a\u00a0now-settled\u00a0federal lawsuit filed by Ventura in\u00a0November. At publication time, representatives for Combs, an influential figure in the music industry who founded the music label Bad Boy in 1993, had not responded to requests for comment. Combs, a rapper, producer and business mogul, was silent for nearly two days as backlash mounted \u2013 including in the comments section of his old social media posts \u2013 and a media storm swirled. Just after 11am ET on Sunday, Combs released a video on Instagram, in which he apologized for an incident he\u2019d previously denied ever happening in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\u201d Combs said in a video statement posted to Instagram. \u201cI was f**ked up \u2014 I hit rock bottom \u2014 but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\u201d He continued: \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I am disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d Combs did not mention Ventura by name. Ventura\u2019s attorney Meredith Firetog said in a statement on Sunday following the release of Combs\u2019 apology: \u201cCombs\u2019 most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt.\u00a0When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.\u00a0That he was only compelled to \u2018apologize\u2019 once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.\u201d Combs previously issued a blanket denial of the allegations in Ventura\u2019s November lawsuit, in which\u00a0Ventura claimed\u00a0she was raped in 2018 and subjected to years of repeated physical and other abuses by Combs. He has also\u00a0denied\u00a0through his spokesperson the allegations from the five other civil suits that were filed against him following Ventura\u2019s, and his attorney has called the claims \u201clies\u201d and suggested the plaintiffs are motivated by financial gain and public notoriety. His vehement denials were amplified given how prominent an entertainment figure Combs, who has gone by various stage names including Puff Daddy, was once considered to be. Credited with work that is regarded as instrumental in the growth of the hip-hop genre, Combs has won three Grammys in his career and is a notable entrepreneur under the Combs Global banner. Combs added in his statement that he \u201cwent and I sought out professional help.\u201d \u201cI got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m committed to be a better man each and every day. I\u2019m not asking for forgiveness. I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d November lawsuit In November, Ventura accused Combs of rape and abuse in a 35-page complaint. In that document, in which there were multiple allegations that Combs was physically violent toward Ventura and forced her to engage in various sex acts with other men during their time together, there were details about an altercation that occurred \u201caround March 2016\u201d at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles. During this incident, the complaint said, Combs became \u201cextremely intoxicated and punched Ms. Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye.\u201d After Combs fell asleep, Ventura attempted to leave the hotel room, but he woke up and \u201cfollowed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her,\u201d the complaint said.  \u201cHe grabbed at her, and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her, causing glass to crash around them as she ran to the elevator to escape,\u201d the complaint alleged. After Ventura got in the elevator, her complaint states that she took a cab to her apartment. \u201cUpon realizing that her running away would cause Mr. Combs to be even angrier with her, and completely stuck in his vicious cycle of abuse, Ms. Ventura returned to the hotel with the intention of apologizing for running away from her abuser,\u201d the complaint claims. \u201cWhen she returned, hotel security staff urged her to get back into a cab and go to her apartment, suggesting that they had seen the security footage showing Mr. Combs beating Ms. Ventura and throwing glass at her in the hotel hallway.\u201d The complaint alleges Combs paid the InterContinental Century City $50,000 for the hallway security footage. When contacted by CNN, a representative for InterContinental Hotels said on Friday, \u201cThis hotel is no longer under IHG management, and we do not have any access to prior incident records or footage.\u201d Ventura, a singer who was formally signed to Combs\u2019 label, claimed in her suit that he \u201cexerted his power and influence\u201d over her throughout the course of their professional and romantic relationship. According to the complaint, she was 19 when they met and Combs was 37, and their business relationship lasted until 2019. Their off-and-on relationship lasted from 2007 \u2013 2018. Denials Ben Brafman, an attorney for Combs, said in a statement to CNN on the day after Ventura\u2019s suit was filed that Combs \u201cvehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations.\u201d The suit was resolved the following day. At the time, Brafman told CNN in a statement that the \u201cdecision to settle a lawsuit\u201d was \u201cin no way an admission of wrongdoing.\u201d Brafman\u2019s statement added: \u201cMr. Combs\u2018 decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.\u201d Details of the settlement were not disclosed. Since November,\u00a0Combs\u00a0has faced five other civil lawsuits accusing him of a range of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity. He has denied the allegations, and the\u00a0cases\u00a0remain active. Combs continued this denial. On December 6, 2023, he posted a note to Instagram that said: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d \u201cFor the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\u201d As of this article\u2019s publication, the comments on Combs\u2019 December Instagram post were turned off. The surveillance video On Friday, CNN published surveillance video compiled from multiple camera angles dated March 5, 2016 that appeared to show the Combs during the 2016 incident at the InterContinental Hotel in Century City that was mentioned in Ventura\u2019s complaint. CNN verified the location based on publicly available photos of the former hotel\u2019s interior. In the video, Ventura exits a hotel room and walks to a bank of elevators. Combs, holding a towel around his waist, runs down a hall after Ventura. He grabs her by the back of the neck and throws her to the floor. Still holding his towel closed with one hand, he then turns to kick her, the video shows. As Ventura is on the ground, Combs retrieves a purse and suitcase from the floor near the elevators. He turns around and kicks Ventura again as she lies motionless on the floor. About four seconds transpire between the two kicks, according to the video. He then briefly drags Ventura by her sweatshirt toward a room before walking away. Ventura is then seen slowly standing up. She gathers items from the floor and moves to pick up a phone on the hallway wall near the elevators. Combs, still in a towel and socks, returns. A mirror directly across from the security camera shows Combs appearing to shove Ventura. Seconds later, he sits down on a chair, grabs an object off a table and forcefully throws it toward Ventura. Combs is seen walking away, then turns toward Ventura once again when an elevator door opens and someone appears to exit. Ventura, who reached an undisclosed settlement with Combs, declined to comment on the video obtained by CNN. Ventura\u2019s other attorney, Douglas H. Wigdor, said in a statement on Friday: \u201cThe gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light.\u201d Reaction to the video Ventura received an outpouring of support on social media in the days that followed the release of the video, with many highlighting Ventura\u2019s story as a way to support other victims of domestic violence. Combs also faced widespread backlash from many online, including Aubrey O\u2019Day, a former member of the group Danity Kane who, like Ventura, was represented by Combs\u2019 Bad Boy label. On Friday, she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on her X page that \u201cthe picture is getting a lot more clear for you all I can imagine.\u201d Danity Kane was formed by Combs in 2005 via the MTV reality competition show \u201cMaking the Band.\u201d O\u2019Day says she was fired by Combs and has previously been highly critical of him. Following the release of the video, the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office issued a statement saying it was \u201caware of the video that has been circulating online allegedly depicting Sean Combs assaulting a young woman in Los Angeles.\u201d \u201cWe find the images extremely disturbing and difficult to watch,\u201d the\u00a0statement posted on Instagram\u00a0reads. \u201cIf the conduct depicted occurred in 2016, unfortunately we would be unable to charge as the conduct would have occurred beyond the timeline where a crime of assault can be prosecuted. As of today, law enforcement has not presented a case related to the attack depicted in the video against Mr. Combs, but we encourage anyone who has been a victim or witness to a crime to report it to law enforcement or reach out to our office for support from our Bureau of Victims Services,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said. The Los Angeles Police Department said it was also\u00a0\u201caware of the video\u201d but did not have an open investigation involving Combs, the\u00a0department\u00a0told CNN in a statement early Saturday. The\u00a0LAPD did not respond to CNN\u2019s question on whether a report was ever filed regarding the assault. On Friday, Alex Fine, a personal trainer and Ventura\u2019s husband, issued an apparent response to the surveillance video in a \u201cletter to women and children\u201d posted to Instagram. He said in the caption that he wrote the letter \u201cawhile back but the words ring true not just today but everyday.\u201d \u201cMen who hit women aren\u2019t men. Men who enable it and protect those people aren\u2019t men,\u201d he wrote in the letter. \u201cAs men violence against women shouldn\u2019t be inevitable, check your brothers, your friends, and your family. Our daughters, sisters, mothers, and wives should feel protected and loved. Hold the women in your life with the upmost regard. Men who hurt women hate women.\u201d Fine and Ventura have been married since 2019. They have two daughters. At the end of the letter, Fine included the phone number of the National Domestic Violence hotline and wrote in part \u201cto the abusers, you\u2019re done, you\u2019re not safe anymore, you\u2019re not protected anymore.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/entertainment/diddy-combs-apology-video-cassie/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

She needn\u2019t worry. Smart\u2019s pitch-perfect performance as Vance has earned her rave reviews and two Emmy Awards for lead actress in a comedy series. When Wallace asked if Smart modeled her performance on any comedians, she said she knew she had make her comedic delivery her own. \u201cI mean, you know actors, we\u2019re monkey see monkey do. We\u2019re good mimics, but I didn\u2019t want to pick one specific person and try to do them because I knew it had to be my own style,\u201d Smart said. \u201cIt had to come from me and my sense of humor and timing and things like that. And I\u2019ve always liked watching comedians, so it\u2019s one of my favorite parts of the show that I get to do standup now.\u201d The third season of \u201cHacks\u201d finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. In the series and in reality, the seats are still predominately held by men. Smart shared her thoughts why it remains harder for female comedians to break through. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really interesting topic,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s still this prevailing feeling that women aren\u2019t really as funny as men or that they shouldn\u2019t be off color and things like that.

{"id": "2024_05_15_entertainment_ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review", "text": "Less than a year after Hulu\u2019s Ashley Madison documentary, Netflix settles for seconds with \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal,\u201d a three-part British production that has the advantage of feeling like roughly four documentaries in one. Part business meltdown, part crime mystery, part media critique, and part \u201ctales of Ashley Madison,\u201d it\u2019s a look at the married-people hookup site that\u2019s plenty salacious and definitely not monotonous. Founded on the theory that a surprising number of married people were signing up for dating sites, Ashley Madison (taken from two popular girl names) began with the slogan \u201cWhen monogamy becomes monotony\u201d before its evolution under CEO Noel Biderman to the more in-your-face line, \u201cLife is short. Have an affair.\u201d Yet while the company enjoyed explosive subscriber growth, and Biderman became media catnip by making the rounds subjecting himself to the righteous indignation of (mostly outraged) TV interviewers, the dirty secret was that Ashley Madison hadn\u2019t taken the promised steps to protect its data, leaving itself vulnerable to a 2015 hack that exposed thousands of clients. \u201cIt was like gambling with people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Evan Back, a sales executive and strategist who is one of the former employees interviewed. In one respect, director Toby Paton approaches the new docuseries in a manner that\u2019s very much of a piece with the daytime-TV mentality Biderman successfully exploited at the time from a marketing standpoint, working off the theory that there was no such thing as bad publicity for a site offering the prospect of adulterous hookups made easy. \u201cAshley Madison\u201d thus spends a lot of time chronicling a few specific soap-opera-worthy tales of lives that were upended when the hacked information went public, such as the fallout for Sam Rader, a Dallas area Christian vlogger who had secretly signed up, and his wife, Nia. At the same time, the docuseries both builds a kind of strange suspense toward the hack, on multiple levels, while providing a pointed media dissection of the voyeurism, with a touch of schadenfreude often masquerading as journalism that made this story so irresistible. As the cherry on top, Paton also devotes a portion of the series to the investigation into the hackers, self-identified as The Impact Team, which didn\u2019t behave like most corporate hackers in the way it presented its demands, leaving lingering questions and speculation regarding its motives. Put all that together, and \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\u201d lives up \u2013 or perhaps better, down \u2013 to its name. Like the ad said, life is short when it comes to committing to another docuseries. Still, people will no doubt be willing to take the leap for a story with such delicious \u201cThere but for the grace of God\u2026\u201d overtones. \u201cAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\u201d premieres May 15 in Netflix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/entertainment/ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

It was an exciting season full of star-studded cameos (hello Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce), instantly classic sketches and snarky political impersonations. Emma Stone and Kristen Wiig became the latest five-timers club inductees and an iconic spoof of two Comedy Central cartoon characters had us all laughing our faces off. Take a look at our best selects: \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d Even \u201cSNL\u201d veteran Heidi Gardner couldn\u2019t stop herself from laughing at Mikey Day and host Ryan Gosling\u2019s physical transformation into \u201890s cartoon icons Beavis and Butt-Head in an instantly classic sketch in April. Clips of Gardner breaking character immediately went viral, and Day and Gosling continued to ride the wave when they later appeared at Gosling\u2019s \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d movie premiere in their Beavis and Butt-Head getups. \u201cI\u2019m Just Pete\u201d \u201cSNL\u201d alum Pete Davidson kicked off Season 49 as host in October, and appeared in a hilarious sketch spoofing the Oscar-nominated \u201cBarbie\u201d song \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d with his own rendition titled \u201cI\u2019m Just Pete.\u201d Davidson sang, \u201cI\u2019m just Pete, my dating life is not discreet,\u201d while cast members performed the song\u2019s choreography with the utmost \u201cKenergy.\u201d \u201cProtective Mom 2\u201d Pedro Pascal made a surprise cameo in an October sketch alongside host and musical guest Bad Bunny, playing cast member Marcello Hernandez\u2019s judgmental Spanish-speaking mom who trash-talks his White girlfriend (Chloe Troast) through a comical half-English-half-Spanish conversation. Pascal, wearing a wig and pink outfit, eventually fawns over Troast when she insists Hernandez eat something \u2013 as moms love to do. \u201cRome Song\u201d Jason Momoa hosted a November episode of \u201cSNL\u201d and rapped about the viral Roman Empire social media trend in a wild music video sketch.

The foursome performed classic ABBA songs with a holiday twist, including a song sung in the style of \u201cMamma Mia\u201d where they poked fun at the group\u2019s signature style of singing while \u201cstanding close facing different directions.\u201d Watching everyone barely being able to hold it together makes this skit one for the books.

Katie Britt When Republican Sen. Katie Britt\u2019s 2024 State of the Union rebuttal went viral, social media was buzzing about which star would impersonate the Alabama Senator on the then-upcoming episode of \u201cSNL.\u201d Marvel star (and Mrs. Colin Jost) Scarlett Johansson then made an iconic surprise cameo when she scored the job, hilariously satirizing Britt\u2019s rebuttal in the March episode\u2019s cold open with quips like, \u201dYou see, I\u2019m not just a mother. I\u2019m a wife, a mother, and the craziest b\u2014h in the Target parking lot.\u201d \u201cAirplane Baby\u201d December host Adam Driver acting as a cranky baby named \u201clittle Eddie\u201d on an airplane, with his adult-sized head appearing atop a baby\u2019s body, was one of the most awkward and memorable sketches of this season. His mom (Sarah Sherman) paid no mind to his disruptive cries, messy spit-ups, shouts about missing \u201cthe womb\u201d and attempt to put his whole baby fist in his mouth, despite how much his adult-like facial features and fully-developed speech were creeping out the other passengers. \u201cHot Ones with Beyonc\u00e9 2\u201d Can you imagine Beyonc\u00e9 actually sitting down to eat increasingly spicy hot wings on \u201cHot Ones,\u201d the internet\u2019s favorite hot wing interview show?

{"id": "2024_05_18_entertainment_bridgerton-penelope-season-3", "text": "If you\u2019ve ever felt like a secondary character in your own romance novel, or experienced the sting of unrequited love, it\u2019s time to finally join the \u201cBridgerton\u201d bandwagon as the Netflix series returns with its most relatable love story yet. Following the success of its second season, which saw the electrifying \u201cwill they,won\u2019t they\u201d love story of Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and KateSharma (Simone Ashley) \u2013 dubbed \u201cKanthony\u201d by frenzied fans \u2013 the spotlight hasshifted to two familiar characters poised for their turn in the spotlight: Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan). The two beloved characters are finally taking center stage as the latest installment of the Regency-era romantic drama, and \u201cPolin\u201d shippers have eagerly awaited this moment, having watched Penelope secretly pine for Colin since the series launched in 2020. But with a deviation from the order of events in Julia Quinn\u2019s \u201cBridgerton\u201d novels, they will finally be getting the resolution they (and we) have been longing for. When we last saw the duo in Season 2, Colin had inadvertently hurt Penelope,when she overheard him telling his gentry friends that he would never court her,creating a rift and setting up the emotional tension for this season. \u201cWhen you meet them, they\u2019re both putting on masks,\u201d Coughlan told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cThey each feel like they need to be other people to survive and to be loved, and to find a match.\u201d The journey from friends to something more The new season begins with Colin returning from a summer of traveling abroad, witha new look and newfound attention from the society ladies. Meanwhile, Penelope is determined to find a husband in attempt to escape her family home, dominated by her scheming mother and newly-married sisters. With this season promising that \u201ceven a wallflower can blossom,\u201d Penelope\u2019s resolve comes with a \u201cglow up\u201d of sorts, which rids her of citrus-colored gowns and awkward hair updos in favor of a more mature, sophisticated look. \u201cFor her, she\u2019s thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t care about romance or love, that doesn\u2019t interest me.I\u2019m going to be practical and find a husband.\u2019 But you realize that she\u2019s done no workon herself. So, the transformation doesn\u2019t fix anything,\u201d Coughlan said. In an unexpected twist, Colin takes on the role of mentor, helping Penelope navigatethe world of courtship. And it works, with Penelope soon attracting the attention of LordDebling (Sam Phillips), a character who doesn\u2019t appear in the books. Almost inevitably, this sparks jealousy in Colin. In a Season 3 preview, we see himpensively ask his mother, \u201cIs the best foundation for love friendship?\u201d While fans ofthe series will be screaming \u201cYES\u201d at their TV screens, Coughlan emphasizes thecharacters must go on a crucial journey of self-love before coming together. \u201cThere\u2019s a real overarching theme throughout the story with both Colin and Pen, ofthem learning to love themselves, as cheesy as that sounds,\u201d Coughlan said cringingly. \u201cBut it\u2019s so important. Once they learn to live in who they are, that\u2019s when they really, trulyblossom.\u201d Newton chimed in, \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other for a really long time, they know each other\u2019s insecurities, and it\u2019s about accepting that person rather than idolizing a version of them that just isn\u2019t real.\u201d As this season\u2019s main love interest, Newton admitted to feeling slight pressure, but said he\u2019s embracing the legacy left by his predecessors (Bailey along with Season 1\u2019s Reg\u00e9-Jean Page as Simon Basset) while bringing a fresh take on the archetype. \u201cHaving sat in this role for the last four years, I felt in a really good place with Colin. He has a lot of traits that the previous male leads didn\u2019t quite have. He\u2019s got this sensitivity and empathy for other characters,\u201d he said. Unlocking their sexual chemistry Coughlan and Newton said that becoming series leads felt exciting and natural. Their strong bond and open communication allowed them to \u201cunlock\u201d their chemistry rather than having to work on it, proving invaluable when filming \u201cBridgerton\u2019s\u201d famous love scenes. \u201cIn the lead up, I was very nervous,\u201d Coughlan admitted. \u201cBut then once we got into it,we had so much control over what we were doing. They ended up being really fun and watching them back, I think they\u2019re really beautiful.\u201d What the pair aren\u2019t comfortable with is dishing out dating advice. Both insisted theyaren\u2019t qualified to give modern-day advice (asking for a friend), but they believe thatultimately, Colin, Penelope and the rest of us are \u201cjust human.\u201d \u201cYou can have a crush, but don\u2019t think that they\u2019re the be-all and end-all,\u201d Coughlaninstructed. Note taken. \u201cBridgerton\u201d Season 3, Part 1 is streaming now on Netflix. Part 2 will release on June 13.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/entertainment/bridgerton-penelope-season-3/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Barrymore adores animals. She said she wept the most writing her memoir \u201cWildflower\u201d when she shared a story about her beloved dog, Flossie, who lived to be almost 17. So, it made sense for Barrymore to partner with Ring for a new campaign announced Monday. \u201cRing Pet Portraits\u201d invites pet parents to join the company in raising funds for animal shelters in need by sharing their favorite pet videos and pictures. When people share a pet video or photo post on Instagram or TikTok using #RingPets through June 14, Ring will make a donation to support ASPCA\u00a0and local animal shelters across the US. Barrymore even filmed a commercial with her dog, Douglas, in support of the campaign (Jeremy, her bearded dragon, makes a cameo) in which she has to explain to her pup that she can\u2019t submit his photo because he\u2019s a \u201cnepo puppy.\u201d She recently lost her golden retriever, Lucy, a month ago, an experience Barrymore said \u201cwas so hard.\u201d \u201cThe whole show built like a memorial wall to her, which was so sweet. \u2018cause everyone in the building was so affected,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we all started in Covid, we weren\u2019t allowed to have guests or people. So, I would bring the dogs and they just made everything feel so much safer and cozier.\u201d Barrymore has been connected to animals almost since the beginning. She began her acting career as an infant and her first commercial was for a Purina puppy chow when she was a toddler. As a young adult she shared her home with cats and now as a 49 year-old mother of two young daughters her pets are a big part of the family. \u201cThere\u2019s just this like, unspoken relationship that you have this connection, this constant companion, this love that is just so profound,\u201d Barrymore said. \u201cMy dogs sleep in my bed with me and so do my cats and it makes me feel like a whole human being.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I won\u2019t sleep with my friends,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m weird about sharing a bed, but with my kids and animals, I\u2019m like, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d She joked that she could have used a Ring camera on set as Lucy loved to wander around her daytime talk show. \u201cWe use cameras to watch babies.

{"id": "2024_05_18_entertainment_diddy-tape-women", "text": "The surveillance video of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, comes days after he paid tribute on social media to some of the women in his life, including the mothers of his seven children and his own mother, Janice Combs. Interest in the footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, has stoked conversation about not only his past with Ventura, whom he dated from 2007 to 2018, but also some of his other former relationships. Ventura documented their relationship in a lawsuit last year in which she alleged Combs raped and subjected her to years of repeated physical and other abuses over the course of their more than a decade together. Combs has denied Ventura\u2019s allegations. The suit was settled a day after it was filed, but it has led to questions about his possible behavior in other relationships. Here are some of the women Combs has had partnerships with. Misa Hylton The fashion stylist credits Combs, in part, for her career. In 2017, Hylton-Brim told Billboard magazine she began styling music artists when she was a 17-year-old high schooler and found herself in the \u201cright place, right time.\u201d \u201cMy boyfriend at the time was Sean Combs (aka P. Diddy), who was an intern when we met and had just got promoted to A&R,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cI was there as he was working with [R&B group Jodeci] and shaping their album. I was able to help him work on the image and to sell it to [Uptown Records head] Andre Harrell.\u201d She\u2019s been hailed as the most influential stylist in hip-hop in the 1990s, working with artists like Lil Kim, Mary J. Blige and others who were on Combs\u2019 Bad Boy Records label. Hylton gave birth to Combs\u2019 first child, Justin, in December 1993. The two split soon after but appear to have amicably co-parented over the years. Kim Porter Porter, a model who also was one of the founders of a lifestyle company in Atlanta, was Combs\u2019 off-and-on girlfriend for more than a decade. He helped raise her son Quincy Brown, whose biological father is R&B singer Al B. Sure. Porter and Combs welcomed their first biological child together, a son named Christian, in April 1998. Their twin daughters, D\u2019Lila and Jessie, were born in December 2006. The couple split for good the following year after Porter learned that Combs was also expecting a child with his friend, businesswoman Sarah Chapman, around the same time she was pregnant with their twins. Porter talked to Essence magazine shortly after the split and explained her reasons for ending the relationship. \u201cI left because at this point in my life I want something different for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI invested ten years, I have children, and I\u2019ve always stood by him. But now it\u2019s time for me and what I want to do for Kim.\u201d The pair maintained a close relationship until Porter died after a brief illness in November 2018. She was 47. The Los Angeles County Coroner\u2019s Office later ruled her death the result of pneumonia.  Jennifer Lopez Lopez was already a star when she began dating Combs in 1999. While their relationship only lasted for two years, they were the focus of a lot of media attention in that time.  She stood beside him after the couple, Combs\u2019 bodyguard Anthony \u201cWolf\u201d Jones and the rapper Shyne Barrow, a Combs prot\u00e9g\u00e9, were involved in a disagreement at Club New York in Manhattan that ended with gunfire. Three people were injured, and while the men and Lopez were initially arrested, charges against her were soon dropped. Combs and Jones were later acquitted in the incident. Lopez and Combs split in 2001, and two years later she told Vibe magazine infidelity played a role in their breakup. \u201dIt was the first time I was with someone who wasn\u2019t faithful,\u201d she said. \u201dI was in this relationship with Puff (the nickname Combs went by at the time) where I was totally crying, crazy and going nuts, it really took my whole life in a tailspin.\u201d The former couple remained friends, however. Sarah Chapman Chapman, an Atlanta-based businesswoman and longtime friend of Combs, welcomed their daughter, Chance, in July 2006. While she has lived pretty privately, their daughter has been more in the spotlight. Chance Combs was her father\u2019s date for the 2022 Academy Awards and shared that she was an aspiring actress. \u201cZendaya is one of my biggest inspirations and someone that I really want to work with in the future,\u201d the teen told Laverne Cox on the red carpet as her father proudly looked on. Caresha \u201cYung Miami\u201d Brownlee One of Combs\u2019 most recent loves is a fellow hip-hop artist. Brownlee, better known as Yung Miami, is a rapper who has been one half of the popular duo City Girls. She was first linked to Combs in 2021. \u201cWe\u2019re dating. We go have dates. We\u2019re friends,\u201d Combs said to Brownlee on her Revolt podcast \u201cCaresha Please.\u201d \u201cWe go to exotic locations. We have great times.\u201d Combs co-founded Revolt and he and Brownlee were frequently seen together on social media and in paparazzi photos. Since Ventura\u2019s lawsuit, Brownlee has been implored by her followers to make a statement, but so far she has not commented. Dana Tran Tran, a cybersecurity specialist, is the mother of Combs\u2019 youngest child, a daughter named Love Sean Combs. The elder Combs had earlier restyled himself as \u201cLove\u201d and since their daughter\u2019s birth, Tran has shared plenty of content featuring the little one on her Instagram account.  Combs this week shared a photo on social media of him cradling his youngest, writing in the caption \u201cMy Love\u201d with a heart emoji.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/entertainment/diddy-tape-women/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}

Prime Video released the first trailer for the upcoming second season of the \u201cLord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\u201d series on Tuesday, giving a sprawling glimpse into how the realm is preparing to battle the Dark Lord Sauron, whose reemergence was chronicled in Season 1. \u201cAn evil, ancient and powerful, has returned,\u201d says dwarven Prince Durin IV (Owain Arthur) in the opening seconds of the trailer. Sauron (Charlie Vickers) is seen sporting a new look, disguising himself as an Elf with bleach-blonde hair and elven ears. He sparsely appears in the trailer, but his presence is felt throughout as Galadriel (Morfydd Clark), Isildur (Maxim Baldry), Arondir (Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova) and Elrond (Robert Aramayo) are shown fighting to protect Middle-earth. The trailer impressively showcases fiery battles, Orc armies, nefarious sea creatures, a Great Eagle, three Rings of Power and the land of Mordor shrouded in darkness, all set to composer Bear McCreary\u2019s dramatic score. The Stranger (Daniel Weyman) \u2013 whose identity has yet to be revealed but is speculated to be the all-powerful wizard Gandalf \u2013 is also briefly shown slamming a staff into the ground. \u201cOne of the exciting things about this year is we\u2019re going to see Sauron out in the open making everything happen,\u201d Vickers said in a Season 2 behind-the-scenes featurette released on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to watch it all unfold.\u201d Season 2 will pick up with the return of the cunning Dark Lord, who must rebuild his strength to oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, \u201cwhich will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will,\u201d according to an official synopsis.

{"id": "2024_05_09_entertainment_kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review", "text": "Seven years after a trilogy that ended with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d didn\u2019t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept. Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it\u2019s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity \u2013 the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren \u2013 the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did). The audience, ultimately, will determine whether \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving (not always for the better) in a variety of ways. What\u2019s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years. In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) \u2013 an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom \u2013 attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive. Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman (\u201cThe Witcher\u2019s\u201d Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery. A veteran of the \u201cMaze Runner\u201d movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language. The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing \u201cThe Planet of the Apes\u201d but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run. Hollywood blockbusters aren\u2019t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these \u201cApes\u201d prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don\u2019t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it\u2019s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d premieres May 10 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_04_25_entertainment_challengers-review-zendaya", "text": "In tennis, \u201clove\u201d means nothing. Love also has little to do with \u201cChallengers,\u201d which uses the sport as the backdrop to serve up an elaborate, non-linear psychological triangle that proves twisty and enticing for much of the match, before double faulting by whiffing on the ending. Seduction and sex are again at the heart of this film from \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d director Luca Guadagnino, who also throws in twists of fate, paths not taken and \u2013 in the case of the central character played by Zendaya \u2013 a burning desire to win and exercise control over those around her, exploring how that elite-athlete mentality bleeds into her personal life. The framing device is a singles match between Art (\u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d Mike Faist), a decorated superstar who might be nearing the end, at least in his mind, of his tournament-winning career; and Patrick (\u201cThe Crown\u2019s\u201d Josh O\u2019Connor), who arrives at the off-the-beaten-track tournament where they end up facing off in a run-down car that, his finances being what they are, doubles as his hotel room. Flashing back 13 years, we discover that the two were bosom pals as junior tennis players when they first set their eyes \u2013 springing out of their heads almost cartoon-like \u2013 on Tashi (Zendaya), a rising star whose game provokes as much lust from them as her striking looks. Back in the present, Tashi is Art\u2019s wife and coach, having lost her own career to a devastating knee injury. Yet it\u2019s pretty obvious that she\u2019s living through him \u2013 he addresses the point overtly, saying, \u201cI\u2019m playing for both of us\u201d \u2013 which only makes how she wound up with him, as well as the outcome of Art and Patrick\u2019s (very) protracted match, more intriguing. While sexual tension plays a central role in the movie (and certainly the marketing of it), \u201cChallengers\u201d is as much about blurring the lines between sex and the seductive power of big-time sports, with winning and success as the ultimate aphrodisiac. Add to that the two boys/men being pretty transparent about what they want, Tashi remains a source of mystery, in part because of the unscheduled detour her career has been forced to take. After his fine young cannibals romance \u201cBones and All,\u201d Guadagnino, working from a script by playwright Justin Kuritzkes, occupies more conventional and commercial territory here, while doing all he can to sex up how he films the tennis sequences. Despite the zooming angles and whizzing balls, there\u2019s no escaping the sheer abundance of those scenes, especially for anyone who has never sat through an entire US Open or Wimbledon final. Even using the sport as a metaphor, \u201cChallengers\u201d might become a bit of a challenge for those who show up eager to see the principals sweat for different reasons. Because she\u2019s playing more complicated angles, Zendaya\u2019s Tashi is the most interesting character as well as a source of frustration. Then again, the details regarding all three of the key figures stay somewhat vague thanks in part to the structure, though all are prone to the occasional racket-mangling tantrum. While the build-up proves effective, the payoff simply feels too precious, in a way that\u2019s particularly unsatisfying. That misstep doesn\u2019t invalidate sitting through this otherwise neatly choreographed match, but in tennis terms, it\u2019s the kind of unforced error that prevents Guadagnino\u2019s latest film from ranking as an unqualified winner. \u201cChallengers\u201d premieres April 26 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/25/entertainment/challengers-review-zendaya/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_entertainment_back-to-black-review-marisa-abela-amy-winehouse", "text": "The tragic arc of Amy Winehouse\u2019s brief life and nova-like career creates built-in problems for a biography of the singer, which doesn\u2019t dampen the knockout performance by Marisa Abela in \u201cBack to Black,\u201d capturing the talent, rage and self-destructiveness that defined her. Thin as biopics go, the power of Abela\u2019s portrayal elevates the film, providing a poignance and strength that\u2019s the clearest motivation to go, go, go. Indeed, Winehouse\u2019s stratospheric rise and paparazzi-plagued stardom lean in the direction of a fairly one-dimensional story, as she falls head over heels for the troubled Blake (Jack O\u2019Connell), entering into a relationship that combines passion, excess and toxicity in roughly equal measure. At the same time, she\u2019s making her mark as a songwriter and singer, though her fondness for drink (and Blake\u2019s dalliances with drugs) goes hand in hand with that \u2013 tendencies that provoke less concern than they seemingly should from her father (Eddie Marsan) and colorful grandmother (Lesley Manville), a one-time jazz singer who isn\u2019t above telling tales out of school about the likes of Tony Bennett. Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (whose credits include the John Lennon biopic \u201cNowhere Boy\u201d as well as \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d) from a script by Matt Greenhalgh, \u201cBack to Black\u201d tilts too heavily toward Winehouse\u2019s personal struggles at the expense of her musical triumphs. Then again, as constructed here, the two went hand in hand, with the lyrics to songs like \u201cBack to Black\u201d and \u201cRehab\u201d directly addressing her addictions to her relationship with Blake and alcohol. Having appeared in the HBO series \u201cIndustry,\u201d Abela pulls off this remarkably challenging character both musically and dramatically, in a way that isn\u2019t necessarily sympathetic \u2013 to the extent Winehouse is often the author of her own troubles \u2013 but rather, magnetic. Ill-equipped for the demands of fame, she achieved it with sheer ferocity and talent, becoming the sort of commodity where the train\u2019s moving too fast to slow down much for warning signs. Of course, just making a movie about Winehouse invites charges of exploiting her tragic end at age 27 as opposed to celebrating her talent, but that\u2019s an issue that can be laid at the feet of any number of gone-too-soon musical biographies, from \u201cThe Doors\u201d to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d (The recent \u201cBob Marley: One Love\u201d was notably made with the blessing and participation of his family and felt like a licensed product.) In terms of capturing what animated Winehouse, the blinding star power that Abela emits here ultimately justifies the exercise. As for whether that means seeing \u201cBack to Black\u201d now in a theater or later at home, it\u2019s the kind of small-boned movie that, unlike its subject, doesn\u2019t quite have the feel of a headliner. \u201cBack to Black\u201d premieres May 17 in US theaters.

{"id": "2024_05_17_entertainment_sean-combs-cassie-ventura", "text": "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs apologized on Sunday for physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, two days after CNN published exclusive hotel surveillance video from 2016 in which Combs appeared to grab, shove, drag and kick her. \u201cMy behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\u201d he said in a video statement posted on\u00a0Instagram. \u201cI was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now,\u201d he added. \u201cI went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I\u2019m so sorry. But I\u2019m committed to be a better man\u00a0each and every\u00a0day. I\u2019m not asking for forgiveness. I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d Combs had previously denied Ventura\u2019s allegations of assault, which were the basis of a now-settled\u00a0federal lawsuit filed by Ventura in\u00a0November. Meredith Firetog, an attorney for Ventura, said in a statement on Sunday following the release of Combs\u2019 apology: \u201cCombs\u2019 most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt.\u00a0When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.\u00a0That he was only compelled to \u2018apologize\u2019 once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.\u201d The\u00a0surveillance footage, compiled from multiple camera angles dated March 5, 2016, appears to show the rapper, producer and business mogul during an incident that, according to Ventura\u2019s complaint, occurred at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles. CNN verified the location based on publicly available photos of the former hotel\u2019s interior. In the video, Ventura exits a hotel room and walks to a bank of elevators. Combs, holding a towel around his waist,\u00a0runs down a hall after Ventura. He grabs her by the back of the neck and throws her to the floor. Still holding his towel closed with one hand, he then turns to kick her, the video shows. As Ventura is on the ground, Combs retrieves a purse and suitcase from the floor near the elevators. He turns around and kicks Ventura again as she lies motionless on the floor. About four seconds transpire between the two kicks, according to the video. He then briefly drags Ventura by her sweatshirt toward a room before walking away. Ventura is then seen slowly standing up. She gathers items from the floor and moves to pick up a phone on the hallway wall near the elevators. Combs, still in a towel and socks, returns. A mirror directly across from the security camera shows Combs appearing to shove Ventura. Seconds later, he sits down on a chair, grabs an object off a table and forcefully throws it toward Ventura. Combs is seen walking away, then\u00a0turns\u00a0toward Ventura once again when an elevator door opens and someone appears to exit. Ventura, who reached an undisclosed settlement with Combs, declined to comment on the video obtained by CNN. Douglas H. Wigdor, another attorney for Ventura, said: \u201cThe gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light.\u201d The Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office issued a statement Friday on the 2016\u00a0surveillance video. \u201cWe are aware of the video that has been circulating online allegedly depicting Sean Combs assaulting a young woman in Los Angeles. We find the images extremely disturbing and difficult to watch,\u201d the\u00a0statement posted on Instagram\u00a0reads. \u201cIf the conduct depicted occurred in 2016, unfortunately we would be unable to charge as the conduct would have occurred beyond the timeline where a crime of assault can be prosecuted. As of today, law enforcement has not presented a case related to the attack depicted in the video against Mr. Combs, but we encourage anyone who has been a victim or witness to a crime to report it to law enforcement or reach out to our office for support from our Bureau of Victims Services,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said. The Los Angeles Police Department is\u00a0\u201caware of the video\u201d but does not have an open investigation involving Combs, the\u00a0department\u00a0told CNN in a statement early Saturday. The\u00a0LAPD did not respond to CNN\u2019s question on whether a report was ever filed regarding the assault. When contacted by CNN, a representative for InterContinental Hotels said on Friday, \u201cThis hotel is no longer under IHG management, and we do not have any access to prior incident records or footage.\u201d Ventura\u2019s lawsuit Combs and Ventura, a model and singer known for songs like \u201cMe & U,\u201d were in an off-and-on relationship from 2007 \u2013 2018. The two were photographed together at the Los Angeles premiere of the film \u201cA Perfect Match\u201d on March 7, 2016. According to Ventura\u2019s complaint, which cited the altercation as occurring \u201caround March 2016,\u201d Combs became \u201cextremely intoxicated and punched Ms. Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye.\u201d After Combs fell asleep, Ventura attempted to leave the hotel room, but he woke up and \u201cfollowed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cHe grabbed at her, and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her, causing glass to crash around them as she ran to the elevator to escape,\u201d the complaint alleged. After Ventura got in the elevator, her complaint states that she took a cab to her apartment. \u201cUpon realizing that her running away would cause Mr. Combs to be even angrier with her, and completely stuck in his vicious cycle of abuse, Ms. Ventura returned to the hotel with the intention of apologizing for running away from her abuser,\u201d the complaint claims. \u201cWhen she returned, hotel security staff urged her to get back into a cab and go to her apartment, suggesting that they had seen the security footage showing Mr. Combs beating Ms. Ventura and throwing glass at her in the hotel hallway.\u201d The complaint alleges Combs paid the InterContinental Century City $50,000 for the hallway security footage, one of a number of allegations made in the November lawsuit in which Ventura claimed she was raped in 2018 and subjected to years of repeated physical and other abuses by Combs. Ventura, who was formally signed to Combs\u2019 label, claimed in her suit that he \u201cexerted his power and influence\u201d over her throughout the course of their professional and romantic relationship. According to the complaint, she was 19 when they met and Combs was 37, and their business relationship lasted until 2019. It detailed claims that Combs was physically violent toward Ventura and forced her to engage in various sex acts with other men during that time. Ben Brafman, an attorney for Combs, said in a statement to CNN on the day it was filed, \u201cMr. Combs vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations.\u201d The suit was resolved the following day. \u201cA decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing,\u201d Brafman told CNN in a statement at the time. \u201cMr. Combs\u2018 decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.\u201d Details of the settlement were not disclosed. Ongoing legal issues Since November, Combs has faced five other civil lawsuits accusing him of a range of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity. He has denied the allegations, and the cases remain active. Authorities searched Combs\u2019 homes in California and Florida in March as part of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security team that handles human trafficking crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The investigation stems from many of the same sexual assault allegations put forth in the civil lawsuits, according to a second law enforcement source familiar with the searches. Aaron Dyer, an attorney for Combs, issued a statement at the time, calling the searches a \u201cgross overuse of military-level force.\u201d \u201cThis unprecedented ambush \u2013 paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence \u2013 leads to a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/entertainment/sean-combs-cassie-ventura/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_entertainment_rick-and-morty-animated-tv-series-cec", "text": "After 10 years on the air, \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d the animated sci-fi comedy about a misanthropic scientist and his 14-year-old grandson\u2019s interdimensional adventures, is surprising as ever. In its seven seasons, it has steered its characters through apocalypses, divorces, an alien musical reality TV competition and school dances \u2014 events with equal gravity in its off-kilter universe. There are very few rules in \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d which makes the job all the more fun for its writers, who are working on its eighth and ninth seasons now. But in the middle of its seventh season, which ended in December, \u201cRick and Morty\u201d made its most shocking move yet \u2013\u2013\u00a0it finally gave Rick what he\u2019s spent more than half of his 70-odd years seeking. Rick finally killed his mortal enemy, Rick Prime, in the fifth episode of the show\u2019s recent 10-episode season. Rick Prime, a cruel version of Rick from another dimension, killed our Rick\u2019s wife, throwing his life off-course. Our protagonist\u2019s curdled, single-minded pursuit of vengeance eventually led him to rejoin his family, recruit his daughter Beth\u2019s teenage children for his interdimensional travels and set the series in motion. But true to \u201cRick and Morty\u2019s\u201d deeply cynical tone, Rick feels nothing when he kills Rick Prime in a series of increasingly brutal punches. Afterwards, back at his family home, while Morty rejoices in Rick\u2019s \u201cvictory,\u201d Rick is as numb as a zombie. The act of killing his enemy, Rick realizes, was ultimately meaningless and does nothing to ease the loss of his wife. It takes him a few episodes to shake his despair. \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d says series writer Heather Anne Campbell, is incredibly silly but utterly serious about the weirdness of being alive.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get at some deeper, funnier, dumber, more nihilistic truth about what we\u2019re doing here,\u201d Campbell told CNN. \u201cThe most effective way to demonstrate that to an audience is like, yeah, have you achieved your goal? And it doesn\u2019t feel like anything? What does that mean? Because that\u2019s something everybody experiences, I think, all the time.\u201d To love \u201cRick and Morty\u201d is to know that it can go anywhere at any time, from the planet Alphabetrium, made up of letter-shaped beings including the rapper Ice-T, to Viking Valhalla with Bigfoot. There are endless possibilities in the world(s) it\u2019s built, where substance-addled scientist Rick is the self-proclaimed smartest man in the universe and can do pretty much anything except readily admit his love for Morty, granddaughter Summer or Beth, or anyone beyond his best friend, the recently resurrected Bird Person. The season wasn\u2019t all major revelations and deeply sad dramatic beats, though. Just a week before that pivotal installment, \u201cRick and Morty\u201d aired an episode in which Rick feeds his family delicious spaghetti that they discover was made from a dead body. (Campbell wrote that one, plus the season seven finale.) That\u2019s the fulfilling joy of writing for \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d Campbell says \u2013\u2013 its \u201cinfinite sandbox.\u201d No idea is off limits as long as it rings true in the universe of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d and to its viewers, be it the moral cost of a spaghetti dinner or the emptiness felt after vanquishing a foe. \u201cThe six seasons previous have shown us that literally anything can be an episode,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the strength of the show is taking any of these completely absurd sci-fi concepts and really interrogating them and trying to illuminate some stupid truth about what life is and what we\u2019re experiencing.\u201d Rick made major strides in season seven, with one major setback As in previous seasons, \u201cRick and Morty\u2019s\u201d seventh season was profane, uproariously funny and often deeply upsetting. (\u201cRick and Morty\u201d is a property of Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN.) It was the first to air after Justin Roiland, who co-created the series with Dan Harmon and voiced both title characters, was fired due to allegations of sexual assault. But his departure didn\u2019t kneecap the series \u2013\u2013 new actors Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden were brought in to voice Rick and Morty, respectively, and the show continues to probe the mysteries of life in outlandish scenarios, asking questions like, Would you stage an intervention for your alcoholic friend whose wife left him for the Predator? And also, what if Hugh Jackman was there? Nihilism is where \u201cRick and Morty\u201d thrives \u2013\u2013\u00a0in the very first season, our title characters abandoned Morty\u2019s home planet with his parents and sister still on it after they unleashed a Cronenberg-ian mutation that turned everyone into oozing, murderous monsters, and all because Morty asked Rick for a love potion. But by the end of this seventh season, our title characters have emotionally matured somewhat. The pair get a subtly sweet moment in the season finale: Rick and Morty have grown jaded by the horrors they\u2019ve seen across dimensions and find they can no longer be scared. Eager to feel the jitters again, they leap into something called the Fear Hole, which brings to life their deepest anxieties. For Morty, that\u2019s a life where Rick leaves. Inside the hole, Morty meets a version of Diane, Rick\u2019s dead wife. Morty\u2019s fear manifests a version of Rick, who Diane tries to convince to stay in the hole \u2014\u00a0even though it\u2019ll kill him. Morty finally climbs out of the hole, but only after confronting his fear that Rick could leave the family as suddenly as he reentered their lives, stranding Morty in an unremarkable life once again. \u201cAm I \u2026 irreplaceable?\u201d Morty asks Rick once he\u2019s left the hole. Rick, ever withholding, counters: \u201cDefine irreplaceable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good \u2026 good,\u201d Morty says, hugging Rick tightly, a rarity in the series. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d Teetering on the edge of the hole, which is inexplicably located in a bathroom stall inside a Denny\u2019s, Rick is briefly tempted to find Diane, a choice made weightier by Rick\u2019s recent killing of the man who killed her. Instead, he pulls a photo of Morty out of his wallet and pins it to a corkboard inside the stall to signify, with pride, that his grandson is one of the few to make it out of the Fear Hole alive. It\u2019s as close as Rick can come to admitting he loves his grandson. The quiet moment lands because it\u2019s taken Rick so long to go that far \u2013\u2013\u00a0and leaves the rest of the series wide open. It\u2019s an exciting prospect for viewers and even for Cardoni, the new voice of Rick, who doesn\u2019t know where the series is headed either. \u201cThe character is growing,\u201d Cardoni told CNN ahead of the finale. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some great turns with (Rick) just in the season, in terms of his emotional health and mental health. We\u2019ve seen it working, and we\u2019re seeing him open up in different ways. I\u2019ll bring to that whatever I can, but I think the character is what\u2019s alive now.\u201d On a show where anything can happen, everything will Because an episode of \u201cRick and Morty\u201d can start from anything, Campbell pitched the idea for suicide spaghetti. It starts out like a \u201cclassic \u2018Rick and Morty\u2019 adventure\u201d in which Morty morally objects to something Rick does \u2013\u2013 in this case, serving delicious spaghetti to his family that\u2019s actually made from the remains of people whose insides turn to pasta only when they die by suicide. Harmon wasn\u2019t sold on the concept as an entire episode at first, Campbell said, but encouraged her to riff on it. It turned into \u201cThat\u2019s Amorte.\u201d At first, the episode feels like it\u2019s taking a blackly comic take on taboo subjects to disturbing extremes \u2013\u2013\u00a0fairly typical terrain for a series that once featured a \u201csoul orgy\u201d between Rick, Morty and Summer, plus a gaggle of dragons. But it turns oddly moving once the suicide spaghetti industry balloons and Morty finds himself complicit in its success. Rick ends the demand for pasta for good by hooking a dying man up to a machine that broadcasts scenes from his life to those watching across the planet. Eating the remains of a man who lived, lost and loved is suddenly no longer appetizing. \u201cI wanted to get across that life is not a direct path from one point to another \u2013\u2013\u00a0it is a constantly meandering river,\u201d Campbell said of the montage of the man\u2019s life. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t rob it of meaning, especially if you look at the entire thing all at once.\u201d The spaghetti episode only worked because co-creator Dan Harmon and showrunner Scott Marder were \u201cfully indulgent and patient\u201d in letting Campbell explore pasta as a plot device and developed it with her from the very beginning of the pitch process, she said. \u201cTapping that excitement for an area usually leads to stronger drafts for each episode on the whole,\u201d Marder told CNN. As for the ideas that make it that far, the \u201cenergy in the writer\u2019s room\u201d is the most important barometer of potential, Harmon told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about everyone laughing, but it is about them being excited \u2013\u2013 when two or more writers start talking over each other, and everyone is pitching very different possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf two people can disagree fundamentally about how they\u2019d use X-ray glasses, that\u2019s a sign there may be a story\u2019s worth of energy in X-ray glasses.\u201d Or, spaghetti. Campbell\u2019s pasta-centric episode tonally fits right in alongside the bleak episode in which Rick Prime dies. \u201cWe always say every episode needs to run a marathon, in terms of its lifespan, from a kernel of an idea to making it to air,\u201d Marder said, \u201cso an idea really works when it\u2019s got a strong enough engine in it to help power it, and our enthusiasm for it, through that 26-mile race.\u201d \u201cRick and Morty\u201d writers are working on the next three seasons at once, in varying stages of development. It\u2019s helpful that way, Campbell said, because they can easily chart how a major canonical move will reverberate in a future season. For example: With his death, Rick Prime ceded his position as the show\u2019s major villain to Evil Morty, who helped our Rick find his nemesis \u2014 but, by the episode\u2019s end, has the power to destroy all Ricks in every dimension, upsetting the show\u2019s balance at any time. Where \u201cRick and Morty\u201d goes next is anyone\u2019s guess, especially with a dead Rick Prime and rogue Evil Morty. But the unknown is the point of the series, Campbell said. \u201cThe future is so terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing alive is a puzzle. And those things colliding against each other is where the show is going.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/entertainment/rick-and-morty-animated-tv-series-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "entertainment"}}
