{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_metformin-preconception-pregnancy-birth-defects-risks", "text": "Some studies have raised concerns about a potential link between the widely used type 2 diabetes drug metformin and an increased risk of conceiving a baby with birth defects. But new research now suggests that the use of the medication among men planning to conceive or women in early pregnancy does not appear to be linked with an increased risk of major birth defects for their children. The two studies, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, contradict a 2022 study that linked metformin use by men in the three months before they conceived a baby to a 40% increased risk of birth defects in their offspring. The findings provide \u201cassurance\u201d for parents, said Dr. Ran Rotem, an author of the new study on the paternal use of metformin and a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cConventionally and traditionally, the mother has been the focus when it comes to pregnancy and when it comes to fetal health and the health of the newborn. What we are increasingly finding is that the father is also important,\u201d he said. He added that the increased risk of birth defects seen in previous research could be associated with the disease of diabetes or with related comorbidities, and not so much the medication itself. \u201cWhen we think about a medication, we also have to think about the underlying conditions in which the medication is usually prescribed,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cWe know that diabetes itself is tricky when it comes to both fertility and potential complications in pregnancy and in newborns.\u201d Metformin is a first-line medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and has been widely used to help control blood sugar levels since the 1960s. The medication is now the most commonly prescribed oral drug for type 2 diabetes, and, before taking metformin, people are recommended to tell their doctor if they plan to become pregnant, are pregnant or are breastfeeding. \u2018Health of the father seems to be important\u2019 For the study on paternal use of metformin, researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Kahn-Sagol-Maccabi Research and Innovation Center of Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel analyzed data from birth records and medical records on nearly 400,000 babies born in Israel between 1999 and 2020. They compared that data with information on the babies\u2019 fathers, such as their ages, laboratory test results and medication records, including data on metformin prescriptions. Although the researchers didn\u2019t specifically look at how long the men had been on the medication, \u201cwe did have many people who have been on the medication for a long time, and the results were pretty consistent for those individuals, too,\u201d Rotem said. The researchers found that the prevalence of major birth defects was 4.7% in children of fathers not exposed to diabetes medications in the months leading up to conception, compared with 6.2% in children of fathers exposed to metformin before conceiving. When the researchers adjusted their data for factors such as the fathers\u2019 other underlying health conditions and whether the mother also had diabetes or related comorbidities, they found no increased risk of major birth defects in children exposed to paternal metformin. Men who used diabetes medications during the sperm developmental period, leading up to conceiving, tended to be older in age, had a higher prevalence of underlying health conditions and were more likely to have fertility problems and a history of smoking compared with fathers not exposed to diabetes medications. \u201cWe find that paternal use of metformin in the sperm development period is not associated with excess risk of malformation in newborns, proving assurance that fathers planning to start a family can continue using the drug to control their diabetes,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cMore broadly, our study also suggests that maintaining a good cardiometabolic health profile is important for both partners.\u201d A higher prevalence of underlying health conditions as well as fertility problems was also seen among the mothers of children whose fathers used metformin, compared with the mothers of children with no paternal diabetes medication exposures. \u201cIf the father is on diabetes medication, the mother is much more likely to be on diabetes medication too or have other metabolic comorbidities,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cWe know that diabetes itself is not good when it is in the mother, and we are finding evidence that it\u2019s also tricky for the fathers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can manage diabetes with just changing your lifestyle \u2013 doing more exercise, watching your diet \u2013 that\u2019s probably good, and that\u2019s helpful anyways. But if you have to be medicated, it seems like metformin is a safe choice for both.\u201d The data also showed that risk of a birth defect was higher when the father used metformin along with other medications, described as a polytherapy. Paternal use of metformin alone, known as monotherapy, did not appear to increase the risk for birth defects. \u201cWhen we examined specific treatment regimens, modestly elevated excess risks were still observed, specifically among children of fathers who used metformin in tandem with some other diabetes medication,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cBut we also observed that fathers who took multiple medications had more poorly controlled diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis again indicates that the modestly elevated risk seen for diabetes polytherapies was likely not caused by the medications themselves, but rather by the worse cardiometabolic health profile of the fathers.\u201d \u2018Poor blood sugar control is a risk factor\u2019 The other study that was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine had somewhat similar findings for mothers. Women who continued using metformin\u00a0and added insulin as a treatment\u00a0in their first trimester of pregnancy\u00a0showed little to no increased risk of giving birth to a baby with major birth defects compared with women who discontinued metformin and switched to insulin, according to the study. The researchers, also from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studied data on more than 12,000 women with type 2 diabetes and their pregnancies. The data came from the US Medicaid health care administration\u2019s database from 2000 to 2018. The analysis showed that the estimated risk for giving birth to a baby with birth defects was about 6% when the mother received insulin plus metformin,\u00a0versus\u00a08% when the mother received insulin alone. \u201cWe were not surprised by our findings. Although metformin may cross the placenta, potentially affecting the fetus, metformin can help with blood sugar control which may lower the risk of birth defects,\u201d Dr. Yu-Han Chiu,\u00a0the lead\u00a0author of the study and a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u00a0and Penn State College of Medicine,\u00a0said in an email. \u201cPoor blood sugar control is a risk factor for birth defects. Insulin in combination with metformin may result in better\u00a0blood sugar\u00a0control than using insulin alone. This may explain why we\u00a0observed a slightly lower risk of\u00a0live birth with congenital malformations when comparing with using insulin alone,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cFor women with type 2 diabetes and currently taking metformin and planning to conceive, our study suggests continuing metformin had no or little increased risk for birth defects compared to switching to insulin.\u201d A \u2018complex picture\u2019 The two new studies are \u201cwell done,\u201d Dr. Meleen Chuang, medical director of women\u2019s health at the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, said in an email. \u201cI would not change the way metformin is prescribed for parents trying to conceive,\u201d said Chuang, who was not involved in the new studies and serves as ob-gyn chief of service for NYU Langone Brooklyn. \u201cI would encourage weight loss, diet, exercise as a part of their preconception care for both parents,\u201d she added. \u201cReducing modifiable risk factors such as decreasing weight, smoking, alcohol, substance use are some ways to improve health and fertility.\u201d The possible risks that may come with the paternal and maternal use of metformin remain a \u201ccomplex picture,\u201d but the new studies help make that evolving picture clearer, Dr. Sarah Martins da Silva, of the University of Dundee in the United Kingdom, wrote in an editorial published alongside the two studies Monday. \u201cClearly, individual risks and benefits should be carefully considered and results should be interpreted with caution since studies lack information on glycemic control,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNonetheless, these recent analyses suggest that metformin is a safe and effective treatment option for [type 2 diabetes] for men and women trying to conceive as well as managing hyperglycemia in pregnant women in the first trimester,\u201d she added, \u201cand it may be time to reconsider current prenatal care guidelines that advocate switching to insulin therapy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/metformin-preconception-pregnancy-birth-defects-risks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_health_alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness", "text": "Preventive neurologist Dr Richard Isaacson stared at the numbers on the fax in astonishment. Blood biomarkers of telltale signs of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the brain of his patient, 55-year-old entrepreneur Simon Nicholls, had all but disappeared in a mere 14 months. \u201cI had to catch my breath. It was a complete shock: The blood tests on his brain had normalized,\u201d said Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. Was this stunning result the work of some new miracle drug designed to combat dementia? Not at all. This is a story of old-fashioned grit and determination. \u201cSimon was on a mission, as if the Grim Reaper was peering over his shoulder. He was going to kick ass and take names,\u201d Isaacson said. Nicholls reduced his risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle changes recommended by Isaacson, including diet, exercise, reducing stress and optimizing sleep, along with a few strategically chosen supplements and medications prescribed by his cardiologist. \u201cI was very worried,\u201d Nicholls told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in his new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d which is airing on \u201cThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.\u201d \u201cI have a 3-year-old son and an 8-year-old son. It\u2019s really important for me, as I get older, to try and be there for them in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many [changes] in lifestyle you can do to hopefully push the disease backwards and give yourself more time, which is all we need until we find a cure.\u201d Unlucky genes When it came to genetics and dementia, Nicholls had drawn the short straw. He carried two copies of the APOE4 gene, one from each parent, which may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s at least tenfold. \u201cSadly, my mum passed away from what we think is Alzheimer\u2019s in her 70s,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cFor the last 10 years of her life, she just sat in a chair, rocking, while on about 14 medications. I\u2019d much rather have a longer health span and then just go quickly.\u201d Not everyone with one or even two copies of APOE4 develops Alzheimer\u2019s, however, creating a tantalizing opportunity. Can a person diminish their genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle and various medical interventions, especially if started early, before too much damage is done? Isaacson, who also has a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, believes the answer is yes. He began the first US clinic devoted to Alzheimer\u2019s prevention in New York City in 2013 before moving his program to Florida in 2021. His research has shown that following a dozen or more lifestyle interventions, when practiced 60% or more of the time, can improve cognitive function, especially in women. Today, scientists around the world are also investigating the impact on cognition of such lifestyle changes as a healthy plant-based diet,\u00a0stress reduction,\u00a0strength training, aerobic exercise and quality sleep habits \u2014 behaviors that Isaacson and his team outlined in a recent review\u00a0published in Nature. \u201cI don\u2019t use the term \u2018reverse.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what reverse means when it comes to the field of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut the results we\u2019ve seen with Simon and some other patients in our research are extremely exciting.\u201d How the heart and the brain are intertwined Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t the only pathway to a life of dwindling memory and the inability to think, plan and interact with loved ones. Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can be caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks, stroke, blood clots and more, all of which can further damage the body and brain. Poor hearts and their consequences can run rampant in a family over generations, a fact Nicholls knew all too well. \u201cMy whole family had endless heart attacks, resulting in my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side dying around age 50,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother had three heart attacks, the first at age 50, then a triple bypass before she went on to develop dementia.\u201d Carrying an APOE4 gene further increases the risk for heart disease as well as dementia, experts say. \u201cMy sister had three heart attacks, and when I was 40, I was told that I had atherosclerosis, with a ridiculously massive coronary artery calcium score of like 1,500 and occlusions in about 96% of my arteries.\u201d A normal coronary artery calcium score is zero. For a man in the prime of his life, the news was crushing. Doctors tried to use lifestyle changes and statins to reverse the plaque buildup but finally resorted to surgery, opening three of Nicholls\u2019 arteries with stents. He also began using an injectable drug called evolocumab, designed to boost the liver\u2019s ability to remove \u201cbad\u201d \u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, from the body. \u2018It was time to turn to my brain\u2019 Slowly, Nicholls\u2019 heart condition began to improve, but the bad news didn\u2019t end there. A brain scan found telltale signs of vascular damage in Nicholls\u2019 brain, which occurs when the tiniest blood vessels are starved of oxygen. \u201cThe doctors said I had too many white matter lesions.\u00a0I told myself that since I now had my heart more or less under control, it was time to turn to my brain,\u201d Nicholls said. In January 2023, Nicholls became participant No. 34 in a novel clinical trial at Isaacson\u2019s Florida center. The trial is designed to uncover cognitive risk factors and counter them with a personalized plan of attack. (Full disclosure: I am participant No. 20 in the same trial; you can read about my experience here.) \u201cThe overall goal of the study is democratize access to preventive neurology care by eventually using at-home blood testing to cost-effectively reach the most people,\u201d Isaacson said. As part of the trial, Nicholls underwent a battery of tests, including a unique blood test that can track levels of amyloid, tau\u00a0and other\u00a0hallmark biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other degenerative conditions. Deposits of amyloid can begin accumulating in the brain decades before symptoms begin,\u00a0even in a person\u2019s 30s and 40s. \u201cSimon\u2019s first test came back with a score of 70. Anything over 58 was positive for amyloid in the brain,\u201d Isaacson said.\u00a0\u201cThe results backed up the amyloid PET scan Simon had taken in 2019, where I could see the plaque in his brain.\u201d 10,000 steps a day: \u2018I\u2019m very consistent\u2019 Nicholls needed to lose weight, so he began taking tirzepatide (the active ingredient in the medications Mounjaro and Zepbound), one of the newer injectable drugs that suppress appetite by stimulating hormones that control blood sugar levels. At the same time, Nicholls was encouraged to step up his physical activity by incorporating strength training three times a week while adding 45 to 60 minutes a day of zone 2 exercise, in which you briskly walk, ruck, jog or cycle at 60% to 70% of your heart rate. \u201cI love going for a walk every morning at sunrise for an hour and a half with a podcast. I get in 10,000 steps or more every day. I\u2019m very consistent,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cI also do a very slow full-body workout with weights three times a week for an hour\u2019s time.\u201d Avoiding sugar, artificial sweeteners, alcohol and ultraprocessed foods is a must, as is following a plant-based meal plan such as the Mediterranean diet. \u201cWhen I first saw Simon, he had a bit of a middle, like most guys in their 50s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen I saw him at nine weeks, I did a double take. He was totally buff, ripped even. \u201cWithin those nine weeks, he had lost 21 pounds, about 80% of that fat, and put on muscle, which was excellent,\u201d Isaacson added. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d The weight loss and increased muscle mass lowered Nicholls\u2019 fasting blood sugar levels, ending his march toward diabetes, while some tweaks to his cholesterol medications further optimized his good and bad cholesterol numbers. In August 2023, it was time to repeat the blood test for amyloid. By then, the company that administers the tests had added a measurement for tau, another key hallmark sign of Alzheimer\u2019s, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease. \u201cSimon\u2019s amyloid probability score on the new APS2 test had dropped to 53, which was phenomenal,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut he was still positive, as anything between 48 and 100 is considered to reflect a high probability of amyloid brain plaques on a brain scan.\u201d \u2018Turn on the screws\u2019 Now that the big concerns of cholesterol, insulin, diet, exercise and fat mass were addressed, it was time \u201cto turn on the screws,\u201d Isaacson said, with personalized recommendations based on Nicholls\u2019 biology. \u201cWe optimized Simon\u2019s omega-3 fatty acid levels, which is especially important for people with APOE \u03b54, as they need more omega-3. We also added B complex vitamins to control elevated homocysteine in his blood,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cHowever, we would not give B complex vitamins to anyone who did not have higher homocysteine levels.\u201d Elevated homocysteine, which is an amino acid used by the body to make protein, is a risk factor for brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. A September 2010 randomized controlled trial found that supplementation slowed brain atrophy in people with mild cognitive impairment. In the meantime, Nicholls, an avid researcher who loves to read medical journals, was adding some interventions of his own. \u201cI have steam and sauna rooms in my home, I do a lot of that. I love it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried cold water plunges, and I have lists of things to do I get from podcasts, from walking to sleeping to gratitude to yoga to sleep routines. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I do that Dr. Isaacson doesn\u2019t agree with: I get stem cell injections twice a year,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cSadly, I have arthritis in my hands, and that definitely feels better when I use stem cells, and I like to think they may be helping my brain, as well.\u201d There was one more big issue to tackle: Nicholls\u2019 sleep, or lack of it, which studies have shown can hasten cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s. With business around the world, Nicholls is a frequent flyer with \u201cterrible sleep\u201d due to jet lag and insomnia.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m also a worrier type of person,\u201d he confessed. Adding a sleep medication approved for insomnia helped, \u201cbut Simon really needs to tackle his sleep by improving his sleep hygiene with a more regular sleep schedule,\u201d Isaacson said. An unbelievable result On Halloween 2023, the next APS2 score arrived. Amazingly, Nicholls had reduced the amount of amyloid and tau in his blood to 40: He was testing negative in blood for signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. Shocked and amazed, Isaacson remained skeptical. \u201cI was very cautious. You know, promise not to overpromise. I needed to retest.\u201d A few days before Christmas, the repeat test results arrived. When it too was a negative finding of 40, Isaacson decided to tell Nicholls in person. \u201cDr. Isaacson drove all the way from Boca Raton to Miami excited, very happy,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cWe walked on a beach together, and we were ecstatic that we\u2019d actually been able go from positive to negative for amyloid.\u201d Although Nicholls is ecstatic about the improvements, he\u2019s also very humble about his efforts to improve his health. \u201cI\u2019m really not all that compliant. To comply is just horrendously difficult, right? Of course I want to have a beer or a hamburger or something stupid. I love gummy bears and eating crappy food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped that I have some great doctors to help me, but to be honest, my biggest motivator are my children,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cI\u2019d love to see my sons get married and have their own kids, and to do that, I have to put in the work to stay the way I am now.\u201d Even lower amyloid levels and a larger hippocampus It appears Nicholls is well on his way toward that goal. In March, his APS2 score had dropped to 25, an unbelievably low number. Not only was Nicholls blood negative for amyloid and tau, the test suggested that his brain amyloid might be normal, with no distinguishable signs of the disease. The only way to definitively prove this, however, would be to repeat his amyloid PET scan, Isaacson said. \u201cWhat really drove his score down was the amyloid value,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cIt normalized at .101, which is like crazy good. That\u2019s not matter for discussion; for amyloid, .1 or above is normal.\u201d Even more startling: Brain volume scans showed that the hippocampus, the tiny seahorse-shaped organ responsible for memory, had actually grown in volume in Nicholls\u2019 brain since he started the intervention. In early Alzheimer\u2019s stages, the hippocampus loses tissue rapidly and then atrophies as the disease progresses. Despite these amazing outcomes, Isaacson remains cautious. After all, this is one person, and similar findings have not been been replicated in a larger, more controlled sample and published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the term \u2018reverse\u2019 because I don\u2019t know what will happen if the person stops doing the intervention,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cI also don\u2019t know if the brain might normalize for a short period of time and then, five years later, catch up. Until I have more data, I don\u2019t think that reverse is the right word.\u201d That doesn\u2019t stop his wonder at the results and his gratitude to Nicholls for his continuing dedication to the study and the personalized interventions. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d seen this before, but only in people who are taking anti-amyloid medications,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen you work your entire career and are told by everyone, \u2018It\u2019s not possible to do this,\u2019 and then you see it \u2014 well, I\u2019m still humbled and amazed.\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s and brain health resources", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/health/alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added. Other finds at the site, which sits on the slope of a valley, include buildings, pits, ditches and a road that archaeologists dated to the late 5th and early 6th centuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/europe/horses-remains-graves-france-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_01_09_health_live-longer-diet-wellness", "text": "You can reduce your risk of an early death for any reason by nearly 20%, just by eating more foods from your choice of four healthy eating patterns, according to a new study. People who more carefully followed any of the healthy eating patterns \u2014 which all share a focus on consuming more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes \u2014 were also less likely to die from cancer, cardiovascular illness, and respiratory and neurodegenerative disease.  The results of the study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, show \u201cthere is more than one way to eat well and derive the attendant health benefits,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a lifestyle medicine specialist who was not involved in the study. People often get bored with one way of eating, study coauthor Dr. Frank Hu said, \u201cso this is good news. It means that we have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating our own healthy dietary patterns that can be tailored to individual food preferences, health conditions and cultures. \u201cFor example, if you are eating healthy Mediterranean, and after a few months you want to try something different, you can switch to a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet or you can switch to a semi-vegetarian diet,\u201d said Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology and chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cOr you can follow US dietary guidelines and create your own healthy eating plate.\u201d A long-term study The study followed the eating habits of 75,000 women participating in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and more than 44,000 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study over 36 years. None of the men and women had cardiovascular disease at the start of the study, and few were smokers. All filled out eating questionnaires every four years. \u201cThis is one of the largest and longest-running cohort studies to examine recommended dietary patterns and the long-term risk of premature deaths and deaths from major diseases,\u201d Hu said. Hu and his team scored participants on how closely they followed four healthy eating styles that are in sync with current US dietary guidelines.  One is the Mediterranean diet, which stresses eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish and a high amount of olive oil, Hu said. \u201cThis dietary pattern emphasizes healthy fats, especially monounsaturated fat, in addition to plant-based foods and moderate alcohol,\u201d he said. The next is called the healthful plant-based diet, which also focuses on eating more plant products but gives negative points for all animal products and any alcohol. \u201cIt even discourages relatively healthy options, like fish or some dairy products,\u201d Hu said, adding that the eating plan frowns on unhealthy plant-based foods such as potato products. \u201cSo you can imagine that vegetarians are probably on the higher end of this diet score,\u201d he said, \u201cand people who eat a lot of animal products or highly processed carbohydrate foods would be at the lower end of this score.\u201d The Healthy Eating Index tracks whether people follow basic US nutritional guidelines, which stress healthy, plant-based foods, frown on red and processed meat, and discourage eating added sugar, unhealthy fats and alcohol, Hu said. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index was developed at Harvard, Hu said, and uses the \u201cbest available evidence\u201d to include foods and nutrients most strongly associated with a lower risk of chronic disease. \u201cWe explicitly included nuts, seeds, whole grains and lower consumption of red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages,\u201d he added. \u201cA moderate consumption of alcohol is allowed.\u201d  Findings by disease After each person\u2019s eating pattern was scored, the participants were divided into five groups, or quintiles, from highest to lowest adherence to one or more of the eating patterns.  \u201cThe highest quintile of diet quality as compared to the lowest was associated with a roughly 20% reduction in all-cause mortality,\u201d said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. The study also found reductions in risk of death from certain chronic diseases if people improved their diet over time, Hu said. Participants who improved the health of their diet by 25% could reduce their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by a range of 6% to 13% and dying from cancer by 7% to 18%, he said. There was up to a 7% reduction in risk of death by neurodegenerative disease, such as dementia. \u201cRespiratory disease mortality reduction was actually much greater, reducing risk by 35% to 46%,\u201d Hu said. The study relied on participants\u2019 self-reports of food preferences and therefore only showed an association, not a direct cause and effect, between eating habits and health outcomes. Still, the fact that the study asked about diets every four years over such a long time frame added weight to the findings, Hu said. What is the takeaway of this large, long-term study? \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to adopt healthy eating patterns, and the benefits of eating a healthy diet can be substantial in terms of reducing total premature deaths and different causes of premature death,\u201d Hu said. \u201cPeople also have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating their own healthy dietary pattern. But the common principles \u2014 eating more-plant based foods and fewer servings of red meat, processed meats, added sugar and sodium \u2014 should be there, no matter what kind of diet that you want to create.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/01/09/health/live-longer-diet-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_health_sedentary-tv-aging-wellness", "text": "Swapping out time in front of the TV for physical activity might not sound like the most fun trade, but it is associated with significantly better chances of healthy aging, according to a new study. \u201cOur take-home message is that replacing TV time with light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sleep (for participants with inadequate sleep) is beneficial to healthy aging,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Molin Wang, associate professor of medicine in the department of epidemiology at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The results are not surprising, as many studies show that sedentary behaviors have significant impacts on health, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Freeman was not involved in this study. For this study, researchers analyzed data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study of more than 45,000 people age 50 or older in 1992 who were also free of chronic disease, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Researchers followed up for 20 years for information on people\u2019s time sitting at work, home and watching television and their hours standing or walking at home and work. That data was analyzed with data on their aging. Healthy aging was defined as living to at least 70 years old and maintaining at least four healthy domains \u2014 such as no major chronic disease and no impairment in subjective memory, physical health and mental health, the study said. Each additional two hours of sitting to watch TV was associated with a 12% decrease in the chances of aging in a healthy way, the study showed. On the other hand, adding two hours of light physical activity at work added a 6% increase in the odds of healthy aging. Replacing one hour of sitting to watch TV with light physical activity at home or work was associated with better chances of healthy aging, the study showed. \u201cVegging out in front of the television, seems to always be associated with worse outcomes,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cOf course, it makes physiologic sense that human beings were never meant to sit in front of a screen all day long.\u201d \u201cThe more we sit, the more problems we get, particularly as we get older,\u201d he added. Why is sitting so bad? A 2017 study showed a relationship between time spent sitting and early death from any cause. And sedentary time as a kid may increase the risk of heart disease later in life, according to 2023 research. The problem is particularly bad when eating a very large amount of salt, which is typical in an American diet, without getting enough movement to circulate fluid, he added. These often unhealthy habits go together. \u201cWhen people sit in front of TV, it usually brings all these other comorbid activities, like eating junk food, TV dinners, failing to connect with others, and it even can interrupt sleep,\u201d Freeman said. Time spent seated at a desk or on the living room couch also takes away opportunities to get out and be active. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on all that physical activity, which is truly an unbelievable way to reduce cardiovascular risk and blood pressure,\u201d Freeman said. How to kick out the sedentary behavior If you work eight, 10 or even 12 hours a day in an office, it might feel difficult to get more movement into your day. \u201cMy very strong suggestion is you should consider at work getting a standing desk if you can, or even a treadmill desk if you\u2019re able and you have the space,\u201d Freeman said. If that is not a possibility, things like getting up often or having walking meetings can help, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting down for more than 30 minutes at a time, in my book, that\u2019s probably too long, and you really want to try to move a little bit,\u201d Freeman added. You don\u2019t have to outlaw sitting or watching TV, however. Maybe try pairing TV with healthy behaviors such as watching while moving or eating a nutritious snack, he said. Or better yet, set limits for yourself. \u201cThere are all these great tools and apps available \u2026 and a lot of people see those as tools for kids, but the truth is, they\u2019re just as good as for adults,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIt lets you keep track of how much screen time you have and then how much activity you have all on the same device, which is kind of neat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/sedentary-tv-aging-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_03_25_health_mifepristone-abortion-pill-explained", "text": "Mifepristone can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor after the US Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit that challenged regulation of the abortion pill. Mifepristone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration decades ago and has been shown to be safe and effective. Anti-abortion advocates have claimed that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn\u2019t study it enough to approve it. A lawsuit was brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations alleged that the FDA violated the law in\u00a0how it regulated mifepristone. If a 5th\u00a0Circuit ruling had been upheld, it could have ended availability of mifepristone for medication abortion via telehealth, which would have affected abortion access \u2014 even in states where it\u2019s legal. The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. The court\u2019s reasoning could still allow other mifepristone challenges in the future. How mifepristone works Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery. Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it\u2019s sometimes known as RU-486. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period. This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show. How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country\u2019s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, that signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the FDA. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone\u2019s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show. Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra \u2013 used to treat erectile dysfunction \u2013 is nearly 10 times higher. Side effects of mifepristone Mifepristone usually doesn\u2019t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA. Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are \u201cexceedingly rare,\u201d happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations\u2019 amicus brief. How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, shows that this option has become steadily more common over the two decades it\u2019s been available, rising from less than 10% of all abortions in the US in 2001 to 53% in 2020 and 63% in 2023. Misoprostol on its own No matter the status of mifepristone,\u00a0misoprostol would still be available\u00a0and could be used for a medication abortion on its own. The only use of misoprostol that\u2019s approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it \u201coff-label\u201d by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor. Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a \u201creasonable\u201d option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective. This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization. People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, previously told CNN. \u201cMisoprostol still works very well and is very safe,\u201d Wong said. \u201cMifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.\u201d CNN\u2019s Devan Cole and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/25/health/mifepristone-abortion-pill-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and the (levels of xylitol) went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d as the xylitol levels did, said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products. The February 2023 erythritol in study found the risk of heart attack and stroke nearly doubled within three years when people had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood. For the new study on xylitol, the results were basically the same \u2014 people with the highest levels of xylitol compared to those with the lowest levels had nearly twice the risk of heart attack, stroke and death, Hazen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a receptor on our platelets, which we as yet don\u2019t understand, that is recognizing this molecule and signaling to the platelet to be more prone to clot,\u201d he said. \u201cOur tastebuds can\u2019t tell the difference in the structures between sugar and these other sweeteners, but clearly our platelets can.\u201d The World Health Organization warned consumers in 2023 to avoid artificial sweeteners for weight loss, and has called for additional research on the long-term toxicity of low- and no-calorie sweeteners, the study said. \u201cThrough their work, the investigators have shined a light on the safety of sugar substitutes. There is more to learn,\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s Tomey said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is worth remembering that sugar substitutes are no substitute for a sincere commitment to the several elements of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_health_men-sexual-health-wellness", "text": "Guys, let\u2019s talk man to man. We often obsess over sex and our performance, but how many take steps to ensure we\u2019re in top shape for the long haul? If we don\u2019t take care of our health today, we won\u2019t enjoy a healthy sex life tomorrow. It\u2019s crucial to think about your sexual health to avoid regrets in the future. Future-proofing yourself is key. Sexual health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Chronic stress, poor diet, lack of exercise and other lifestyle factors can significantly affect your sexual health. If you\u2019re experiencing persistent problems, don\u2019t hesitate to speak with a doctor. Early intervention can prevent minor issues from becoming significant obstacles. Seeking help is a sign of strength, and a health care professional can provide the guidance and treatment options you need for a lifetime of good sexual function. The effects of high stress Whether as a result of personal problems or trouble at work, chronic stress is a major contributor to reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. With stress, the body produces elevated levels of cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production. Studies\u00a0have shown that men with emotional problems or stress are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction in the form of either premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction and/or low sexual desire. It\u2019s crucial to incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine: regular exercise, meditation, proper sleep and hobbies that you enjoy. Seeking professional help from a therapist can also provide effective coping strategies. What you eat Poor eating habits can lead to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular issues, all of which can adversely affect sexual function. Research indicates that men with a waist circumference over 40 inches are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome, which is linked to erectile dysfunction. Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains can make a substantial difference. Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding ultraprocessed foods can further enhance your sexual health. (To put it simply, the more fast food you eat, the faster you will lose your sex life.) How you move Lack of physical activity is detrimental to heart health, which is crucial for maintaining sexual function. Regular exercise helps improve blood flow, which is essential for achieving and maintaining an erection. Studies suggest that men who exercise regularly report improved erectile function compared with inactive men. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, along with strength training exercises, to keep your body in top shape. The more you exercise at the gym, the more exercise you will get in the bedroom. If you smoke Smoking is a leading cause of erectile dysfunction due to its negative impact on blood vessels and blood flow. The toxins in cigarettes can damage the lining of blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the penis. Research shows that men who smoke are about twice\u00a0as likely to develop erectile dysfunction as nonsmokers. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your sexual health. Consider resources such as nicotine replacement therapy, support groups and counseling to help you quit. How you sleep Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, can severely affect testosterone levels and lead to sexual dysfunction. A study found that men with severe sleep apnea had significantly lower testosterone levels compared with those without the condition. Prioritizing good sleep hygiene is essential. If you suspect a sleep disorder, consult a health care provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, which may include lifestyle changes or medical interventions. Mental health issues Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety can have a profound impact on sexual desire and performance. About 20% of patients with anxiety and up to 40% of men with depression report experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction. Mental health conditions can lead to a decrease in libido and difficulties in achieving or maintaining an erection. Seeking help from mental health professionals can be highly beneficial. Therapy and medication can significantly improve both mental health and sexual function. Hormonal imbalances Hormonal imbalances, particularly low testosterone, can negatively affect sexual health. Testosterone levels naturally decline with age, but conditions such as hypogonadism can accelerate this process. Studies suggest that about 20% of men over the age of 60 have low testosterone levels. Regular checkups with a health care provider can help monitor hormone levels. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications or hormone replacement therapy to restore balance. Side effects of certain medications Certain medications, including those for hypertension and depression, can cause sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Beta-blockers, for example, can decrease libido and lead to erectile issues. It\u2019s important to discuss potential side effects with your doctor. They may adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication that has fewer effects on sexual health. Chronic illness Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease can significantly affect sexual function. Diabetic men, for instance, are three times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction compared with nondiabetic men. Managing chronic illnesses effectively with the help of a health care provider is crucial. Doing so includes following prescribed treatments, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and monitoring yourself regularly to keep conditions under control. Relationship issues Problems within a relationship can cause stress and decreased sexual desire. Communication breakdowns, unresolved conflicts and lack of intimacy can all contribute to sexual dysfunction. Open communication with your partner is key to addressing these issues. Consider couples counseling to help resolve underlying problems and improve your relationship and sexual health. Conclusion Guys, taking care of your sexual health isn\u2019t just about avoiding problems today; it\u2019s about ensuring you\u2019re ready for action tomorrow and beyond. Think about it \u2014 how many times have you stressed over performance but ignored the basics that keep you in the game? It\u2019s time to make a change. Managing stress, eating right, staying active and kicking bad habits such as smoking are the foundation of a healthy sex life. These aren\u2019t just empty words \u2014 they\u2019re steps you can take now to ensure you\u2019re not sidelined later. And if you\u2019re dealing with persistent issues, don\u2019t tough it out alone. Talking to a doctor isn\u2019t admitting defeat; it\u2019s making a smart play. There\u2019s no better time to focus on your well-being than during National Men\u2019s Health Month in June. It\u2019s dedicated to encouraging men to take control of their health and make the necessary changes to improve their lives. Use this opportunity to schedule that checkup you\u2019ve been putting off, start a new exercise routine or seek help for any health issues you\u2019ve been ignoring. You\u2019ve got one body and one life \u2014 make sure both are in peak condition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/health/men-sexual-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_plant-based-junk-food-study-wellness", "text": "Want to reduce your risk of developing chronic disease and live longer while also helping the planet? Eat a plant-based diet, experts say. Does that mean you can fill your plate with boxed macaroni and cheese, deep-dish frozen veggie pizza or fast-food French fries and have a doughnut or three for dessert? While all of those ultraprocessed choices may be meat-free, they are not without risk, said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston Medical School in Birmingham, United Kingdom. \u201cWe can\u2019t always assume plant-based means healthy, as after all sugar is plant-based,\u201d Mellor said in a statement. \u201cMany foods that do not contain animal products, which includes biscuits, crisps, confectionary and soft drinks, are technically plant-based but would not be considered essential as part of a healthy diet by the majority of people.\u201d In fact, eating such plant-based junk foods dramatically raises bad cholesterol and hypertension and can lead to associated heart disease and early death, according to a new study authors call \u201cthe first\u201d to show ultraprocessed plant foods are associated with an increase in the risk of cardiovascular diseases. \u201cEating plant-based products can be beneficial, acting as protection against health problems, or it can represent a risk \u2014 it all depends on the level of processing of these foods,\u201d said senior study author Renata Levy, a researcher in the Epidemiological Research Center in Nutrition and Health at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, known as Nupens/USP, in Brazil. Ultraprocessed foods undergo multiple industrial processes, such as heating, fracking of nutrients and proteins, molding and compression, and have added chemicals to cosmetically alter color, smell, taste and texture. Foods in this category are formulated to be hyper-palatable to human taste buds and are often extremely convenient, requiring little to no preparation time. Unprocessed foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs and milk.\u00a0Minimally processed foods\u00a0include culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils, and foods such as canned goods and frozen vegetables that combine culinary ingredients with unprocessed foods. \u201cFood additives and industrial contaminants present in these foods might cause oxidative stress and inflammation, further aggravating the risks,\u201d said first author Fernanda Rauber, a researcher with Nupens/USP. \u201cTherefore, our results support the shift towards plant-based food choices that consider the degree of processing to improve cardiovascular health outcomes,\u201d Rauber said in a statement. Eat fresh and frozen minimally processed plants The study, published Monday in the journal The Lancet Regional Health \u2014 Europe, utilized data collected from the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study that includes participants from England, Scotland and Wales. More than 118,000 people between the ages of 40 and 69 years answered questions about their diet. That information was later linked to hospital and mortality records on the development of cardiovascular risk factors. Ultraprocessed foods made from plants increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by 5% while increasing the risk of early death by 13%, the study found. Researchers also found that each 10% replacement of plant-based ultraprocessed foods with fresh, frozen or minimally processed plants lowered the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 7% while offering a 13% reduction in the risk of dying from heart disease. The study also looked at plant-based meat products, such as sausages, nuggets and burgers, which by their very nature fall into the ultraprocessed bucket. However, it was hard to determine just how much risk those foods carried, said Peter Scarborough, a professor of population health at the University of Oxford in the UK. He was not involved in the study. \u201cPlant-based meat alternatives make up only 0.5% of all the plant-based ultraprocessed foods included in this paper,\u201d Scarborough said in a statement. Over half of the plant-based ultraprocessed foods studied in the paper were packaged breads, pastries, buns, cakes and cookies. \u201cIt is therefore very difficult to conclude from this paper that plant-based meat alternatives are bad for your health,\u201d Scarborough added. In addition, much of what is reported in the paper is already known, said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt is well accepted that well-balanced plant-based diets such as the Mediterranean or DASH diets are favorable for cardiovascular health and these already emphasize avoiding unhealthy foods such as crisps etc., sugar sweetened beverages, cakes, biscuits and confectionary,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThese latter foods are unhealthy regardless of whether they are made industrially or home-made.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/plant-based-junk-food-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_fauci-memoir-gupta-interview", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards wear you down.\u201d That phrase, instilled in Dr. Anthony Fauci when he was a student at the Jesuit-run Regis High School in New York City, might as well be the motto of his professional life. Even though he chose a career centered in science, medicine and public health, controversy has always had a way of finding him, even as he tried to make it constructive. Fauci chronicles many such moments in his new memoir, \u201cOn Call: A Doctor\u2019s Journey in Public Service.\u201d Fauci was in the public eye for decades as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, but he became a veritable household name at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was charged with monitoring and mitigating the spread of the virus. Fauci spoke frequently to the worried and bewildered American public at government news conferences, giving status updates and offering guidance on face masks, social distancing, school closures, hospitalization rates and, eventually, vaccines. Many credit him with helping the country navigate the uncharted waters of the coronavirus crisis with his medical expertise, calm demeanor and signature Brooklyn-tinged gravelly voice. At the same time, Fauci was navigating his own political headwinds \u2013 some from his boss, former President Donald Trump, who tried to play down the threat of SARS-CoV-2 even as he initiated Operation Warp Speed, the $10 billion-plus public-private partnership focused on rapidly developing vaccines as well as therapeutics. Speaking to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Fauci described how \u201cpainful\u201d it was at one point to correct Trump about hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19 during a news conference early in the pandemic, a move that upset some of the President\u2019s aides. But Trump\u2019s attention was elsewhere, Fauci said: When he called the doctor to his office, the President surprised him by talking about how many people were watching the news conferences. As the pandemic continued, many coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and antivaxxers blamed Fauci personally for struggles with school closures, mask mandates and vaccine recommendations. Even now, Fauci recently testified, he still faces death threats. The pandemic was not the first time Fauci found himself in the center of a political and medical maelstrom. He was in the hot seat during the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s, when his agency spearheaded the effort to fight the widening epidemic. HIV/AIDS activists called him and the entire medical establishment out for not doing enough or moving quickly enough to help people infected with the virus. Yet throughout his career, Fauci seems to have taken public criticism in stride and used it, even, to build something better. It was an attitude he learned in childhood. \u201cThe Jesuit priests, when you thought that all of a sudden the whole world was pounding on you, they would say \u2018Illegitimi non carborundum,\u2019 which means \u2018don\u2019t let the bastards wear you down,\u2019 which \u2026 lately, that is a very relevant and appropriate saying,\u201d Fauci told Gupta. \u201cThey don\u2019t get me down to the point of interfering with what my work is, but it does wear and tear on you,\u201d he added. Fauci recently sat down for a conversation with Gupta \u2014 one of the many they have shared over the years \u2014 to discuss his life\u2019s work and his legacy. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. (Listen to more of the conversation on the podcast \u201cChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\u201d here.) Dr. Sanjay Gupta: You talk about this interesting press briefing that you did. This is in March of 2020.\u00a0And you had to correct the record, even if the President was talking. How challenging is that? Dr. Anthony Fauci: I said to myself, \u201cI have a responsibility to preserve my own personal integrity and a responsibility to the American public.\u201d\u00a0\u2026 So when I walked up to the podium, I said, \u201cHere it goes!\u201d That was painful to me, to have to do that, but there was no doubt that I had to do it. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cWell, maybe you should, and maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d There was no doubt that I had to do it, because I would actually be just relinquishing my responsibility. And what happened is that the President was less upset about that than the people around him, who really got upset. But then he called me in his office once when he wanted to ask me another question, and he was looking at three different televisions, and he says, \u201cMy God, these ratings are amazing. They\u2019re better than cable; they\u2019re better than network.\u201d The President \u2014 it\u2019s no secret. I\u2019m not divulging a secret about the President \u2014 he was very, very fixated on image and ratings. And he thought that the amount of attention that was given to the press briefings was really terrific. And his comment was, \u201cWow, do you see those ratings?\u201d And my feeling was, \u201cThe ratings are in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d Gupta: I want to talk about the 54 years of public service \u2014 almost 40 years, as you say, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Go back to June 5, 1981. That was a date you really talked a lot about in the book. What\u2019s the significance of that? Fauci: I was in my office in the clinical center at the NIH, and I read the June 5 [issue of the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which described five cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among five gay men in LA] and I looked at it and I said, \u201cGosh, what a curiosity. This is strange that they\u2019re all gay men.\u201d But maybe there was talk about using poppers or drugs to enhance your sexual experience that maybe somehow had the collateral effect of suppressing their immune system. But it bothered me. Boy, you really have got to suppress the immune system a lot to get pneumocystis [a serious lung infection caused by a common fungus]. \u2026 So I put it aside, saying \u201cit\u2019s probably a fluke, and it\u2019s just going to disappear.\u201d The real transforming thing came one month later, in July of 1981, when the second MMWR came; this time, 26 \u2014 curiously \u2014 all young, otherwise healthy gay men, not only from L.A. but from San Francisco and New York City, who presented not only with pneumocystis but with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and multiple other opportunistic infections. I can say \u2014 retrospectively, when you try to evaluate the different landmarks in your life, in your career \u2014 reading that MMWR totally transformed my professional career because I made the decision right there, even though I had a very successful career up to that point \u2026 I said, \u201cthis is a brand new disease. \u00a0And even though I don\u2019t know what it is, there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s an infection. \u2026 And it seems to be destroying the immune system.\u201d And here I am: boards in internal medicine, boards in infectious diseases, boards in clinical immunology. I said, \u201cIf there\u2019s one disease that I have to study, is this disease.\u201d Gupta: I don\u2019t think many people who sort of know you from Covid realize that in many ways, you went through some of these same challenges before with HIV/AIDS. Not just new disease, trying to find new therapeutics, but the activists. What was that part of your life like? Fauci: Well, naturally, people ask about the difference or similarity between the pushing back against me and the government in HIV and pushing back against the government and me as the face of Covid. \u2026 It is as different as peanuts and watermelons. It just is very different because the [HIV/AIDS] activists were trying to get the attention of the authorities, the scientific authorities and the regulatory authorities, that the time-proven way of approaching the development of interventions for a new disease doesn\u2019t work well for a disease that\u2019s rapidly killing themselves and their friends and their loved ones. So they wanted a seat at the table. \u2026 So their confrontation to us was based on a good thing. I think back to John Lewis\u2019 \u201cgood trouble\u201d versus bad trouble. They made good trouble for us because they wanted us to just put ourselves in their shoes. \u2026 Again, one of the best things I did in my career was to, instead of running away from them the way most of the scientific community did \u2026 I said to myself, \u201cThis can\u2019t work, so let me put aside the theatrics and the disruption and listen to what they have to say.\u201d And what they had to say made absolutely perfect sense to me. And I said to myself, \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I would be doing exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d That\u2019s when I invited them in to sit down with us and said \u201clet\u2019s start talking.\u201d \u2026 It became such that they became an important part of the community scientific effort to address HIV with therapeutics, with prevention, with regulation, to the point now where they\u2019re on all of our advisory committees. They\u2019re part of the discussion. And quite frankly, many of them turned out to be some of my closest friends. Gupta: But just to punctuate this point, though, at that time, going back 40 years, did you feel that way, the way you\u2019re describing it now? I mean, this idea that, \u201cHey, look, there might be something to be gained from these confrontations\u201d? Fauci: The thing that drove me was empathy, which has been something that has driven my motivation about medicine and about anything that I\u2019ve done, that goes back to my family, that I describe in the book: my parents and my training in the Jesuit schools. There\u2019s empathy for people who are in trouble and people who are suffering. When you combine empathy with listening to them \u2014 just forget the screaming and the yelling. Just listen to what they\u2019re saying. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, it just made perfect sense to me. So my interaction and my response to them, as I often get asked, is dramatically different than someone, on the basis of no evidence, accuses you of killing people or that scene of Marjorie Taylor Greene at the hearing. I mean, come on. That is nothing like what the [HIV] activists were doing. Gupta: What do you want your legacy to be? How do you want people to reflect on Dr. Anthony Fauci? Fauci: I\u2019ve thought about that, and when I think about legacies \u2014 I really, honestly mean this \u2014 I will leave that to other people to decide. I know what I\u2019ve done \u2026 with the development of drugs for HIV, with the development of the vaccine for Covid. I know that, but that\u2019s not [for me to] say, \u201cI want my legacy to be this,\u201d because people are going to have different interpretations of that \u2026 But what I would want my legacy to be, something that I am certain of, is that I have given it 100% every single day. And in the sports analogy, I can say I always left it on the field or left it on the court \u2026 I never held back. I just gave everything I could for the discipline I\u2019m in, which is science, medicine and public health. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like my legacy to be.

{"id": "2024_05_25_world_solar-magnetic-field-science-newsletter-wt-scn", "text": "I was lucky enough to catch an awesome glimpse of the northern lights\u00a0from my own home this month when the biggest solar storm to reach Earth in two decades made auroras visible at latitudes much farther south\u00a0than usual. Despite living in the light-filled streets of central London, my smartphone camera picked up a green haze and a pulsing sheet of purple and pink light. Capturing the moment was an unforgettable experience and one that I had thought would involve expensive travel to the northernmost reaches of our planet. The storms that create spectacular auroras such as those I witnessed originate from the sun\u2019s dynamic magnetic field, an astrophysical enigma that scientists this week came closer to unraveling. Solar update Figuring out how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works will help scientists improve the forecasting of space weather, which dazzles night sky watchers but can disrupt GPS and communication satellites. The sun\u2019s looping magnetic field lines, which form a tangled web of structures more complex than those on Earth, are difficult to study directly. To grasp what\u2019s going on, scientists create mathematical models. A new model, which took more than a decade to develop and required a NASA supercomputer to conduct the detailed calculations, found that the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated much closer to the surface than previously thought. The team believes its model is more accurate because it accounts for a unique solar feature. A long time ago A single gold earring found in the ruins of a 2,000-year-old building in the Pyrenees is a clue to how a devastating fire may have started. The inferno consumed the wooden structure, situated in an Iron Age settlement called Tossal de Baltarga, and killed six animals penned in a stable. Archaeologists believe the fire was deliberate. Had it been accidental, the building\u2019s owners likely would have released the livestock and returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden gold, which was concealed in a jar. The arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic, according to the new study. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but the excavation uncovered telling details of the lives of an Iberian people called the Cerretani. Sky watch The builders of Stonehenge placed the huge stones that make up the prehistoric monument in line with sunrise and sunset on the longest and shortest days of the year, revealing an intimate understanding of the sun that\u2019s still palpable today. But does the 4,500-year-old site in southwest England \u2014 and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world \u2014 also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge has a lunar link first gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored \u2014 until now. This summer, archaeologists are using the lunar standstill, a little-known phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years, to investigate. Across the universe Space scientists have observed the edge of a black hole \u2014 an area known as the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 for the first time. Andrew Mummery, lead author of a new study on black holes and a research fellow at the University of Oxford, compared it to \u201cthe edge of a waterfall\u201d at the end of a river, where orbiting material from nearby stars plummets into the abyss. In the plunging region, matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead hurtles into the black hole. But unlike at the black hole\u2019s event horizon, or surface, light can still escape at this point. The study\u2019s findings, which Albert Einstein predicted, could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes. Wild kingdom Corvids \u2014 the group of birds that includes crows, ravens and jays \u2014 are famously smart. One corvid species may even be capable of something researchers refer to as \u201cmental time travel.\u201d This type of recollection enables the mind to recall a seemingly unimportant bit of information that you didn\u2019t consciously commit to memory \u2014 for instance, remembering what you had for lunch yesterday. Researchers working with Eurasian jays trained to find food hidden under cups said these birds may be capable of the feat of memory. In the experiment, which involved decorated cups, the jays were able to remember what a particular cup looked like, even after the cups were rearranged and a time delay. And in other corvid news, crows can count up to four, the latest research has found. Explorations Dive into these mind-expanding stories. \u2014 Thomas Midgley Jr. was a gifted American inventor who made a lasting mark on history.

{"id": "2024_06_11_health_bird-flu-animals-humans", "text": "Mark Naniot remembers 2022 as the summer from hell. As the co-founder of Wild Instincts animal rescue in Wisconsin\u2019s Northwoods, Naniot and his team spent the season sweating in gloves, gowns, smocks and masks and going through what felt like endless rounds of disinfection as they moved between the cages of the sick and injured animals they cared for. The precautions were necessary for a trio of infectious diseases occurring with some frequency in wild animals that summer: Covid-19 was still making life difficult, and a devastating contagion called chronic wasting disease was showing up in deer in the area. Then, there was H5N1 bird flu to contend with.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s highly, highly transmissible,\u201d said Naniot, who has been involved in animal rescue for 35 years. Since it was first discovered in birds in 1996, H5N1 has shown itself to be a Swiss Army Knife of a virus, evolving the necessary tools to break into the cells of a growing list of species.\u00a0So far, it has infected and killed millions of wild and farmed birds.\u00a0It\u2019s also been found in at least 26 different kinds of mammals, including, most recently in the United States \u2014 cows, cats and house mice. The voraciousness of the virus prompted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization in April to call it \u201ca global zoonotic animal pandemic.\u201d Along the way, people have been a kind of collateral damage. Humans can be infected, but we aren\u2019t really the intended targets. That could all change quickly, however. \u201cInfluenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors don\u2019t always work in favor of the virus.\u00a0Most of the time, viruses with errors won\u2019t work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive.\u00a0But every once in a while, a random error can result in a change to the virus that give it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow. If humans happen to be that environment, and H5N1 changes at the right place at the right time, suddenly the animal pandemic could become a major problem for people, too. Naniot had seen wild birds come into Wild Instincts rescue with H5N1 \u2014 bald eagles, hawks and owls \u2014 but nothing had prepared him for the red fox kits. The baby foxes were brought in stumbling and uncoordinated, making him think they might have gotten into some kind of poison. Then the seizures started. \u201cThey would have these severe, severe seizures,\u201d Naniot said. \u201cScreaming very loud, whole-body tremors.\u201d The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. \u201cAnd then it would get longer and longer and longer,\u201d he said. Naniot hadn\u2019t known his young patients could get bird flu. Further research clued him in to the fact that foxes had recently joined a growing list of species that could succumb, usually after eating the flesh of infected dead birds. \u201cThe severity of the seizures is something I really hadn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Naniot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad thing to see, the progression of the disease.\u201d Risks to humans Though H5N1 is known to have infected nearly 900 people in the past 30 years, these infections have been sporadic and usually self-limiting. The virus can still be deadly, however: More than 50% of people who are known to have been infected with H5N1 have died. Still, the virus isn\u2019t particularly good at infecting humans. Even when virus manages to get into a person and cause symptoms, it rarely gets passed to someone else. \u201cWe call these dead-end infections,\u201d said Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinarian and expert in zoonotic infections, at the University of Guelph in Canada. The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in.\u00a0 But it is not a virus that\u2019s well-adapted to humans, so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions \u2014 the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs \u2014 which would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath. There have been at least three of these have apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who worked closely with infected milk cows.\u00a0Two of the workers developed conjunctivitis, or eye infections.  In one case, the worker reported getting splashed with raw milk in their eyes. A third developed respiratory symptoms after close contact with cows.\u00a0All were successfully treated with an antiviral medication.\u00a0None developed severe symptoms or infected others. Using a strain of H5N1 from the recent cattle outbreak, scientists recently confirmed that this version of the virus is unlikely to transmit through the air. In experiments with ferrets, which are considered the gold standard for studying how viruses transmit in people, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew a sample of the same H5N1 virus taken from a farmworker with the flu in Texas to experimentally infect six of the animals.\u00a0Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals.\u00a0These animals could touch, nose and lick the sick animals, and all of them became ill. Next, the CDC tested airborne transmission by putting three healthy ferrets into an enclosure where they could breathe the same air as sick animals but couldn\u2019t touch them.\u00a0 Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. So far, that seems to be what\u2019s happening in the real world, too.\u00a0 Though more than 80 dairy herds have tested positive across at least 12 states, the number of human infections has apparently been low, though there\u2019s been little testing to confirm that. These early ferret experiments are good news, the CDC noted, because it means the virus would need to change to become an infection spread person-to-person through the airborne droplets. The agency said it plans to repeat the tests. As Covid has shown, all of this could change in the the rub of an eye or a small cough. The more opportunity the virus has to spread, the more opportunity it has to change in ways that will help it pry its way into human cells. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand everything we know today is a snapshot of today, and these viruses can change very quickly,\u201d said Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and former director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the Chasing Life podcast. \u201cThey can adapt, and they can spread very easily when they do change,\u201d said Bright, who is now CEO of Bright Global Health.  Dr. Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says that while humans have been exposed to seasonal strains of the flu, and flu vaccines help build immunity H1 and H3 flu strains, H5N1 would look pretty different to our bodies. \u201cOur existing immunity to H3 and H1 is not necessarily going to protect us against exposure to an H5 virus,\u201d she said. The CDC\u2019s ferret study also had some sobering findings.\u00a0 In contrast to seasonal flu, which makes ferrets sick, but doesn\u2019t kill them, H5N1 killed all the ferrets that were infected. \u201cWhile the three cases of A(H5N1) in the United States have been mild, it is possible that there will be serious illnesses among people,\u201d the CDC wrote in its conclusions on the study. In the more than two dozen human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide since 2022, with the most recent iteration of the virus, there\u2019s been a wide spectrum of severity.\u00a0Fourteen illnesses were severe or critical, seven were fatal, six were mild and eight didn\u2019t have any symptoms at all, according to the CDC. Dr. Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist and immunologist at Emory University who specializes in the flu, thinks the difference in symptom severity may be due to previous exposure to seasonal viruses. Her experiments in ferrets suggest that our bodies wouldn\u2019t necessarily be totally defenseless.\u00a0 In her lab, ferrets with previous exposures to seasonal flu strains didn\u2019t get as sick when exposed to new flu viruses compared to those with no prior exposure to seasonal strains.\u00a0 She says she hasn\u2019t tested this with any of the strains involved in the cattle outbreak, however. So while we probably don\u2019t have any antibodies\u00a0\u2014 the immune system\u2019s front-line soldiers \u2014 at the ready to fight off an H5 infection, there are memory cells in our tissues that might recognize parts of a new flu virus and respond. How much help we might get from past exposures to flu viruses is difficult to predict, however, which is why vaccination would still be important to tune up our immunity. Plans to stop the virus from spreading The US has vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, and last month, government officials said 4.8 million doses are being\u00a0\u201cfilled and finished\u201d so they would be ready for use, though there\u2019s no plan to give them to anyone yet. Finland has already ordered 20,000 doses of a different H5 strain \u2014 H5N8 \u2014 which, will be used as soon as they\u2019re available to protect workers who might be vulnerable to the virus, such as scientists and those in direct contact with infected animals\u00a0on mink farms, local\u00a0officials told\u00a0health and science news outlet,\u00a0STAT News. For now, the CDC maintains its assessment that the risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, though people who work with infected animals have a higher risk and should wear protective clothing and take additional precautions to avoid getting sick. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, has made that protective equipment available to states for use on farms, and the USDA has made additional funding available to farms to support efforts to safeguard their livestock from disease. But so far, wearing this equipment is voluntary, and there are concerns that it might be difficult for farm workers to wear the full recommended kit, which includes coveralls, an apron, a mask, eye protection, a head covering, gloves and boots during the summer, which is again expected to break heat records. The government has also said it is working on the development of a rapid test for H5N1. Bright thinks severity of symptoms may depend on how much virus a person is exposed to when they are infected. Touching contaminated milk or the body of a dead bird and then\u00a0rubbing your eyes or nose might deliver a smaller dose of the virus, and ultimately result in milder symptoms. Whereas ingesting large amount of virus \u2014 as some animals do when they scavenge for food or as humans in some countries do when consuming dishes made with duck blood \u2014 could lead to severe disease. \u201cThe virus is able to infect a number of internal organs. So it doesn\u2019t just locate, say, in the lungs, as we would think most influenza viruses would,\u201d Bright said. It\u2019s also been found in \u201cthe brains and then the spleens, the intestines, and the heart and throughout the body of those animals.\u201d Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the WHO\u2019s Collaborating Centre on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s at the top of the list in terms of bad guy viruses,\u201d he said, noting that the virus is nerve-loving, or neurotropic. \u201cSo it goes to the brain and causes very, very severe disease.\u201d Infected animals often behave strangely or aggressively.\u00a0Ducks waddle in circles, twisting their necks, writhing on the ground. \u201cI would hate to see it in humans,\u201d Webby said. So far, the virus hasn\u2019t made the changes that would enable it to become a fully human pathogen, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear whether it ever will. \u201cI\u2019ve been a student of this virus. And I surely have been amazed at how it\u2019s changed over the course of the last 20-some years, but at the same time, you know, I\u2019m looking for evidence that it is likely to become a virus infecting humans and then transmitted by humans to other humans. And we just haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d he added. Naniot at the Wisconsin animal rescue said they tried to save about seven infected fox kits in the summer of 2022, but all of them died. Other rescue organizations in their network had a few foxes infected with H5N1 that survived, but they ultimately went blind. While all the precautions they took to safely work with the animals were arduous, Naniot said he\u2019s grateful they were effective. They never spread the virus to any of the other animals in the facility \u2014 including themselves. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s kind of like when Covid went through, you know, it first started someplace,\u201d he said. Naniot says he hasn\u2019t encountered any infected animals since 2022, but he\u2019s watching the news closely in case any cow herds become infected in Wisconsin, knowing that he could easily see H5N1 again. \u201cIt spread kind of like wildfire, and it\u2019s a highly, highly contagious disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/bird-flu-animals-humans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_health_cdc-adhd-medication-alert", "text": "People taking medications for ADHD, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, may face disruptions in accessing treatment after the arrests of two executives of a telehealth company that distributed such drugs to adults across the United States. On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an official health advisory warning about a \u201cpotential disrupted access to care among individuals taking prescription stimulant medications and possible increased risks for injury and overdose.\u201d Around the same time, the US Department of Justice announced a federal health-care fraud indictment against two executives from the digital health company Done Global, whose website describes it as \u201cmaking high quality psychiatric chronic care management more accessible and affordable for patients.\u201d The indictment\u2019s effect on patients \u201cis unknown at the time,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s advisory. \u201cPatients who rely on prescription stimulant medications to treat their ADHD and have been using this or other similar subscription-based telehealth platforms could experience a disruption to their treatment and disrupted access to care,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cA disruption involving this large telehealth company could impact as many as 30,000 to 50,000 patients ages 18 years and older across all 50 U.S. states.\u201d Ruthia He, the founder and CEO of Done Global Inc., was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday and accused of participating in a scheme to distribute Adderall over the internet, conspire to commit health-care fraud and obstruct justice, according to the Justice Department\u2019s announcement. The company\u2019s clinical president, David Brody, also was arrested in San Rafael, California. The Justice Department claims that He and Brody generated more than $100 million in revenue by arranging for the prescriptions of more than 40 million pills, targeting \u201cdrug seekers\u201d and instructing prescribers to prescribe stimulants to patients even if they didn\u2019t qualify. \u201cAs alleged, these defendants exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and carry out a $100 million scheme to defraud taxpayers and provide easy access to Adderall and other stimulants for no legitimate medical purpose,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news release. \u201cThose seeking to profit from addiction by illegally distributing controlled substances over the internet should know that they cannot hide their crimes and that the Justice Department will hold them accountable.\u201d Naomi Chung, Brody\u2019s attorney, said he had pleaded not guilty to all counts. \u201cDr. Brody worked to promote access to medical treatment for those with ADHD in the face of both widespread stigma and the unprecedented challenges of a global pandemic.\u201d Efforts to reach He or the company were not successful, and CNN has not been able to determine whether He has retained a lawyer because the case docket remains under seal. The arrests mark the Justice Department\u2019s first criminal drug distribution prosecutions related to prescribing via telemedicine through a digital health company, the agency said. If convicted, He and Brody will face a maximum penalty of two decades in prison. Last year, a CDC study found that prescriptions for stimulants often used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder surged during the pandemic, especially among adults. Between 2016 and 2020, the share of the population that had filled a prescription for a stimulant drug held relatively steady. But there was a large increase in 2021, with prescription fills jumping more than 10% across most age groups. The new CDC advisory noted that there is an ongoing prescription drug shortage in the United States involving several stimulant medications commonly prescribed to treat ADHD, a brain disorder that can make it difficult to concentrate or control impulsive behavior. It\u2019s estimated that ADHD affects about 4% of adults and about 10% of children in the US. About one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. \u201cPatients whose care or access to prescription stimulant medications is disrupted, and who seek medication outside of the regulated healthcare system, might significantly increase their risk of overdose due to the prevalence of\u00a0counterfeit pills\u00a0in the illegal drug market that could contain unexpected substances, including\u00a0fentanyl,\u201d according to the CDC advisory. \u201cGiven the national\u00a0drug overdose crisis\u00a0and threats associated with the illegal drug market, individuals struggling to access prescription stimulant medications are urged to avoid using medication obtained from anyone other than a licensed clinician and licensed pharmacy,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cHealth officials and healthcare providers may need to assist affected patients seeking treatment for ADHD and should communicate overdose risks associated with the current illegal drug market as well as provide overdose prevention education and mental health support.\u201d The CDC advisory also warned that without treatment, ADHD is associated with social and emotional impairment and a higher risk of drug or alcohol use disorder, unintentional injuries such as motor vehicle crashes, and suicide. \u201cAs more health care needs are met through telemedicine, we will not tolerate fraud schemes that seek to recklessly exploit digital technologies,\u201d Christi Grimm, inspector general of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in the Justice Department\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect the enrollees of federal health care programs by ensuring that requirements for the appropriate, legal prescribing of stimulants and other drugs are always met, and those who choose to violate them are held accountable.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/cdc-adhd-medication-alert/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Looking back, Tammy Maida, 67, said things started to change in her late 50s. At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_health_summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness", "text": "Welcome to summer in the Northern Hemisphere, with all its fun in the sun \u2013 and little critters who want to take a bite out of you. Mosquitoes and ticks can transmit vector-borne illnesses, and they are showing up with greater frequency. What can people do to protect themselves while still enjoying all that the summer months have to offer? And what treatments are available if you or your loved ones get bit? To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0Let\u2019s start by talking about tick-borne diseases, specifically Lyme disease. What is Lyme, and why is this something people should pay attention to? Dr.\u00a0Leana Wen:\u00a0In the United States,\u00a0Lyme disease is the\u00a0most common vector-borne disease\u00a0and is transmitted by ticks. People who contract Lyme disease may experience temporary symptoms similar to the flu, such as muscle aches, fever and headache. They also may develop a rash and have joint pain. The concern with Lyme is that some untreated patients progress to having long-term symptoms. These can be severe and debilitating and include ongoing nerve pain, facial paralysis and abnormal heart function. CNN: When is peak season for Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0We are in peak season now. In areas where the disease is prevalent such as the eastern United States, people can be bitten by blacklegged ticks that carry Lyme disease from spring into fall, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, there were reports that Lyme diagnoses\u00a0peaked\u00a0just before the Fourth of July holiday. CNN: Has the incidence of Lyme disease increased in recent years? Wen:\u00a0Yes. The rates of Lyme diagnoses have\u00a0doubled\u00a0from 2004 to 2018, with an increase in geographic prevalence, meaning that more areas have a high incidence of this disease compared to before.\u00a0(Newer data show an even more dramatic increase, though\u00a0surveillance methodology\u00a0has improved to capture more diagnoses.)\u00a0There are a variety of theories as to why this is the case. Most are centered on the influence of climate change \u2014 for example, that warmer temperatures expanded the tick habitat and perhaps also sped up tick life cycles. This is the same with other vector-borne diseases, like those carried by mosquitoes, which are also on the rise\u00a0likely due to rising temperatures. CNN: What can people do to reduce their odds of contracting Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0The most important step is to prevent tick bites. If you are in an area known to have Lyme, you should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when hiking. Use insect repellent that contains the ingredient DEET. After the activity, examine carefully for ticks. If you have young children and pets, take the time to examine them as well. If you find a tick, remove it, save it for identification purposes in a small jar and contact your primary care provider.\u00a0Early antibiotic therapy\u00a0can prevent you from developing Lyme disease. Also, if you end up developing symptoms, get tested right away. Antibiotic treatment can reduce the progression to chronic symptoms. CNN:\u00a0What about mosquitoes? What diseases can they carry? Wen:\u00a0Mosquitoes can transmit a lot of diseases to humans including the West Nile virus,\u00a0dengue\u00a0and malaria. West Nile\u00a0is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. While most people with the illness do not become ill, around 1 in 150 infected people develop a serious illness that can be fatal. In 2023,\u00a047 states\u00a0reported West Nile cases. In total, there were 2,406 reported instances in the US. Dengue is another virus transmitted by mosquitoes. Outbreaks are common globally, and occasionally there are cases reported in the US. Most of these cases\u00a0occur in travelers, but the types of mosquitoes that can spread dengue are found throughout many parts of the US. That means local transmission is possible. In recent years, transmission of dengue by people who have no travel history has happened in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. Another infection transmitted by mosquito that is far more common in other parts of the world is malaria. If untreated, symptoms can become severe and\u00a0progress\u00a0to kidney failure, seizures, coma and death. While most US cases involve travelers who contracted malaria from other parts of the world, locally transmitted cases have occurred, too. Last year, there were such cases reported in Florida, Texas and Maryland. CNN: You\u2019ve mentioned the US cases of malaria. What should people do who are traveling to other countries known to have these and other mosquito-borne illnesses? Wen:\u00a0I advise that people consult the\u00a0CDC\u2019s comprehensive guide, which includes recommendations for each destination country, and make an appointment with your primary care physician or travel medical clinic. Depending on where you are going, your planned activities and your personal medical history, you may be recommended to have additional vaccines or prophylactic medications. For instance, if you are going somewhere with a concern for yellow fever, you may need to get that vaccine. If you are traveling to areas with high rates of malaria, you may be recommended to start antimalarial medicines. CNN: What can everyone do to reduce their chance of getting bitten by mosquitoes? Wen:\u00a0Everyone should keep two key steps in mind. The first is to reduce bites. You can do this by covering arms and legs with clothes when possible. Clothing treated with the insecticide permethrin can provide an added layer of protection. You can also use insect repellent. Make sure to\u00a0use repellents\u00a0that are registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency. These will contain active ingredients like DEET and are safe, even for children and pregnant women. The second key step is source control \u2014 meaning to reduce the mosquitoes near you. During peak mosquito season, in the summer and early fall, use screens on windows and doors to reduce the mosquitoes in your home. In addition, it\u2019s crucial to look for standing water in your garden, as these are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Check for items around your home that could hold water \u2014 such as buckets, trash containers, tires and toys\u2014 and empty and wash them at least once a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_bird-flu-risk-opinion-frieden", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, is president and chief executive of\u00a0Resolve to Save Lives\u00a0and senior fellow for global health at the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations. The United States\u2019 response to H5N1 \u2013 \u201cbird flu\u201d \u2013 has taken too long, showing how risky gaps in coordination and trust can be. With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters in cattle herds from Michigan to Texas, Idaho to North Carolina, it\u2019s clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right. We\u2019ve seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Although the challenge was smaller because of it size, Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, among a half dozen outbreaks that never made headlines, is featured in our new\u00a0Epidemics That Didn\u2019t Happen\u00a0report. The U.S. has done a lot, including scaling up test production, evaluating vaccines, tracking wastewater for related viruses, and providing information about efforts. Finland did three things particularly well; all are relevant to the U.S. response to the virus. Rapid response.\u00a0Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was known to be circulating among birds in Finland, just at the virus has been circulating among birds in the U.S. for the past two years. Human and animal health specialists worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk workers on farms with infected animals. In the United States, H5N1 has been spreading among cattle since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn\u2019t know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The\u00a07-1-7 target for outbreak detection\u00a0and response should be our guiding principle: seven days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, one day to notify public health authorities, and seven days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland\u2019s response met this target. In the U.S., instead of 7 days, the time from emergence of H5N1 in cattle to detection was more like 100 days, and it\u2019s not clear we\u2019ve met the 7-day target for initial response even months into the outbreak. Doing so requires communication and public health measures in the affected communities and an effective coordination mechanism. We must improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health. Trust.\u00a0Farmers already had a high level of trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs, and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals.\u00a0Farmers were immediately reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust of the government in the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland\u2019s\u00a0next move: vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so. Trust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are on the front line of these outbreaks.\u00a0In May, the US Department of Agriculture announced\u00a0payments to farms\u00a0to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including\u00a0covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1,\u00a0compensating farms that\u00a0supply personal protective equipment to their workers, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies.\u00a0We may need to do more to protect our nation\u2019s agricultural sector. Coordinated government response.\u00a0Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. The joint response strengthened detection, collaboration of industry groups, and protection of workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure it had the authority to implement effective control measures. In the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. There are multiple agencies involved: USDA monitors cattle health, US Food and Drug Administration monitors milk safety and the CDC monitors diseases in humans, including from animal exposure. Coordination seems to be improving, but any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country\u2019s size and diversity. We have a lot to learn, and no time to lose.\u00a0First, localities,\u00a0states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies \u2013 including CDC, USDA, FDA \u2013 and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public.\u00a0Second,\u00a0Congress needs to provide resources to prevent and respond to pandemic risks, including for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we\u2019re prepared to stop new events before they become epidemics. Third and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing their questions and concerns. If one country responds to H5N1 well, that\u2019s not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country \u2013 including the United States \u2013 needs an effective response.

{"id": "2023_01_06_health_medication-abortion-process-wellness", "text": "Mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortions, can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor following the US Supreme Court rejection of a lawsuit challenging regulation of the abortion pill. \u201cWhile many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cA growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective,\u201d he said. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks\u2019 gestation, which is \u201c70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,\u201d according to the US Food and Drug Administration. In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.  Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. \u201cSome people do this because they cannot access a clinic \u2014 particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion \u2014 or because they have a preference for self-care,\u201d said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman\u2019s health. What happens in a medication abortion What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.  CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences? Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation. An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there\u2019s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo. The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes. Then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.  A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration. Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.  In fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled. The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.  CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion? Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed. Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.  Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription. Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator,  helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That\u2019s something people could get without a prescription. Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we\u2019re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we\u2019ve been doing more research on people\u2019s experiences with medication abortion, it\u2019s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.  CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise? Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It\u2019s rare, happening in about 2 out of every 100 pregnancies \u2014 and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion. People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization. If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill. Anyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful. People with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.  CNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion? Grossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever \u2014 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider. Heavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well. One of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it\u2019s wise to be on the lookout. We usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends. Most people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.  If someone still feels pregnant, isn\u2019t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician. People should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion.

{"id": "2024_06_18_health_older-americans-healthcare-affordability-kff-partner-wellness", "text": "What weighs most heavily on older adults\u2019 minds when it comes to health care? The cost of services and therapies, and their ability to pay. \u201cIt\u2019s on our minds a whole lot because of our age and because everything keeps getting more expensive,\u201d said Connie Colyer, 68, of Pleasureville, Kentucky. She\u2019s a retired forklift operator who has lung disease and high blood pressure. Her husband, James, 70, drives a dump truck and has a potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythm. Tens of millions of seniors are similarly anxious about being able to afford health care because of its expense and rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. A new wave of research highlights the reach of these anxieties. When the University of Michigan\u2019s National Poll on Healthy Aging asked people 50 and older about 26 health-related issues, their top three areas of concern had to do with costs: of medical care in general, of long-term care, and of prescription drugs. More than half of 3,300 people surveyed in February and March reported being \u201cvery concerned\u201d about these issues. In fact, five of the top 10 issues identified as very concerning were cost-related. Beyond the top three, people cited the cost of health insurance and Medicare (52%), and the cost of dental care (45%). Financial scams and fraud came in fourth place (53% very concerned). Of much less concern were issues that receive considerable attention, including social isolation, obesity and age discrimination. In an election year, \u201cour poll sends a very clear message that older adults are worried about the cost of health care and will be looking to candidates to discuss what they have done or plan to do to contain those costs,\u201d said John Ayanian, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation. Health care costs are impacting wallets Older adults have good reason to worry. One in 10 seniors (about 6 million people) have incomes below the federal poverty level. About one in four rely exclusively on Social Security payments, which average $1,913 a month per person. Even though inflation has moderated since its 2022 peak, prices haven\u2019t come down, putting a strain on seniors living on fixed incomes. Meanwhile, traditional Medicare doesn\u2019t cover several services that millions of older adults need, such as dental care, vision care or help at home from aides. While private Medicare Advantage plans offer some coverage for these services, benefits are frequently limited. All of this contributes to a health care affordability squeeze for older adults. Recently published research from the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s 2023 Health Care Affordability Survey found that nearly a third of people 65 or older reported difficulty paying for health care expenses, including premiums for Medicare, medications, and expenses associated with receiving medical services. One in seven older adults reported spending a quarter or more of their average monthly budget on health care; 44% spent between 10% and 24%. Seventeen percent said they or a family member had forgone needed care in the past year for financial reasons. The Colyers in Pleasureville are among them. Both need new dentures and eyeglasses, but they can\u2019t afford to pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket, Connie said. \u201cAs the cost of living rises for basic necessities, it\u2019s more difficult for lower-income and middle-income Medicare beneficiaries to afford the health care they need,\u201d said Gretchen Jacobson, vice president of the Medicare program at the Commonwealth Fund. Similarly, \u201cwhen health care costs rise, it\u2019s more difficult to afford basic necessities.\u201d This is especially worrisome because older adults are more prone to illness and disability than younger adults, resulting in a greater need for care and higher expenses. In 2022, seniors on Medicare spent $7,000 on medical services, compared with $4,900 for people without Medicare. Not included in this figure is the cost of assisted living or long-term stays in nursing homes, which Medicare also doesn\u2019t cover. According to Genworth\u2019s latest survey, the median annual cost of a semiprivate room in a nursing home was $104,000 in 2023, while assisted living came to $64,200, and a week\u2019s worth of services from home-health aides averaged $75,500. Many older adults simply can\u2019t afford to pay for these long-term care options or other major medical expenses out-of-pocket. \u201cSeventeen million older adults have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Program on Medicare Policy for KFF. (That\u2019s $30,120 for a single-person household in 2024; $40,880 for a two-person household.) \u201cFor people living on that income, the risk of a major expense is very scary.\u201d Planning for the future is challenging How to deal with unanticipated expenses in the future is a question that haunts Connie Colyer. Her monthly premiums for Medicare Parts B and D, and a Medigap supplemental policy come to nearly $468, or 42% of her $1,121 monthly income from Social Security. With a home mortgage of $523 a month, and more than $150 in monthly copayments for her inhalers and her husband\u2019s heart medications, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t make it if my husband wasn\u2019t still working,\u201d she told me. (James\u2019 monthly Social Security payment is $1,378. His premiums are similar to Connie\u2019s and his income fluctuates based on the weather. In the first five months of this year, it approached $10,000, Connie told me.) The couple makes too much to qualify for programs that help older adults afford Medicare out-of-pocket costs. As many as 6 million people are eligible but not enrolled in these Medicare Savings Programs. Those with very low incomes may also qualify for dual coverage by Medicaid and Medicare or other types of assistance with household costs, such as food stamps. Older adults can check their eligibility for these and other programs by contacting their local Area Agency on Agency, State Health Insurance Assistance Program or benefits enrollment center. Enter your ZIP code at the Eldercare Locator and these and other organizations helping seniors locally will come up. Persuading older adults to step forward and ask for help often isn\u2019t easy. Angela Zeek, health and government benefits manager at Legal Aid of the Bluegrass in Kentucky, said many seniors in her area don\u2019t want to be considered poor or unable to pay their bills, a blow to their pride. \u201cWhat we try to say is, \u2018You\u2019ve worked hard all your life, you\u2019ve paid your taxes. You\u2019ve given back to this government so there\u2019s nothing wrong with the government helping you out a bit.\u2019\u201d And the unfortunate truth is there\u2019s very little, if any, help available for seniors who aren\u2019t poor but have modest financial resources. While the need for new dental, vision and long-term care benefits for older adults is widely acknowledged, \u201cthe question is always how to pay for it,\u201d said Neuman of KFF. This will become an even bigger issue in the coming years because of the burgeoning aging population. There is some relief on the horizon, however: Assistance with Medicare drug costs is available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, although many older adults don\u2019t realize it yet. The act allows Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs for the first time. This year, out-of-pocket costs for medications will be limited to a maximum $3,800 for most beneficiaries. Next year, a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket drug costs will take effect. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing people who\u2019ve had very high drug costs in the past save thousands of dollars this year,\u201d said Frederic Riccardi, president of the Medicare Rights Center. \u201cAnd next year, it\u2019s going to get even better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/older-americans-healthcare-affordability-kff-partner-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_childhood-obesity-recommendations-uspstf", "text": "The US Preventive Services Task Force updated its final recommendations Tuesday for how primary care clinicians can best help children with a high body mass index, the measure most practitioners use to determine whether a person has obesity. The task force suggested that extensive and intensive behavioral interventions are the best way to help a child get to a healthy weight. Recent studies have shown that popular weight-loss drugs and surgical procedures are also highly successful treatments for children, and they are recommended as viable options under American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. But neither option is part of the USPSTF\u2019s latest recommendations, and along with the large number of hours the task force recommends for behavioral interventions, it has left some doctors frustrated. Several providers characterize the new recommendations as unrealistic or problematic. What the recommendations say The latest recommendations from the task force \u2013 a volunteer panel of independent medical experts \u2013 suggest that clinicians provide intensive behavioral interventions for children who are at least 6 years old with a high BMI, or refer children for such services. A high BMI for a child is defined a little differently than it is for adults, although both use height and weight to estimate mass. A BMI of 30 or higher is within the obesity range for adults, but a child is considered to have a high BMI if they fall at or above the 95th percentile for their age and sex.\u00a0That means the child\u2019s BMI is higher than that of 95% of other kids of the same age or gender, based on growth charts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Parents can use the CDC\u2019s online calculator to estimate their child\u2019s body fat percentage. The USPSTF\u2019s recommended interventions can include self-monitoring, goal-setting, supervised physical activity, instruction in healthier eating and limits on screen time. Providers can tailor these options to fit the patient and their family, the task force says, but the interventions should involve at least 26 hours in a calendar year and include supervised physical activity. According to research that the USPSTF reviewed before making its recommendations, most children who were a part of such intensive programs experienced small weight loss and reductions in BMI after six months to a year. Those who did better spent a larger number of hours with the clinician and had physical activity as a part of their program. Why the recommendations matter A high BMI in children can lead to several significant and even life-threatening health conditions including diabetes, breathing issues, bone and joint problems, liver issues, skin problems, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which itself may lead to heart diseases. Obesity can also make a child a target of bullying, affecting their emotional well-being and self-esteem. Nearly 20% of children in the US have what\u2019s considered a high BMI. The number of children with obesity has grown significantly, tripling over the past four decades, studies show. The USPSTF recommendations help primary care providers determine what preventive care works and what doesn\u2019t, and insurance companies use them to help decide what treatments to cover. The task force gives its guidelines letter grades based on the most up-to-date science. Under the Affordable Care Act, private insurers must cover preventive services that get a grade of A or B; the new child obesity recommendations got a B grade. Some doctors say guidelines are impractical Dr. Susma Vaidya, a pediatrician who runs a weight loss clinic at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, says intensive behavioral intervention is essential and important, but she thinks the recommendation of 26 hours per year \u2013 which averages out to an hour every other week \u2013 is a nearly impossible goal. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure currently to provide this intensive behavioral therapy management,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging for providers. It\u2019s challenging for parents and for kids to be able to commit to that number of hours. And we know that the amount of BMI improvement can be fairly minimal.\u201d Dr. Mona Sharifi, an associate professor of pediatrics and biostatistics at the Yale School of Medicine, worked on the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines that came out last year on helping doctors manage patients with obesity. She was happy to see that the USPSTF recommendations reiterate the strength of the evidence around intensive behavioral treatments, she said, but the group\u2019s last two sets of recommendations on this topic \u2013 issued in 2010 and 2017 \u2013 were similar, and little has changed. \u201cHere we are 15 years later from the first version of these, and still, access to this kind of treatment is abysmal \u2013 and it might even be worse, really, post-pandemic,\u201d Sharifi said. Many programs remain inaccessible for the vast majority of children and adolescents who need them most, according to an editorial published alongside the latest guidelines Tuesday in the journal JAMA. Even the past recommendations are \u201cstill not routinely implemented in clinical practice,\u201d wrote Dr. Thomas Robinson of the Stanford Solutions Science Lab and Department of Pediatrics and Dr. Sarah Armstrong, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Health at Duke University Medical School. Several highly effective pediatric programs also shut down during the pandemic and still haven\u2019t returned, Sharifi said. Some doctors are trying to resurrect these programs, she said, but \u201cin the absence of appropriate reimbursement from insurers, it\u2019s just been really difficult.\u201d Dr. Justin Ryder, a pediatric obesity researcher with Stanley Manne Children\u2019s Research Institute at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago, said that such a high benchmark as 26 hours could also mean insurers refuse to cover programs that are less intense. \u201cI\u2019ve got huge problems with these recommendations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that these recommendations really do a disservice to kids with obesity.\u201d Twenty-six hours of intervention is \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d to achieve in the clinical setting, he said. \u201cIn a primary care setting, it\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d Lack of recommendations on surgery Some doctors are also critical of the USPSTF\u2019s decision not to recommend surgery. Although procedures such as bariatric surgeries are among the options that the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests doctors consider, the task force didn\u2019t review the latest research on the matter, saying surgery is considered \u201coutside the scope of the primary care setting.\u201d \u201cBariatric surgery has 10 years of data now in adolescents,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cIt has some of the most robust and best long-term followup, as well as outcome data, in this patient population, and to not even mention it as a potential option, it\u2019s a clear miss.\u201d Lack of recommendations on medication Some of the biggest disagreements with the recommendation involve weight-loss drugs, for which the USPSTF said \u201cthe totality of the evidence was found to be inadequate.\u201d However, the task force did examine studies involving the medications liraglutide, semaglutide, orlistat, phentermine and topiramate (sold under brand names such as Saxenda, Wegovy, Alli, Lomaira and Topamax, respectively). In most trials, the medications were\u00a0associated with larger BMI reductions than with placebos. But there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to determine what effects they could have in the long term, said task force member\u00a0Dr.\u00a0John Ruiz, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Arizona. The drugs also may come with side effects like nausea, vomiting and gallstones. \u201cThere\u2019s just such a limited set of studies done that one doesn\u2019t know if those results are reliable and to whether they are generalizable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether there\u2019s any harms that have come about, particularly, in longer-term use of those medications. That would be important to know.\u201d Vaidya says the drugs have transformed her practice in Washington. \u201cI appreciate that these are children, and we are always very cautious about using medication, but these are FDA-approved medications, and sometimes, these medications facilitate a family or child\u2019s ability to adhere to the lifestyle modifications that we also recommend,\u201d she said. Vaidya said she has seen children struggle for years to get to a healthy weight through lifestyle interventions alone before they finally get \u201cunstuck\u201d with the help of weight-loss medications. \u201cI think the role of pharmacotherapy, honestly, can\u2019t be understated,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/childhood-obesity-recommendations-uspstf/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_health_senate-hearing-fda-flavored-vapes", "text": "Republicans and Democrats on the US Senate Judiciary Committee showed rare agreement Wednesday as they took to task the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Justice for what they described as inaction on the country\u2019s youth vaping epidemic. Nearly three years ago, a federal court ruled that the FDA was violating the Tobacco Control Act by allowing e-cigarette products that did not have FDA pre-authorization to stay on the market. An FDA official testified Wednesday that the topic was a \u201ctop priority,\u201d but the agency has missed the September 2021 deadline that the court set to for the agency to complete its review of e-cigarette makers\u2019 applications to sell their products. Since that time, one study found, an estimated 2.1 million children have used e-cigarettes regularly, and the majority use flavored products. \u201cAfter the court-ordered deadline passed on September 9, 2021, the FDA could have ordered every single unauthorized e-cigarette off the market, and that\u2019s what it should have done,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, told Dr. Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cInstead, thousands of unauthorized e-cigarettes flooded the market.\u201d In fact, Durbin said, his staffers found vapes in flavors like Red Bull, strawberry, dragonfruit and watermelon bubble gum at a shop just a mile from FDA headquarters. \u201cNot a single one of these products has been authorized by the FDA. None of them. These illegal products, clearly designed for kids by their flavors, are being sold\u201d even in the shadow of FDA headquarters, he said. Placing one of the products in front of him, Durbin asked how the FDA could let such sales happen. \u201cThe volume of those applications and the volume of the market requires us to prioritize our enforcement efforts,\u201d King testified. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, also told the representatives from the FDA and the Department of Justice that she was displeased. \u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing to hear you kind of talk in circles about what you are planning to do, but you haven\u2019t established a plan, and you\u2019re not certain what your way forward is going to be,\u201d she said. King said the FDA has received 27 million applications for e-cigarette products. But unlike with companies that make drugs and medical devices, which pay user fees that fund the agency\u2019s work, the FDA is not allowed to\u00a0collect fees from e-cigarette makers. King asked the Senate committee for the authority to fund this increased workload. \u201cThe rapidly evolving tobacco product landscape presents an unprecedented time and resource challenge that no other center at FDA has ever faced,\u201d King said. Since June, the FDA has authorized only 23 e-cigarette products \u2013 none of them flavored \u2013 and has denied many more. Hundreds of thousands of additional applications are still pending. From 2020 to 2023, there was a 1,500% increase in flavored tobacco products sold in the US, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. He also brought in flavored vape products that his staffers bought, including watermelon bubble gum, apple melon berry and one called Tyson Heavyweight. \u201cDr. King, those are clearly designed for consumption by children, correct?\u201d Cornyn asked. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the intent of the manufacturer, but I can say that flavors do appeal to kids. Ninety percent of youth who use e-cigarettes use flavored varieties,\u201d King testified. About 10% of high school-age adolescents and nearly 5% of middle school students use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, King said. But when they do vape, teens and young adults are much more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. \u201cMore work is definitely needed,\u201d he testified. Enforcement of the law is the other challenge, the FDA and DOJ said at the hearing. The FDA has conducted thousands of inspections of e-cigarette manufacturers and distributors resulting in nearly 900 warning letters, King said. More than 500 warning letters have gone to retail stores, King said, but if the letters are ignored that\u2019s as far as the FDA can go, so it must rely on the DOJ and other agencies. It was only this week that the FDA and several law enforcement agencies announced that they were creating a task force that will use the criminal and civil tools available to fight the illegal sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. \u201cWhat in the hell have you been waiting for?\u201d Durbin asked Arun Rao, deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch in the Department of Justice. \u201cSenator, we have been acting on a number of fronts,\u201d Rao replied. He said the Justice Department has been working with the US Marshals Service and the FDA on seizures of illegal products, but he admitted that \u201cmany manufactures have exploited the premarket authorization process.\u201d Rao testified that many manufacturers whose products have been denied FDA authorization make minimal alterations and resubmit for approval. Some overseas e-cigarette makers will also misrepresent shipments in an effort to slip past regulators, and some stores make their own products. \u201cTaken together, these factors have made illegal e-cigarettes all too accessible,\u201d Rao said. Many products come from China, but that country has banned flavored e-cigarettes, and the products are not sold in Chinese stores \u2013 a point that wasn\u2019t lost on the committee. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell them in China, but you can sell them in the United States and essentially victimize and addict our children to these nicotine delivery devices,\u201d Cornyn said. Nicotine is highly addictive and hurts kids, testified Dr. Susan Walley, immediate past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Section on Nicotine and Tobacco Prevention and Treatment. Nicotine can permanently hurt a teen\u2019s developing brain, studies show, impairing working memory and attention. Flavored products are too tempting and easy to access, said Walley, who brought with her a flavored e-cigarette product called OMG Blow Pop that she said she purchased within walking distance of a school. \u201cSimply put, this is unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need the federal government to get these illegal products off the market.\u201d Even representatives of the vaping industry testified that they were unhappy with the FDA\u2019s authorization process. \u201cThis is a hot mess right now,\u201d said Tony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association. He complained that there was no clear pathway through the approval process and said that without one, \u201cwe are going to persist in having an illicit market.\u201d A high school senior, Josie Shapiro of Seattle, told the committee that vaping products are too easy to access. She said she started vaping after several friends did. \u201cThey thought vapes were harmless because of the fun flavors and colorful packaging,\u201d Shapiro testified. Shapiro said she has tried to quit several times, but vaping has taken over her and her friends\u2019 lives. \u201cI\u2019ve felt completely out of control, helpless and alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t spend quality time with my friends without thinking about when we were going to get our next hit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/health/senate-hearing-fda-flavored-vapes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_media_surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label", "text": "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the threat social media poses to children requires urgent action, and he demanded Congress to put a label on the apps as it does with cigarettes and alcohol. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in the New York Times Monday. Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, \u201cnearly universal.\u201d But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps \u2014 that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill. \u201cI put forward this call for a warning because I think it\u2019s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,\u201d Murthy told CNN. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in America over the past several decades. Congress has long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Murthy argued that it\u2019s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children\u2019s use of social media. \u201cUntil that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future\u2026 parents deserve to be warned. That\u2019s where the label comes in,\u201d Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media as soon as possible. \u201cI think this is an urgent issue.\u201d An escalating battle Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. But Monday\u2019s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. In May 2023, Murthy issued an advisory that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use, saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I\u2019m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,\u201d Murthy told CNN in May 2023. \u201cFor too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cChasing Life\u201d podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta in June 2023, Murthy outlined some steps parents can take to rein in their children\u2019s social media usage, including partnering with other parents to make sure kids lack the \u201cI\u2019m the only one without social media\u201d excuse. More action needed A warning label, if Congress passes legislation requiring one, would be insufficient to fix the problem, Murthy acknowledged. He suggested schools become phone-free environments for children, as should dinner time and other family events. And Murthy urged parents to restrict children\u2019s use of social media until they graduate from middle school. Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would prohibit children under 14 from obtaining their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would ban social media from using algorithms in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18. \u201cThis is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,\u201d Murthy wrote in the New York Times. On Monday, Murthy confirmed to CNN that alcohol and cigarettes are currently the only two products with surgeon general warning labels but that the overall health risk of social media is \u201cjust as profound.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mental health and wellbeing of kids,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_resistance-training-older-adults-wellness", "text": "Retirement should be filled with time with loved ones, relaxation and\u2014according to new research\u2014heavy lifting. As people get older, their skeletal muscle function declines, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine. \u201cIf you do resistance training at this age, benefits in some parameters may last several years,\u201d said lead study author \ufeffMads Bloch-Ibenfeldt, a doctoral student at the Institute of Sports Medicine at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. To investigate whether resistance exercise programs could be helpful in the long term, researchers performed a randomized control trial with 369 recently retired and healthy adults who were between 64 and 75 years old. The participants were assigned one of three exercise programs for a year. They either lifted weights three times a week, did moderate-intensity training using their body weight and resistance bands three times a week, or did not change their usual exercise routines, the study said. Researchers measured their bone and muscle strength as well as body fat levels at the start of the trial at the end of the one-year program and then two and four years later, according to the study. It was up to the individuals whether they continued their strength training regimen or went back to their normal exercise level, Resistance training with heavy loads yielded the greatest long-lasting benefit in leg strength, the study showed. Even four years after the training, their leg strength was unaltered, whereas the moderate-intensity group did see a decrease \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t significant, the study showed. \u201cExercise is critically important across the life span. This study does show that even in those engaging in activity later in life around retirement can lead to marked benefits to one\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the School of Medicine (Geriatric Medicine) and in the Gillings School of Global Public Health (Nutrition). He was not involved in the research. What counts as resistance training? The umbrella of exercise includes aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance activities, Batsis said. \u201cEach of these have important consequences if one regularly performs them or does not on overall health (including cognition) and physical function,\u201d Batsis\ufeff said in an email. You can think of resistance training as \u201cexercises that improve strength by making muscles work against a force,\u201d said CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a mind-body coach for professional athletes. That force can include weights, resistance bands or your own body weight\u2014like with pushups or squats, she added. \u201cFor older adults, resistance training is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, and mobility,\u201d she said. According to the recent study, adding heavier weight seems to be important, Bloch-Ibenfeldt said. What you can do at home One limitation of the exercise proposed in the recent study is that the weighted exercises were done at a gym, which is something not everyone has the time, money or transportation to do, Batsis said. While you should consult a certified trainer or physical therapist to ensure\ufeff you are exercising safely, there are things you can do from home, Santas said. For older adults, it is important to strengthen in ways that are important to functional movements of everyday living, she added. Santas recommends box squats, where you sit lightly on a chair seat and stand back up. If you don\u2019t need to hold the arms of the chair for support, add some dumbbells, Santas said. The added weight gives \u201cadditional resistance while also improving\u00a0grip strength, which is essential for functional independence and serves as (a) marker for heart health,\u201d she added. You can also increase strength in functional movements, protect your knee joints and prevent injury by placing a resistance band around both of your legs and doing side steps,\u00a0side lunging\u00a0or\u00a0reverse lunging, she said. Try to do two or three sets of eight to 12 of each activity at least a couple of times a week, Santas said. Regular maintenance of exercise and other health factors are important for independence later in life, Batsis said. \u201cThe basics of lifestyle changes, including nutrition and exercise are a major key to healthy aging,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/resistance-training-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}

Symptoms have included seizures, muscle rigidity, abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, and vomiting. According to a\u00a0health advisory\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several people were admitted to intensive care units and required intubation and mechanical ventilation after eating the company\u2019s microdosing chocolate bars, infused cones, or micro dose and macro dose gummies. The exact cause of the reported illnesses has yet to be uncovered, but the FDA and CDC are conducting an investigation along with America\u2019s Poison Centers and state and local partners. The FDA says it has been in contact with the Diamond Shruumz brand about a potential recall. The agency cautions consumers not to eat, sell or serve Diamond Shruumz chocolate bars, cones and gummies, which are marketed as containing a proprietary blend of mushrooms and which have been sold nationwide. Diamond Shruumz has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Similar products containing cannabis or mushrooms are increasing in popularity, entering the market in forms such as gummies, chocolates and snack foods, according to the CDC. They are especially appealing to children and teenagers, the FDA warned in a\u00a0statement. Brands have touted mushroom-containing products for their alleged health benefits, such as improved focus and energy, and for initiating hallucinations and feelings of euphoria. However, the CDC urges consumers to avoid these products, saying they \u201cmight contain undisclosed ingredients that might be linked to severe illness.\u201d Anyone who has symptoms after consuming a product should get medical attention right away or call the Poison Help Line at 1-800-222-1222.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_crows-can-count-study-scn", "text": "Perhaps \u201cbirdbrained\u201d isn\u2019t such an insult after all \u2013\u2013 crows, the ubiquitous urban bird, can vocally count up to four, the latest research has found. Not only can the inquisitive creatures count, but they can match the number of calls they make when shown a numeral, according to a new study, led by a team of researchers with the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2019s animal physiology lab in Germany. The way the birds recognize and react to numbers is similar to a process we humans use, both to learn to count as toddlers and quickly recognize how many objects we\u2019re looking at. The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, deepen our growing understanding of crow intelligence. \u201cHumans do not have a monopoly on skills such as numerical thinking, abstraction, tool manufacture, and planning ahead,\u201d said animal cognition expert Heather Williams via email. \u201cNo one should be surprised that crows are \u2018smart.\u2019\u201d Williams, a professor of biology at Williams College in Massachusetts, was not involved in the study. In the animal kingdom, counting isn\u2019t limited to crows. Chimpanzees have been taught to count in numerical order and understand the value of numerals, much like young children. In attempting to woo mates, some male frogs count the number of calls from competing males to match or even one-up that number when it\u2019s their turn to croak at a female. Scientists have even theorized that ants retrace their paths back to their colonies by counting their steps, though the method isn\u2019t always accurate. What this latest study showed is that crows, like young humans, can learn to associate numerals with values \u2013\u2013 and count out loud accordingly. Can crows count much like toddlers do? The research was inspired by toddlers learning to count, said lead study author Diana Liao, a neurobiologist and senior researcher at the T\u00fcbingen lab. Toddlers use the words of numbers to tally the number of objects in front of them: If they see three toys in front of them, their counting could sound like \u201cone, two, three\u201d or \u201cone, one, one.\u201d Maybe crows could do the same, Liao thought. She was inspired, too, by a June 2005 study on chickadees tailoring their alarm calls to a predator\u2019s size. The larger a predator\u2019s wingspan or body length, the fewer \u201cdee\u201d sounds the chickadees used in their alarm call, the study found. The opposite was true for smaller predators \u2013\u2013 the songbirds would use more \u201cdee\u201d sounds if they encountered a smaller bird, which could be greater threats to chickadees since they are more agile, Liao said. The authors of the chickadee study couldn\u2019t confirm whether the small songbirds had control over the number of sounds they made or if the number of sounds were an involuntary response. But the possibility piqued Liao\u2019s curiosity \u2013\u2013 could crows, whose intelligence has been well-documented over decades of research, show control over their ability to produce a certain number of sounds, effectively \u201ccounting\u201d like toddlers do? The crows planned their number of caws Liao and her colleagues trained three carrion crows, a European species closely related to the American crow, over more than 160 sessions. During the trainings, the birds had to learn associations between a series of visual and auditory cues from 1 to 4 and produce the corresponding number of caws. In the example researchers provided, a visual cue might look like a bright blue numeral, and its corresponding audio could be the half-second song of a drumroll. The crows were expected to perform the same number of caws as the number represented by the cue \u2013\u2013 three caws for the cue with the numeral 3 \u2013\u2013 within 10 seconds of seeing and hearing the cue. When the birds had stopped counting and cawing, they would peck at an \u201center\u201d key on the touchscreen that presented their cues to confirm that they were done. If the birds had counted correctly, they\u2019d receive a treat. It appeared that as the cues continued, the crows took longer to react to each cue. Their reaction times grew as \u201cmore vocalizations were impending,\u201d Liao wrote, suggesting that the crows planned the number of caws they were going to make before they opened their beaks. The researchers could even tell how many calls the birds planned to make by the way their first call sounded \u2013\u2013 subtle acoustic differences that showed that the crows knew how many numbers they were looking at and had synthesized the information. \u201cThey understand abstract numbers \u2026 and then plan ahead as they match their behavior to match that number,\u201d Williams said. Even the mistakes the crows made were somewhat advanced: If the crows had cawed one too many times, stuttered over the same number or submitted their responses with their beak prematurely, Liao and her researchers could detect from the sound of the first call where they went wrong. These are the \u201csame kinds of errors humans make,\u201d Williams said. We\u2019re still learning how smart crows are Birds and many other animals were previously thought to make only on-the-spot decisions based on stimuli in their immediate environments, a theory popularized by the 20th century animal behaviorist B.F. Skinner. But the latest research by Liao and her colleagues provides more evidence about crows\u2019 ability to synthesize numbers to produce a sound and suggests that the skill is within their control. The study team\u2019s findings are highly specific but still significant \u2013\u2013 they challenge the once common belief that all animals are merely stimulus-response machines, said Kevin McGowan, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, who has spent more than two decades studying wild crows in their habitats. McGowan wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study, McGowan told CNN, demonstrated that \u201ccrows aren\u2019t just simple nonthinking machines out there reacting to their environment \u2013\u2013 they\u2019re actually thinking ahead and have the ability to communicate in a structured, preplanned way. It\u2019s sort of a necessary precursor for having a language.\u201d Crow intelligence has been studied for decades. Scientists have investigated New Caledonian crows creating their own compound tools to access food. The birds appear to establish rules, according to a November 2013 study coauthored by the University of T\u00fcbingen lab\u2019s lead researcher, Andreas Nieder. Crow language has confounded scientists for decades, too, with its widely varying tones and expressions, McGowan said. The study by Liao and her colleagues isn\u2019t even the first to consider whether crows can count. That research began with Nicholas Thompson in 1968, animal cognition expert Irene Pepperberg noted. A research professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Pepperberg is best known for her work with an African grey parrot named Alex. Thompson hypothesized that crows could count based on their caws, the duration and number of which the birds appeared to control in a given burst of sound. The crows\u2019 counting abilities \u201cseem to exceed the demands which survival makes for such abilities,\u201d he wrote. Another University of T\u00fcbingen study on crows\u2019 counting abilities from September 2015 trained the birds to recognize groupings of dots and recorded the activity of neurons in the part of the crows\u2019 brains that receives and makes sense of visual stimuli. The researchers found that the crows\u2019 neurons \u201cignore the dots\u2019 size, shape and arrangement and only extract their number,\u201d the university said in a statement at the time. \u201cSo, crows\u2019 brains can represent different quantities, and crows can quickly learn to match Arabic numerals to those quantities \u2013\u2013 something humans usually explicitly teach their children,\u201d Williams said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/crows-can-count-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "health"}}
