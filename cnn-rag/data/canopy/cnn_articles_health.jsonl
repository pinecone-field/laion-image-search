The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other. Doing so should allow the satellites to collect data about phenomena that take place on a short time scale and require frequent measurements \u2014 such as how the amount of cloud cover affects the temperature on Earth beneath it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/world/nasa-prefire-mission-launch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and the (levels of xylitol) went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d as the xylitol levels did, said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products. The February 2023 erythritol in study found the risk of heart attack and stroke nearly doubled within three years when people had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood. For the new study on xylitol, the results were basically the same \u2014 people with the highest levels of xylitol compared to those with the lowest levels had nearly twice the risk of heart attack, stroke and death, Hazen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a receptor on our platelets, which we as yet don\u2019t understand, that is recognizing this molecule and signaling to the platelet to be more prone to clot,\u201d he said. \u201cOur tastebuds can\u2019t tell the difference in the structures between sugar and these other sweeteners, but clearly our platelets can.\u201d The World Health Organization warned consumers in 2023 to avoid artificial sweeteners for weight loss, and has called for additional research on the long-term toxicity of low- and no-calorie sweeteners, the study said. \u201cThrough their work, the investigators have shined a light on the safety of sugar substitutes. There is more to learn,\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s Tomey said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is worth remembering that sugar substitutes are no substitute for a sincere commitment to the several elements of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_07_09_health_what-happens-to-your-body-extreme-heat-xpn", "text": "Human-caused climate change has already made heat waves around the world more frequent and intense. Scientists who study the role of global warming on weather say that every heat wave today bears the fingerprints of the climate crisis. Climate change, driven primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is worsening global extreme weather in general, but much of that change is related to heat.  In the US, heat kills more Americans than any other weather-related disaster, and it will only continue to worsen as the world heats up from burning fossil fuels. Here\u2019s what happens to your body in extreme heat, what you need to watch out for and how to stay safe.  What happens to your body Normally, your body is used to a certain range of temperatures, usually between 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. When your brain senses a change \u2013 either lower or higher than that \u2013 it attempts to help your body cool down or heat up, according to Dr. Judith Linden, executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center and a professor in the emergency medicine department at Boston University\u2019s school of medicine.   \u201cThere are a number of different ways in which (the brain) attempts to cool the body down. One way, the most common way we think of, is that you sweat,\u201d Linden said. \u201cThe pores open, the body sweats and the sweat evaporates, that cools the body.\u201d The second way your body cools itself down is by dilating vessels and upping your heart rate, which helps bring heat and blood to the surface of your body and helps releases that excess heat.   When you\u2019re exposed to high temperatures, it becomes harder for your body to try and keep up with cooling itself down. And if your environment is hot and humid, sweat doesn\u2019t evaporate as easily \u2013 which pushes your body\u2019s temperature even higher, according to the Mayo Clinic.  \u201cThe higher the humidity, the lower temperatures you need for extreme heat,\u201d  Linden said.  High body temperatures can lead to damage to the brain and other vital organs, the CDC says. They can also lead to several heat-related illnesses.  Types of heat-related illnesses  Mild-heat related illnesses, including heat cramps, are most common, Linden said. Heat cramps can develop in people who sweat a lot, including during exercising. The excessive sweating uses up all of the body\u2019s salt and moisture and can lead to  muscle pains or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms or legs, according to the CDC.  A heat rash can also develop. That\u2019s a skin irritation caused by too much sweating in hot and humid weather, and is most common in young children, the CDC says. It is usually a red cluster of pimples or blisters, and tends to be in places including the neck, upper chest or in elbow creases. When your body\u2019s beginning to exceed its ability to cool itself down, you can develop what\u2019s known as heat exhaustion. \u201cIn this case you\u2019re going to see excessive sweating because your body is really going to try and keep up with that extra heat. You\u2019re going to feel light-headed, you may feel dizzy, often people present with nausea, headaches and their skin often looks pale and clammy and their pulse is often fast,\u201d Linden said.  \u201cThis is the body\u2019s last attempt to cool itself before it really goes into a point of no return.\u201d A heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, and, if left untreated, can lead to death.  \u201cThat\u2019s where your body\u2019s temperature goes above 104 to 105 degrees or so, and this is where your mechanisms are starting to fail,\u201d Linden said.  Warning signs may include extremely high body temperatures, red and dry skin, a rapid pulse, headache, dizziness, nausea or loss of consciousness, according to the CDC. The hallmark of a heat stroke is confusion and agitation, Linden said.  \u201cSo when somebody\u2019s in the heat and they become confused and agitated, that\u2019s heat stroke until proven otherwise and you need to call 911 for that or get help immediately and get the person out of the heat.\u201d Who is most at risk Elderly, people with chronic medical conditions as well as children are at higher risk for severe heat-related illnesses.  The elderly and people with chronic medical conditions may be less likely to sense and respond to temperature changes and may be taking medication that make the heat effects worse, the CDC said.  \u201cVery young (people) as well, because they\u2019re less likely to recognize heat-related illness and they\u2019re less likely to get out of the heat if they\u2019re starting to feel overheated,\u201d Linden said.  Student-athletes and pets are also at higher risk, she added. \u201cIn this weather, you must never, ever, ever leave a child or a pet in the car for even a minute,\u201d Linden added.  How to stay safe When your community is facing extreme heat, there are several things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.  First, keep an eye out for symptoms of heat exhaustion or other illnesses. \u201cIf somebody starts feeling light-headed, dizzy, nausea or headache, that is the time to act immediately,\u201d Linden said. \u201cThat means getting them out of the heat and into a cool environment.\u201d Putting water on someone who may be experiencing symptoms and giving them fluids can help cool them down. If someone is starting to lose consciousness or has nausea or vomiting, call 911.  \u201cIf you see anybody with any type of confusion, that\u2019s an immediate red flag,\u201d Linden added.  When it\u2019s hot outside, try to avoid outdoor activities \u2013 especially between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to Linden. If you have to go outside, wear light-colored clothing, cover your head and drink plenty of fluids.  Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re thirsty to drink water \u2013 as that can be a sign of dehydration. Linden recommends drinking at least one glass of water \u2013 or more \u2013 an hour.  \u201cIf you do start to feel light-headed, dizzy, sweating, fast pulse, get out of the heat immediately,\u201d Linden said.  Try to find air conditioning, or places in your area where you can go to stay cool, according to Ready.gov.  Even spending a few hours in a shopping mall or public library can help.  When you\u2019re home, fans can help, but don\u2019t rely on them as your only way of cooling down \u2013 while it may feel more comfortable, they won\u2019t help prevent heat-related illness.  \u201cIf you\u2019re in a super hot room, if you\u2019ve got a fan, is it helpful? No. I think, if you\u2019ve got a fan, and you\u2019re able to mist yourself \u2026 then fans can be helpful,\u201d Linden said. \u201cFans are not foolproof.\u201d Finally, make sure you\u2019re checking on your neighbors, parents and friends \u2013 especially older individuals who may be living alone or are isolated, Linden said.

{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness", "text": "There\u2019s a crack of light shining through the dark clouds of America\u2019s battle with poor nutrition and subsequent health issues, according to a new study that analyzed two decades of nutritional data. \u201cThere is good news. Americans are starting to hear the message about nutrition, and some companies and restaurants are starting to make healthier products. It\u2019s a little bit of an improvement,\u201d said senior study author and cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston. However, he added, the majority of the improvement occurred between 1999 and 2010, with no advances in nutrition after that. \u201cWe have stalled as a nation \u2014 and that does not bode well for our health,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIf I was grading America on its diet, I\u2019d give it a D\u2014just up from an F.\u201d An upward trend, but more is needed The number of adults in the United States who ate a poor diet decreased from about 49% to just over 37% between 1999 and 2020 \u2014 a drop of 11.4%, while those who ate somewhat better nutritionally rose by 10.5%, the study found. A poor diet was defined as one with too many refined grains, processed meat and sugary beverages, including fruit juice, as well as ultraprocessed foods full of added sugar, salt and fat.\u00a0Healthy choices such as fruits and vegetables are extremely low in this eating style. \u201cIntake of fruits and vegetables didn\u2019t increase at all over this 20-year period, which is pretty striking,\u201d Mozaffarian said. An ideal diet included at least the daily recommended servings of fruits and vegetables, as well as more beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Dietary guidelines such as those from the American Heart Association suggest eating 4 to 5 cups a day of canned, fresh or frozen fruits and the same amount for vegetables. The nutritionally ideal diet also contained few sugary beverages, processed meats, refined grains and ultraprocessed food, which is often high in added sugars, fat and salt, the study said. Unfortunately, the number of people who ate an ideal diet \u2013\u2014 which included those 9 cups of fruits and vegetables \u2014 rose less than 1%, the study found. \u201cPeople often ask me, \u2018Well, if the diet\u2019s slowly improving, why is obesity and diabetes still going up?\u2019 It\u2019s still going up because only 1.58% of Americans have an ideal diet. We still have a long way to go,\u201d Mozaffarian said. More than a million Americans die each year from diet-related diseases such as obesity, cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes,\u00a0according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the United States an\u00a0estimated $1.1 trillion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity annually. \u201cI think it is correct to emphasize that diet quality remains dismal in the US. There is no secret why Americans are experiencing epidemics of obesity and diabetes and declining life expectancy,\u201d said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, in an email. He was not involved in the study. Food insecurity is a major issue The study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed dietary information on nearly 52,000 US adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. Nutritional advances were highest among women, younger adults, Hispanic adults, and people with more education and higher incomes who had access to private health care insurance. Fewer gains were seen in men, Black or older adults and people with less income, lower educational levels, non-private health insurance, and food insecurity issues. \u201cDisparities in the population by education and income and race and ethnicity are the same or sometimes getting worse,\u201d Mozaffarian said. The study found that people with lower income saw a 5% improvement in nutritional quality, while those with higher incomes improved their nutritional score by 16%. \u201cWe do need to avoid just blaming the victims of the dysfunctional US food system for the terrible diets documented in the survey,\u201d Willett said. \u201cWe fail to educate students about nutrition in our schools and feed them unhealthy diets. \u201cOur health care system is missing in action almost completely, we allow advertising to seduce children into junk foods and beverages that kill them prematurely, and we indirectly subsidize unhealthy foods in many ways that make healthier options relatively more expensive and less available to low-income Americans,\u201d he said. How to improve your nutrition There are easy steps you can take to boost the nutritional quality of your diet, experts say. Cook at home as often as possible: \u201cMy top suggestion is to shop at the grocery store as much as you can, rather than getting your food at a coffee shop, sandwich shop or quick-serve restaurant,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Even eating at a full-service restaurant should be limited, he added. Prior research by Mozaffarian and his team found about 80% of all food consumed by Americans from restaurants was of poor diet quality. \u201cShockingly, even when we compared fast food versus sit-down restaurants, there wasn\u2019t a dramatic difference in quality,\u201d he said. Instead, try to choose minimally-processed foods to cook at home and avoid the ready-to-heat-and-eat convenience foods so prevalent at the grocery store. Bring your lunch and snacks to work. Don\u2019t drink your sugar. Americans are beginning to get the idea that sugary sodas are unhealthy, but they have not yet made the connection that energy, sports and caffeinated drinks can be equally sugar laden, Mozaffarian said. \u201cEnergy drinks, pre-sweetened iced teas, and specialty coffee drinks can have more sugar than soda,\u201d he said. \u201cI see people walking out of the coffee shop with drinks with whipped cream on top. Don\u2019t drink your sugar.\u201d However, once sugary beverages are removed from the equation, only \u201c6% of calories in the country come from added sugar in foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIn contrast, about 35% of calories in the country come from refined grains and starches.\u201d Limit refined grains.\u00a0Overall, the biggest contributor to the poor quality diet of Americans is refined grains, at 5.2 servings per day \u2014 \u201calmost two servings a meal of refined grains such as refined bread, refined rice, crackers, chips, and other ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Whole grains still contain the bran and germ, which is a nutritional powerhouse full of healthy fats, antioxidants, minerals and E and B vitamins. Whole grains take longer to digest, don\u2019t raise blood sugar as quickly as refined grains and contain more fiber, which can reduce the risk of chronic disease, promote weight loss, and improve digestion. \u201cSome examples of whole grains include barley, bulgur, farro, millet, quinoa, black rice, brown rice, red rice, wild rice, oatmeal and popcorn,\u201d according to My Plate, the US Department of Agriculture website. Refined grains such as white flour, corn grits, white bread and white rice have been milled, removing the bran and germ, to give them a finer texture and longer shelf life. Milling also removes nutrients like dietary fiber, iron and vitamins.\u00a0Refined grains are found in nearly all ultraprocessed foods, including breakfast cereals, desserts, pastries, bread and crackers. Replace refined grains. Instead, nourish your gut microbiome with fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds and minimally-processed whole grains,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi can also help the microbiome, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn", "text": "Do you yearn for long days and short nights? Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers. The summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It\u2019s the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It\u2019s also the first official day of summer. Our ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion.\u00a0Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge). Pagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe. The mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility \u2013 both the plant and human variety \u2013 in destinations worldwide. The science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia. Summer solstice science Is it summer solstice all over the world? No. It\u2019s only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world\u2019s population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there. When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on\u00a0June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that\u2019s 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool. Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador\u2019s capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight. But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn\u2019t get that dark.\u00a0 The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They\u2019ll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order. Why don\u2019t we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night\u00a0back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That\u2019s because the Earth is aligned on an\u00a0axis, an imaginary pole\u00a0going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts \u2013 at\u00a0an angle of 23.5 degrees. \u201cAs Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun\u2019s direct rays,\u201d explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that\u2019s the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox. Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it\u2019s not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US. \u201cOn average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\u201d says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward. \u201cTemperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night \u2013 so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\u201d says Ward. \u201cThe only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\u201d\u00a0because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August. The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe. How to celebrate summer solstice What does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically. The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at\u00a0summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times. The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise. What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day. In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night \u2013 a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires. In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations\u2019 International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_media_surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label", "text": "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the threat social media poses to children requires urgent action, and he demanded Congress to put a label on the apps as it does with cigarettes and alcohol. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in the New York Times Monday. Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, \u201cnearly universal.\u201d But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps \u2014 that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill. \u201cI put forward this call for a warning because I think it\u2019s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,\u201d Murthy told CNN. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in America over the past several decades. Congress has long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Murthy argued that it\u2019s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children\u2019s use of social media. \u201cUntil that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future\u2026 parents deserve to be warned. That\u2019s where the label comes in,\u201d Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media as soon as possible. \u201cI think this is an urgent issue.\u201d An escalating battle Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. But Monday\u2019s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. In May 2023, Murthy issued an advisory that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use, saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I\u2019m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,\u201d Murthy told CNN in May 2023. \u201cFor too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cChasing Life\u201d podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta in June 2023, Murthy outlined some steps parents can take to rein in their children\u2019s social media usage, including partnering with other parents to make sure kids lack the \u201cI\u2019m the only one without social media\u201d excuse. More action needed A warning label, if Congress passes legislation requiring one, would be insufficient to fix the problem, Murthy acknowledged. He suggested schools become phone-free environments for children, as should dinner time and other family events. And Murthy urged parents to restrict children\u2019s use of social media until they graduate from middle school. Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would prohibit children under 14 from obtaining their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would ban social media from using algorithms in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18. \u201cThis is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,\u201d Murthy wrote in the New York Times. On Monday, Murthy confirmed to CNN that alcohol and cigarettes are currently the only two products with surgeon general warning labels but that the overall health risk of social media is \u201cjust as profound.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mental health and wellbeing of kids,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_health_firearm-injuries-cdc", "text": "Rates of emergency medical services encounters for firearm injuries spiked in 2021 to more than 25% over 2019 levels, but they began to fall in the following years. However, rates were still higher in 2023 than before the Covid-19 pandemic began, a new study says. Young Black men who live in urban areas with severe housing problems \u2014 such as overcrowding, high cost or a lack of functional facilities \u2014 and high unemployment and income disparities were the most vulnerable to that gun violence, according to the new research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The research was published Thursday in the agency\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The researchers took a closer look at data on people who sought help from EMS for a firearm injury in 858 counties in 27 states between January 2019 and September 2023. Because the study focused on these centers only, it cannot be generalizable and speak to trends nationally. However, it offers a good snapshot of the level of gun violence across the country and which people are most likely to be injured, at least in some areas. Compared with the year before the Covid-19 pandemic began, the report says, the rate of EMS encounters for firearm injuries was generally elevated through the fall of 2023. Rates were 22% higher in 2020, 27% higher in 2021, 17% higher in 2022 and 14% higher in 2023 than in 2019. Firearm injuries were highest among people ages 15 to 24, but the largest increase in injuries during this period was among children and teens up to age 14. The data doesn\u2019t capture how people were injured with firearms, so it could have been through self-harm, an accident or a crime. The researchers also couldn\u2019t say why the rate of firearm injuries had grown. One reason could be the number of guns in circulation. Previous research has showed that there was a significant spike in firearm purchases in 2020, and the number of purchases has remained higher than in pre-pandemic times, although there was a slight decline in 2023 from the year before. The study authors also noted that after stay-at-home recommendations were put in place to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, research showed an increase in domestic violence in the US. And the number of suicide attempts in the US increased during the pandemic, studies show. However, studies showed that violent crime \u2013 including crime that involved guns \u2013 declined significantly last year compared with the year before, with murder rates having some of the largest declines in history. The researchers on the new study say the data can\u2019t capture the number of people who immediately died from firearm injuries and thus didn\u2019t need help from an emergency medical service. The quality of the data can also vary, since it relies on EMS personnel to enter all the information accurately, according to the CDC. The CDC researchers said they hope the new report will encourage hospitals and community groups to promote secure firearm storage to help reduce the number of people injured by firearms. In a separate CDC survey released this month, firearm owners in eight states reported that many kept guns unlocked and loaded, including in homes with children. In Alaska, that was the case in more than 40% of homes in the survey with children. In Ohio, it was more than 25%. The new report also urged states and local communities to develop comprehensive firearm injury prevention strategies, such as addressing some of the potential underlying issues hinted at in the report. One such issue, access to affordable housing, has long been a problem in the US, and during the pandemic, rents increased about 24% government data shows. Such a lack of access can weaken social ties, potentially contributing to safety issues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/firearm-injuries-cdc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}

The United States\u2019 response to H5N1 \u2013 \u201cbird flu\u201d \u2013 has taken too long, showing how risky gaps in coordination and trust can be. With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters in cattle herds from Michigan to Texas, Idaho to North Carolina, it\u2019s clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right. We\u2019ve seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Although the challenge was smaller because of it size, Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, among a half dozen outbreaks that never made headlines, is featured in our new\u00a0Epidemics That Didn\u2019t Happen\u00a0report. The U.S. has done a lot, including scaling up test production, evaluating vaccines, tracking wastewater for related viruses, and providing information about efforts. Finland did three things particularly well; all are relevant to the U.S. response to the virus. Rapid response.\u00a0Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was known to be circulating among birds in Finland, just at the virus has been circulating among birds in the U.S. for the past two years. Human and animal health specialists worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk workers on farms with infected animals. In the United States, H5N1 has been spreading among cattle since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn\u2019t know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The\u00a07-1-7 target for outbreak detection\u00a0and response should be our guiding principle: seven days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, one day to notify public health authorities, and seven days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland\u2019s response met this target. In the U.S., instead of 7 days, the time from emergence of H5N1 in cattle to detection was more like 100 days, and it\u2019s not clear we\u2019ve met the 7-day target for initial response even months into the outbreak. Doing so requires communication and public health measures in the affected communities and an effective coordination mechanism. We must improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health. Trust.\u00a0Farmers already had a high level of trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs, and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals.\u00a0Farmers were immediately reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust of the government in the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland\u2019s\u00a0next move: vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so. Trust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are on the front line of these outbreaks.\u00a0In May, the US Department of Agriculture announced\u00a0payments to farms\u00a0to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including\u00a0covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1,\u00a0compensating farms that\u00a0supply personal protective equipment to their workers, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies.\u00a0We may need to do more to protect our nation\u2019s agricultural sector. Coordinated government response.\u00a0Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. The joint response strengthened detection, collaboration of industry groups, and protection of workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure it had the authority to implement effective control measures. In the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. There are multiple agencies involved: USDA monitors cattle health, US Food and Drug Administration monitors milk safety and the CDC monitors diseases in humans, including from animal exposure. Coordination seems to be improving, but any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country\u2019s size and diversity. We have a lot to learn, and no time to lose.\u00a0First, localities,\u00a0states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies \u2013 including CDC, USDA, FDA \u2013 and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public.\u00a0Second,\u00a0Congress needs to provide resources to prevent and respond to pandemic risks, including for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we\u2019re prepared to stop new events before they become epidemics. Third and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing their questions and concerns. If one country responds to H5N1 well, that\u2019s not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country \u2013 including the United States \u2013 needs an effective response.

{"id": "2024_06_14_health_dual-mutant-drug-resistant-flu-variant", "text": "A rare flu variant that has shown some resistance to the most commonly used antiviral treatment has been detected in at least two people in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, but this variant has two concerning mutations in places that could lower the effectiveness of treatment with oseltamivir phosphate, known by the brand name Tamiflu. \u201cThere\u2019s active global surveillance going on looking for these mutations,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cWe want to know when they come up, because that could really have major implications for how we treat influenza.\u201d For now, though, experts say the threat is low. Cases of the \u201cdual mutant\u201d influenza variant were identified in 15 countries across five continents, including two cases in the US, according to a report published Wednesday in the CDC\u2019s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. But they\u2019re very infrequent, representing only about 1% of the samples collected between May 2023 and February 2024. \u201cThey appear in a lot of places, but they\u2019re never really the dominant virus in any place they appear,\u201d Pekosz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the mutation occurred someplace, and suddenly that particular virus began spreading and out-competing everything in one big wave,\u201d he said. Instead, the same mutations seem to be developing in multiple places independently. The doubly mutated variant has shown a reduction in Tamiflu effectiveness of up to 16-fold, according to the CDC report \u2013 but that\u2019s based on laboratory studies. Other influenza variants have shown much greater resistance in the lab, and there\u2019s no gauge for what this could mean in real-life clinical practice, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know really what the clinical significance of this slight resistance is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may well be that the amount of Tamiflu that we give patients is sufficient to overcome this.\u201d Laboratory testing suggests that other antiviral treatments \u2013 including a newer antiviral called baloxavir marboxil, or Xofluza \u2013 are still effective against the dual mutants, according to the CDC. And flu vaccines should offer protection against infections caused by viruses with the mutations, too. \u201cThere are no immediate implications with regard to clinical care decisions,\u201d the CDC said in an emailed statement. \u201cCDC is continuously monitoring the antiviral susceptibility of circulating seasonal influenza viruses in the U.S. and worldwide, along with global partners. This global virologic surveillance will inform the potential public health threat of these influenza viruses.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maya Davis contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/health/dual-mutant-drug-resistant-flu-variant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_fauci-memoir-gupta-interview", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards wear you down.\u201d That phrase, instilled in Dr. Anthony Fauci when he was a student at the Jesuit-run Regis High School in New York City, might as well be the motto of his professional life. Even though he chose a career centered in science, medicine and public health, controversy has always had a way of finding him, even as he tried to make it constructive. Fauci chronicles many such moments in his new memoir, \u201cOn Call: A Doctor\u2019s Journey in Public Service.\u201d Fauci was in the public eye for decades as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, but he became a veritable household name at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was charged with monitoring and mitigating the spread of the virus. Fauci spoke frequently to the worried and bewildered American public at government news conferences, giving status updates and offering guidance on face masks, social distancing, school closures, hospitalization rates and, eventually, vaccines. Many credit him with helping the country navigate the uncharted waters of the coronavirus crisis with his medical expertise, calm demeanor and signature Brooklyn-tinged gravelly voice. At the same time, Fauci was navigating his own political headwinds \u2013 some from his boss, former President Donald Trump, who tried to play down the threat of SARS-CoV-2 even as he initiated Operation Warp Speed, the $10 billion-plus public-private partnership focused on rapidly developing vaccines as well as therapeutics. Speaking to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Fauci described how \u201cpainful\u201d it was at one point to correct Trump about hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19 during a news conference early in the pandemic, a move that upset some of the President\u2019s aides. But Trump\u2019s attention was elsewhere, Fauci said: When he called the doctor to his office, the President surprised him by talking about how many people were watching the news conferences. As the pandemic continued, many coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and antivaxxers blamed Fauci personally for struggles with school closures, mask mandates and vaccine recommendations. Even now, Fauci recently testified, he still faces death threats. The pandemic was not the first time Fauci found himself in the center of a political and medical maelstrom. He was in the hot seat during the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s, when his agency spearheaded the effort to fight the widening epidemic. HIV/AIDS activists called him and the entire medical establishment out for not doing enough or moving quickly enough to help people infected with the virus. Yet throughout his career, Fauci seems to have taken public criticism in stride and used it, even, to build something better. It was an attitude he learned in childhood. \u201cThe Jesuit priests, when you thought that all of a sudden the whole world was pounding on you, they would say \u2018Illegitimi non carborundum,\u2019 which means \u2018don\u2019t let the bastards wear you down,\u2019 which \u2026 lately, that is a very relevant and appropriate saying,\u201d Fauci told Gupta. \u201cThey don\u2019t get me down to the point of interfering with what my work is, but it does wear and tear on you,\u201d he added. Fauci recently sat down for a conversation with Gupta \u2014 one of the many they have shared over the years \u2014 to discuss his life\u2019s work and his legacy. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. (Listen to more of the conversation on the podcast \u201cChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\u201d here.) Dr. Sanjay Gupta: You talk about this interesting press briefing that you did. This is in March of 2020.\u00a0And you had to correct the record, even if the President was talking. How challenging is that? Dr. Anthony Fauci: I said to myself, \u201cI have a responsibility to preserve my own personal integrity and a responsibility to the American public.\u201d\u00a0\u2026 So when I walked up to the podium, I said, \u201cHere it goes!\u201d That was painful to me, to have to do that, but there was no doubt that I had to do it. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cWell, maybe you should, and maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d There was no doubt that I had to do it, because I would actually be just relinquishing my responsibility. And what happened is that the President was less upset about that than the people around him, who really got upset. But then he called me in his office once when he wanted to ask me another question, and he was looking at three different televisions, and he says, \u201cMy God, these ratings are amazing. They\u2019re better than cable; they\u2019re better than network.\u201d The President \u2014 it\u2019s no secret. I\u2019m not divulging a secret about the President \u2014 he was very, very fixated on image and ratings. And he thought that the amount of attention that was given to the press briefings was really terrific. And his comment was, \u201cWow, do you see those ratings?\u201d And my feeling was, \u201cThe ratings are in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d Gupta: I want to talk about the 54 years of public service \u2014 almost 40 years, as you say, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Go back to June 5, 1981. That was a date you really talked a lot about in the book. What\u2019s the significance of that? Fauci: I was in my office in the clinical center at the NIH, and I read the June 5 [issue of the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which described five cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among five gay men in LA] and I looked at it and I said, \u201cGosh, what a curiosity. This is strange that they\u2019re all gay men.\u201d But maybe there was talk about using poppers or drugs to enhance your sexual experience that maybe somehow had the collateral effect of suppressing their immune system. But it bothered me. Boy, you really have got to suppress the immune system a lot to get pneumocystis [a serious lung infection caused by a common fungus]. \u2026 So I put it aside, saying \u201cit\u2019s probably a fluke, and it\u2019s just going to disappear.\u201d The real transforming thing came one month later, in July of 1981, when the second MMWR came; this time, 26 \u2014 curiously \u2014 all young, otherwise healthy gay men, not only from L.A. but from San Francisco and New York City, who presented not only with pneumocystis but with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and multiple other opportunistic infections. I can say \u2014 retrospectively, when you try to evaluate the different landmarks in your life, in your career \u2014 reading that MMWR totally transformed my professional career because I made the decision right there, even though I had a very successful career up to that point \u2026 I said, \u201cthis is a brand new disease. \u00a0And even though I don\u2019t know what it is, there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s an infection. \u2026 And it seems to be destroying the immune system.\u201d And here I am: boards in internal medicine, boards in infectious diseases, boards in clinical immunology. I said, \u201cIf there\u2019s one disease that I have to study, is this disease.\u201d Gupta: I don\u2019t think many people who sort of know you from Covid realize that in many ways, you went through some of these same challenges before with HIV/AIDS. Not just new disease, trying to find new therapeutics, but the activists. What was that part of your life like? Fauci: Well, naturally, people ask about the difference or similarity between the pushing back against me and the government in HIV and pushing back against the government and me as the face of Covid. \u2026 It is as different as peanuts and watermelons. It just is very different because the [HIV/AIDS] activists were trying to get the attention of the authorities, the scientific authorities and the regulatory authorities, that the time-proven way of approaching the development of interventions for a new disease doesn\u2019t work well for a disease that\u2019s rapidly killing themselves and their friends and their loved ones. So they wanted a seat at the table. \u2026 So their confrontation to us was based on a good thing. I think back to John Lewis\u2019 \u201cgood trouble\u201d versus bad trouble. They made good trouble for us because they wanted us to just put ourselves in their shoes. \u2026 Again, one of the best things I did in my career was to, instead of running away from them the way most of the scientific community did \u2026 I said to myself, \u201cThis can\u2019t work, so let me put aside the theatrics and the disruption and listen to what they have to say.\u201d And what they had to say made absolutely perfect sense to me. And I said to myself, \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I would be doing exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d That\u2019s when I invited them in to sit down with us and said \u201clet\u2019s start talking.\u201d \u2026 It became such that they became an important part of the community scientific effort to address HIV with therapeutics, with prevention, with regulation, to the point now where they\u2019re on all of our advisory committees. They\u2019re part of the discussion. And quite frankly, many of them turned out to be some of my closest friends. Gupta: But just to punctuate this point, though, at that time, going back 40 years, did you feel that way, the way you\u2019re describing it now? I mean, this idea that, \u201cHey, look, there might be something to be gained from these confrontations\u201d? Fauci: The thing that drove me was empathy, which has been something that has driven my motivation about medicine and about anything that I\u2019ve done, that goes back to my family, that I describe in the book: my parents and my training in the Jesuit schools. There\u2019s empathy for people who are in trouble and people who are suffering. When you combine empathy with listening to them \u2014 just forget the screaming and the yelling. Just listen to what they\u2019re saying. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, it just made perfect sense to me. So my interaction and my response to them, as I often get asked, is dramatically different than someone, on the basis of no evidence, accuses you of killing people or that scene of Marjorie Taylor Greene at the hearing. I mean, come on. That is nothing like what the [HIV] activists were doing. Gupta: What do you want your legacy to be? How do you want people to reflect on Dr. Anthony Fauci? Fauci: I\u2019ve thought about that, and when I think about legacies \u2014 I really, honestly mean this \u2014 I will leave that to other people to decide. I know what I\u2019ve done \u2026 with the development of drugs for HIV, with the development of the vaccine for Covid. I know that, but that\u2019s not [for me to] say, \u201cI want my legacy to be this,\u201d because people are going to have different interpretations of that \u2026 But what I would want my legacy to be, something that I am certain of, is that I have given it 100% every single day. And in the sports analogy, I can say I always left it on the field or left it on the court \u2026 I never held back. I just gave everything I could for the discipline I\u2019m in, which is science, medicine and public health. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like my legacy to be.

{"id": "2024_06_13_health_summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness", "text": "Welcome to summer in the Northern Hemisphere, with all its fun in the sun \u2013 and little critters who want to take a bite out of you. Mosquitoes and ticks can transmit vector-borne illnesses, and they are showing up with greater frequency. What can people do to protect themselves while still enjoying all that the summer months have to offer? And what treatments are available if you or your loved ones get bit? To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0Let\u2019s start by talking about tick-borne diseases, specifically Lyme disease. What is Lyme, and why is this something people should pay attention to? Dr.\u00a0Leana Wen:\u00a0In the United States,\u00a0Lyme disease is the\u00a0most common vector-borne disease\u00a0and is transmitted by ticks. People who contract Lyme disease may experience temporary symptoms similar to the flu, such as muscle aches, fever and headache. They also may develop a rash and have joint pain. The concern with Lyme is that some untreated patients progress to having long-term symptoms. These can be severe and debilitating and include ongoing nerve pain, facial paralysis and abnormal heart function. CNN: When is peak season for Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0We are in peak season now. In areas where the disease is prevalent such as the eastern United States, people can be bitten by blacklegged ticks that carry Lyme disease from spring into fall, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, there were reports that Lyme diagnoses\u00a0peaked\u00a0just before the Fourth of July holiday. CNN: Has the incidence of Lyme disease increased in recent years? Wen:\u00a0Yes. The rates of Lyme diagnoses have\u00a0doubled\u00a0from 2004 to 2018, with an increase in geographic prevalence, meaning that more areas have a high incidence of this disease compared to before.\u00a0(Newer data show an even more dramatic increase, though\u00a0surveillance methodology\u00a0has improved to capture more diagnoses.)\u00a0There are a variety of theories as to why this is the case. Most are centered on the influence of climate change \u2014 for example, that warmer temperatures expanded the tick habitat and perhaps also sped up tick life cycles. This is the same with other vector-borne diseases, like those carried by mosquitoes, which are also on the rise\u00a0likely due to rising temperatures. CNN: What can people do to reduce their odds of contracting Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0The most important step is to prevent tick bites. If you are in an area known to have Lyme, you should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when hiking. Use insect repellent that contains the ingredient DEET. After the activity, examine carefully for ticks. If you have young children and pets, take the time to examine them as well. If you find a tick, remove it, save it for identification purposes in a small jar and contact your primary care provider.\u00a0Early antibiotic therapy\u00a0can prevent you from developing Lyme disease. Also, if you end up developing symptoms, get tested right away. Antibiotic treatment can reduce the progression to chronic symptoms. CNN:\u00a0What about mosquitoes? What diseases can they carry? Wen:\u00a0Mosquitoes can transmit a lot of diseases to humans including the West Nile virus,\u00a0dengue\u00a0and malaria. West Nile\u00a0is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. While most people with the illness do not become ill, around 1 in 150 infected people develop a serious illness that can be fatal. In 2023,\u00a047 states\u00a0reported West Nile cases. In total, there were 2,406 reported instances in the US. Dengue is another virus transmitted by mosquitoes. Outbreaks are common globally, and occasionally there are cases reported in the US. Most of these cases\u00a0occur in travelers, but the types of mosquitoes that can spread dengue are found throughout many parts of the US. That means local transmission is possible. In recent years, transmission of dengue by people who have no travel history has happened in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. Another infection transmitted by mosquito that is far more common in other parts of the world is malaria. If untreated, symptoms can become severe and\u00a0progress\u00a0to kidney failure, seizures, coma and death. While most US cases involve travelers who contracted malaria from other parts of the world, locally transmitted cases have occurred, too. Last year, there were such cases reported in Florida, Texas and Maryland. CNN: You\u2019ve mentioned the US cases of malaria. What should people do who are traveling to other countries known to have these and other mosquito-borne illnesses? Wen:\u00a0I advise that people consult the\u00a0CDC\u2019s comprehensive guide, which includes recommendations for each destination country, and make an appointment with your primary care physician or travel medical clinic. Depending on where you are going, your planned activities and your personal medical history, you may be recommended to have additional vaccines or prophylactic medications. For instance, if you are going somewhere with a concern for yellow fever, you may need to get that vaccine. If you are traveling to areas with high rates of malaria, you may be recommended to start antimalarial medicines. CNN: What can everyone do to reduce their chance of getting bitten by mosquitoes? Wen:\u00a0Everyone should keep two key steps in mind. The first is to reduce bites. You can do this by covering arms and legs with clothes when possible. Clothing treated with the insecticide permethrin can provide an added layer of protection. You can also use insect repellent. Make sure to\u00a0use repellents\u00a0that are registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency. These will contain active ingredients like DEET and are safe, even for children and pregnant women. The second key step is source control \u2014 meaning to reduce the mosquitoes near you. During peak mosquito season, in the summer and early fall, use screens on windows and doors to reduce the mosquitoes in your home. In addition, it\u2019s crucial to look for standing water in your garden, as these are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Check for items around your home that could hold water \u2014 such as buckets, trash containers, tires and toys\u2014 and empty and wash them at least once a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_health_fatherhood-good-for-dads-wellness", "text": "Many arguments about why dads should do more parenting focus on why that would be good for their wives or partners and kids. How about why and how it would be good for the dads themselves? It\u2019s also a conversation we should be having. Fatherhood can be good for men, psychologically speaking. As I discovered while doing interviews for my new book, \u201cWhen You Care: The Unexpected Magic of Caring for Others,\u201d the experience of being a dad allows men to feel feelings and behave in ways that mainstream masculinity standards often prohibit. At the office or on the ball court, men are expected to deny or conceal their vulnerability, empathy and sensitivity. Do so and risk being thought of as feminine or weak. But with their kids, dads have a chance to explore all these sides and more, often away from the scrutiny of the public eye. They get to be sweet, soft and compassionate, unafraid to show tenderness without fear of judgment or rejection. Many are better for it. \u201cWhen we put men in caregiving roles, whether they chose to be in it or are forced into it, it gives men a chance to reach inside and embody parts of themselves that are already there, but often not widely shown nor reinforced by greater society,\u201d Matt Englar-Carlson, director of the Center for Boys and Men at California State University, Fullerton, told me in an interview for my book. Take Eric Gardner, for example. He is a former company commander in the US Army who found that caring for his daughters has allowed him to uncover long-repressed feelings and work through trauma. Fatherhood pushed Gardner to break away from the stoicism and aggression encouraged during his military career and learn how to be deeply attentive to others and try to understand their weakness and fears. Eventually, he realized he needed to turn these skills on himself to move past the shame of his post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis and figure out what would help him. \u201cBeing with my daughters made me realize that I had to understand myself,\u201d Gardner said. Dads really are doing more care It may not always feel like fathers are doing more parenting, but they are. \u201cIf you are a woman who has to constantly fight with her husband to get him to help with the kids or do housework, I am sure it is very frustrating,\u201d Stephanie Coontz, a family studies historian, told me. \u201cBut, as a historian, if you step back and look at what men were not doing and refusing to do 20 or 30 years ago and compare that to what they are doing now \u2014 from a historical perspective it is quite a turnaround.\u201d Dads still do less parenting than moms, but we are getting closer than ever. One cross-national study found that dads spent an average of 16 minutes a day caring for their kids in 1965. By 2012 that number rose to 59 minutes a day. By comparison, moms went from 54 minutes a day in 1965 to 104 minutes in 2012. Sadly, this shift didn\u2019t happen because men suddenly realized parenthood is a meaningful and valuable \u2014 something they wanted to experience firsthand. Or, because they wanted to give moms a break. Instead, it is because women went to work outside the home. \u201cNothing has had more of an impact on men getting more involved in caregiving than women entering the workforce in greater numbers,\u201d said Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work & Family. If you find this reason frustrating \u2014 well, me, too! But it helps to remember that men didn\u2019t avoid hands-on parenting exclusively because they weren\u2019t interested. There are social costs to men doing more care, which has long been considered antithetical to masculinity. I grew up watching a movie about a full-time dad and the high jinks that ensued when a man took on women\u2019s work. What was it called? \u201cMr. Mom.\u201d For years I remember people teasing men who took on a heavy load of parenting with this nickname. The implication was that doing care makes men more feminine, and being feminine is a joke. Such stigma follows men to the workplace, where they are financially rewarded for being a dad, but only if they don\u2019t make any parenthood-related requests from their employers \u2014 such as having to work from home when a kid is sick or leave early for a child\u2019s orthodontist appointment. Should that happen, they tend to be penalized just like moms, Harrington said. Despite the professional and cultural obstacles, today\u2019s dads continue to do more and more parenting for both practical reasons \u2014 Mom has a job, too! \u2014 and personal ones. They like it. In his research, Harrington found that more than two-thirds of dads said they wish they could spend more time with their kids, even when they\u2019re already spending a lot of time with them. Other studies reach similar conclusions. Also, dads find parenting \u201cextremely important to their identity,\u201d and enjoyable and rewarding nearly identically as often moms do. Breaking free of gender scripts Some of this joy and satisfaction comes from the way fatherhood allows men to break free of gender scripts, experts say. One reason is that traditional masculinity isn\u2019t good for anyone, according to a 2018 American Psychological Association report featuring guidelines for treating boys and men. \u201cThe main thrust of the subsequent research is that traditional masculinity \u2014 marked by stoicism, competitiveness, dominance and aggression \u2014 is, on the whole, harmful,\u201d according to the APA. Indeed, the patriarchy has rewarded men. But the type of masculinity required to make it in a patriarchal world comes with a cost. Traditional masculinity is negatively correlated\u00a0with poor physical health and mental health, lower life satisfaction and lower self-esteem. Englar-Carlson said he believes that caring for others gives men a chance to find justification for behaving in ways that have long been associated with the feminine. \u201cCaregiving gives men an opportunity to combat the shame associated with not being tough enough, which is often a cause of the internal conflict men often experience when they are in nontraditionally male roles. It can also give men an opportunity to feel helpful, worthwhile, and like something matters,\u201d he said. At online and in-person gatherings for Fathering Together, a dad advocacy organization, fathers often work through their desire to try to be more sensitive, empathetic dads. Brian Anderson, cofounder of the organization, told me that these dads rely on each other to learn how to express vulnerability and move past the \u201cfather knows best\u201d approach to parenthood. Their goal is to be more empathetic and sensitive. For many, these conversations are a rare opportunity to shed their macho skins and discover what is underneath. Learning the power of vulnerability David Bullman, a member of the Fathering Together community, was raised in a US Army post in Colorado Springs, where traditional masculinity had a stronghold. Bullman responded to his father\u2019s expectations with rebellion; his self-described tough-guy lifestyle, including drugs and crime, eventually landed him in prison at age 22. When he got out a decade later, determined to take a different path, he became romantically committed to a woman he knew as a child and reconnected with while in prison. Two years later, they had a child. Caring for his daughter woke up the tender and receptive parts of himself that he had long buried. \u201cMy whole world had changed. I\u2019m not the hard-ass I used to be. I had to learn how to have feelings and have emotions and how to be human and not a robot,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause with the kids you can\u2019t just turn it all off. I had to learn to ask for help, because for a long time I would try to keep that in, and think I got to learn this on my own and do this on my own,\u201d he said. To raise his child, \u201cI went from being a stone-cold a**hole \u00a0to being the complete opposite. I had to change everything about me.\u201d Elissa Strauss writes about the politics and culture of parenthood.

{"id": "2024_06_19_health_microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness", "text": "Scientists have found microplastics in human penises for the first time, as concerns over the tiny particles\u2019 proliferation and potential health effects mount. Seven different kinds of microplastics were found in four out of five samples of penis tissue taken from five different men as part of a study published in IJIR: Your Sexual Medicine Journal on Wednesday. Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. They form when larger plastics break down,\u00a0either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. Some minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, and evidence is mounting that they are increasingly present in our bodies. Study lead author Ranjith Ramasamy, an expert in reproductive urology who conducted the research while working at the University of Miami, told CNN that he used a previous study that found evidence of microplastics in the human heart as a basis for his research. Ramasamy said he wasn\u2019t surprised to find microplastics in the penis, as it is a \u201cvery vascular organ,\u201d like the heart. The samples were taken from study participants who had been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction (ED) and were in the hospital to undergo surgery for penile implants to treat the condition at the University of Miami between August and September 2023. The samples were then analyzed using chemical imaging, which revealed that four of the five men had microplastics in their penile tissue. Seven different types of microplastics were detected, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) the most prevalent, according to the study.  Now their presence has been confirmed, more research is needed to investigate potential links to conditions such as ED, Ramasamy said. \u201cWe need to identify whether microplastics are linked to ED and if there is a level beyond which it causes pathology and what types of microplastics are pathologic,\u201d he said. As for the wider implications of the findings, Ramasamy said he hoped the study would \u201ccreate more awareness about the presence of foreign bodies within human organs and foster more research surrounding this topic.\u201d Prior research has found that one liter of bottled water \u2014 the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters \u2014 contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles. \u201cI think we need to be mindful about consuming water and food from plastic bottles and containers and try and limit the use until more research is done to identify levels that could cause pathology,\u201d Ramasamy said. Toxicologist Matthew J. Campen told CNN that this is \u201can interesting study that confirms the ubiquity of plastics in the body.\u201d \u201cAs we are trying to understand the potential health effects of plastics, this is another concerning paper,\u201d said Campen,\u00a0a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cPlastics are generally non-reactive with the cells and chemicals of our bodies, but they could be physically disruptive to the many processes our bodies undertake for normal function, including functions related to erection and sperm production.\u201d Campen coauthored a study published in May that found that human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas. The study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers of males who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said at the time the study was published. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d There are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to microplastics. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

{"id": "2024_06_20_health_fda-gene-therapy-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration has given the green light for the first gene therapy that treats a rare form of muscular dystrophy to be used in most people who have the disease and a certain genetic mutation. Last year, the drug \u2013 Elevidys, from the biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics \u2013 was approved to treat only children ages 4 and 5 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, one of the most severe forms of inherited muscular dystrophies, who have a confirmed mutation in a gene called DMD that is associated with muscle strength. The FDA announced Thursday that it had given traditional approval for Elevidys for ambulatory people 4 and older with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene and accelerated approval for non-ambulatory people 4 and older with this mutation. There\u2019s not enough data on safety to support its use in children under 4, the agency says. Elevidys, given as a one-time intravenous infusion, costs about $3.2 million per patient. Although eye-popping, such a\u00a0price tag\u00a0isn\u2019t out of step with other one-time gene therapies, which have topped\u00a0$3 million\u00a0per patient in recent years. But Elevidys appears to be the second most expensive drug in the world, after the $3.5 million hemophilia treatment\u00a0Hemgenix.  Elevidys was previously approved under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval pathway, which clears medicines for diseases where they\u2019re urgently needed based on data suggesting that they\u2019re likely to confer clinical benefits. The drug has been closely monitored since that approval, and in October, Sarepta Therapeutics released results from a confirmatory trial showing that the therapy missed its primary goal \u2013 a measure of how well kids can move \u2013 but was successful on a number of secondary measures. The approval addressed \u201can urgent unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a devastating condition with limited treatment options, that leads to a progressive deterioration of an individual\u2019s health over time,\u201d Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a news release at the time. It was the first time a therapy of this nature \u2013 a one-time treatment that delivers a working copy of a gene to make up for one that leads to disease \u2013 had been cleared under the accelerated approval framework. The move came after emotional\u00a0testimonials\u00a0from families at an FDA advisory committee meeting. Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes progressive muscle weakness that can rob children of their ability to walk by the time they\u2019re teenagers, and many don\u2019t live well into their 30s. It primarily affects boys because of the way it\u2019s inherited, affecting an estimated 1 in 3,300 boys. The Muscular Dystrophy Association trusts the decision of the FDA, which weighs the risks and benefits of the drug, said Dr. Sharon Hesterlee, chief researcher at the association. \u201cUltimately, what we want is what\u2019s best for our patient community \u2013 and that\u2019s balancing that risk-benefit ratio appropriately,\u201d she said. Potential risks of Elevidys include increases in certain liver enzyme levels and acute serious liver injury. The most common side effects of the drug include vomiting, nausea, increased liver function tests and fever. Yet a major benefit is that the gene therapy provides another option for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and it\u2019s administered just once. There is no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and outside of Elevidys, treatments are limited. Other\u00a0approaches\u00a0may include steroid medications,\u00a0certain\u00a0drugs that change how the muscle cells \u201cread\u201d the mutated gene, physical therapy or surgery to correct spinal curvature, Hesterlee said. \u201cRight now, the\u00a0main\u00a0standard of care for Duchenne is corticosteroids, like prednisone,\u00a0although there are some newer drugs available. These kids are\u00a0still\u00a0often on chronic doses of\u00a0steroids\u00a0for many, many years,\u201d she said, adding that the side effects of corticosteroids \u2013 such as weight gain, behavioral issues and increased risk of bone breakage \u2013 are not ideal. Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be difficult to treat, she said, and having more treatment options that are proven to be effective remains important. \u201cMuscle makes up a significant amount of your body mass. So when you have a disease like this, it\u2019s really impacting a lot of tissue. So anything you do, you\u2019re looking at trying to bring back or stop a disease process that\u2019s really throughout the body, and it\u2019s a disease that\u2019s progressive, so you lose more and more muscle over time,\u201d Hesterlee said. \u201cThat\u2019s made it pretty challenging, but we\u2019ve certainly learned a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t overlook the fact that these boys are living so much longer and doing so much better. Even 20 years ago, they were dying in their teens, and many of them are now living into their 30s. They\u2019re going to college; they have girlfriends; some of them have gotten married. These are things that weren\u2019t happening years ago. So we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/fda-gene-therapy-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness", "text": "When her daughter was 6 years old, Kelceymarie Warner began to notice her child\u2019s hesitation before bedtime. \u201cHer body would be a little more tense, and she would hyperventilate if you pushed the subject too soon, she really needed to be slowly moved into the cycle.\u201d Warner, who is a parent to four young daughters, believes that sticking to a nightly routine is the best way for her kids to have an easy transition to bedtime. But when her 6-year-old was experiencing bedtime anxiety, Warner had to make some additions to her routine. Warner is not the only one \u2014 many parents know all too well what can be a nightly struggle to get their young children to bed. A new C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health reinforces this common difficulty, revealing that 1 in 4 parents said their child has trouble getting to sleep because they are anxious or worried. Over one-third of parents reported that their child doesn\u2019t stay asleep throughout the night and often or occasionally wakes up upset or crying. \u201cFrom 1 year of age to 6 years of age, kids change a lot. The different phases that they go to are often pretty predictable: They\u2019re scared of the dark, or as kids develop and their imagination develops \u2026 now they\u2019re scared of monsters,\u201d said Sarah Clark, Mott poll co-director and a research scientist in pediatrics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt can be all sorts of things, and so often with kids, and I would argue adults too, some of those anxieties seem to come out at night.\u201d The Mott Poll was conducted in February with 781 parents who have at least one child age 1 to 6 years old. Almost half reported their child leaving their bed and moving to the parent\u2019s bed some or most nights, while 1 in 3 parents said their child often or occasionally insists that they stay in the room until the child falls asleep. But some of these habits may be causing more trouble than the temporary relief they provide, Clark said. While a child may feel safe knowing the parent is in the room, they could later wake up and not be able to go back to sleep on their own, she added. How to help an anxious child with bedtime Warner said her child\u2019s bedtime anxiety may have been caused by the major changes that happened when her youngest daughter was in the neonatal intensive care unit for three months. \u201cMy husband and I were gone for extended periods during the day and even during the night because we wanted to be with a new baby who was born three months early \u2014 but we also needed to be there with our other children. I think she really struggled with a major change in her routine, and it just kind of triggered this very difficult time for her especially.\u201d Warner began incorporating activities into her daughter\u2019s bedtime routine that would promote relaxation and reassurance, such as drinking herbal tea after bathtime, reading a story together and saying nightly affirmations like \u201cI am loved\u201d and \u201cI am important.\u201d The new routine took longer than usual, sometimes up to an hour, but now, a little over a year later, her daughter is able to go through some parts of the routine on her own, and is able to better self-soothe, Warner said. She had posted her advice for other parents that may be facing a similar scenario\u00a0on her TikTok\u00a0account in 2023. The most important factor in getting kids to bed is consistency and sticking with a bedtime routine, Mott Poll co-director Clark said. Ninety percent of polled parents reported having an established and consistent bedtime routine. But some 27% described getting their child to bed was difficult, and those parents were more likely to not have a bedtime routine, stay in the room until the child fell asleep and keep the television or a video on. \u201cWe know that young children really resonate with consistency and routine, and getting ready for bed helps their body and their brain know that this is the time to start winding down,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Hartstein, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. She studies sleep and circadian health in early childhood and was not involved in the Mott poll. Hartstein recommends limiting media use at night, especially avoiding exciting content that could stimulate the child\u2019s brain and make it harder to wind down. A\u00a0January 2022 study\u00a0that Hartstein led found that children around this age group were more sensitive to light at night than adults are, and it could interfere with a child\u2019s production of natural melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Parents could find it beneficial to dim the lights an hour before bed, which would trigger a mental cue that it\u2019s time to get ready to sleep soon, she added. As for staying in the child\u2019s bedroom until they fall asleep, Clark recommends leaving the room and returning to check in every few minutes, which lets the child know that someone will be making sure they are safe every so often, but not staying in the room indefinitely. It\u2019s common for young children to experience sleep issues, especially as preschool-age children begin to reduce or drop naptime, Hartstein said. If parents are especially worried or see their child struggling during the day because they are sleepy, they should talk with their pediatrician, she added. Giving melatonin to young children The poll also found 1 in 5 parents often or sometimes give their child melatonin before bedtime, which came as a surprise given the younger age range of 1 to 6 years old, Clark said. \u201cClearly, this is something that people are feeling the need to try with younger kids. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a signal of how disruptive sleep problems can be for the whole family.\u201d It isn\u2019t recommended to give melatonin to children younger than age of 3, since many sleep issues with children that age are behavioral, according to\u00a0Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0If a parent is considering giving melatonin to their child, they should speak with their pediatrician first, Hartstein said. \u201c(One) concern is that what you\u2019re teaching them is that if they can\u2019t sleep, they should just take a medication, at a time when they should really be developing these healthy sleep habits that will carry them through childhood,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_health_eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness", "text": "While holidays are often marked by parties, shared meals, gift-giving and special outfits, experts say there\u2019s health benefits to remembering the meaning behind the celebration. The three-day holiday of Eid-al-Adha commemorates the story in the Quran of God appearing to Ibrahim, or Abraham, in a dream and commanding him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. The holiday, which starts on Sunday this year, is determined by the lunar calendar, and Saudi Arabia announces the dates according to its time zone. Muslims believe that as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, an angel of God stopped him and gave him a ram to sacrifice in place of his son. A version of the story also appears in both Christian and Jewish scriptures. Many people kick off the holiday by calling and texting Muslims they know throughout the world with \u201cEid Mubarak,\u201d which means blessed feast or festival. Families typically attend a special morning prayer at the local mosque and then gather with loved ones to feast over a holiday meal and exchange money or gifts. Others may make a obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca \u2014 the Hajj pilgrimage \u2014 to visit the holiest sites in Islam, including the mountainous region where Abraham\u2019s feted act took place. Muslims also honor Abraham\u2019s sacrifice with udhiya or qurbani \u2014 sacrificing a cow, sheep or goat and then sharing the meat with friends and family and offering it to those in need. Many people also send donations to or place qurbani orders in Muslim countries to feed disadvantaged people. These traditions are reminders that letting go, having faith and doing good deeds will be rewarded, said Dr. Yasmine Saad, a clinical psychologist and author in New York City. This message and the pious and social acts of Eid, such as celebrating with friends and family and spreading acts of charity exemplify mindfulness and can be helpful when implemented regularly. \u201cEid is a reminder that we should strive to add more of this balance in our day-to-day,\u201d said Dr. Rania Awaad, clinical professor of psychiatry and director of the Stanford Muslim Mental Health & Islamic Psychology lab. Here are some mindful takeaways from the Eid holiday that you can include in your routine \u2013 no matter what you believe in. At its core, mindfulness is staying in the present, focusing on one\u2019s thoughts, feelings and surroundings without judgment. The practice of mindfulness carries multiple health and wellness benefits such as decreasing pain, reducing stress and easing feelings of depression. Stay hopeful and look for silver linings The story of Abraham is not easily transferable to everyday life as it was an example of an extreme hurdle, but the lesson of pushing through a hardship and carrying on with resilience is relatable.\u00a0 \u201cIslam really develops this notion of faithfulness and patience in the face of a trial,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Reynolds, professor of Islamic Studies and Theology at University of Notre Dame. In Islamic spirituality, this mindset \u201cbecomes a real important way for Muslims to carry on through trials, suffering, oppression, evil that they suffer in life.\u201d Reynolds describes this mindset as a \u201csustaining force\u201d for Muslims. And it\u2019s not limited to Islam \u2014 anyone can reflect on one\u2019s current circumstances and look for positivity as a way to get through the hard parts. Do your part and trust the process During Abraham\u2019s challenging ordeal, his wife was also being tested. According to Islamic narrative, she was left alone in the desert in present-day Mecca with their son so that Abraham could follow God\u2019s command. In this story, the baby was in desperate need of nourishment, so the mother ran between two hills seven times to try to procure water for the baby. Eventually water \u2014 of which the well has become the source of holy water for Muslims \u2014 sprung up from the ground where the baby\u2019s feet lay. It sounds like a miraculous happening, but when applied to daily life, one can view it as doing one\u2019s work and trusting that things fall into place. Abraham\u2019s wife did her part by trying her best to search for nourishment for her child. Feeding others \u2018feeds the soul\u2019 Muslims commemorate the day with the sacrifice of an animal, and they take it a step further by making a meal of it for their own families and for people less fortunate. In this way they venerate Abraham while underscoring sharing and giving. At the root of qurbani is creating a shared experience while giving to others. \u201cA lot of people are feeling purposeless, and they feel that what they do in their life doesn\u2019t hit home,\u201d Saad said. \u201cGiving to others, giving to poor (people), sharing, making an impact in other people\u2019s lives always feeds the soul.\u201d You can make cooking for others, volunteering at a soup kitchen and donating your money, time or goods a regular \u2014 but impactful \u2014 part of your routine. Giving can \u201crealign people so their mind will be different, they will think more positive thoughts, their bodies will feel better, they will have a smile on their face,\u201d Saad said. By stepping out of one\u2019s routine and giving to others, it can help make \u201cyou feel you have an impact, you help, you have significance.\u201d This sense of purpose and meaning contributes to living a happier and longer life, according to an expert. In a larger sense, kindness contributes to one\u2019s sense of community and belonging, and donating to others has proven to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health, according to studies. It takes a village Humans are inherently social creatures, and loneliness and social isolationa are not good for one\u2019s brain, body or spirit, according to research. Even the size of a person\u2019s social network can impact health. Smaller networks are linked to larger feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can impact disease and death rates. Further, more positive experiences in social relationships is generally linked to better coping and lower stress. Because Eid is celebrated over a period of three days, the holiday emphasizes socializing and connecting with others for longer than just an afternoon or a day. These kinds of \u201csocial ceremonies\u201d can be helpful, said Dr. David Spiegel, psychiatrist and director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford Medicine. People have survived because \u201cwe\u2019ve formed communities, and support one another, and protect one another,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a community act that gives you a sense of doing something and doing something together with other people does help people to manage stress better.\u201d Connecting with one\u2019s community and expanding that circle, or even in smaller ways such as making time for a friend can be healthy. Fill your cup While going on the Hajj pilgrimage might be spiritually fulfilling for some Muslims, it may not be practical for everyone to take that journey. But creating space that brings in any sort of fulfillment can usher in new, exciting energy. Whether it\u2019s reading a good book or going on a yoga retreat for example, it can be something you do for your growth and gratification.

We often obsess over sex and our performance, but how many take steps to ensure we\u2019re in top shape for the long haul? If we don\u2019t take care of our health today, we won\u2019t enjoy a healthy sex life tomorrow. It\u2019s crucial to think about your sexual health to avoid regrets in the future. Future-proofing yourself is key. Sexual health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Chronic stress, poor diet, lack of exercise and other lifestyle factors can significantly affect your sexual health. If you\u2019re experiencing persistent problems, don\u2019t hesitate to speak with a doctor. Early intervention can prevent minor issues from becoming significant obstacles. Seeking help is a sign of strength, and a health care professional can provide the guidance and treatment options you need for a lifetime of good sexual function. The effects of high stress Whether as a result of personal problems or trouble at work, chronic stress is a major contributor to reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. With stress, the body produces elevated levels of cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production. Studies\u00a0have shown that men with emotional problems or stress are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction in the form of either premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction and/or low sexual desire. It\u2019s crucial to incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine: regular exercise, meditation, proper sleep and hobbies that you enjoy. Seeking professional help from a therapist can also provide effective coping strategies. What you eat Poor eating habits can lead to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular issues, all of which can adversely affect sexual function. Research indicates that men with a waist circumference over 40 inches are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome, which is linked to erectile dysfunction. Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains can make a substantial difference. Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding ultraprocessed foods can further enhance your sexual health. (To put it simply, the more fast food you eat, the faster you will lose your sex life.) How you move Lack of physical activity is detrimental to heart health, which is crucial for maintaining sexual function. Regular exercise helps improve blood flow, which is essential for achieving and maintaining an erection. Studies suggest that men who exercise regularly report improved erectile function compared with inactive men. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, along with strength training exercises, to keep your body in top shape. The more you exercise at the gym, the more exercise you will get in the bedroom. If you smoke Smoking is a leading cause of erectile dysfunction due to its negative impact on blood vessels and blood flow. The toxins in cigarettes can damage the lining of blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the penis. Research shows that men who smoke are about twice\u00a0as likely to develop erectile dysfunction as nonsmokers. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your sexual health. Consider resources such as nicotine replacement therapy, support groups and counseling to help you quit. How you sleep Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, can severely affect testosterone levels and lead to sexual dysfunction. A study found that men with severe sleep apnea had significantly lower testosterone levels compared with those without the condition. Prioritizing good sleep hygiene is essential. If you suspect a sleep disorder, consult a health care provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, which may include lifestyle changes or medical interventions. Mental health issues Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety can have a profound impact on sexual desire and performance. About 20% of patients with anxiety and up to 40% of men with depression report experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction. Mental health conditions can lead to a decrease in libido and difficulties in achieving or maintaining an erection. Seeking help from mental health professionals can be highly beneficial. Therapy and medication can significantly improve both mental health and sexual function. Hormonal imbalances Hormonal imbalances, particularly low testosterone, can negatively affect sexual health. Testosterone levels naturally decline with age, but conditions such as hypogonadism can accelerate this process. Studies suggest that about 20% of men over the age of 60 have low testosterone levels. Regular checkups with a health care provider can help monitor hormone levels. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications or hormone replacement therapy to restore balance. Side effects of certain medications Certain medications, including those for hypertension and depression, can cause sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Beta-blockers, for example, can decrease libido and lead to erectile issues. It\u2019s important to discuss potential side effects with your doctor. They may adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication that has fewer effects on sexual health. Chronic illness Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease can significantly affect sexual function. Diabetic men, for instance, are three times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction compared with nondiabetic men. Managing chronic illnesses effectively with the help of a health care provider is crucial. Doing so includes following prescribed treatments, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and monitoring yourself regularly to keep conditions under control. Relationship issues Problems within a relationship can cause stress and decreased sexual desire. Communication breakdowns, unresolved conflicts and lack of intimacy can all contribute to sexual dysfunction. Open communication with your partner is key to addressing these issues. Consider couples counseling to help resolve underlying problems and improve your relationship and sexual health. Conclusion Guys, taking care of your sexual health isn\u2019t just about avoiding problems today; it\u2019s about ensuring you\u2019re ready for action tomorrow and beyond. Think about it \u2014 how many times have you stressed over performance but ignored the basics that keep you in the game? It\u2019s time to make a change. Managing stress, eating right, staying active and kicking bad habits such as smoking are the foundation of a healthy sex life. These aren\u2019t just empty words \u2014 they\u2019re steps you can take now to ensure you\u2019re not sidelined later. And if you\u2019re dealing with persistent issues, don\u2019t tough it out alone. Talking to a doctor isn\u2019t admitting defeat; it\u2019s making a smart play. There\u2019s no better time to focus on your well-being than during National Men\u2019s Health Month in June. It\u2019s dedicated to encouraging men to take control of their health and make the necessary changes to improve their lives. Use this opportunity to schedule that checkup you\u2019ve been putting off, start a new exercise routine or seek help for any health issues you\u2019ve been ignoring. You\u2019ve got one body and one life \u2014 make sure both are in peak condition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/health/men-sexual-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_depression-types-brain-treatments-study-wellness", "text": "For some people with depression, finding the right medication can be a process of trial and error lasting for months or even years, which can worsen symptoms. But what if doctors, when diagnosing someone with depression, could assess exactly how depression is affecting a patient\u2019s brain and prescribe a treatment that gets it right the first time? Scientists may be a step closer to that reality, thanks to new research that has identified six subtypes \u2014 or \u201cbiotypes\u201d \u2014 of major depression via brain imaging combined with machine learning. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, also tested how three of those biotypes responded to different antidepressants and therapies. \u201cThere are currently no tests available to help pinpoint what type of depression (people) have, or, I think especially importantly, what treatment might be most suitable for them,\u201d said Dr. Leanne Williams, the study\u2019s senior author and the Vincent V.C. Woo Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. \u201cThe current situation is we rely on a person to tell us what they\u2019re experiencing and for the physician or therapist to observe symptoms and come to a diagnosis.\u201d About 280 million people worldwide and 26 million people in the United States have depression, which is a leading cause of disability. Some 30% to 40% of people with depression do not experience symptom improvement after trying one treatment, according to the study. And about 30% of people diagnosed with depression go on to experience treatment-resistant depression when the disorder doesn\u2019t improve after multiple treatment attempts. \u201cThat motivated this study \u2014 to have a whole new way to more quickly get the right treatment, to figure out the right treatment for each person the first time,\u201d said Williams, who is also the director of the Stanford Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness. Williams lost her partner to a decades-long struggle with depression in 2015 and for more than 20 years has focused her work on individualized mental health care.\u00a0 Mapping depression in the brain The authors used data from 801 adult participants who were previously diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and 137 healthy control group participants. The authors used functional MRI \u2014 magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 to measure participants\u2019 brain activity when they were at rest doing nothing, focusing on brain regions already known to play a role in depression, and on the connections between those regions. They also monitored brain activity when participants, who were in their mid-30s on average, engaged in various tests that evaluated their cognitive and emotional functioning. The authors also randomly assigned 250 of the participants to receive behavioral talk therapy or one of three commonly used antidepressants: venlafaxine, escitalopram or sertraline. The six biotypes of depression the authors found include one characterized by hyperactivity in cognitive regions, which was associated with more anxiety, negative bias, threat dysregulation and anhedonia than other biotypes. Threat dysregulation refers to how people manage their reactions to their fears, such as social interactions, Williams said. Anhedonia is the lack of interest in or enjoyment of life experiences. Participants with this biotype also performed worse on executive function tasks that assessed how well they could manage thoughts or behaviors, make decisions or suppress distraction, Williams said. They also had the best response to the antidepressant venlafaxine. Another biotype was marked by higher levels of brain connectivity in three regions associated with depression and problem-solving. Those with this biotype also made errors in executive function tests but did do well on cognitive tasks. They found their symptoms better alleviated by behavioral talk therapy, which teaches skills for better addressing daily problems. The higher connectivity in these brain regions might be what helped participants with that biotype more readily adopt new skills, study coauthor Dr. Jun Ma said in a news release. There was also a biotype distinguished by lower levels of activity in the brain circuit that manages attention. This biotype was linked with more mistakes on tasks requiring sustained attention, and less of a chance of improving with therapy. People with this biotype may need medication for the dysfunction first so they can gain more from therapy, said Ma, the Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago. The authors also found a biotype characterized by high emotional reactivity, meaning the brains of participants in this group were more affected by emotional inputs such as their own emotions or people\u2019s facial expressions, Williams said. One other biotype was associated with lower activity in cognitive brain regions and less connectivity in emotional regions, meaning these participants had difficulty responding to cognitive information and regulating negative emotions. Those last two biotypes didn\u2019t respond to the medications or therapy, which suggests other options may be needed for people with those types, Williams said. \u201cIn other studies, we\u2019re finding they respond to some of the newer treatments being developed.\u201d The sixth biotype identified didn\u2019t differ from brain scans of the same region in people without depression. Williams said she thinks this finding could mean the full range of brain biology underlying depression hasn\u2019t been entirely discovered. \u201cDepression is a lot of different things with a lot of different causes, biological changes and treatments,\u201d said Dr. Richard Keefe, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study \u201ctakes a positive step in the direction\u201d of figuring these things out, Keefe added via email. Hurdles and next steps The study, though \u201csophisticated and very well done,\u201d does have several key problems, including the low number of people enrolled in treatment, said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, the Dorothy and Marty Silverman Chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \u201cIt needs to be thought of as a very preliminary study that needs to be replicated.\u201d Additionally, more diverse samples are needed, said Alpert, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study and is a professor of psychiatry, neuroscience and pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Most participants were White, and 2% were Black. But the most important next step is a study that tests the authors\u2019 hypothesis \u2014 that if patients have particular biotypes, they\u2019ll do better on a specific treatment \u2014 and tracks participants over time, said Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Council on Research. The 250 treatment participants weren\u2019t randomized on the basis of their biotypes. So, what Alpert recommends the authors do next is assign people to treatments based on their biotypes and see whether those participants have better outcomes from that method than if they had been assigned to a treatment according to clinical judgment without knowledge of their biotype. Another issue is that the study investigated only one form of psychotherapy and three medications; in the real world, there are many of each, Alpert said. The medications were also all serotonin-based, but there are a few other classes of antidepressants. Studies can only do so much at a time, Alpert acknowledged, but addressing these shortcomings incrementally would help continue advancements toward precision psychiatry. What these findings mean for you The study\u2019s methods and findings are years away from being applied to direct patient care, experts said, but there is funding for such efforts. \u201cSince 2009, the National Institute of Mental Health has been invested in using basic science, including functional brain imaging like in this study, for identifying the causes of mental illness through approaches that delve deeper than the traditional diagnostic approaches,\u201d Keefe said. This month, Williams was awarded an $18.8 million grant as part of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Individually Measured Phenotypes to Advance Computational Translation in Mental Health Initiative. The grant supports a five-year project involving 4,500 participants, which is centered on the development of a better diagnosis and treatment tool for depression biotypes. The new study\u2019s approach has begun to be experimentally implemented at a Stanford clinic, Williams said. \u201cWhen we use it in that setting, we can effectively double the chance of someone getting better,\u201d she said, taking the odds from around 30% of people improving with the traditional approach to about 75% with the more precise method. This method isn\u2019t intended to replace or be the primary choice for assessments of individual cases of depression, Williams said. It\u2019s another piece that can be added to the puzzle that also includes symptom information, clinical interviews and more. For now, people with depression should know \u201cthere is continued progress being made\u201d toward efficiently getting patients effective treatment, Alpert said. If you\u2019re struggling, talk with a mental health professional about your options. One powerful effect these findings could have immediately is to reduce stigma, Williams said. For people who think their depression is just due to them \u201cnot trying hard enough,\u201d she added, understanding the disorder through the lens of objective measures of brain function could be \u201cdeeply helpful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/depression-types-brain-treatments-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_abortion-clinics-in-banned-states-pivot", "text": "In the last couple years, Houston Women\u2019s Reproductive Services scaled down from nearly 5,000 square-feet to an 800-square-foot location. The Texas clinic cut more than a dozen full-time employees down to a medical director and three part-time staff members. It\u2019s no longer able to provide abortions, but it changed its focus and stayed open. \u201cI was willing to make whatever sacrifices needed to be made to keep our head above water, just keep the doors open and the lights on, and be able to provide care to these people who desperately need our help,\u201d said clinic administrator Kathy Kleinfeld. It\u2019s one example of the shift to the the country\u2019s abortion landscape since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision ended the federal right to abortion two years ago. Since then, 14 states have near-total bans on abortion. Clinics can no longer provide abortions in more than a quarter of US states. Although the total number of facilities that provide abortions in the United States hasn\u2019t changed that much \u2013 only a couple dozen clinics have closed completely \u2013 the number of closures doesn\u2019t always capture the upheaval. States that enacted abortion bans generally had few clinics to start with. Since Dobbs, some packed up and moved to places where they can still provide care, but may require patients to travel further. Still other clinics remain open, but in a different capacity. Kleinfeld\u2019s clinic in Houston pivoted to broader reproductive health, including pre- and post-abortion care for those who travel out of state or self-manage their abortions. In the months before the Supreme Courts\u2019 Dobbs decision, there were about 3,000 abortions a month in Houston and Kleinfeld said she knew that need wouldn\u2019t stop once Texas\u2019 trigger law banned abortions. \u201cThere were a lot of different ways it could have gone; most of all would have involved closing,\u201d Kleinfeld said of her clinic in Houston. \u201cThat was just not something I was willing to do.\u201d Few clinics to start with In 2021, there were about 750 abortion clinics in the United States, according to data from the University of California San Francisco\u2019s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.\u00a0Less than a tenth \u2013 only about 60 of them \u2013 were in the 14 states that have since banned abortion. \u201cThe reason that banned states did not have many facilities to begin with is that they were hostile to abortion and put up barriers to providing abortion services even before Dobbs,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College. Her research focuses on the US abortion landscape, and she has been tracking travel distances to abortion facilities. These states were more likely to have regulations like mandatory waiting periods and parental involvement that created challenges for people seeking abortions, as well as logistical hurdles for providers, such as those in Texas. \u201cThis is basic economic theory,\u201d Myers said. Strict regulatory environments created high costs to entry for providers, leaving space for only the few that could effectively scale their services up enough to survive, she said. The Dobbs decision wasn\u2019t the first time abortion clinics in Texas confronted their fate. About half of the abortion clinics there closed in 2013 when the state legislature passed a law that required them to meet hospital-like standards. The US Supreme Court overturned those restrictions, but dozens of doors closed remained shuttered. \u201cHaving lived through that, I knew all the other clinics \u2013 the very few that were left \u2013 I knew they were going to close\u201d after the Dobbs decision, Kleinfeld said. By 2023, the total number of facilities providing abortions in the US was down to about 725, the UCSF data shows. But each clinic closure has a ripple of negative effects, experts say, especially in regions where services have already been suppressed. \u201cWe need every single abortion clinic in this country. There really aren\u2019t enough for the number of people who need care,\u201d said Nikki Madsen, executive director at Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion care providers and other stakeholders. \u201cWhen we treat abortion in an isolated way, we miss the broader cost of closing a clinic.\u201d About two-thirds of the clinics in states with bans have stayed open in some capacity, the UCSF data shows. Clinics often provide other reproductive health-care services and are sometimes the only touchpoint that people have with the health-care system. \u201cIndependent clinics have always been based in their communities. They really understand the communities where they\u2019re located and the people that they serve in those communities,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cSo over this time, the clinics have been really working to figure out how they can continue to serve the same communities that they were serving pre-Dobbs in an increasingly hostile environment.\u201d Clinics move to the front lines While some clinics have held their ground with a shift in focus, a handful of others have relocated into key access states or opened new locations. \u201cProviders are going to locations that place them as close as possible to the places where people are coming out of banned states in search of abortion,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThey are primarily locating in places that put them on the front lines to receive patients, very strategically in southern Illinois, in New Mexico, in Virginia.\u201d The number of abortion clinics in New Mexico more than doubled post-Dobbs, rising from five in 2021 to 11 in 2023, according to the UCSF data. And the number of abortion providers in Illinois grew from 27 to 36 in that time frame. Among the new additions is CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, which relocated its abortion clinic from Memphis, where abortion is banned, about 200 miles north to Carbondale, a small city in southern Illinois. It still has a location in Tennessee that offers other services including birth control consultations and STI testing. Red River Women\u2019s Clinic had a much less distant \u2013 but no less significant \u2013 move. It popped just a couple miles away from its original location in Fargo, North Dakota, over the border into Minnesota. \u201cWe were the only abortion clinic in North Dakota for over 20 years,\u201d said Tammi Kromenaker, the clinic director. \u201cWe knew that if we didn\u2019t do something, those patients who already drive three, four, five hours one way just to get to our clinic would face even bigger hurdles.\u201d Kromenaker says she had been exploring options to move the clinic out of North Dakota years before the Dobbs decision as a conservative state legislature threatened the clinic\u2019s work, but options felt out of reach, mainly because they were too expensive. But when the Dobbs decision leaked a month before it was handed down, the need to act instantly outweighed those concerns. \u201cIt just was just this thing, like, \u2018we just have to do this. We have to, no matter the obstacles,\u2019\u201d Kromenaker said, and she was thankful for a fundraising campaign that buoyed the clinic in that leap. Struggle for solid financial footing As clinics weigh their options in a post-Dobbs world, finances are the greatest determining factor. \u201cIt costs money to close the clinic. It costs money to reopen the clinic. If patients have never gone to you for prenatal care before, it\u2019s going to take time to develop a patient population who comes to you for prenatal care,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cAll of these shifts really require community support and financial support from the community to continue to keep these clinics open.\u201d And constant changes to the abortion landscape in the US exacerbate clinics\u2019 struggle for solid footing. \u201cI would have expected to see providers open in North Florida and North Carolina, which were both geographically important destinations after Dobbs, except for the fact that both states are fairly hostile to abortion,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe future there was so uncertain, and I think it was too risky to open.\u201d Before Dobbs, a 100-mile increase in distance to the nearest clinic could prevent about 1 in 5 people who wanted an abortion from being able to reach a facility to get one, her research shows. Travel distance to abortion clinics continues to be a critical barrier to access, but a surge in virtual clinics has helped fill some of that gap. In the last few months of 2023, about 1 in 5 abortions in the US were telehealth abortions, where medication abortions pills were mailed to a patient after a remote consultation with a clinician, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning. By December, nearly a tenth of all abortions in the US \u2013 about 8,000 a month \u2013 were telehealth abortions provided under shield laws, which allow providers in some states where abortion remains legal to prescribe medication abortion drugs via telehealth to people living in states with bans or restrictions. \u201cSome people have resources to travel, but the pressure on brick-and-mortar clinics continues to build,\u201d said Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project. \u201cNow, patients can get their medications sooner because they don\u2019t have to wait for a spot to open up in a clinic or find a way to get there. It\u2019s vital.\u201d A Supreme Court ruling last week maintained broad access to medication abortion, but other ongoing legal challenges and ballot measures that will be on the table in a few states during this year\u2019s election leave policies and planning very much in flux. Although Red River has moved all of its staff and services to the Minnesota, Kromenaker has kept the address in Fargo to maintain standing in ongoing legal battles with the state. \u201cIt would have been easy to just walk away and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to sell this building. We\u2019re done with North Dakota. We\u2019re out,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe have fought so long and so hard, we just didn\u2019t want to give up. We\u2019re just one little clinic, but downtown Fargo is still, technically, our corporate address so that we can maintain that standing in North Dakota and continue to fight for those patients we\u2019ve served for \u2026 26 years in July.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/abortion-clinics-in-banned-states-pivot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_low-back-pain-walking-wellness", "text": "Low back pain affects at least 619 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to increase to 843 million people by 2050, according to research estimates. Unfortunately, nearly 70% of people who recover from an episode of low back pain have a recurrence within a year, experts say. In addition to acute physical discomfort and lost time at work, treatment often requires education, physical therapy and exercises such as Pilates that may require fees or specialized equipment. Yet there is an easy, free way to prevent low back pain, at least for a while, according to a new randomized clinical trial. People in the study who walked regularly after having at least one episode of low back pain were pain free nearly twice as long as those who did not. \u201cThe intervention group had fewer occurrences of activity-limiting pain compared to the control group, and a longer average period before they had a recurrence, with a median of 208 days compared to 112 days,\u201d said senior author Mark Hancock, a professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University in Sydney. \u201cWalking is a low-cost, widely accessible and simple exercise that almost anyone can engage in, regardless of geographic location, age or socio-economic status,\u201d Hancock said in a statement. Walking for at least 30 minutes The study, published Wednesday in The Lancet journal, followed 701 Australian adults, mostly women in their 50s, who had recently recovered from an episode of low back pain that derailed their ability to perform daily activities. Each person was randomly assigned to a control group with no intervention or an individualized walking and educational program. Those in the intervention group were asked to build up to 30 minutes of walking five times a week over a six-month period at speeds adjusted for age, physical capacity and individual preferences. Jogging was also allowed. \u201cAfter three months, most of the people who took part were walking three to five days a week for an average of 130 minutes in total,\u201d Hancock told CNN via email. Participants were asked to wear pedometers to track their daily steps and keep a walking diary. At three months into the program, they also wore an accelerometer that objectively measured daily step count and the amount of brisk walking or other physical activity. The program also provided six physiotherapist-guided education sessions over six months, a more cost-effective model than typical treatment, Hancock said. \u201cWe included 3 standard sessions with a physiotherapist and 3 brief phone catch ups,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn the few previous studies of prevention exercise programs for back pain the intervention included approximately 20 group classes. \u201cWe also discussed simple strategies to reduce the risk of a recurrence of low back pain and instructions on how to self-manage any minor recurrences. The education was embedded in the same sessions as the walking prescription.\u201d Cost-effective intervention In addition to providing participants with longer pain-free periods, the walking program reduced the amount of time taken off work and medical visits by half, said lead study author\u00a0Natasha Pocovi, a postdoctoral fellow at Macquarie. \u201cThe exercise-based interventions to prevent back pain that have been explored previously are typically group-based and need close clinical supervision and expensive equipment, so they are much less accessible to the majority of patients,\u201d Pocovi said in a statement. \u201cOur study has shown that this effective and accessible means of exercise has the potential to be successfully implemented at a much larger scale than other forms of exercise.\u201d Due to the structure of the study, it was not possible to determine how much of the benefit was due to walking or the educational program provided by physiotherapists, Hancock said. \u201cWe believe it is likely the two components complement each other, with education helping to overcome avoidance and fear of movement, while the health coaching and walking program resulted in behavior change,\u201d he said. However, because the intervention appeared to be behavioral coaching, and not actual physical therapy, the act of walking may indeed have been the key reason for improvement, said A. Lynn Millar, a retired physical therapist\u00a0and former professor at Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was not involved in the study. \u201cThis is important, as many studies have shown that pain response is partially a behavioral response,\u201d Millar said in an email. \u201cThe coaching was limited in duration, thus they can suggest that the primary intervention of walking was the major contributor to the long term response.\u201d What walking does for the body What is it about walking that is so helpful for lower back pain? For one, exercise is good for every part of the body. \u201cFirst, the person is sitting less, and sitting is not the best posture for the back,\u201d Millar said. \u201cSecond, walking will improve general circulation,\u00a0and will improve blood circulation to the\u00a0muscles of the back that\u00a0are\u00a0actively supporting the individual during the motion. Movement of a joint also helps circulate the\u00a0joint fluids,\u00a0thus the\u00a0joints of the\u00a0spine may be benefiting from the motion.\u201d Walking improves metabolism and the amount of calories burned, experts say. Lower weight can ease the load on the back and legs, ensuring better spinal health. Taking a brisk stroll also improves the strength of core muscles around the spine and in the legs, all of which can improve posture and provide better support to the spine. Walking also increases muscle endurance, assuring muscles are less susceptible to fatigue and injury. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking increase bone density, protecting against injury while stimulating the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good hormones that reduce pain and stress. When starting a walking program, good shoes and arch supports are necessary,\u00a0and potential problems may be offset by exercise programs such as resistance training and stretching, Millar said. \u201cI also think it is important to have varied paces and distances throughout the week. Some problems are caused by progressing too rapidly, and not paying attention to initial\u00a0aches,\u201d she said. \u201cI also used to see people that were walking in shoes that did not have good support, or they had become so worn, the support was gone,\u201d she added. If your \u201cback goes out\u201d during walking, activity modification such as cycling or swimming may be necessary, Millar said.\u00a0 Taking a day or two off from walking and doing some back exercises and stretching can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/low-back-pain-walking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_health_sedentary-tv-aging-wellness", "text": "Swapping out time in front of the TV for physical activity might not sound like the most fun trade, but it is associated with significantly better chances of healthy aging, according to a new study. \u201cOur take-home message is that replacing TV time with light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sleep (for participants with inadequate sleep) is beneficial to healthy aging,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Molin Wang, associate professor of medicine in the department of epidemiology at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The results are not surprising, as many studies show that sedentary behaviors have significant impacts on health, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Freeman was not involved in this study. For this study, researchers analyzed data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study of more than 45,000 people age 50 or older in 1992 who were also free of chronic disease, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Researchers followed up for 20 years for information on people\u2019s time sitting at work, home and watching television and their hours standing or walking at home and work. That data was analyzed with data on their aging. Healthy aging was defined as living to at least 70 years old and maintaining at least four healthy domains \u2014 such as no major chronic disease and no impairment in subjective memory, physical health and mental health, the study said. Each additional two hours of sitting to watch TV was associated with a 12% decrease in the chances of aging in a healthy way, the study showed. On the other hand, adding two hours of light physical activity at work added a 6% increase in the odds of healthy aging. Replacing one hour of sitting to watch TV with light physical activity at home or work was associated with better chances of healthy aging, the study showed. \u201cVegging out in front of the television, seems to always be associated with worse outcomes,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cOf course, it makes physiologic sense that human beings were never meant to sit in front of a screen all day long.\u201d \u201cThe more we sit, the more problems we get, particularly as we get older,\u201d he added. Why is sitting so bad? A 2017 study showed a relationship between time spent sitting and early death from any cause. And sedentary time as a kid may increase the risk of heart disease later in life, according to 2023 research. The problem is particularly bad when eating a very large amount of salt, which is typical in an American diet, without getting enough movement to circulate fluid, he added. These often unhealthy habits go together. \u201cWhen people sit in front of TV, it usually brings all these other comorbid activities, like eating junk food, TV dinners, failing to connect with others, and it even can interrupt sleep,\u201d Freeman said. Time spent seated at a desk or on the living room couch also takes away opportunities to get out and be active. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on all that physical activity, which is truly an unbelievable way to reduce cardiovascular risk and blood pressure,\u201d Freeman said. How to kick out the sedentary behavior If you work eight, 10 or even 12 hours a day in an office, it might feel difficult to get more movement into your day. \u201cMy very strong suggestion is you should consider at work getting a standing desk if you can, or even a treadmill desk if you\u2019re able and you have the space,\u201d Freeman said. If that is not a possibility, things like getting up often or having walking meetings can help, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting down for more than 30 minutes at a time, in my book, that\u2019s probably too long, and you really want to try to move a little bit,\u201d Freeman added. You don\u2019t have to outlaw sitting or watching TV, however. Maybe try pairing TV with healthy behaviors such as watching while moving or eating a nutritious snack, he said. Or better yet, set limits for yourself. \u201cThere are all these great tools and apps available \u2026 and a lot of people see those as tools for kids, but the truth is, they\u2019re just as good as for adults,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIt lets you keep track of how much screen time you have and then how much activity you have all on the same device, which is kind of neat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/sedentary-tv-aging-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_obesity-genetic-wellness", "text": "Obesity isn\u2019t just a matter of food and exercise \u2014 it may be in your genetic code, according to new research. \u201cObesity\u2019s causes are very complex and in the majority of cases, the combination of many factors. In this study, however, we found a clear genetic trigger for obesity,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Mattia Frontini, British Heart Foundation senior fellow and an associate professor in cellular biology at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, in an email. Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that follows people long term, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Med. They compared data from people with two faulty copies of a particular gene (SMIM1) and those who did not have the two faulty copies. Women with the gene mutation weighed an extra 4.6 kilograms (10.14 pounds), and men with the variant weighed an extra 2.4 kilograms (5.29 pounds), according to the study. The faulty copies of the SMIM1 gene cause decreased function in the thyroid and declining energy expenditure, Frontini said, \u201cwhich means that given the same food intake, less energy is used and this excess is stored as fat.\u201d Not only is the correlation significant, but this study also identifies a specific gene mutation, which isn\u2019t always the case in research, said Dr. Philipp Scherer, director of the Touchstone Diabetes Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. He was not involved in the study. \u201cIt is an exciting study in that it puts a new gene on the map,\u201d Scherer said. \u201cIt\u2019s an actual gene, rather than just a genomic locus with a mutation somewhere where we don\u2019t understand. \u2026 We think we\u2019re looking at a gene here that we can further study.\u201d This genetic finding is \u2018pretty rare\u2019 This particular genetic finding doesn\u2019t apply to a large population of people with obesity \u2014 only about 1 in 5,000 people have this genetic makeup, Frontini said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty rare, but you multiply that to a population of 10 (million), 15 million and there\u2019s quite a few people out there that would walk around with that mutation and maybe weren\u2019t fully aware of the fact that there is a genetic explanation for their struggle with obesity,\u201d Scherer said. Dysfunction in the thyroid is common, affecting almost 2% of the population in the UK, Frontini said. And thyroid dysfunction is treated regularly with a relatively inexpensive medication, Frontini said. The next step in the research is to find out if people with the SMIM1 mutation qualify to treat their thyroid with medication, he added. \u201cIf they do, we plan to run a randomized clinical trial to determine if they would benefit from the treatment,\u201d Frontini said. \u201cThe hope is that they will, and we can improve their quality of life using a cheap, safe treatment.\u201d The best approach in the meantime Weight isn\u2019t just a matter of willpower or laziness. The size and shape of your body is determined by many factors \u2014 some of which you have control over and others you don\u2019t, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Among these factors are lifestyle habits, the amount of sleep you get, medications, health problems, where you live and work, and genetics, according to the institute. Research into genetic factors and potential treatments is still underway, but Scherer said the current best approach to medical treatment of obesity is GLP-1 medications. Severe restrictive dieting is not the answer, Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and author of \u201cThe Diet Detox: Why Your Diet Is Making You Fat and What to Do About It,\u201d said in an earlier CNN article. Demonizing foods too much may make you crave them more, and then the guilt you feel when you give in can lead to a cycle of fluctuating between restricting yourself and bingeing, she added. If you want to make changes to your lifestyle, it\u2019s best to try a gradual, sustainable approach while maintaining a healthy relationship with food, Emily Feig, a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in the same CNN report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/obesity-genetic-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_metformin-preconception-pregnancy-birth-defects-risks", "text": "Some studies have raised concerns about a potential link between the widely used type 2 diabetes drug metformin and an increased risk of conceiving a baby with birth defects. But new research now suggests that the use of the medication among men planning to conceive or women in early pregnancy does not appear to be linked with an increased risk of major birth defects for their children. The two studies, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, contradict a 2022 study that linked metformin use by men in the three months before they conceived a baby to a 40% increased risk of birth defects in their offspring. The findings provide \u201cassurance\u201d for parents, said Dr. Ran Rotem, an author of the new study on the paternal use of metformin and a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cConventionally and traditionally, the mother has been the focus when it comes to pregnancy and when it comes to fetal health and the health of the newborn. What we are increasingly finding is that the father is also important,\u201d he said. He added that the increased risk of birth defects seen in previous research could be associated with the disease of diabetes or with related comorbidities, and not so much the medication itself. \u201cWhen we think about a medication, we also have to think about the underlying conditions in which the medication is usually prescribed,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cWe know that diabetes itself is tricky when it comes to both fertility and potential complications in pregnancy and in newborns.\u201d Metformin is a first-line medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and has been widely used to help control blood sugar levels since the 1960s. The medication is now the most commonly prescribed oral drug for type 2 diabetes, and, before taking metformin, people are recommended to tell their doctor if they plan to become pregnant, are pregnant or are breastfeeding. \u2018Health of the father seems to be important\u2019 For the study on paternal use of metformin, researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Kahn-Sagol-Maccabi Research and Innovation Center of Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel analyzed data from birth records and medical records on nearly 400,000 babies born in Israel between 1999 and 2020. They compared that data with information on the babies\u2019 fathers, such as their ages, laboratory test results and medication records, including data on metformin prescriptions. Although the researchers didn\u2019t specifically look at how long the men had been on the medication, \u201cwe did have many people who have been on the medication for a long time, and the results were pretty consistent for those individuals, too,\u201d Rotem said. The researchers found that the prevalence of major birth defects was 4.7% in children of fathers not exposed to diabetes medications in the months leading up to conception, compared with 6.2% in children of fathers exposed to metformin before conceiving. When the researchers adjusted their data for factors such as the fathers\u2019 other underlying health conditions and whether the mother also had diabetes or related comorbidities, they found no increased risk of major birth defects in children exposed to paternal metformin. Men who used diabetes medications during the sperm developmental period, leading up to conceiving, tended to be older in age, had a higher prevalence of underlying health conditions and were more likely to have fertility problems and a history of smoking compared with fathers not exposed to diabetes medications. \u201cWe find that paternal use of metformin in the sperm development period is not associated with excess risk of malformation in newborns, proving assurance that fathers planning to start a family can continue using the drug to control their diabetes,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cMore broadly, our study also suggests that maintaining a good cardiometabolic health profile is important for both partners.\u201d A higher prevalence of underlying health conditions as well as fertility problems was also seen among the mothers of children whose fathers used metformin, compared with the mothers of children with no paternal diabetes medication exposures. \u201cIf the father is on diabetes medication, the mother is much more likely to be on diabetes medication too or have other metabolic comorbidities,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cWe know that diabetes itself is not good when it is in the mother, and we are finding evidence that it\u2019s also tricky for the fathers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can manage diabetes with just changing your lifestyle \u2013 doing more exercise, watching your diet \u2013 that\u2019s probably good, and that\u2019s helpful anyways. But if you have to be medicated, it seems like metformin is a safe choice for both.\u201d The data also showed that risk of a birth defect was higher when the father used metformin along with other medications, described as a polytherapy. Paternal use of metformin alone, known as monotherapy, did not appear to increase the risk for birth defects. \u201cWhen we examined specific treatment regimens, modestly elevated excess risks were still observed, specifically among children of fathers who used metformin in tandem with some other diabetes medication,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cBut we also observed that fathers who took multiple medications had more poorly controlled diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis again indicates that the modestly elevated risk seen for diabetes polytherapies was likely not caused by the medications themselves, but rather by the worse cardiometabolic health profile of the fathers.\u201d \u2018Poor blood sugar control is a risk factor\u2019 The other study that was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine had somewhat similar findings for mothers. Women who continued using metformin\u00a0and added insulin as a treatment\u00a0in their first trimester of pregnancy\u00a0showed little to no increased risk of giving birth to a baby with major birth defects compared with women who discontinued metformin and switched to insulin, according to the study. The researchers, also from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studied data on more than 12,000 women with type 2 diabetes and their pregnancies. The data came from the US Medicaid health care administration\u2019s database from 2000 to 2018. The analysis showed that the estimated risk for giving birth to a baby with birth defects was about 6% when the mother received insulin plus metformin,\u00a0versus\u00a08% when the mother received insulin alone. \u201cWe were not surprised by our findings. Although metformin may cross the placenta, potentially affecting the fetus, metformin can help with blood sugar control which may lower the risk of birth defects,\u201d Dr. Yu-Han Chiu,\u00a0the lead\u00a0author of the study and a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u00a0and Penn State College of Medicine,\u00a0said in an email. \u201cPoor blood sugar control is a risk factor for birth defects. Insulin in combination with metformin may result in better\u00a0blood sugar\u00a0control than using insulin alone. This may explain why we\u00a0observed a slightly lower risk of\u00a0live birth with congenital malformations when comparing with using insulin alone,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cFor women with type 2 diabetes and currently taking metformin and planning to conceive, our study suggests continuing metformin had no or little increased risk for birth defects compared to switching to insulin.\u201d A \u2018complex picture\u2019 The two new studies are \u201cwell done,\u201d Dr. Meleen Chuang, medical director of women\u2019s health at the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, said in an email. \u201cI would not change the way metformin is prescribed for parents trying to conceive,\u201d said Chuang, who was not involved in the new studies and serves as ob-gyn chief of service for NYU Langone Brooklyn. \u201cI would encourage weight loss, diet, exercise as a part of their preconception care for both parents,\u201d she added. \u201cReducing modifiable risk factors such as decreasing weight, smoking, alcohol, substance use are some ways to improve health and fertility.\u201d The possible risks that may come with the paternal and maternal use of metformin remain a \u201ccomplex picture,\u201d but the new studies help make that evolving picture clearer, Dr. Sarah Martins da Silva, of the University of Dundee in the United Kingdom, wrote in an editorial published alongside the two studies Monday. \u201cClearly, individual risks and benefits should be carefully considered and results should be interpreted with caution since studies lack information on glycemic control,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNonetheless, these recent analyses suggest that metformin is a safe and effective treatment option for [type 2 diabetes] for men and women trying to conceive as well as managing hyperglycemia in pregnant women in the first trimester,\u201d she added, \u201cand it may be time to reconsider current prenatal care guidelines that advocate switching to insulin therapy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/metformin-preconception-pregnancy-birth-defects-risks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
