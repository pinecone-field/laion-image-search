{"id": "2024_06_16_health_dads-worse-than-you-glenn-boozan-wellness", "text": "Whether you\u2019re a new or seasoned father, the anxieties of raising children can pop up anywhere, anytime. What if I\u2019m not meant for this? What if I stink at this \u201cdad\u201d stuff? What if my kids need something I simply can\u2019t provide? These fears are normal, and perfection is a myth. So try putting things into perspective and remember there are dads far worse than you, suggests comedy writer Glenn Boozan in her new book, \u201cThere Are Dads Way Worse Than You: Unimpeachable Evidence of Your Excellence as a Father.\u201d The book, which Priscilla Witte illustrated, is a 10- to 15-minute read that dads and those who love them can knock out between tasks. These problematic fathers include Thanos, the Marvel villain who pushed his daughter off a cliff, and Jack Torrance of Stephen King\u2019s \u201cThe Shining,\u201d who terrorizes his wife and son as his sanity deteriorates. (Fine, they\u2019re fictional, but still, you are not them.) The book is a natural follow-up to Boozan\u2019s motherhood-focused counterpart, published in 2022. Her inspiration for a fatherhood version came from having a \u201creally great dad\u201d who, in the \u201880s when Boozan was growing up, was a stay-at-home father while her mother was the breadwinner, she said. \u201cI\u2019m always very proud to say that my dad was an extremely present and active part of my childhood.\u201d Fathers Boozan interviewed while developing her book often shared worries about whether they could provide enough resources for their families, be strong enough for them, protect them or teach them all the skills society typically associates with masculinity, she said. \u201cAlso, just every dad I spoke to was like, \u2018I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m gonna roughhouse too hard (and) they\u2019ll get hurt,\u2019\u201d Boozan said. Another common fear was \u201cbeing cast as the villain in their kids\u2019 lives,\u201d she added. Boozan said she hopes her book relieves, at least temporarily, these intense pressures many parents feel \u2014 especially in the modern age of parents\u2019 attempts to be perfect. \u201cI want parents, in these moments of terror and fear and panic, to take a breath and say to themselves, \u2018Oh, you know, it could be worse.\u2019 I want parents to be nicer to themselves,\u201d Boozan said. And \u201cas a comedy writer, I\u2019m biased, but I\u2019m a big proponent of laughter as medicine. And I think taking a break from a stressful situation for a laugh can be a lifesaver.\u201d Here\u2019s the lowdown on four other \u201cbad\u201d dads who might make you feel better about your parenting this Father\u2019s Day. Walter \u2018Heisenberg\u2019 White \u201cWhat if, at a barbecue, your \u2018Grill Dad\u2019 skills are green? As long as what you\u2019re cooking isn\u2019t methamphetamine,\u201d Boozan wrote. Walter White\u2019s original intention was to provide for his family in the event of his eventual death from cancer \u2014 but that changed as his success got to his head. As if living a double life to be a meth kingpin wasn\u2019t bad enough, White also got his teenage son drunk, left his infant daughter alone in the front seat of a fire truck and put his family\u2019s safety at risk. The list goes on. \u201cBy the end of the show, the things he\u2019s done to protect his family are the very things that have put them in danger,\u201d Boozan said. Wayne Szalinski \u201cOn days when you feel \u2018Dad guilt\u2019 about the things you did,\u201d Boozan wrote, \u201cat least you\u2019ve never had to say, \u2018Honey? I shrunk the kids.\u2019\u201d Boozan chose to include Wayne Szalinski as a funny example of a father making a single huge mistake that had innocent intentions yet resulted in disastrous consequences, she said. Darth Vader \u201cOops! Forgot their bathtime? Mess up a midday snack? Better than a cauterizing lightsaber attack,\u201d Boozan wrote, referring to a famous scene in the 1980 film \u201cStar Wars: Episode V \u2014 The Empire Strikes Back.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 READ MORE: Overthinking the initiation into \u2018Star Wars\u2019 for our kids \u201cCutting off your son\u2019s hand is a pretty crazy dad error,\u201d Boozan said. \u201cThat was why it was so important for the cover of the book to be Darth Vader, because everybody\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I understand exactly what this book is going to be about.\u2019\u201d King Midas \u201cPoor dad? Rich dad? In between? Nobody\u2019s gonna care,\u201d Boozan wrote. \u201cMidas had the golden touch and look what happened there.\u201d The Midas myth is another case of worries about resources gone awry. Striving for success, he gets too greedy and accidentally turns his daughter into gold when hugging her. \u201cThat\u2019s a great example of a workaholic dad who thinks that amassing a trove of riches in order to pass that along to your child is the way of being a good dad,\u201d Boozan said. \u201cThat\u2019s a cautionary tale.\u201d \u2018Reach out for help\u2019 Boozan\u2019s book also touches on a difficult yet reassuring lesson most parents experience: that the responsibility and quality in parenting isn\u2019t only in how much you\u2019re able to protect them from danger and heartbreak but also in how you help them grow from those necessary rites of passage. \u201cThe best thing my dad ever did \u2026 is he was a chill dad,\u201d Boozan said. \u201cHe would let me explore and discover things on my own, encourage my curiosity and let me play with matches, run around the house and jump on the couch. And if I got hurt, then I learned not to get hurt. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a helicopter parent,\u201d Boozan added. \u201cAnd I think that encouraged me to open up and grow as a kid.\u201d Boozan also emphasized the importance of fathers having healthy, open relationships with their own emotional and mental health \u2014 which can also influence a child\u2019s well-being. \u201cHe never shamed us for sharing our emotions and \u2026 there was no toxic masculinity in my house,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you need it, reach out for help, whether that be emotional or otherwise. If the parent is in a good place, then they have the energy to help their child.\u201d Now that\u2019s a good dad.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/health/dads-worse-than-you-glenn-boozan-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness", "text": "There\u2019s a crack of light shining through the dark clouds of America\u2019s battle with poor nutrition and subsequent health issues, according to a new study that analyzed two decades of nutritional data. \u201cThere is good news. Americans are starting to hear the message about nutrition, and some companies and restaurants are starting to make healthier products. It\u2019s a little bit of an improvement,\u201d said senior study author and cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston. However, he added, the majority of the improvement occurred between 1999 and 2010, with no advances in nutrition after that. \u201cWe have stalled as a nation \u2014 and that does not bode well for our health,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIf I was grading America on its diet, I\u2019d give it a D\u2014just up from an F.\u201d An upward trend, but more is needed The number of adults in the United States who ate a poor diet decreased from about 49% to just over 37% between 1999 and 2020 \u2014 a drop of 11.4%, while those who ate somewhat better nutritionally rose by 10.5%, the study found. A poor diet was defined as one with too many refined grains, processed meat and sugary beverages, including fruit juice, as well as ultraprocessed foods full of added sugar, salt and fat.\u00a0Healthy choices such as fruits and vegetables are extremely low in this eating style. \u201cIntake of fruits and vegetables didn\u2019t increase at all over this 20-year period, which is pretty striking,\u201d Mozaffarian said. An ideal diet included at least the daily recommended servings of fruits and vegetables, as well as more beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Dietary guidelines such as those from the American Heart Association suggest eating 4 to 5 cups a day of canned, fresh or frozen fruits and the same amount for vegetables. The nutritionally ideal diet also contained few sugary beverages, processed meats, refined grains and ultraprocessed food, which is often high in added sugars, fat and salt, the study said. Unfortunately, the number of people who ate an ideal diet \u2013\u2014 which included those 9 cups of fruits and vegetables \u2014 rose less than 1%, the study found. \u201cPeople often ask me, \u2018Well, if the diet\u2019s slowly improving, why is obesity and diabetes still going up?\u2019 It\u2019s still going up because only 1.58% of Americans have an ideal diet. We still have a long way to go,\u201d Mozaffarian said. More than a million Americans die each year from diet-related diseases such as obesity, cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes,\u00a0according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the United States an\u00a0estimated $1.1 trillion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity annually. \u201cI think it is correct to emphasize that diet quality remains dismal in the US. There is no secret why Americans are experiencing epidemics of obesity and diabetes and declining life expectancy,\u201d said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, in an email. He was not involved in the study. Food insecurity is a major issue The study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed dietary information on nearly 52,000 US adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. Nutritional advances were highest among women, younger adults, Hispanic adults, and people with more education and higher incomes who had access to private health care insurance. Fewer gains were seen in men, Black or older adults and people with less income, lower educational levels, non-private health insurance, and food insecurity issues. \u201cDisparities in the population by education and income and race and ethnicity are the same or sometimes getting worse,\u201d Mozaffarian said. The study found that people with lower income saw a 5% improvement in nutritional quality, while those with higher incomes improved their nutritional score by 16%. \u201cWe do need to avoid just blaming the victims of the dysfunctional US food system for the terrible diets documented in the survey,\u201d Willett said. \u201cWe fail to educate students about nutrition in our schools and feed them unhealthy diets. \u201cOur health care system is missing in action almost completely, we allow advertising to seduce children into junk foods and beverages that kill them prematurely, and we indirectly subsidize unhealthy foods in many ways that make healthier options relatively more expensive and less available to low-income Americans,\u201d he said. How to improve your nutrition There are easy steps you can take to boost the nutritional quality of your diet, experts say. Cook at home as often as possible: \u201cMy top suggestion is to shop at the grocery store as much as you can, rather than getting your food at a coffee shop, sandwich shop or quick-serve restaurant,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Even eating at a full-service restaurant should be limited, he added. Prior research by Mozaffarian and his team found about 80% of all food consumed by Americans from restaurants was of poor diet quality. \u201cShockingly, even when we compared fast food versus sit-down restaurants, there wasn\u2019t a dramatic difference in quality,\u201d he said. Instead, try to choose minimally-processed foods to cook at home and avoid the ready-to-heat-and-eat convenience foods so prevalent at the grocery store. Bring your lunch and snacks to work. Don\u2019t drink your sugar. Americans are beginning to get the idea that sugary sodas are unhealthy, but they have not yet made the connection that energy, sports and caffeinated drinks can be equally sugar laden, Mozaffarian said. \u201cEnergy drinks, pre-sweetened iced teas, and specialty coffee drinks can have more sugar than soda,\u201d he said. \u201cI see people walking out of the coffee shop with drinks with whipped cream on top. Don\u2019t drink your sugar.\u201d However, once sugary beverages are removed from the equation, only \u201c6% of calories in the country come from added sugar in foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIn contrast, about 35% of calories in the country come from refined grains and starches.\u201d Limit refined grains.\u00a0Overall, the biggest contributor to the poor quality diet of Americans is refined grains, at 5.2 servings per day \u2014 \u201calmost two servings a meal of refined grains such as refined bread, refined rice, crackers, chips, and other ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Whole grains still contain the bran and germ, which is a nutritional powerhouse full of healthy fats, antioxidants, minerals and E and B vitamins. Whole grains take longer to digest, don\u2019t raise blood sugar as quickly as refined grains and contain more fiber, which can reduce the risk of chronic disease, promote weight loss, and improve digestion. \u201cSome examples of whole grains include barley, bulgur, farro, millet, quinoa, black rice, brown rice, red rice, wild rice, oatmeal and popcorn,\u201d according to My Plate, the US Department of Agriculture website. Refined grains such as white flour, corn grits, white bread and white rice have been milled, removing the bran and germ, to give them a finer texture and longer shelf life. Milling also removes nutrients like dietary fiber, iron and vitamins.\u00a0Refined grains are found in nearly all ultraprocessed foods, including breakfast cereals, desserts, pastries, bread and crackers. Replace refined grains. Instead, nourish your gut microbiome with fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds and minimally-processed whole grains,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi can also help the microbiome, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_media_surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label", "text": "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the threat social media poses to children requires urgent action, and he demanded Congress to put a label on the apps as it does with cigarettes and alcohol. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in the New York Times Monday. Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, \u201cnearly universal.\u201d But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps \u2014 that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill. \u201cI put forward this call for a warning because I think it\u2019s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,\u201d Murthy told CNN. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in America over the past several decades. Congress has long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Murthy argued that it\u2019s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children\u2019s use of social media. \u201cUntil that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future\u2026 parents deserve to be warned. That\u2019s where the label comes in,\u201d Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media as soon as possible. \u201cI think this is an urgent issue.\u201d An escalating battle Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. But Monday\u2019s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. In May 2023, Murthy issued an advisory that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use, saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I\u2019m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,\u201d Murthy told CNN in May 2023. \u201cFor too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cChasing Life\u201d podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta in June 2023, Murthy outlined some steps parents can take to rein in their children\u2019s social media usage, including partnering with other parents to make sure kids lack the \u201cI\u2019m the only one without social media\u201d excuse. More action needed A warning label, if Congress passes legislation requiring one, would be insufficient to fix the problem, Murthy acknowledged. He suggested schools become phone-free environments for children, as should dinner time and other family events. And Murthy urged parents to restrict children\u2019s use of social media until they graduate from middle school. Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would prohibit children under 14 from obtaining their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would ban social media from using algorithms in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18. \u201cThis is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,\u201d Murthy wrote in the New York Times. On Monday, Murthy confirmed to CNN that alcohol and cigarettes are currently the only two products with surgeon general warning labels but that the overall health risk of social media is \u201cjust as profound.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mental health and wellbeing of kids,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_17_health_children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness", "text": "When her daughter was 6 years old, Kelceymarie Warner began to notice her child\u2019s hesitation before bedtime. \u201cHer body would be a little more tense, and she would hyperventilate if you pushed the subject too soon, she really needed to be slowly moved into the cycle.\u201d Warner, who is a parent to four young daughters, believes that sticking to a nightly routine is the best way for her kids to have an easy transition to bedtime. But when her 6-year-old was experiencing bedtime anxiety, Warner had to make some additions to her routine. Warner is not the only one \u2014 many parents know all too well what can be a nightly struggle to get their young children to bed. A new C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health reinforces this common difficulty, revealing that 1 in 4 parents said their child has trouble getting to sleep because they are anxious or worried. Over one-third of parents reported that their child doesn\u2019t stay asleep throughout the night and often or occasionally wakes up upset or crying. \u201cFrom 1 year of age to 6 years of age, kids change a lot. The different phases that they go to are often pretty predictable: They\u2019re scared of the dark, or as kids develop and their imagination develops \u2026 now they\u2019re scared of monsters,\u201d said Sarah Clark, Mott poll co-director and a research scientist in pediatrics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt can be all sorts of things, and so often with kids, and I would argue adults too, some of those anxieties seem to come out at night.\u201d The Mott Poll was conducted in February with 781 parents who have at least one child age 1 to 6 years old. Almost half reported their child leaving their bed and moving to the parent\u2019s bed some or most nights, while 1 in 3 parents said their child often or occasionally insists that they stay in the room until the child falls asleep. But some of these habits may be causing more trouble than the temporary relief they provide, Clark said. While a child may feel safe knowing the parent is in the room, they could later wake up and not be able to go back to sleep on their own, she added. How to help an anxious child with bedtime Warner said her child\u2019s bedtime anxiety may have been caused by the major changes that happened when her youngest daughter was in the neonatal intensive care unit for three months. \u201cMy husband and I were gone for extended periods during the day and even during the night because we wanted to be with a new baby who was born three months early \u2014 but we also needed to be there with our other children. I think she really struggled with a major change in her routine, and it just kind of triggered this very difficult time for her especially.\u201d Warner began incorporating activities into her daughter\u2019s bedtime routine that would promote relaxation and reassurance, such as drinking herbal tea after bathtime, reading a story together and saying nightly affirmations like \u201cI am loved\u201d and \u201cI am important.\u201d The new routine took longer than usual, sometimes up to an hour, but now, a little over a year later, her daughter is able to go through some parts of the routine on her own, and is able to better self-soothe, Warner said. She had posted her advice for other parents that may be facing a similar scenario\u00a0on her TikTok\u00a0account in 2023. The most important factor in getting kids to bed is consistency and sticking with a bedtime routine, Mott Poll co-director Clark said. Ninety percent of polled parents reported having an established and consistent bedtime routine. But some 27% described getting their child to bed was difficult, and those parents were more likely to not have a bedtime routine, stay in the room until the child fell asleep and keep the television or a video on. \u201cWe know that young children really resonate with consistency and routine, and getting ready for bed helps their body and their brain know that this is the time to start winding down,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Hartstein, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. She studies sleep and circadian health in early childhood and was not involved in the Mott poll. Hartstein recommends limiting media use at night, especially avoiding exciting content that could stimulate the child\u2019s brain and make it harder to wind down. A\u00a0January 2022 study\u00a0that Hartstein led found that children around this age group were more sensitive to light at night than adults are, and it could interfere with a child\u2019s production of natural melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Parents could find it beneficial to dim the lights an hour before bed, which would trigger a mental cue that it\u2019s time to get ready to sleep soon, she added. As for staying in the child\u2019s bedroom until they fall asleep, Clark recommends leaving the room and returning to check in every few minutes, which lets the child know that someone will be making sure they are safe every so often, but not staying in the room indefinitely. It\u2019s common for young children to experience sleep issues, especially as preschool-age children begin to reduce or drop naptime, Hartstein said. If parents are especially worried or see their child struggling during the day because they are sleepy, they should talk with their pediatrician, she added. Giving melatonin to young children The poll also found 1 in 5 parents often or sometimes give their child melatonin before bedtime, which came as a surprise given the younger age range of 1 to 6 years old, Clark said. \u201cClearly, this is something that people are feeling the need to try with younger kids. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a signal of how disruptive sleep problems can be for the whole family.\u201d It isn\u2019t recommended to give melatonin to children younger than age of 3, since many sleep issues with children that age are behavioral, according to\u00a0Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0If a parent is considering giving melatonin to their child, they should speak with their pediatrician first, Hartstein said. \u201c(One) concern is that what you\u2019re teaching them is that if they can\u2019t sleep, they should just take a medication, at a time when they should really be developing these healthy sleep habits that will carry them through childhood,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_diamond-shruumz-fda-illnesses", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration is reporting increases in the number of illnesses associated with Diamond Shruumz edible products, with at least 16 hospitalizations and 26 total illnesses reported in 16 states as of Monday. Symptoms have included seizures, muscle rigidity, abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, and vomiting. According to a\u00a0health advisory\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several people were admitted to intensive care units and required intubation and mechanical ventilation after eating the company\u2019s microdosing chocolate bars, infused cones, or micro dose and macro dose gummies. The exact cause of the reported illnesses has yet to be uncovered, but the FDA and CDC are conducting an investigation along with America\u2019s Poison Centers and state and local partners. The FDA says it has been in contact with the Diamond Shruumz brand about a potential recall. The agency cautions consumers not to eat, sell or serve Diamond Shruumz chocolate bars, cones and gummies, which are marketed as containing a proprietary blend of mushrooms and which have been sold nationwide. Diamond Shruumz has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Similar products containing cannabis or mushrooms are increasing in popularity, entering the market in forms such as gummies, chocolates and snack foods, according to the CDC.

{"id": "2024_06_21_health_exercise-summer-heat-wellness", "text": "For people in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s summer and you might be inspired to get outdoors to move more.\u00a0But the weather is getting too warm in some places for people to exercise safely outside. We know that adults should aim for at least\u00a0150 minutes \u00a0of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly. This can include exercises such as brisk walking, biking, playing basketball, swimming and more vigorous household tasks like mowing the lawn and vacuuming, also called functional fitness.\u00a0But is that all safe to do at high temperatures? How hot is too hot for exercising outdoors? Is it safe to exercise outside at some times of the day? Should younger or older people take more precautions in the heat? What about people who have heart and kidney conditions or take certain medications? To help us stay fit and safe in the summer heat, I spoke with CNN wellness analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What precautions should people take before exercising during the summer? Wen:\u00a0Summer can be a fantastic time to get outside and become more active, but as temperatures rise to unsafe levels,\u00a0people should be aware of the risk of\u00a0heat-related illnesses. I\u2019d advise that people look at the weather forecast before exercising. If a\u00a0heat wave\u00a0is expected, avoid exercising in the hottest part of the day and instead go out in the morning or evening. If it\u2019s going to be very hot all day and into the night, don\u2019t do your workout outside. CNN: What can happen if people work or exercise too much outside in the heat? Wen:\u00a0Someone working or exercising outside for prolonged periods of time may experience symptoms of heat exhaustion, including headache, weakness, dizziness\u00a0and nausea. When this happens, get out of the sun and into a cool, air-conditioned space. If symptoms worsen and the person develops confusion and vomiting, for instance, they may have\u00a0heat stroke, which is an emergency and requires immediate medical attention. CNN: Which people are most at risk during a heat wave?\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0\u00a0People who are the most vulnerable include those who are very young and elderly, and those who have chronic medical conditions. Several underlying conditions, such as heart, lung and kidney problems, can be exacerbated by heat. CNN: Do any medications make people more vulnerable during a heat wave? Wen:\u00a0Several medications can increase risk during times of extreme heat. Common blood pressure medications, like calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics, can have effects such as increasing the likelihood of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances during extreme heat. There are medications used for some mental health conditions that can affect the body\u2019s normal response to regulate temperature. That includes some antidepressants and stimulants used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Over-the-counter medicines can also have these effects. Diphenhydramine, for instance, and doxylamine are common antihistamines that can make people sweat less and affect temperature regulation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/exercise-summer-heat-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_fda-menthol-vapes-response", "text": "Four menthol vaping products were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday, the first non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products to get the agency\u2019s sign-off. The decision drew harsh criticism from pediatricians and anti-tobacco groups, which called it \u201ca blow to public health\u201d and warned of potential for \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d to children. The products, made by NJOY, an Altria company, are disposable e-cigarettes and nonrefillable pods that are used with the company\u2019s reusable vaping device. Nicotine levels in the products range from 2.4% to 6%. The company did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Friday\u2019s authorizations do \u201cnot mean these tobacco products are safe nor are they \u2018FDA approved,\u2019\u201d the agency said, but evidence submitted by the company showed that the products could be beneficial to adult smokers to help them make a switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes. The agency said there was sufficient evidence that the products would be \u201cappropriate for the protection of public health.\u201d \u201cBased upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,\u201d Dr. Matthew Farrelly, director of the Office of Science in the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in a news release. E-cigarettes were created to be a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes and were advertised by tobacco companies as a way to help people quit smoking, with flavored vapes being most popular. Massive advertising campaigns targeted children, helping lead to a vaping epidemic among young people \u2014 and eventually an FDA crackdown on flavors. Still, many flavored products remain available for purchase while the agency reviews marketing applications. An FDA official told the US Senate Judiciary Committee last week that regulation of e-cigarettes was a \u201ctop priority.\u201d However, the agency missed a September 2021 deadline to complete its review of e-cigarette makers\u2019 applications to sell their products; a federal court had ruled that the FDA was violating the Tobacco Control Act by allowing e-cigarette products that did not have agency pre-authorization to stay on the market. The FDA has been making its way through 27 million applications from companies seeking marketing authorization for e-cigarette products. Only 27 have gotten the FDA\u2019s green light, and until now, tobacco was the only flavor to do so. Anti-tobacco groups and doctors were quick to criticize Friday\u2019s decision as short-sighted and risky, especially for young people. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is hard to understand in light of the FDA\u2019s own repeated conclusions that flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products, appeal to kids and have fueled the youth e-cigarette epidemic. What has changed?\u201d Yolonda C. Richardson, president and CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in an email. \u201cThis decision is especially troubling given the FDA\u2019s failure to do its job and clear the market of unauthorized, illegal e-cigarette products. Rather than authorizing the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, the FDA should be stepping up its enforcement efforts against the illegal products that are addicting our kids.\u201d The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said in an email that the FDA decision had \u201cdealt a blow to public health,\u201d even as the Biden White House continues to hold up a long-awaited ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. \u201cOn the heels of the administration refusing to finalize rules to prohibit menthol in cigarettes and all flavors in cigars, this decision is a missed opportunity for the FDA to do the right thing,\u201d said Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \u201cBy authorizing the sale of menthol flavored e-cigarettes, including two disposable menthol e-cigarettes, the agency is continuing to allow Big Tobacco to addict yet another generation of youth to their products. Authorizing the sale of any flavored e-cigarette flies in the face of public health and fails to protect young people from a lifetime of addiction.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics said it is also \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d by the FDA decision. \u201cPrevious decisions by FDA to allow the marketing of flavored e-cigarettes had disastrous consequences for children that we are still working to overcome,\u201d President Dr. Benjamin Hoffman said. \u201cThese products will inevitably end up in the backpacks of middle schoolers. Once that happens, FDA will have an obligation to immediately reverse this deeply unwise decision.\u201d Erika Sward, assistant vice president of nationwide advocacy for the American Lung Association, said it \u201copposes any flavored products being on the market. But what is most troubling is the fact that these are so highly addictive with 5% and 6% nicotine. And that is a recipe for more addiction, particularly among kids.\u201d \u201cMenthol-flavored e-cigarettes are highly attractive to kids. And this is a one-two combination of a flavor plus such high levels of nicotine, and that\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\u201d Sward said. About 10% of high school-age adolescents and nearly 5% of middle school students use e-cigarettes,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, according to the FDA. But when they do vape, teens and young adults are much more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. According to the to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey, more than 23% of high school e-cigarette users nationwide use menthol-flavored products. The FDA said it has put \u201cstringent marketing restrictions\u201d on the newly authorized products in an effort to prevent youth access and exposure. The agency also said it will closely monitor how the products are marketed, and if the company fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the agency may suspend or withdraw authorization. \u201cAll tobacco products are harmful and potentially addictive,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cThose who do not use tobacco products shouldn\u2019t start.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/fda-menthol-vapes-response/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_health_alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness", "text": "Preventive neurologist Dr Richard Isaacson stared at the numbers on the fax in astonishment. Blood biomarkers of telltale signs of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the brain of his patient, 55-year-old entrepreneur Simon Nicholls, had all but disappeared in a mere 14 months. \u201cI had to catch my breath. It was a complete shock: The blood tests on his brain had normalized,\u201d said Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. Was this stunning result the work of some new miracle drug designed to combat dementia? Not at all. This is a story of old-fashioned grit and determination. \u201cSimon was on a mission, as if the Grim Reaper was peering over his shoulder. He was going to kick ass and take names,\u201d Isaacson said. Nicholls reduced his risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle changes recommended by Isaacson, including diet, exercise, reducing stress and optimizing sleep, along with a few strategically chosen supplements and medications prescribed by his cardiologist. \u201cI was very worried,\u201d Nicholls told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in his new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d which is airing on \u201cThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.\u201d \u201cI have a 3-year-old son and an 8-year-old son. It\u2019s really important for me, as I get older, to try and be there for them in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many [changes] in lifestyle you can do to hopefully push the disease backwards and give yourself more time, which is all we need until we find a cure.\u201d Unlucky genes When it came to genetics and dementia, Nicholls had drawn the short straw. He carried two copies of the APOE4 gene, one from each parent, which may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s at least tenfold. \u201cSadly, my mum passed away from what we think is Alzheimer\u2019s in her 70s,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cFor the last 10 years of her life, she just sat in a chair, rocking, while on about 14 medications. I\u2019d much rather have a longer health span and then just go quickly.\u201d Not everyone with one or even two copies of APOE4 develops Alzheimer\u2019s, however, creating a tantalizing opportunity. Can a person diminish their genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle and various medical interventions, especially if started early, before too much damage is done? Isaacson, who also has a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, believes the answer is yes. He began the first US clinic devoted to Alzheimer\u2019s prevention in New York City in 2013 before moving his program to Florida in 2021. His research has shown that following a dozen or more lifestyle interventions, when practiced 60% or more of the time, can improve cognitive function, especially in women. Today, scientists around the world are also investigating the impact on cognition of such lifestyle changes as a healthy plant-based diet,\u00a0stress reduction,\u00a0strength training, aerobic exercise and quality sleep habits \u2014 behaviors that Isaacson and his team outlined in a recent review\u00a0published in Nature. \u201cI don\u2019t use the term \u2018reverse.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what reverse means when it comes to the field of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut the results we\u2019ve seen with Simon and some other patients in our research are extremely exciting.\u201d How the heart and the brain are intertwined Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t the only pathway to a life of dwindling memory and the inability to think, plan and interact with loved ones. Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can be caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks, stroke, blood clots and more, all of which can further damage the body and brain. Poor hearts and their consequences can run rampant in a family over generations, a fact Nicholls knew all too well. \u201cMy whole family had endless heart attacks, resulting in my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side dying around age 50,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother had three heart attacks, the first at age 50, then a triple bypass before she went on to develop dementia.\u201d Carrying an APOE4 gene further increases the risk for heart disease as well as dementia, experts say. \u201cMy sister had three heart attacks, and when I was 40, I was told that I had atherosclerosis, with a ridiculously massive coronary artery calcium score of like 1,500 and occlusions in about 96% of my arteries.\u201d A normal coronary artery calcium score is zero. For a man in the prime of his life, the news was crushing. Doctors tried to use lifestyle changes and statins to reverse the plaque buildup but finally resorted to surgery, opening three of Nicholls\u2019 arteries with stents. He also began using an injectable drug called evolocumab, designed to boost the liver\u2019s ability to remove \u201cbad\u201d \u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, from the body. \u2018It was time to turn to my brain\u2019 Slowly, Nicholls\u2019 heart condition began to improve, but the bad news didn\u2019t end there. A brain scan found telltale signs of vascular damage in Nicholls\u2019 brain, which occurs when the tiniest blood vessels are starved of oxygen. \u201cThe doctors said I had too many white matter lesions.\u00a0I told myself that since I now had my heart more or less under control, it was time to turn to my brain,\u201d Nicholls said. In January 2023, Nicholls became participant No. 34 in a novel clinical trial at Isaacson\u2019s Florida center. The trial is designed to uncover cognitive risk factors and counter them with a personalized plan of attack. (Full disclosure: I am participant No. 20 in the same trial; you can read about my experience here.) \u201cThe overall goal of the study is democratize access to preventive neurology care by eventually using at-home blood testing to cost-effectively reach the most people,\u201d Isaacson said. As part of the trial, Nicholls underwent a battery of tests, including a unique blood test that can track levels of amyloid, tau\u00a0and other\u00a0hallmark biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other degenerative conditions. Deposits of amyloid can begin accumulating in the brain decades before symptoms begin,\u00a0even in a person\u2019s 30s and 40s. \u201cSimon\u2019s first test came back with a score of 70. Anything over 58 was positive for amyloid in the brain,\u201d Isaacson said.\u00a0\u201cThe results backed up the amyloid PET scan Simon had taken in 2019, where I could see the plaque in his brain.\u201d 10,000 steps a day: \u2018I\u2019m very consistent\u2019 Nicholls needed to lose weight, so he began taking tirzepatide (the active ingredient in the medications Mounjaro and Zepbound), one of the newer injectable drugs that suppress appetite by stimulating hormones that control blood sugar levels. At the same time, Nicholls was encouraged to step up his physical activity by incorporating strength training three times a week while adding 45 to 60 minutes a day of zone 2 exercise, in which you briskly walk, ruck, jog or cycle at 60% to 70% of your heart rate. \u201cI love going for a walk every morning at sunrise for an hour and a half with a podcast. I get in 10,000 steps or more every day. I\u2019m very consistent,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cI also do a very slow full-body workout with weights three times a week for an hour\u2019s time.\u201d Avoiding sugar, artificial sweeteners, alcohol and ultraprocessed foods is a must, as is following a plant-based meal plan such as the Mediterranean diet. \u201cWhen I first saw Simon, he had a bit of a middle, like most guys in their 50s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen I saw him at nine weeks, I did a double take. He was totally buff, ripped even. \u201cWithin those nine weeks, he had lost 21 pounds, about 80% of that fat, and put on muscle, which was excellent,\u201d Isaacson added. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d The weight loss and increased muscle mass lowered Nicholls\u2019 fasting blood sugar levels, ending his march toward diabetes, while some tweaks to his cholesterol medications further optimized his good and bad cholesterol numbers. In August 2023, it was time to repeat the blood test for amyloid. By then, the company that administers the tests had added a measurement for tau, another key hallmark sign of Alzheimer\u2019s, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease. \u201cSimon\u2019s amyloid probability score on the new APS2 test had dropped to 53, which was phenomenal,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut he was still positive, as anything between 48 and 100 is considered to reflect a high probability of amyloid brain plaques on a brain scan.\u201d \u2018Turn on the screws\u2019 Now that the big concerns of cholesterol, insulin, diet, exercise and fat mass were addressed, it was time \u201cto turn on the screws,\u201d Isaacson said, with personalized recommendations based on Nicholls\u2019 biology. \u201cWe optimized Simon\u2019s omega-3 fatty acid levels, which is especially important for people with APOE \u03b54, as they need more omega-3. We also added B complex vitamins to control elevated homocysteine in his blood,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cHowever, we would not give B complex vitamins to anyone who did not have higher homocysteine levels.\u201d Elevated homocysteine, which is an amino acid used by the body to make protein, is a risk factor for brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. A September 2010 randomized controlled trial found that supplementation slowed brain atrophy in people with mild cognitive impairment. In the meantime, Nicholls, an avid researcher who loves to read medical journals, was adding some interventions of his own. \u201cI have steam and sauna rooms in my home, I do a lot of that. I love it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried cold water plunges, and I have lists of things to do I get from podcasts, from walking to sleeping to gratitude to yoga to sleep routines. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I do that Dr. Isaacson doesn\u2019t agree with: I get stem cell injections twice a year,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cSadly, I have arthritis in my hands, and that definitely feels better when I use stem cells, and I like to think they may be helping my brain, as well.\u201d There was one more big issue to tackle: Nicholls\u2019 sleep, or lack of it, which studies have shown can hasten cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s. With business around the world, Nicholls is a frequent flyer with \u201cterrible sleep\u201d due to jet lag and insomnia.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m also a worrier type of person,\u201d he confessed. Adding a sleep medication approved for insomnia helped, \u201cbut Simon really needs to tackle his sleep by improving his sleep hygiene with a more regular sleep schedule,\u201d Isaacson said. An unbelievable result On Halloween 2023, the next APS2 score arrived. Amazingly, Nicholls had reduced the amount of amyloid and tau in his blood to 40: He was testing negative in blood for signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. Shocked and amazed, Isaacson remained skeptical. \u201cI was very cautious. You know, promise not to overpromise. I needed to retest.\u201d A few days before Christmas, the repeat test results arrived. When it too was a negative finding of 40, Isaacson decided to tell Nicholls in person. \u201cDr. Isaacson drove all the way from Boca Raton to Miami excited, very happy,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cWe walked on a beach together, and we were ecstatic that we\u2019d actually been able go from positive to negative for amyloid.\u201d Although Nicholls is ecstatic about the improvements, he\u2019s also very humble about his efforts to improve his health. \u201cI\u2019m really not all that compliant. To comply is just horrendously difficult, right? Of course I want to have a beer or a hamburger or something stupid. I love gummy bears and eating crappy food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped that I have some great doctors to help me, but to be honest, my biggest motivator are my children,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cI\u2019d love to see my sons get married and have their own kids, and to do that, I have to put in the work to stay the way I am now.\u201d Even lower amyloid levels and a larger hippocampus It appears Nicholls is well on his way toward that goal. In March, his APS2 score had dropped to 25, an unbelievably low number. Not only was Nicholls blood negative for amyloid and tau, the test suggested that his brain amyloid might be normal, with no distinguishable signs of the disease. The only way to definitively prove this, however, would be to repeat his amyloid PET scan, Isaacson said. \u201cWhat really drove his score down was the amyloid value,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cIt normalized at .101, which is like crazy good. That\u2019s not matter for discussion; for amyloid, .1 or above is normal.\u201d Even more startling: Brain volume scans showed that the hippocampus, the tiny seahorse-shaped organ responsible for memory, had actually grown in volume in Nicholls\u2019 brain since he started the intervention. In early Alzheimer\u2019s stages, the hippocampus loses tissue rapidly and then atrophies as the disease progresses. Despite these amazing outcomes, Isaacson remains cautious. After all, this is one person, and similar findings have not been been replicated in a larger, more controlled sample and published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the term \u2018reverse\u2019 because I don\u2019t know what will happen if the person stops doing the intervention,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cI also don\u2019t know if the brain might normalize for a short period of time and then, five years later, catch up. Until I have more data, I don\u2019t think that reverse is the right word.\u201d That doesn\u2019t stop his wonder at the results and his gratitude to Nicholls for his continuing dedication to the study and the personalized interventions. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d seen this before, but only in people who are taking anti-amyloid medications,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen you work your entire career and are told by everyone, \u2018It\u2019s not possible to do this,\u2019 and then you see it \u2014 well, I\u2019m still humbled and amazed.\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s and brain health resources", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/health/alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_science_strawberry-full-moon-june-scn", "text": "Despite its name, June\u2019s full moon will not look like a strawberry. But the bright orb could still turn heads Friday night with an appearance that is bigger and more colorful than the average moon. The full moon \u2014 which will reach the crest of its fullness\u00a0at 9:08\u00a0p.m. ET Friday\u00a0\u2014 comes one day after the\u00a0summer solstice, the day of the year when the sun appears the highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. Since a full moon is opposite the sun, this strawberry moon will shine lower in the sky than usual, according to\u00a0NASA. Because of this \u201clower than average path across the sky,\u201d the full moon could have an \u201corange- or amber-colored appearance, for the same reason sunsets appear orange or reddish,\u201d said Preston Dyches, a science communicator with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. Dyches said the effect is the result of the moon\u2019s reflected light having to travel a longer distance throughout Earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering away most blue wavelengths (which are shorter than red wavelengths). Native American tribes across North America gave the strawberry moon its name to mark the in-season ripeness of strawberries, according to\u00a0The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The moon\u2019s low placement in the sky could also cause the orb to appear bigger than usual, according to\u00a0NASA,\u00a0due to an effect dubbed the moon illusion. Scientists don\u2019t really know why this optical illusion happens, but it\u2019s believed to be a combination of how our brain processes visual information and the moon\u2019s size in comparison with smaller objects near the horizon, such as trees or the roofs of houses. For optimal viewing, Dyches recommends looking when the moon is rising or setting to see the effects of the moon illusion. No equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features, according to\u00a0NASA\u2019s Moon Viewing Guide. \u201cWhenever something beautiful about the natural world can be experienced from your doorstep, it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time,\u201d Dyches said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to marvel at the sight of another giant world. \u2026 I like to gaze up and think of it as a place people will live and work someday.\u201d How to see the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019 in the night sky Because the moon appears full for three days a month surrounding its peak, the strawberry moon will be visible to almost everyone worldwide. However, it will be more difficult to observe for those farther north, such as in Alaska or Denmark, where the low-traversing moon will only briefly rise above the horizon, Dyches said. Besides the full moon, those in the Northern Hemisphere can spot the \u201cSummer Triangle,\u201d an arrangement of three bright stars whose presence in the sky symbolizes summertime in the north, said Dyches, who also produces the space agency\u2019s monthly sky-watching highlights video called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up.\u201d To find the triangular pattern, it is easiest to look for the brightest of the three stars, Vega, which will be near the east in the sky, according to EarthSky. The second brightest, Altair, will be to the lower right, and the star Deneb, to the lower left of Vega, will finish off the sides of the triangle. Those away from bright city lights can spot the center of the Milky Way as a \u201chazy band of dim clouds arching across the sky,\u201d and the constellation Scorpius can be seen as it \u201cpoints the way to the galaxy\u2019s core,\u201d Dyches added. Remaining moons of 2024 There are six more full moons set to shine bright in the sky this year,\u00a0according to EarthSky.

The three-day holiday of Eid-al-Adha commemorates the story in the Quran of God appearing to Ibrahim, or Abraham, in a dream and commanding him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. The holiday, which starts on Sunday this year, is determined by the lunar calendar, and Saudi Arabia announces the dates according to its time zone. Muslims believe that as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, an angel of God stopped him and gave him a ram to sacrifice in place of his son. A version of the story also appears in both Christian and Jewish scriptures. Many people kick off the holiday by calling and texting Muslims they know throughout the world with \u201cEid Mubarak,\u201d which means blessed feast or festival. Families typically attend a special morning prayer at the local mosque and then gather with loved ones to feast over a holiday meal and exchange money or gifts. Others may make a obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca \u2014 the Hajj pilgrimage \u2014 to visit the holiest sites in Islam, including the mountainous region where Abraham\u2019s feted act took place. Muslims also honor Abraham\u2019s sacrifice with udhiya or qurbani \u2014 sacrificing a cow, sheep or goat and then sharing the meat with friends and family and offering it to those in need. Many people also send donations to or place qurbani orders in Muslim countries to feed disadvantaged people. These traditions are reminders that letting go, having faith and doing good deeds will be rewarded, said Dr. Yasmine Saad, a clinical psychologist and author in New York City. This message and the pious and social acts of Eid, such as celebrating with friends and family and spreading acts of charity exemplify mindfulness and can be helpful when implemented regularly. \u201cEid is a reminder that we should strive to add more of this balance in our day-to-day,\u201d said Dr. Rania Awaad, clinical professor of psychiatry and director of the Stanford Muslim Mental Health & Islamic Psychology lab. Here are some mindful takeaways from the Eid holiday that you can include in your routine \u2013 no matter what you believe in. At its core, mindfulness is staying in the present, focusing on one\u2019s thoughts, feelings and surroundings without judgment. The practice of mindfulness carries multiple health and wellness benefits such as decreasing pain, reducing stress and easing feelings of depression. Stay hopeful and look for silver linings The story of Abraham is not easily transferable to everyday life as it was an example of an extreme hurdle, but the lesson of pushing through a hardship and carrying on with resilience is relatable.\u00a0 \u201cIslam really develops this notion of faithfulness and patience in the face of a trial,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Reynolds, professor of Islamic Studies and Theology at University of Notre Dame. In Islamic spirituality, this mindset \u201cbecomes a real important way for Muslims to carry on through trials, suffering, oppression, evil that they suffer in life.\u201d Reynolds describes this mindset as a \u201csustaining force\u201d for Muslims. And it\u2019s not limited to Islam \u2014 anyone can reflect on one\u2019s current circumstances and look for positivity as a way to get through the hard parts. Do your part and trust the process During Abraham\u2019s challenging ordeal, his wife was also being tested. According to Islamic narrative, she was left alone in the desert in present-day Mecca with their son so that Abraham could follow God\u2019s command. In this story, the baby was in desperate need of nourishment, so the mother ran between two hills seven times to try to procure water for the baby. Eventually water \u2014 of which the well has become the source of holy water for Muslims \u2014 sprung up from the ground where the baby\u2019s feet lay. It sounds like a miraculous happening, but when applied to daily life, one can view it as doing one\u2019s work and trusting that things fall into place. Abraham\u2019s wife did her part by trying her best to search for nourishment for her child. Feeding others \u2018feeds the soul\u2019 Muslims commemorate the day with the sacrifice of an animal, and they take it a step further by making a meal of it for their own families and for people less fortunate. In this way they venerate Abraham while underscoring sharing and giving. At the root of qurbani is creating a shared experience while giving to others. \u201cA lot of people are feeling purposeless, and they feel that what they do in their life doesn\u2019t hit home,\u201d Saad said. \u201cGiving to others, giving to poor (people), sharing, making an impact in other people\u2019s lives always feeds the soul.\u201d You can make cooking for others, volunteering at a soup kitchen and donating your money, time or goods a regular \u2014 but impactful \u2014 part of your routine. Giving can \u201crealign people so their mind will be different, they will think more positive thoughts, their bodies will feel better, they will have a smile on their face,\u201d Saad said. By stepping out of one\u2019s routine and giving to others, it can help make \u201cyou feel you have an impact, you help, you have significance.\u201d This sense of purpose and meaning contributes to living a happier and longer life, according to an expert. In a larger sense, kindness contributes to one\u2019s sense of community and belonging, and donating to others has proven to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health, according to studies. It takes a village Humans are inherently social creatures, and loneliness and social isolationa are not good for one\u2019s brain, body or spirit, according to research. Even the size of a person\u2019s social network can impact health. Smaller networks are linked to larger feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can impact disease and death rates. Further, more positive experiences in social relationships is generally linked to better coping and lower stress. Because Eid is celebrated over a period of three days, the holiday emphasizes socializing and connecting with others for longer than just an afternoon or a day. These kinds of \u201csocial ceremonies\u201d can be helpful, said Dr. David Spiegel, psychiatrist and director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford Medicine. People have survived because \u201cwe\u2019ve formed communities, and support one another, and protect one another,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a community act that gives you a sense of doing something and doing something together with other people does help people to manage stress better.\u201d Connecting with one\u2019s community and expanding that circle, or even in smaller ways such as making time for a friend can be healthy. Fill your cup While going on the Hajj pilgrimage might be spiritually fulfilling for some Muslims, it may not be practical for everyone to take that journey. But creating space that brings in any sort of fulfillment can usher in new, exciting energy. Whether it\u2019s reading a good book or going on a yoga retreat for example, it can be something you do for your growth and gratification. Even a hike can do it for some, Awaad explained. \u201cIt could be something that just fills your cup to where you\u2019re able to then ground yourself and be much more attuned to the people around you and to the work that you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/health/eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_abortion-clinics-in-banned-states-pivot", "text": "In the last couple years, Houston Women\u2019s Reproductive Services scaled down from nearly 5,000 square-feet to an 800-square-foot location. The Texas clinic cut more than a dozen full-time employees down to a medical director and three part-time staff members. It\u2019s no longer able to provide abortions, but it changed its focus and stayed open. \u201cI was willing to make whatever sacrifices needed to be made to keep our head above water, just keep the doors open and the lights on, and be able to provide care to these people who desperately need our help,\u201d said clinic administrator Kathy Kleinfeld. It\u2019s one example of the shift to the the country\u2019s abortion landscape since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision ended the federal right to abortion two years ago. Since then, 14 states have near-total bans on abortion. Clinics can no longer provide abortions in more than a quarter of US states. Although the total number of facilities that provide abortions in the United States hasn\u2019t changed that much \u2013 only a couple dozen clinics have closed completely \u2013 the number of closures doesn\u2019t always capture the upheaval. States that enacted abortion bans generally had few clinics to start with. Since Dobbs, some packed up and moved to places where they can still provide care, but may require patients to travel further. Still other clinics remain open, but in a different capacity. Kleinfeld\u2019s clinic in Houston pivoted to broader reproductive health, including pre- and post-abortion care for those who travel out of state or self-manage their abortions. In the months before the Supreme Courts\u2019 Dobbs decision, there were about 3,000 abortions a month in Houston and Kleinfeld said she knew that need wouldn\u2019t stop once Texas\u2019 trigger law banned abortions. \u201cThere were a lot of different ways it could have gone; most of all would have involved closing,\u201d Kleinfeld said of her clinic in Houston. \u201cThat was just not something I was willing to do.\u201d Few clinics to start with In 2021, there were about 750 abortion clinics in the United States, according to data from the University of California San Francisco\u2019s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.\u00a0Less than a tenth \u2013 only about 60 of them \u2013 were in the 14 states that have since banned abortion. \u201cThe reason that banned states did not have many facilities to begin with is that they were hostile to abortion and put up barriers to providing abortion services even before Dobbs,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College. Her research focuses on the US abortion landscape, and she has been tracking travel distances to abortion facilities. These states were more likely to have regulations like mandatory waiting periods and parental involvement that created challenges for people seeking abortions, as well as logistical hurdles for providers, such as those in Texas. \u201cThis is basic economic theory,\u201d Myers said. Strict regulatory environments created high costs to entry for providers, leaving space for only the few that could effectively scale their services up enough to survive, she said. The Dobbs decision wasn\u2019t the first time abortion clinics in Texas confronted their fate. About half of the abortion clinics there closed in 2013 when the state legislature passed a law that required them to meet hospital-like standards. The US Supreme Court overturned those restrictions, but dozens of doors closed remained shuttered. \u201cHaving lived through that, I knew all the other clinics \u2013 the very few that were left \u2013 I knew they were going to close\u201d after the Dobbs decision, Kleinfeld said. By 2023, the total number of facilities providing abortions in the US was down to about 725, the UCSF data shows. But each clinic closure has a ripple of negative effects, experts say, especially in regions where services have already been suppressed. \u201cWe need every single abortion clinic in this country. There really aren\u2019t enough for the number of people who need care,\u201d said Nikki Madsen, executive director at Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion care providers and other stakeholders. \u201cWhen we treat abortion in an isolated way, we miss the broader cost of closing a clinic.\u201d About two-thirds of the clinics in states with bans have stayed open in some capacity, the UCSF data shows. Clinics often provide other reproductive health-care services and are sometimes the only touchpoint that people have with the health-care system. \u201cIndependent clinics have always been based in their communities. They really understand the communities where they\u2019re located and the people that they serve in those communities,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cSo over this time, the clinics have been really working to figure out how they can continue to serve the same communities that they were serving pre-Dobbs in an increasingly hostile environment.\u201d Clinics move to the front lines While some clinics have held their ground with a shift in focus, a handful of others have relocated into key access states or opened new locations. \u201cProviders are going to locations that place them as close as possible to the places where people are coming out of banned states in search of abortion,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThey are primarily locating in places that put them on the front lines to receive patients, very strategically in southern Illinois, in New Mexico, in Virginia.\u201d The number of abortion clinics in New Mexico more than doubled post-Dobbs, rising from five in 2021 to 11 in 2023, according to the UCSF data. And the number of abortion providers in Illinois grew from 27 to 36 in that time frame. Among the new additions is CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, which relocated its abortion clinic from Memphis, where abortion is banned, about 200 miles north to Carbondale, a small city in southern Illinois. It still has a location in Tennessee that offers other services including birth control consultations and STI testing. Red River Women\u2019s Clinic had a much less distant \u2013 but no less significant \u2013 move. It popped just a couple miles away from its original location in Fargo, North Dakota, over the border into Minnesota. \u201cWe were the only abortion clinic in North Dakota for over 20 years,\u201d said Tammi Kromenaker, the clinic director. \u201cWe knew that if we didn\u2019t do something, those patients who already drive three, four, five hours one way just to get to our clinic would face even bigger hurdles.\u201d Kromenaker says she had been exploring options to move the clinic out of North Dakota years before the Dobbs decision as a conservative state legislature threatened the clinic\u2019s work, but options felt out of reach, mainly because they were too expensive. But when the Dobbs decision leaked a month before it was handed down, the need to act instantly outweighed those concerns. \u201cIt just was just this thing, like, \u2018we just have to do this. We have to, no matter the obstacles,\u2019\u201d Kromenaker said, and she was thankful for a fundraising campaign that buoyed the clinic in that leap. Struggle for solid financial footing As clinics weigh their options in a post-Dobbs world, finances are the greatest determining factor. \u201cIt costs money to close the clinic. It costs money to reopen the clinic. If patients have never gone to you for prenatal care before, it\u2019s going to take time to develop a patient population who comes to you for prenatal care,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cAll of these shifts really require community support and financial support from the community to continue to keep these clinics open.\u201d And constant changes to the abortion landscape in the US exacerbate clinics\u2019 struggle for solid footing. \u201cI would have expected to see providers open in North Florida and North Carolina, which were both geographically important destinations after Dobbs, except for the fact that both states are fairly hostile to abortion,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe future there was so uncertain, and I think it was too risky to open.\u201d Before Dobbs, a 100-mile increase in distance to the nearest clinic could prevent about 1 in 5 people who wanted an abortion from being able to reach a facility to get one, her research shows. Travel distance to abortion clinics continues to be a critical barrier to access, but a surge in virtual clinics has helped fill some of that gap. In the last few months of 2023, about 1 in 5 abortions in the US were telehealth abortions, where medication abortions pills were mailed to a patient after a remote consultation with a clinician, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning. By December, nearly a tenth of all abortions in the US \u2013 about 8,000 a month \u2013 were telehealth abortions provided under shield laws, which allow providers in some states where abortion remains legal to prescribe medication abortion drugs via telehealth to people living in states with bans or restrictions. \u201cSome people have resources to travel, but the pressure on brick-and-mortar clinics continues to build,\u201d said Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project. \u201cNow, patients can get their medications sooner because they don\u2019t have to wait for a spot to open up in a clinic or find a way to get there. It\u2019s vital.\u201d A Supreme Court ruling last week maintained broad access to medication abortion, but other ongoing legal challenges and ballot measures that will be on the table in a few states during this year\u2019s election leave policies and planning very much in flux. Although Red River has moved all of its staff and services to the Minnesota, Kromenaker has kept the address in Fargo to maintain standing in ongoing legal battles with the state. \u201cIt would have been easy to just walk away and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to sell this building. We\u2019re done with North Dakota. We\u2019re out,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe have fought so long and so hard, we just didn\u2019t want to give up. We\u2019re just one little clinic, but downtown Fargo is still, technically, our corporate address so that we can maintain that standing in North Dakota and continue to fight for those patients we\u2019ve served for \u2026 26 years in July.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/abortion-clinics-in-banned-states-pivot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Looking back, Tammy Maida, 67, said things started to change in her late 50s. At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_fauci-memoir-gupta-interview", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards wear you down.\u201d That phrase, instilled in Dr. Anthony Fauci when he was a student at the Jesuit-run Regis High School in New York City, might as well be the motto of his professional life. Even though he chose a career centered in science, medicine and public health, controversy has always had a way of finding him, even as he tried to make it constructive. Fauci chronicles many such moments in his new memoir, \u201cOn Call: A Doctor\u2019s Journey in Public Service.\u201d Fauci was in the public eye for decades as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, but he became a veritable household name at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was charged with monitoring and mitigating the spread of the virus. Fauci spoke frequently to the worried and bewildered American public at government news conferences, giving status updates and offering guidance on face masks, social distancing, school closures, hospitalization rates and, eventually, vaccines. Many credit him with helping the country navigate the uncharted waters of the coronavirus crisis with his medical expertise, calm demeanor and signature Brooklyn-tinged gravelly voice. At the same time, Fauci was navigating his own political headwinds \u2013 some from his boss, former President Donald Trump, who tried to play down the threat of SARS-CoV-2 even as he initiated Operation Warp Speed, the $10 billion-plus public-private partnership focused on rapidly developing vaccines as well as therapeutics. Speaking to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Fauci described how \u201cpainful\u201d it was at one point to correct Trump about hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19 during a news conference early in the pandemic, a move that upset some of the President\u2019s aides. But Trump\u2019s attention was elsewhere, Fauci said: When he called the doctor to his office, the President surprised him by talking about how many people were watching the news conferences. As the pandemic continued, many coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and antivaxxers blamed Fauci personally for struggles with school closures, mask mandates and vaccine recommendations. Even now, Fauci recently testified, he still faces death threats. The pandemic was not the first time Fauci found himself in the center of a political and medical maelstrom. He was in the hot seat during the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s, when his agency spearheaded the effort to fight the widening epidemic. HIV/AIDS activists called him and the entire medical establishment out for not doing enough or moving quickly enough to help people infected with the virus. Yet throughout his career, Fauci seems to have taken public criticism in stride and used it, even, to build something better. It was an attitude he learned in childhood. \u201cThe Jesuit priests, when you thought that all of a sudden the whole world was pounding on you, they would say \u2018Illegitimi non carborundum,\u2019 which means \u2018don\u2019t let the bastards wear you down,\u2019 which \u2026 lately, that is a very relevant and appropriate saying,\u201d Fauci told Gupta. \u201cThey don\u2019t get me down to the point of interfering with what my work is, but it does wear and tear on you,\u201d he added. Fauci recently sat down for a conversation with Gupta \u2014 one of the many they have shared over the years \u2014 to discuss his life\u2019s work and his legacy. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. (Listen to more of the conversation on the podcast \u201cChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\u201d here.) Dr. Sanjay Gupta: You talk about this interesting press briefing that you did. This is in March of 2020.\u00a0And you had to correct the record, even if the President was talking. How challenging is that? Dr. Anthony Fauci: I said to myself, \u201cI have a responsibility to preserve my own personal integrity and a responsibility to the American public.\u201d\u00a0\u2026 So when I walked up to the podium, I said, \u201cHere it goes!\u201d That was painful to me, to have to do that, but there was no doubt that I had to do it. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cWell, maybe you should, and maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d There was no doubt that I had to do it, because I would actually be just relinquishing my responsibility. And what happened is that the President was less upset about that than the people around him, who really got upset. But then he called me in his office once when he wanted to ask me another question, and he was looking at three different televisions, and he says, \u201cMy God, these ratings are amazing. They\u2019re better than cable; they\u2019re better than network.\u201d The President \u2014 it\u2019s no secret. I\u2019m not divulging a secret about the President \u2014 he was very, very fixated on image and ratings. And he thought that the amount of attention that was given to the press briefings was really terrific. And his comment was, \u201cWow, do you see those ratings?\u201d And my feeling was, \u201cThe ratings are in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d Gupta: I want to talk about the 54 years of public service \u2014 almost 40 years, as you say, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Go back to June 5, 1981. That was a date you really talked a lot about in the book. What\u2019s the significance of that? Fauci: I was in my office in the clinical center at the NIH, and I read the June 5 [issue of the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which described five cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among five gay men in LA] and I looked at it and I said, \u201cGosh, what a curiosity. This is strange that they\u2019re all gay men.\u201d But maybe there was talk about using poppers or drugs to enhance your sexual experience that maybe somehow had the collateral effect of suppressing their immune system. But it bothered me. Boy, you really have got to suppress the immune system a lot to get pneumocystis [a serious lung infection caused by a common fungus]. \u2026 So I put it aside, saying \u201cit\u2019s probably a fluke, and it\u2019s just going to disappear.\u201d The real transforming thing came one month later, in July of 1981, when the second MMWR came; this time, 26 \u2014 curiously \u2014 all young, otherwise healthy gay men, not only from L.A. but from San Francisco and New York City, who presented not only with pneumocystis but with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and multiple other opportunistic infections. I can say \u2014 retrospectively, when you try to evaluate the different landmarks in your life, in your career \u2014 reading that MMWR totally transformed my professional career because I made the decision right there, even though I had a very successful career up to that point \u2026 I said, \u201cthis is a brand new disease. \u00a0And even though I don\u2019t know what it is, there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s an infection. \u2026 And it seems to be destroying the immune system.\u201d And here I am: boards in internal medicine, boards in infectious diseases, boards in clinical immunology. I said, \u201cIf there\u2019s one disease that I have to study, is this disease.\u201d Gupta: I don\u2019t think many people who sort of know you from Covid realize that in many ways, you went through some of these same challenges before with HIV/AIDS. Not just new disease, trying to find new therapeutics, but the activists. What was that part of your life like? Fauci: Well, naturally, people ask about the difference or similarity between the pushing back against me and the government in HIV and pushing back against the government and me as the face of Covid. \u2026 It is as different as peanuts and watermelons. It just is very different because the [HIV/AIDS] activists were trying to get the attention of the authorities, the scientific authorities and the regulatory authorities, that the time-proven way of approaching the development of interventions for a new disease doesn\u2019t work well for a disease that\u2019s rapidly killing themselves and their friends and their loved ones. So they wanted a seat at the table. \u2026 So their confrontation to us was based on a good thing. I think back to John Lewis\u2019 \u201cgood trouble\u201d versus bad trouble. They made good trouble for us because they wanted us to just put ourselves in their shoes. \u2026 Again, one of the best things I did in my career was to, instead of running away from them the way most of the scientific community did \u2026 I said to myself, \u201cThis can\u2019t work, so let me put aside the theatrics and the disruption and listen to what they have to say.\u201d And what they had to say made absolutely perfect sense to me. And I said to myself, \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I would be doing exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d That\u2019s when I invited them in to sit down with us and said \u201clet\u2019s start talking.\u201d \u2026 It became such that they became an important part of the community scientific effort to address HIV with therapeutics, with prevention, with regulation, to the point now where they\u2019re on all of our advisory committees. They\u2019re part of the discussion. And quite frankly, many of them turned out to be some of my closest friends. Gupta: But just to punctuate this point, though, at that time, going back 40 years, did you feel that way, the way you\u2019re describing it now? I mean, this idea that, \u201cHey, look, there might be something to be gained from these confrontations\u201d? Fauci: The thing that drove me was empathy, which has been something that has driven my motivation about medicine and about anything that I\u2019ve done, that goes back to my family, that I describe in the book: my parents and my training in the Jesuit schools. There\u2019s empathy for people who are in trouble and people who are suffering. When you combine empathy with listening to them \u2014 just forget the screaming and the yelling. Just listen to what they\u2019re saying. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, it just made perfect sense to me. So my interaction and my response to them, as I often get asked, is dramatically different than someone, on the basis of no evidence, accuses you of killing people or that scene of Marjorie Taylor Greene at the hearing. I mean, come on. That is nothing like what the [HIV] activists were doing. Gupta: What do you want your legacy to be? How do you want people to reflect on Dr. Anthony Fauci? Fauci: I\u2019ve thought about that, and when I think about legacies \u2014 I really, honestly mean this \u2014 I will leave that to other people to decide. I know what I\u2019ve done \u2026 with the development of drugs for HIV, with the development of the vaccine for Covid. I know that, but that\u2019s not [for me to] say, \u201cI want my legacy to be this,\u201d because people are going to have different interpretations of that \u2026 But what I would want my legacy to be, something that I am certain of, is that I have given it 100% every single day. And in the sports analogy, I can say I always left it on the field or left it on the court \u2026 I never held back. I just gave everything I could for the discipline I\u2019m in, which is science, medicine and public health. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like my legacy to be.

{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_food-hoarding-wellness", "text": "Having grown up with food insecurity, Kimi Ceridon and her sister see how their childhood experiences continue to leave their mark on their lives. Ceridon looks back on how she would sneak off to her room with any extras she could come by. And now, she is protective of getting a fair portion size when sharing with someone. And when the pandemic hit, Ceridon said she and her sister talked about how conscious they had to be not to panic and run out to stores to hoard food. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in scarcity, and now here we were again living in scarcity, and even though both of us no longer had concerns of food insecurity, it was bringing up a lot of anxiety,\u201d said Ceridon, owner of Life Love Cheese, a grazing board company in Boston. Many people like to see a pantry full of food available for themselves and their family. But when the amount of food gets to be too much, is hidden or becomes too precious to toss when it goes bad, a person might be dealing with food hoarding, experts say. An estimated 2% to 6% of people suffer from a hoarding disorder, according to the International OCD Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Among those disorders is food hoarding. About 75% of those people have another mental health condition alongside hoarding, such as major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, the foundation said. It is natural to have an emotional relationship with food and get comfort from having it available, said Kate Daigle, licensed professional counselor and certified eating disorder specialist in Denver. But for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a history of food scarcity or other trauma, the desire to have a stockpile of food may become debilitating, said New York psychologist Dr. Alexis Conason. What is food hoarding? Food hoarding can vary depending on the access the person has to buying food, Daigle said. For young children, it can mean hiding food from their parents or caregivers in their room or their closet \u2014 sometimes eating it, but sometimes not, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just having it there as a form of emotional safety, coming from a place of feeling deprived,\u201d Daigle said. \u201cNot necessarily physically deprived from food, but maybe emotionally having some deprivation or scarcity mindset around food.\u201d For adults or children with access to money, it can mean going out and buying large quantities of food and sometimes stashing it in hiding places as well, Daigle said. What\u2019s so bad about hoarding food? It is interesting to talk about food hoarding after the lockdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic, because food hoarding served a purpose in that time, Daigle said. But for many Americans, having a basement, pantry or entire home filled with food isn\u2019t necessary, she said. A fixation around hoarding food can have a financial impact when a person spends all their money on food and can\u2019t take care of other basic needs. There are also sanitary and health concerns when that food goes bad, Daigle said. There are concerns around mental health and social relationships as well, she added. Some people engaging in food hoarding behaviors may isolate out of shame or feel more comfortable being around food versus being out in public. Why do people hoard food? Storing more food than we need at a given moment is in some ways strategic and common in nature, said Dr. Erin Rhinehart, professor of neuroscience at Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. \u201cIt evolved as like insurance against famine,\u201d she said. Many animals have evolved mechanisms for storing food to protect their survival, she added. \u201cIn animals, if they actually experience like a short period with no food, that behavior increases,\u201d Rhinehart said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically an insurance policy or a way to make sure that you\u2019re never going to run out of food.\u201d Food hoarding may share underlying problems with \u2014 but is not necessarily caused by \u2014 eating disorders, Daigle said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the food. It\u2019s about the behavior,\u201d she said. Some eating disorders have food hoarding as part of their behaviors, and the same experience may drive people to cope with both hoarding and eating disorder behaviors, she said. Many people with these behaviors may have had significant trauma in their childhood. \u201cPerhaps there was a true lack of available resources financially for food for the family, and so the child might hoard what food they can,\u201d she said. And as adults, people might continue to hoard food in fear there will be a scarcity again. But shortages of other things children need may also lead to food hoarding, Daigle said. \u201cIt could be where food is controlled or a child\u2019s emotional needs are not met,\u201d she said. Safety and security are not guaranteed in families with addiction, physical or emotional abuse, or neglect, she said. \u201cThat can turn into holding comfort objects, whether it\u2019s food or other sentimental objects, to try to take care of those needs,\u201d Daigle said. Curiosity and compassion It\u2019s common for food hoarding to cause shame and drive people into isolation, so remember to approach any loved ones you think might be hoarding with curiosity and without judgment, Daigle said. Instead of focusing on how shocking you may find the behaviors, ask about their emotional experience, she added. If you see this behavior in yourself, know there are ways to feel better, Daigle said. The next step is to find professional support to heal any deep traumas and unmet needs so you can replace the food hoarding with healthier coping mechanisms, she added. The professional you work with should not be a diet coach or someone who shames you over food, however. Instead, look for a licensed professional with expertise in trauma, eating disorders, OCD, anxiety and compulsive behaviors, she said. \u201cThe key thing is how much time and space is this taking up in your life?\u201d Conason said. \u201cIf it feels like it\u2019s stopping you from doing things that you enjoy or into interfering with your quality of life, it\u2019s definitely a good idea to seek out support.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/food-hoarding-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_tiktok-falsehoods-sun-protection-wellness", "text": "As our planet endures what may be the hottest year on record, social media influencers are spawning messages about the sun and sunscreen that are not only false, but dangerous, say experts. \u201cStop wearing sunscreen,\u201d says a TikTok influencer with 1.6 million followers and 36 million likes. \u201cThe more time you spend outside, the less likely you are to get sunburned,\u201d proclaims a shirtless TikTokker with nearly 90,000 followers and over 11 million likes. \u201cThe sun does not cause skin cancer,\u201d insists a TikTok pundit with 76,000 followers in a post that has been bookmarked nearly 4,000 times. \u201cCooling down the skin can help prevent sunburns,\u201d claims another TikTokker with over 4 million likes. \u201cWhen I feel my skin starting to get hot in the sun, I\u2019ll go in the ocean or I\u2019ll go in the pool, and I\u2019ll cool down.\u201d Such assertions fly in the face of decades of scientific research on the dangers of sun exposure and the protective role of sunscreen, experts say. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a \u201cproven human carcinogen,\u201d causing squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, which works closely with industry. Long-wave ultraviolet A rays (UVA) and short-wave ultraviolet B rays (UVB) penetrate the ozone layer\u00a0and can burn, damage and age skin\u00a0even on cloudy days. \u201cExtensive research has shown that UV radiation from the sun is a significant cause of skin cancers such as melanoma. It\u2019s really indisputable at this point,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen Suozzi, a dermatologic surgeon at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cUV radiation has both UVA and UVB, and we know that both of them damage the DNA in skin cells,\u201d she said. \u201cThese mutations accumulate over time and then lead to skin cancer \u2014 which can quickly spread throughout the body \u2014 as well as wrinkles, dark spots and other signs of skin aging.\u201d What should you do? Wearing a hat, sunglasses and protective clothing \u2014 along with sunscreen and staying in the shade during the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \u2014 will help protect the skin from sun damage, experts say. Jumping in the water to cool off the skin, however, does not. \u201cIt\u2019s really the exact opposite,\u201d Suozzi said. \u201cYou\u2019ll just lose the sense of heat, so you\u2019ll get a higher exposure to UV without knowing it, and because the water is reflective, you\u2019ll get a double hit of exposure to your face.\u201d Early sun damage can lead to melanoma years later Historically, younger generations often fail to adequately protect themselves from the sun, experts say. Surveys show that trend continues today among Gen Z young adults. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only 8% of men and 26% of women younger than 30 said they always used sunscreen when outside for more than an hour on a sunny day. \u201cSunlight isn\u2019t toxic, sunscreen is,\u201d according to an X contributor who says he has a doctorate in tanning without sunscreen. While some products do contain worrisome chemicals, many do not, and today\u2019s broad spectrum sunscreens do a much better job at protecting the skin from UVA and UVB rays, said David Andrews, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a consumer organization which advocates for sunscreen safety. \u201cMineral-based sunscreens are not absorbed into the skin and are better for the environment,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThere are many good, safe choices on the market that don\u2019t leave a white cast on the skin.\u201d Unless accelerated by a tanning bed, skin damage can take years, if not decades to develop, experts say, leaving today\u2019s unwary youth at risk for early skin aging and lethal skin cancers such as melanoma. \u201cMelanoma is the deadliest cancer known to man,\u201d said Dr. Kelly Olino, clinical director of the Smilow Melanoma Program at the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cMelanoma is the only type of cancer where, if it is two-millimeters in size, we say \u2018Goodness, this is serious,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf you had a two-millimeter colon cancer, we\u2019d be having a parade saying, \u2018Wow, we got this one really, really early.\u2019\u201d Sun tanning versus sunburns While getting a sunburn appears to be a no-no for many of these social media gurus, they do encourage their followers to get a tan. The reasoning goes like this: As UV exposure is increased, a pigment in the skin called melanin darkens. Melanin has protective properties against UV radiation; therefore tanning should be encouraged. \u201cSlow exposure to the sun allows you to build melanin and protect skin the natural way,\u201d says a Tiktokker who has gathered over 3 million likes. \u201cAs long as\u00a0you have a good tan, you don\u2019t need sunscreen. It\u2019s much better to just quietly, slowly build up a tan during the spring,\u201d said a computer scientist interviewed on X, formerly known as Twitter. That\u2019s just so wrong, according to experts. \u201cTanning is the body\u2019s response to being damaged, so tanned skin is already damaged skin, and all you\u2019re doing is creating more and more damage,\u201d Olino said. \u201cIn the best case scenario with your \u2018base tan\u2019 or sun damaged skin, the melanin that\u2019s produced gives you an SPF of 2 to 4 or so, and we would never tell people that anything less than 30 SPF would be protective from additional sun damage,\u201d she said. In fact, a sunburn is much more than a red flag for a little sun damage. It\u2019s a sign of actual cell death, Suozzi explained. \u201cWe see this under the microscope,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call them sunburnt cells, and you can see them actually dying. And when they die, the body creates inflammation, and that\u2019s what causes the redness. It\u2019s a very inflammatory process.\u201d When it comes to vitamin D, 15 minutes of sun on the skin each day is all that is needed, said Andrews, and the skin does not need to be free of sunscreen for that to happen. \u201cVitamin D can still be generated when you\u2019re wearing sunscreen,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cYou can actually still have that beneficial sun exposure while you\u2019re wearing a sunscreen that\u2019s reducing the risk of sunburn and preventing overexposure to the sun.\u201d A little truth, a lot of malarky Social media pundits often espouse ideas that distort a grain of truth, such as pointing to data that shows a simultaneous rise in sunscreen use and new melanoma diagnoses. \u201cSince sunscreen came out, the rise of skin cancer has only gone up and up,\u201d says one TikTok influencer. \u201cIf you think sunscreen is protecting you from melanoma, why is the rate going up?\u201d asks the computer scientist in her TikTok interview. It is true that the rate of melanoma cases has been rising, but it\u2019s not due to sunscreen, Suozzi said. Instead, credit dermatologists, who are detecting skin cancers at earlier stages and saving lives. That\u2019s a good thing. \u201cDue to better screening we are detecting melanomas at earlier stages, which leads to higher reported incidence rates,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition, the sun exposure that\u2019s causing the increase in melanomas today occurred 40 or 50 years ago, when people were in their 20s and unlikely to use sunscreen. So the driving force is exposure years and years ago, not the increased use of sunscreen today.\u201d Sunglasses are another target. As one TikTok influencer told his friend: \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get sunburned if you wear sunglasses. \u201cOur eyes can sense the sun \u2026. and when it\u2019s harsh lighting our eyes tell us to produce melanin in our skin,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf our eyes can\u2019t realize that the sun is that harsh because we\u2019re wearing a lens over top, it\u2019s gonna burn your skin.\u201d So if people go out into the sun with sunglasses on, \u201cyou can burn a lot easier because your brain didn\u2019t get the message that the sun\u2019s hot,\u201d another said. While the eyes do contain melanin \u2014 that\u2019s what determines our eye color \u2014 the vast majority of the body\u2019s pigmentation is produced by cells in the skin, which is the largest organ of the body. Ultraviolet light penetrates deep into the lower layer of the epidermis to trigger the process. \u201cThe videos seem to imply that if you weren\u2019t wearing sunglasses, you\u2019d also get tanned under your clothes, which we absolutely know doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d EWG\u2019s Andrews said. \u201cIf it\u2019s only going to the brain, then your whole body would be perfectly tanned, right? \u201cIt made me laugh and cry. It\u2019s frightening, and I know those videos have thousands of views, which is shocking, because the message is so separated from reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these falsehoods are only influencing a few people, that\u2019s one person too many.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/tiktok-falsehoods-sun-protection-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_fda-gene-therapy-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration has given the green light for the first gene therapy that treats a rare form of muscular dystrophy to be used in most people who have the disease and a certain genetic mutation. Last year, the drug \u2013 Elevidys, from the biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics \u2013 was approved to treat only children ages 4 and 5 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, one of the most severe forms of inherited muscular dystrophies, who have a confirmed mutation in a gene called DMD that is associated with muscle strength. The FDA announced Thursday that it had given traditional approval for Elevidys for ambulatory people 4 and older with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene and accelerated approval for non-ambulatory people 4 and older with this mutation. There\u2019s not enough data on safety to support its use in children under 4, the agency says. Elevidys, given as a one-time intravenous infusion, costs about $3.2 million per patient, making it among the most expensive drugs in the world. Although eye-popping, such a\u00a0price tag\u00a0isn\u2019t out of step with other one-time gene therapies, which have topped\u00a0$3 million to 4 million\u00a0per patient in recent years. Elevidys was previously approved under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval pathway, which clears medicines for diseases where they\u2019re urgently needed based on data suggesting that they\u2019re likely to confer clinical benefits. The drug has been closely monitored since that approval, and in October, Sarepta Therapeutics released results from a confirmatory trial showing that the therapy missed its primary goal \u2013 a measure of how well kids can move \u2013 but was successful on a number of secondary measures. The approval addressed \u201can urgent unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a devastating condition with limited treatment options, that leads to a progressive deterioration of an individual\u2019s health over time,\u201d Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a news release at the time. It was the first time a therapy of this nature \u2013 a one-time treatment that delivers a working copy of a gene to make up for one that leads to disease \u2013 had been cleared under the accelerated approval framework. The move came after emotional\u00a0testimonials\u00a0from families at an FDA advisory committee meeting. Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes progressive muscle weakness that can rob children of their ability to walk by the time they\u2019re teenagers, and many don\u2019t live well into their 30s. It primarily affects boys because of the way it\u2019s inherited, affecting an estimated 1 in 3,300 boys. The Muscular Dystrophy Association trusts the decision of the FDA, which weighs the risks and benefits of the drug, said Dr. Sharon Hesterlee, chief researcher at the association. \u201cUltimately, what we want is what\u2019s best for our patient community \u2013 and that\u2019s balancing that risk-benefit ratio appropriately,\u201d she said. Potential risks of Elevidys include increases in certain liver enzyme levels and acute serious liver injury. The most common side effects of the drug include vomiting, nausea, increased liver function tests and fever. Yet a major benefit is that the gene therapy provides another option for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and it\u2019s administered just once. There is no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and outside of Elevidys, treatments are limited. Other\u00a0approaches\u00a0may include steroid medications,\u00a0certain\u00a0drugs that change how the muscle cells \u201cread\u201d the mutated gene, physical therapy or surgery to correct spinal curvature, Hesterlee said. \u201cRight now, the\u00a0main\u00a0standard of care for Duchenne is corticosteroids, like prednisone,\u00a0although there are some newer drugs available. These kids are\u00a0still\u00a0often on chronic doses of\u00a0steroids\u00a0for many, many years,\u201d she said, adding that the side effects of corticosteroids \u2013 such as weight gain, behavioral issues and increased risk of bone breakage \u2013 are not ideal. Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be difficult to treat, she said, and having more treatment options that are proven to be effective remains important. \u201cMuscle makes up a significant amount of your body mass. So when you have a disease like this, it\u2019s really impacting a lot of tissue. So anything you do, you\u2019re looking at trying to bring back or stop a disease process that\u2019s really throughout the body, and it\u2019s a disease that\u2019s progressive, so you lose more and more muscle over time,\u201d Hesterlee said. \u201cThat\u2019s made it pretty challenging, but we\u2019ve certainly learned a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t overlook the fact that these boys are living so much longer and doing so much better. Even 20 years ago, they were dying in their teens, and many of them are now living into their 30s. They\u2019re going to college; they have girlfriends; some of them have gotten married. These are things that weren\u2019t happening years ago. So we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/fda-gene-therapy-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_metformin-preconception-pregnancy-birth-defects-risks", "text": "Some studies have raised concerns about a potential link between the widely used type 2 diabetes drug metformin and an increased risk of conceiving a baby with birth defects. But new research now suggests that the use of the medication among men planning to conceive or women in early pregnancy does not appear to be linked with an increased risk of major birth defects for their children. The two studies, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, contradict a 2022 study that linked metformin use by men in the three months before they conceived a baby to a 40% increased risk of birth defects in their offspring. The findings provide \u201cassurance\u201d for parents, said Dr. Ran Rotem, an author of the new study on the paternal use of metformin and a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cConventionally and traditionally, the mother has been the focus when it comes to pregnancy and when it comes to fetal health and the health of the newborn. What we are increasingly finding is that the father is also important,\u201d he said. He added that the increased risk of birth defects seen in previous research could be associated with the disease of diabetes or with related comorbidities, and not so much the medication itself. \u201cWhen we think about a medication, we also have to think about the underlying conditions in which the medication is usually prescribed,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cWe know that diabetes itself is tricky when it comes to both fertility and potential complications in pregnancy and in newborns.\u201d Metformin is a first-line medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and has been widely used to help control blood sugar levels since the 1960s. The medication is now the most commonly prescribed oral drug for type 2 diabetes, and, before taking metformin, people are recommended to tell their doctor if they plan to become pregnant, are pregnant or are breastfeeding. \u2018Health of the father seems to be important\u2019 For the study on paternal use of metformin, researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Kahn-Sagol-Maccabi Research and Innovation Center of Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel analyzed data from birth records and medical records on nearly 400,000 babies born in Israel between 1999 and 2020. They compared that data with information on the babies\u2019 fathers, such as their ages, laboratory test results and medication records, including data on metformin prescriptions. Although the researchers didn\u2019t specifically look at how long the men had been on the medication, \u201cwe did have many people who have been on the medication for a long time, and the results were pretty consistent for those individuals, too,\u201d Rotem said. The researchers found that the prevalence of major birth defects was 4.7% in children of fathers not exposed to diabetes medications in the months leading up to conception, compared with 6.2% in children of fathers exposed to metformin before conceiving. When the researchers adjusted their data for factors such as the fathers\u2019 other underlying health conditions and whether the mother also had diabetes or related comorbidities, they found no increased risk of major birth defects in children exposed to paternal metformin. Men who used diabetes medications during the sperm developmental period, leading up to conceiving, tended to be older in age, had a higher prevalence of underlying health conditions and were more likely to have fertility problems and a history of smoking compared with fathers not exposed to diabetes medications. \u201cWe find that paternal use of metformin in the sperm development period is not associated with excess risk of malformation in newborns, proving assurance that fathers planning to start a family can continue using the drug to control their diabetes,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cMore broadly, our study also suggests that maintaining a good cardiometabolic health profile is important for both partners.\u201d A higher prevalence of underlying health conditions as well as fertility problems was also seen among the mothers of children whose fathers used metformin, compared with the mothers of children with no paternal diabetes medication exposures. \u201cIf the father is on diabetes medication, the mother is much more likely to be on diabetes medication too or have other metabolic comorbidities,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cWe know that diabetes itself is not good when it is in the mother, and we are finding evidence that it\u2019s also tricky for the fathers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can manage diabetes with just changing your lifestyle \u2013 doing more exercise, watching your diet \u2013 that\u2019s probably good, and that\u2019s helpful anyways. But if you have to be medicated, it seems like metformin is a safe choice for both.\u201d The data also showed that risk of a birth defect was higher when the father used metformin along with other medications, described as a polytherapy. Paternal use of metformin alone, known as monotherapy, did not appear to increase the risk for birth defects. \u201cWhen we examined specific treatment regimens, modestly elevated excess risks were still observed, specifically among children of fathers who used metformin in tandem with some other diabetes medication,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cBut we also observed that fathers who took multiple medications had more poorly controlled diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis again indicates that the modestly elevated risk seen for diabetes polytherapies was likely not caused by the medications themselves, but rather by the worse cardiometabolic health profile of the fathers.\u201d \u2018Poor blood sugar control is a risk factor\u2019 The other study that was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine had somewhat similar findings for mothers. Women who continued using metformin\u00a0and added insulin as a treatment\u00a0in their first trimester of pregnancy\u00a0showed little to no increased risk of giving birth to a baby with major birth defects compared with women who discontinued metformin and switched to insulin, according to the study. The researchers, also from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studied data on more than 12,000 women with type 2 diabetes and their pregnancies. The data came from the US Medicaid health care administration\u2019s database from 2000 to 2018. The analysis showed that the estimated risk for giving birth to a baby with birth defects was about 6% when the mother received insulin plus metformin,\u00a0versus\u00a08% when the mother received insulin alone. \u201cWe were not surprised by our findings. Although metformin may cross the placenta, potentially affecting the fetus, metformin can help with blood sugar control which may lower the risk of birth defects,\u201d Dr. Yu-Han Chiu,\u00a0the lead\u00a0author of the study and a researcher at the Harvard T.H.

Despite living in the light-filled streets of central London, my smartphone camera picked up a green haze and a pulsing sheet of purple and pink light. Capturing the moment was an unforgettable experience and one that I had thought would involve expensive travel to the northernmost reaches of our planet. The storms that create spectacular auroras such as those I witnessed originate from the sun\u2019s dynamic magnetic field, an astrophysical enigma that scientists this week came closer to unraveling. Solar update Figuring out how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works will help scientists improve the forecasting of space weather, which dazzles night sky watchers but can disrupt GPS and communication satellites. The sun\u2019s looping magnetic field lines, which form a tangled web of structures more complex than those on Earth, are difficult to study directly. To grasp what\u2019s going on, scientists create mathematical models. A new model, which took more than a decade to develop and required a NASA supercomputer to conduct the detailed calculations, found that the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated much closer to the surface than previously thought. The team believes its model is more accurate because it accounts for a unique solar feature. A long time ago A single gold earring found in the ruins of a 2,000-year-old building in the Pyrenees is a clue to how a devastating fire may have started. The inferno consumed the wooden structure, situated in an Iron Age settlement called Tossal de Baltarga, and killed six animals penned in a stable. Archaeologists believe the fire was deliberate. Had it been accidental, the building\u2019s owners likely would have released the livestock and returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden gold, which was concealed in a jar. The arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic, according to the new study. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but the excavation uncovered telling details of the lives of an Iberian people called the Cerretani. Sky watch The builders of Stonehenge placed the huge stones that make up the prehistoric monument in line with sunrise and sunset on the longest and shortest days of the year, revealing an intimate understanding of the sun that\u2019s still palpable today. But does the 4,500-year-old site in southwest England \u2014 and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world \u2014 also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge has a lunar link first gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored \u2014 until now. This summer, archaeologists are using the lunar standstill, a little-known phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years, to investigate. Across the universe Space scientists have observed the edge of a black hole \u2014 an area known as the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 for the first time. Andrew Mummery, lead author of a new study on black holes and a research fellow at the University of Oxford, compared it to \u201cthe edge of a waterfall\u201d at the end of a river, where orbiting material from nearby stars plummets into the abyss. In the plunging region, matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead hurtles into the black hole. But unlike at the black hole\u2019s event horizon, or surface, light can still escape at this point. The study\u2019s findings, which Albert Einstein predicted, could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes.

Researchers working with Eurasian jays trained to find food hidden under cups said these birds may be capable of the feat of memory. In the experiment, which involved decorated cups, the jays were able to remember what a particular cup looked like, even after the cups were rearranged and a time delay. And in other corvid news, crows can count up to four, the latest research has found.

{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_health_summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness", "text": "Welcome to summer in the Northern Hemisphere, with all its fun in the sun \u2013 and little critters who want to take a bite out of you. Mosquitoes and ticks can transmit vector-borne illnesses, and they are showing up with greater frequency. What can people do to protect themselves while still enjoying all that the summer months have to offer? And what treatments are available if you or your loved ones get bit? To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0Let\u2019s start by talking about tick-borne diseases, specifically Lyme disease. What is Lyme, and why is this something people should pay attention to? Dr.\u00a0Leana Wen:\u00a0In the United States,\u00a0Lyme disease is the\u00a0most common vector-borne disease\u00a0and is transmitted by ticks. People who contract Lyme disease may experience temporary symptoms similar to the flu, such as muscle aches, fever and headache. They also may develop a rash and have joint pain. The concern with Lyme is that some untreated patients progress to having long-term symptoms. These can be severe and debilitating and include ongoing nerve pain, facial paralysis and abnormal heart function. CNN: When is peak season for Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0We are in peak season now. In areas where the disease is prevalent such as the eastern United States, people can be bitten by blacklegged ticks that carry Lyme disease from spring into fall, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, there were reports that Lyme diagnoses\u00a0peaked\u00a0just before the Fourth of July holiday. CNN: Has the incidence of Lyme disease increased in recent years? Wen:\u00a0Yes. The rates of Lyme diagnoses have\u00a0doubled\u00a0from 2004 to 2018, with an increase in geographic prevalence, meaning that more areas have a high incidence of this disease compared to before.\u00a0(Newer data show an even more dramatic increase, though\u00a0surveillance methodology\u00a0has improved to capture more diagnoses.)\u00a0There are a variety of theories as to why this is the case. Most are centered on the influence of climate change \u2014 for example, that warmer temperatures expanded the tick habitat and perhaps also sped up tick life cycles. This is the same with other vector-borne diseases, like those carried by mosquitoes, which are also on the rise\u00a0likely due to rising temperatures. CNN: What can people do to reduce their odds of contracting Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0The most important step is to prevent tick bites. If you are in an area known to have Lyme, you should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when hiking. Use insect repellent that contains the ingredient DEET. After the activity, examine carefully for ticks. If you have young children and pets, take the time to examine them as well. If you find a tick, remove it, save it for identification purposes in a small jar and contact your primary care provider.\u00a0Early antibiotic therapy\u00a0can prevent you from developing Lyme disease. Also, if you end up developing symptoms, get tested right away. Antibiotic treatment can reduce the progression to chronic symptoms. CNN:\u00a0What about mosquitoes? What diseases can they carry? Wen:\u00a0Mosquitoes can transmit a lot of diseases to humans including the West Nile virus,\u00a0dengue\u00a0and malaria. West Nile\u00a0is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. While most people with the illness do not become ill, around 1 in 150 infected people develop a serious illness that can be fatal. In 2023,\u00a047 states\u00a0reported West Nile cases. In total, there were 2,406 reported instances in the US. Dengue is another virus transmitted by mosquitoes. Outbreaks are common globally, and occasionally there are cases reported in the US. Most of these cases\u00a0occur in travelers, but the types of mosquitoes that can spread dengue are found throughout many parts of the US. That means local transmission is possible. In recent years, transmission of dengue by people who have no travel history has happened in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. Another infection transmitted by mosquito that is far more common in other parts of the world is malaria. If untreated, symptoms can become severe and\u00a0progress\u00a0to kidney failure, seizures, coma and death. While most US cases involve travelers who contracted malaria from other parts of the world, locally transmitted cases have occurred, too. Last year, there were such cases reported in Florida, Texas and Maryland. CNN: You\u2019ve mentioned the US cases of malaria. What should people do who are traveling to other countries known to have these and other mosquito-borne illnesses? Wen:\u00a0I advise that people consult the\u00a0CDC\u2019s comprehensive guide, which includes recommendations for each destination country, and make an appointment with your primary care physician or travel medical clinic. Depending on where you are going, your planned activities and your personal medical history, you may be recommended to have additional vaccines or prophylactic medications. For instance, if you are going somewhere with a concern for yellow fever, you may need to get that vaccine. If you are traveling to areas with high rates of malaria, you may be recommended to start antimalarial medicines. CNN: What can everyone do to reduce their chance of getting bitten by mosquitoes? Wen:\u00a0Everyone should keep two key steps in mind. The first is to reduce bites. You can do this by covering arms and legs with clothes when possible. Clothing treated with the insecticide permethrin can provide an added layer of protection. You can also use insect repellent. Make sure to\u00a0use repellents\u00a0that are registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency. These will contain active ingredients like DEET and are safe, even for children and pregnant women. The second key step is source control \u2014 meaning to reduce the mosquitoes near you. During peak mosquito season, in the summer and early fall, use screens on windows and doors to reduce the mosquitoes in your home. In addition, it\u2019s crucial to look for standing water in your garden, as these are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Check for items around your home that could hold water \u2014 such as buckets, trash containers, tires and toys\u2014 and empty and wash them at least once a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_bird-flu-risk-opinion-frieden", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, is president and chief executive of\u00a0Resolve to Save Lives\u00a0and senior fellow for global health at the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations. The United States\u2019 response to H5N1 \u2013 \u201cbird flu\u201d \u2013 has taken too long, showing how risky gaps in coordination and trust can be. With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters in cattle herds from Michigan to Texas, Idaho to North Carolina, it\u2019s clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right. We\u2019ve seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Although the challenge was smaller because of it size, Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, among a half dozen outbreaks that never made headlines, is featured in our new\u00a0Epidemics That Didn\u2019t Happen\u00a0report. The U.S. has done a lot, including scaling up test production, evaluating vaccines, tracking wastewater for related viruses, and providing information about efforts. Finland did three things particularly well; all are relevant to the U.S. response to the virus. Rapid response.\u00a0Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was known to be circulating among birds in Finland, just at the virus has been circulating among birds in the U.S. for the past two years. Human and animal health specialists worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk workers on farms with infected animals. In the United States, H5N1 has been spreading among cattle since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn\u2019t know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The\u00a07-1-7 target for outbreak detection\u00a0and response should be our guiding principle: seven days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, one day to notify public health authorities, and seven days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland\u2019s response met this target. In the U.S., instead of 7 days, the time from emergence of H5N1 in cattle to detection was more like 100 days, and it\u2019s not clear we\u2019ve met the 7-day target for initial response even months into the outbreak. Doing so requires communication and public health measures in the affected communities and an effective coordination mechanism. We must improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health. Trust.\u00a0Farmers already had a high level of trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs, and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals.\u00a0Farmers were immediately reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust of the government in the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland\u2019s\u00a0next move: vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so. Trust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are on the front line of these outbreaks.\u00a0In May, the US Department of Agriculture announced\u00a0payments to farms\u00a0to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including\u00a0covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1,\u00a0compensating farms that\u00a0supply personal protective equipment to their workers, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies.\u00a0We may need to do more to protect our nation\u2019s agricultural sector. Coordinated government response.\u00a0Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. The joint response strengthened detection, collaboration of industry groups, and protection of workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure it had the authority to implement effective control measures. In the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. There are multiple agencies involved: USDA monitors cattle health, US Food and Drug Administration monitors milk safety and the CDC monitors diseases in humans, including from animal exposure. Coordination seems to be improving, but any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country\u2019s size and diversity. We have a lot to learn, and no time to lose.\u00a0First, localities,\u00a0states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies \u2013 including CDC, USDA, FDA \u2013 and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public.\u00a0Second,\u00a0Congress needs to provide resources to prevent and respond to pandemic risks, including for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we\u2019re prepared to stop new events before they become epidemics. Third and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing their questions and concerns. If one country responds to H5N1 well, that\u2019s not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country \u2013 including the United States \u2013 needs an effective response.

{"id": "2024_06_18_health_older-americans-healthcare-affordability-kff-partner-wellness", "text": "What weighs most heavily on older adults\u2019 minds when it comes to health care? The cost of services and therapies, and their ability to pay. \u201cIt\u2019s on our minds a whole lot because of our age and because everything keeps getting more expensive,\u201d said Connie Colyer, 68, of Pleasureville, Kentucky. She\u2019s a retired forklift operator who has lung disease and high blood pressure. Her husband, James, 70, drives a dump truck and has a potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythm. Tens of millions of seniors are similarly anxious about being able to afford health care because of its expense and rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. A new wave of research highlights the reach of these anxieties. When the University of Michigan\u2019s National Poll on Healthy Aging asked people 50 and older about 26 health-related issues, their top three areas of concern had to do with costs: of medical care in general, of long-term care, and of prescription drugs. More than half of 3,300 people surveyed in February and March reported being \u201cvery concerned\u201d about these issues. In fact, five of the top 10 issues identified as very concerning were cost-related. Beyond the top three, people cited the cost of health insurance and Medicare (52%), and the cost of dental care (45%). Financial scams and fraud came in fourth place (53% very concerned). Of much less concern were issues that receive considerable attention, including social isolation, obesity and age discrimination. In an election year, \u201cour poll sends a very clear message that older adults are worried about the cost of health care and will be looking to candidates to discuss what they have done or plan to do to contain those costs,\u201d said John Ayanian, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation. Health care costs are impacting wallets Older adults have good reason to worry. One in 10 seniors (about 6 million people) have incomes below the federal poverty level. About one in four rely exclusively on Social Security payments, which average $1,913 a month per person. Even though inflation has moderated since its 2022 peak, prices haven\u2019t come down, putting a strain on seniors living on fixed incomes. Meanwhile, traditional Medicare doesn\u2019t cover several services that millions of older adults need, such as dental care, vision care or help at home from aides. While private Medicare Advantage plans offer some coverage for these services, benefits are frequently limited. All of this contributes to a health care affordability squeeze for older adults. Recently published research from the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s 2023 Health Care Affordability Survey found that nearly a third of people 65 or older reported difficulty paying for health care expenses, including premiums for Medicare, medications, and expenses associated with receiving medical services. One in seven older adults reported spending a quarter or more of their average monthly budget on health care; 44% spent between 10% and 24%. Seventeen percent said they or a family member had forgone needed care in the past year for financial reasons. The Colyers in Pleasureville are among them. Both need new dentures and eyeglasses, but they can\u2019t afford to pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket, Connie said. \u201cAs the cost of living rises for basic necessities, it\u2019s more difficult for lower-income and middle-income Medicare beneficiaries to afford the health care they need,\u201d said Gretchen Jacobson, vice president of the Medicare program at the Commonwealth Fund. Similarly, \u201cwhen health care costs rise, it\u2019s more difficult to afford basic necessities.\u201d This is especially worrisome because older adults are more prone to illness and disability than younger adults, resulting in a greater need for care and higher expenses. In 2022, seniors on Medicare spent $7,000 on medical services, compared with $4,900 for people without Medicare. Not included in this figure is the cost of assisted living or long-term stays in nursing homes, which Medicare also doesn\u2019t cover. According to Genworth\u2019s latest survey, the median annual cost of a semiprivate room in a nursing home was $104,000 in 2023, while assisted living came to $64,200, and a week\u2019s worth of services from home-health aides averaged $75,500. Many older adults simply can\u2019t afford to pay for these long-term care options or other major medical expenses out-of-pocket. \u201cSeventeen million older adults have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Program on Medicare Policy for KFF. (That\u2019s $30,120 for a single-person household in 2024; $40,880 for a two-person household.) \u201cFor people living on that income, the risk of a major expense is very scary.\u201d Planning for the future is challenging How to deal with unanticipated expenses in the future is a question that haunts Connie Colyer. Her monthly premiums for Medicare Parts B and D, and a Medigap supplemental policy come to nearly $468, or 42% of her $1,121 monthly income from Social Security. With a home mortgage of $523 a month, and more than $150 in monthly copayments for her inhalers and her husband\u2019s heart medications, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t make it if my husband wasn\u2019t still working,\u201d she told me. (James\u2019 monthly Social Security payment is $1,378. His premiums are similar to Connie\u2019s and his income fluctuates based on the weather. In the first five months of this year, it approached $10,000, Connie told me.) The couple makes too much to qualify for programs that help older adults afford Medicare out-of-pocket costs. As many as 6 million people are eligible but not enrolled in these Medicare Savings Programs. Those with very low incomes may also qualify for dual coverage by Medicaid and Medicare or other types of assistance with household costs, such as food stamps. Older adults can check their eligibility for these and other programs by contacting their local Area Agency on Agency, State Health Insurance Assistance Program or benefits enrollment center. Enter your ZIP code at the Eldercare Locator and these and other organizations helping seniors locally will come up. Persuading older adults to step forward and ask for help often isn\u2019t easy. Angela Zeek, health and government benefits manager at Legal Aid of the Bluegrass in Kentucky, said many seniors in her area don\u2019t want to be considered poor or unable to pay their bills, a blow to their pride. \u201cWhat we try to say is, \u2018You\u2019ve worked hard all your life, you\u2019ve paid your taxes. You\u2019ve given back to this government so there\u2019s nothing wrong with the government helping you out a bit.\u2019\u201d And the unfortunate truth is there\u2019s very little, if any, help available for seniors who aren\u2019t poor but have modest financial resources. While the need for new dental, vision and long-term care benefits for older adults is widely acknowledged, \u201cthe question is always how to pay for it,\u201d said Neuman of KFF. This will become an even bigger issue in the coming years because of the burgeoning aging population. There is some relief on the horizon, however: Assistance with Medicare drug costs is available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, although many older adults don\u2019t realize it yet. The act allows Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs for the first time. This year, out-of-pocket costs for medications will be limited to a maximum $3,800 for most beneficiaries. Next year, a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket drug costs will take effect. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing people who\u2019ve had very high drug costs in the past save thousands of dollars this year,\u201d said Frederic Riccardi, president of the Medicare Rights Center. \u201cAnd next year, it\u2019s going to get even better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/older-americans-healthcare-affordability-kff-partner-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_obesity-genetic-wellness", "text": "Obesity isn\u2019t just a matter of food and exercise \u2014 it may be in your genetic code, according to new research. \u201cObesity\u2019s causes are very complex and in the majority of cases, the combination of many factors. In this study, however, we found a clear genetic trigger for obesity,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Mattia Frontini, British Heart Foundation senior fellow and an associate professor in cellular biology at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, in an email. Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that follows people long term, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Med. They compared data from people with two faulty copies of a particular gene (SMIM1) and those who did not have the two faulty copies. Women with the gene mutation weighed an extra 4.6 kilograms (10.14 pounds), and men with the variant weighed an extra 2.4 kilograms (5.29 pounds), according to the study. The faulty copies of the SMIM1 gene cause decreased function in the thyroid and declining energy expenditure, Frontini said, \u201cwhich means that given the same food intake, less energy is used and this excess is stored as fat.\u201d Not only is the correlation significant, but this study also identifies a specific gene mutation, which isn\u2019t always the case in research, said Dr. Philipp Scherer, director of the Touchstone Diabetes Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. He was not involved in the study. \u201cIt is an exciting study in that it puts a new gene on the map,\u201d Scherer said. \u201cIt\u2019s an actual gene, rather than just a genomic locus with a mutation somewhere where we don\u2019t understand. \u2026 We think we\u2019re looking at a gene here that we can further study.\u201d This genetic finding is \u2018pretty rare\u2019 This particular genetic finding doesn\u2019t apply to a large population of people with obesity \u2014 only about 1 in 5,000 people have this genetic makeup, Frontini said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty rare, but you multiply that to a population of 10 (million), 15 million and there\u2019s quite a few people out there that would walk around with that mutation and maybe weren\u2019t fully aware of the fact that there is a genetic explanation for their struggle with obesity,\u201d Scherer said. Dysfunction in the thyroid is common, affecting almost 2% of the population in the UK, Frontini said. And thyroid dysfunction is treated regularly with a relatively inexpensive medication, Frontini said. The next step in the research is to find out if people with the SMIM1 mutation qualify to treat their thyroid with medication, he added. \u201cIf they do, we plan to run a randomized clinical trial to determine if they would benefit from the treatment,\u201d Frontini said. \u201cThe hope is that they will, and we can improve their quality of life using a cheap, safe treatment.\u201d The best approach in the meantime Weight isn\u2019t just a matter of willpower or laziness. The size and shape of your body is determined by many factors \u2014 some of which you have control over and others you don\u2019t, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Among these factors are lifestyle habits, the amount of sleep you get, medications, health problems, where you live and work, and genetics, according to the institute. Research into genetic factors and potential treatments is still underway, but Scherer said the current best approach to medical treatment of obesity is GLP-1 medications. Severe restrictive dieting is not the answer, Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and author of \u201cThe Diet Detox: Why Your Diet Is Making You Fat and What to Do About It,\u201d said in an earlier CNN article. Demonizing foods too much may make you crave them more, and then the guilt you feel when you give in can lead to a cycle of fluctuating between restricting yourself and bingeing, she added. If you want to make changes to your lifestyle, it\u2019s best to try a gradual, sustainable approach while maintaining a healthy relationship with food, Emily Feig, a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in the same CNN report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/obesity-genetic-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and the (levels of xylitol) went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d as the xylitol levels did, said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products. The February 2023 erythritol in study found the risk of heart attack and stroke nearly doubled within three years when people had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood. For the new study on xylitol, the results were basically the same \u2014 people with the highest levels of xylitol compared to those with the lowest levels had nearly twice the risk of heart attack, stroke and death, Hazen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a receptor on our platelets, which we as yet don\u2019t understand, that is recognizing this molecule and signaling to the platelet to be more prone to clot,\u201d he said. \u201cOur tastebuds can\u2019t tell the difference in the structures between sugar and these other sweeteners, but clearly our platelets can.\u201d The World Health Organization warned consumers in 2023 to avoid artificial sweeteners for weight loss, and has called for additional research on the long-term toxicity of low- and no-calorie sweeteners, the study said. \u201cThrough their work, the investigators have shined a light on the safety of sugar substitutes. There is more to learn,\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s Tomey said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is worth remembering that sugar substitutes are no substitute for a sincere commitment to the several elements of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
