{"id": "2017_09_18_health_opioid-crisis-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at the opioid crisis.  Experts say the United States is in the throes of an opioid epidemic. An estimated 8.9 million Americans aged 12 and older misused opioids in 2022, including 8.5 million prescription pain reliever abusers and 1 million heroin users. Opioids are drugs formulated to replicate the pain-reducing properties of opium. Prescription painkillers like morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone are opioids. Illegal drugs like heroin and illicitly made fentanyl are also opioids. The word \u201copioid\u201d is derived from the word \u201copium.\u201d  Overdose deaths have been on the rise for years in the United States, but surged amid the Covid-19 pandemic: Annual deaths were nearly 50% higher in 2021 than in 2019, CDC data shows. Data on overdose deaths. Prescription opioid volumes peaked in 2011, with the equivalent of 240 billion milligrams of morphine prescribed, according to the market research firm, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee had the highest opioid dispensing rates in 2020. Common Opioids Opioids such as morphine and codeine are naturally derived from opium poppy plants more commonly grown in Asia, Central America and South America. Heroin is an illegal drug synthesized from morphine.  Hydrocodone and oxycodone are semi-synthetic opioids, manufactured in labs with natural and synthetic ingredients.  Fentanyl is a fully synthetic opioid, originally developed as a powerful anesthetic for surgery.  It is also administered to alleviate severe pain associated with terminal illnesses like cancer. The drug is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. Just a small dose can be deadly. Illicitly produced fentanyl has been a driving factor in the number of overdose deaths in recent years.  Methadone is another fully synthetic opioid. It is commonly dispensed to recovering heroin addicts to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.     Opioids bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting pain signals. They also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a \u201chigh.\u201d Addiction Opioid use disorder is the clinical term for opioid addiction or abuse. People who become dependent on opioids may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the medication. Dependence is often coupled with tolerance, meaning that users need to take increasingly larger doses for the same effect.  A drug called naloxone, available as an injection or a nasal spray, is used as a treatment for overdoses. It blocks or reverses the effects of opioids and is often carried by first responders.  Regulation and Funding The 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, allocated $1 billion over two years in opioid crisis grants to states, providing funding for expanded treatment and prevention programs. In April 2017, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price announced the distribution of the first round of $485 million in grants to all 50 states and US territories. In August 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the launch of an Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit within the Department of Justice. The unit\u2019s mission is to prosecute individuals who commit opioid-related health care fraud. The DOJ is also appointing US attorneys who will specialize in opioid health care fraud cases as part of a three-year pilot program in 12 jurisdictions nationwide.  On October 24, 2018, President Donald Trump signed opioid legislation into law. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes provisions aimed at promoting research to find new drugs for pain management that will not be addictive. It also expands access to treatment for substance use disorders for Medicaid patients. State legislatures have also introduced measures to regulate pain clinics and limit the quantity of opioids that doctors can dispense.  Timeline 1861-1865 - During the Civil War, medics use morphine as a battlefield anesthetic. Many soldiers become dependent on the drug.  1898 - Heroin is first produced commercially by the Bayer Company. At the time, heroin is believed to be less habit-forming than morphine, so it is dispensed to individuals who are addicted to morphine. 1914 - Congress passes the Harrison Narcotics Act, which requires that doctors write prescriptions for narcotic drugs like opioids and cocaine. Importers, manufacturers and distributors of narcotics must register with the Treasury Department and pay taxes on products   1924 - The Anti-Heroin Act bans the production and sale of heroin in the United States.  1970 - The Controlled Substances Act becomes law. It creates groupings (or schedules) of drugs based on the potential for abuse. Heroin is a Schedule I drug while morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone (Percocet) and methadone are Schedule II. Hydrocodone (Vicodin) is originally a Schedule III medication. It is later recategorized as a Schedule II drug.  January 10, 1980 - A letter titled \u201cAddiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics\u201d is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It looks at incidences of painkiller addiction in a very specific population of hospitalized patients who were closely monitored. It becomes widely cited as proof that narcotics are a safe treatment for chronic pain.  1995 - OxyContin, a long-acting version of oxycodone that slowly releases the drug over 12 hours, is introduced and aggressively marketed as a safer pain pill by manufacturer, Purdue Pharma.  May 10, 2007 - Purdue Pharma pleads guilty for misleadingly advertising OxyContin as safer and less addictive than other opioids. The company and three executives are charged with \u201cmisleading and defrauding physicians and consumers.\u201d Purdue and the executives agree to pay $634.5 million in criminal and civil fines.  2010 - FDA approves an \u201cabuse-deterrent\u201d formulation of OxyContin, to help curb abuse. However, people still find ways to abuse it.  May 20, 2015 - The DEA announces that it has arrested 280 people, including 22 doctors and pharmacists, after a 15-month sting operation centered on health care providers who dispense large amounts of opioids. The sting, dubbed Operation Pilluted, is the largest prescription drug bust in the history of the DEA.     March 18, 2016 - The CDC publishes guidelines for prescribing opioids for patients with chronic pain. Recommendations include prescribing over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen in lieu of opioids. Doctors are encouraged to promote exercise and behavioral treatments to help patients cope with pain.    March 29, 2017 - Trump signs an executive order calling for the establishment of the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is selected as the chairman of the group, with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an adviser. July 31, 2017 - After a delay, the White House panel examining the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic releases its interim report, asking Trump to declare a national public health emergency to combat the ongoing crisis    September 22, 2017 - The pharmacy chain CVS announces that it will implement new restrictions on filling prescriptions for opioids, dispensing a limited seven-day supply to patients who are new to pain therapy.  November 1, 2017 - The opioid commission releases its final report. Its 56 recommendations include a proposal to establish nationwide drug courts that would place opioid addicts in treatment facilities rather than prison.  February 9, 2018 - A budget agreement signed by Trump authorizes $6 billion for opioid programs, with $3 billion allocated for 2018 and $3 billion allocated for 2019.  February 27, 2018 - Sessions announces a new opioid initiative: The Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force. The mission of the task force is to support local jurisdictions that have filed lawsuits against prescription drugmakers and distributors. March 19, 2018 - The Trump administration outlines an initiative to stop opioid abuse. The three areas of concentration are law enforcement and interdiction; prevention and education via an ad campaign; and job-seeking assistance for individuals fighting addiction. April 9, 2018 - The US surgeon general issues an advisory recommending that Americans carry the opioid overdose-reversing drug, naloxone. A surgeon general advisory is a rarely used tool to convey an urgent message. The last advisory issued by the surgeon general, more than a decade ago, focused on drinking during pregnancy. May 1, 2018 - The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a study that finds synthetic opioids like fentanyl caused about 46% of opioid deaths in 2016. That\u2019s a three-fold increase compared with 2010, when synthetic opioids were involved in about 14% of opioid overdose deaths. It\u2019s the first time that synthetic opioids surpassed prescription opioids and heroin as the primary cause of overdose fatalities.   May 30, 2018 - The journal Medical Care publishes a study that estimates the cost of medical care and substance abuse treatment for opioid addiction was $78.5 billion in 2013.   June 7, 2018 - The White House announces a new multimillion dollar public awareness advertising campaign to combat opioid addiction. The first four ads of the campaign are all based on true stories illustrating the extreme lengths young adults have gone to obtain the powerful drugs. December 12, 2018 - According to the National Center for Health Statistics, fentanyl is now the most commonly used drug involved in drug overdoses. The rate of drug overdoses involving the synthetic opioid skyrocketed by about 113% each year from 2013 through 2016. January 14, 2019 - The National Safety Council finds that, for the first time on record, the odds of dying from an opioid overdose in the United States are now greater than those of dying in a vehicle crash. March 26, 2019 - Purdue Pharma agrees to pay a $270 million settlement to settle a historic lawsuit brought by the Oklahoma attorney general. The settlement will be used to fund addiction research and help cities and counties with the opioid crisis. July 17, 2019 - The CDC releases preliminary data showing a 5.1% decline in drug overdoses during 2018. If the preliminary number is accurate, it would mark the first annual drop in overdose deaths in more than two decades. August 26, 2019 - Oklahoma wins its case against Johnson & Johnson in the first major opioid lawsuit trial to be held in the United States. Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman orders Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million for its role in the state\u2019s opioid crisis. The penalty is later reduced to $465 million, due to a mathematical error made when calculating the judgment. In November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reverses the decision. September 15, 2019 - Purdue files for bankruptcy as part of a $10 billion agreement to settle opioid lawsuits. According to a statement from the chair of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, the money will be allocated to communities nationwide struggling to address the crisis. September 30, 2019 - The FDA and DEA announce that they sent warnings to four online networks, operating a total of 10 websites, which the agencies said are illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded versions of opioid medicines, including tramadol. February 25, 2020 - Mallinckrodt, a large opioid manufacturer, reaches a settlement agreement in principle worth $1.6 billion. Mallinckrodt says the proposed deal will resolve all opioid-related claims against the company and its subsidiaries if it moves forward. Plaintiffs would receive payments over an eight-year period to cover the costs of opioid-addition treatments and other needs. October 21, 2020 - The Justice Department announces that Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has agreed to plead guilty to three federal criminal charges for its role in creating the nation\u2019s opioid crisis. They agree to pay more than $8 billion and close down the company. The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. The Justice Department also reached a separate $225 million civil settlement with the former owners of Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family. In November 2020, Purdue Pharma board chairman Steve Miller formally pleads guilty on behalf of the company. March 15, 2021 - According to court documents, Purdue files a restructuring plan to dissolve itself and establish a new company dedicated to programs designed to combat the opioid crisis. As part of the proposed plan, the Sackler family agrees to pay an additional $4.2 billion over the next nine years to resolve various civil claims. September 1, 2021 - In federal bankruptcy court, Judge Robert Drain rules that Purdue Pharma will be dissolved. The settlement agreement resolves all civil litigation against the Sackler family members, Purdue Pharma and other related parties and entities, and awards them broad legal protection against future civil litigation. The Sacklers will relinquish control of family foundations with over $175 million in assets to the trustees of a National Opioid Abatement Trust. On December 16, 2021, a federal judge overturns the settlement.  February 25, 2022 - Johnson & Johnson and the three largest US drug distributors \u2013 McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and AmerisourceBergen Corp \u2013 finalize a $26 billion nationwide opioid settlement.  March 3, 2022 - The Sackler families reaches a settlement with a group of states the first week of March, according to court filings. The settlement, ordered through court-ordered mediation that began in January, requires the Sacklers to pay out as much as $6 billion to states, individual claimants and opioid crisis abatement, if approved by a federal bankruptcy court judge. November 2, 2022 - CVS and Walgreens agree to pay a combined $10 billion, over 10 and 15 years, to settle lawsuits brought by states and local governments alleging the retailers mishandled prescriptions of opioid painkillers. November 15, 2022 - Walmart agrees to the framework of a $3.1 billion settlement, which resolves allegations from multiple states\u2019 attorneys general that the company failed to regulate opioid prescriptions contributing to the nationwide opioid crisis. August 10, 2023 - The US Supreme Court blocks Purdue Pharma from going forward with bankruptcy proceedings.  February 1, 2024 - New York Attorney General Letitia James announces that for the first time, an advertising company that worked on Purdue Pharma\u2019s OxyContin account has settled a lawsuit accusing it of falsely marketing opioids as safe. Publicis, a French marketing company, has agreed to pay $350 million within the next two months and will not take on any more opioid clients.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2017/09/18/health/opioid-crisis-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness", "text": "Vegetables are great not only\u00a0for their versatility\u00a0\u2014 they can be eaten raw or cooked, whole or chopped \u2014 but also for their health benefits. However, those looking to incorporate more veggies into their diet may be overlooking one in particular. Eating three servings of baby carrots a week can give a significant boost of important nutrients found in the\u00a0orange root vegetables, according to a new unpublished study presented June 30 in Chicago at\u00a0Nutrition 2024,\u00a0the annual meeting of the\u00a0American Society for Nutrition. Surveys found separately in 2015 and 2019 that only\u00a0about 1 in 10 American adults ate the recommended 2 to 3 cups of vegetables daily, according to a 2022 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0report\u00a0on fruit and vegetable intake. That statistic inspired lead study author Mary Harper Simmons and her colleagues to investigate a simple solution that could increase a person\u2019s weekly vegetable intake. \u201c(Baby carrots) are grab and go, great with things like ranch, hummus \u2014 I\u2019ve even seen people dip them in peanut butter \u2014 some people like them plain,\u201d said Simmons, a graduate student in nutrition at Samford University in Alabama. \u201cI would really like to show people that improving your health can be (done) with small simple changes. \u2026 It does not have to be one drastic change overnight.\u201d For the study, one serving of baby carrots \u2014 chopped into smaller pieces and commonly sold at grocery stores \u2014 was around eight to 12 carrots, the equivalent of 100 grams or half a cup, Simmons added. The unpublished study looked at 60 young adults who were either assigned to eat the servings of carrots three times a week, eat no carrots and instead take a multivitamin supplement, consume a combination of the carrots and the multivitamin, or consume neither the carrots or supplement as a control group. After four weeks, the researchers found those who ate the carrots had a 10.8% increase in carotenoids in their skin, natural antioxidants found to have\u00a0health benefits, such as preventing inflammation and promoting heart health, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Additionally, the researchers found those who only took the multivitamin (containing the same carotenoid found in carrots) did not see any changes in carotenoid levels. But those who consumed the carrots and the supplement saw the most benefits and increased their skin carotenoids by 21.6%. \u201cPeople might think, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m getting a multivitamin supplement, (that should be enough),\u2019 but that alone did not increase the carotenoid accumulation. It was a combination that seemed to increase it,\u201d said Dr. Suresh Mathews, the principal investigator for the new study and a professor and chair of Samford\u2019s department of nutrition and dietetics. \u201cThe \u2018food first\u2019\u00a0philosophy always works. But for populations that may be unable to just do only foods or are limited, the combination of the food and the supplements seems to have an even bigger effect in this case,\u201d he added. The benefits of eating carrots and other vegetables \u201cHigh vegetable intake is associated with all kinds of positive health effects \u2014 the risk of all kinds of chronic diseases are lowered with increased fruit and vegetable consumption,\u201d said Dr. Sander Kersten, the director of the division of nutritional sciences and Schleifer Family Professor\u00a0at Cornell University, who was not involved in the new study. Eating vegetables can protect against heart disease, some cancers, diabetes and obesity,\u00a0according to the CDC. But carrots and other orange and red-toned vegetables such as squash and sweet potatoes are unique in that they\u2019re high in beta-carotene, the carotenoid that the body converts into vitamin A, Kersten said. Dark leafy greens, such as spinach and kale, are also high in beta-carotene, he added. Vitamin A is important for keeping your heart, lungs and other organs healthy and also for supporting various bodily functions, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health. Vitamin A deficiency is not common in the United States,\u00a0but people should still look to eat fruits and vegetables to reap the benefits of the natural low-calorie, high-in-fiber foods, Kersten said. Young adults eating vegetables While a reminder to include vegetables in a healthy diet is good for everyone, Simmons said the message is particularly important when it comes to young adults. According to the\u00a02022 CDC report, around 7% of adults\u00a0ages 18 to 30 eat the recommended amount of vegetables, while a 2023\u00a0National College Health Assessment\u00a0from the American College Health Association found that about 1 in 4 college students surveyed said they ate three or more servings of vegetables per day. \u201cYou hear the thing we tell kids, \u2018Eat the rainbow,\u2019 and I feel like for any age that really does stand,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt is good to have a variety of colors on your plate, and if not every single time you eat, just having a variety throughout your day and throughout your week is definitely very beneficial to getting all those key nutrients that our body needs to function.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_07_01_health_bionic-leg-ami-neuroprosthesis", "text": "Amy Pietrafitta has learned to walk seven times. First was as a child and then after an industrial burn led to the amputation of her left leg in 2018. Since then, she\u2019s had \u201cfirst steps\u201d in prosthetic legs for running, water, high heels, rowing and everyday walking. Her latest \u201cfirst steps\u201d were different. This time, she was fitted with a bionic leg that was fully connected to her brain, allowing her to walk and move like anyone else. With this new leg, she said, she couldn\u2019t even tell there was a difference. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like my leg had been amputated,\u201d the 47-year-old from Massachusetts said. \u201cIt was the happiest moment in my life.\u201d Pietrafitta was part of a study of a new neuroprosthesis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that\u2019s fully controlled by the nervous system. Her leg had been amputated using a novel muscle-pairing technique called agonist-antagonist myoneural interface, or AMI, which preserves signaling between the muscles and the brain. The neuroprosthesis uses sensors placed between the reconstructed amputation site and the bionic leg to transmit electrical signals from the brain. This allows the prosthetic to sense its position and movement and to send this information back to the patient, enabling a sense of proprioception: the brain\u2019s ability to sense self-movement and location in space. The study,\u00a0published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, indicated that participants who\u2019d had the specialized amputation and neuroprosthesis increased their walking speed 41%, matching the ranges and abilities of people without leg amputations. The results also suggested that the bionic limb could be controlled using just 18% of natural proprioception.  This is the first bionic leg fully controlled by the human nervous system to demonstrate natural walking speeds and gait patterns, according to Dr. Hugh Herr, principal investigator and senior author of the study and co-lead of the\u00a0Yang Center for Bionics\u00a0at MIT, where the research took place. \u201cIt feels natural, as if the limb were made of flesh and bone. It\u2019s as if the central brain isn\u2019t aware the limb is amputated because the brain is getting normal sensations,\u201d said Herr, who had both legs amputated below the knee after a climbing accident in 1982. Herr embarked on the project after observing a trend of prosthetics being increasingly controlled by robotic algorithms rather than the human nervous system. \u201cWe want to rebuild human bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reconstruct and give people back what they so seek. We don\u2019t just want to build fancier and fancier robotic tools or devices.\u201d To test the interface, 14 participants were split into two groups and fitted with bionic prosthetic legs. Seven had undergone AMI surgery, and seven had not. The results suggested that those with AMI amputations navigated real-world environments better, including slopes, stairs, obstructed pathways and even an \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d-style course, according to Pietrafitta and Dr. Matthew J. Carty, the lead surgeon in the first AMI procedure and a co-author of the new study. \u201cThis is a fundamental paradigm shift in the way we think about amputation in conjunction with technology: treating it as a restorative procedure as opposed to a failure,\u201d Carty said. Beyond first steps The technology also allows users to switch between speeds without changing prosthetics. This reduces the hassle of swapping legs, avoids unwanted attention and restores a sense of normalcy, according to Pietrafitta. \u201cIt felt normal. \u2026 I was ready to run. I kept wanting to take my hands off [the supports], to get out and start moving,\u201d she said. Restoring a normal gait is about more than getting from point A to point B. According to Pietrafitta, it\u2019s about re-entering society. \u201cIt meant my life could begin again. \u2026 I could go out there and live the way I wanted to,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in your home and you\u2019re bedridden, family and friends start to dwindle away. It\u2019s too hard for people to come in and see you in pain.\u201d For John Rheinstein, a lower and upper limb prosthetic specialist and clinic manager at the Hanger Clinic in New York, the physical prosthesis is only part of a successful amputation outcome. \u201cCare has improved over the years (in part) as a result of advances in understanding and treating the emotional impacts of losing a limb,\u201d he wrote in an email. Is innovation accessible? An estimated 1.9 million Americans live with limb loss, a figure expected to double by 2050, largely due to increasing rates of diabetes, a known risk factor, according to a 2018 report published by the federal\u00a0Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Herr said his team aims to make fully neuro-controlled prosthetics commercially available within five years. However, the 2018 report estimates that fewer than half of people with amputations receive prosthetic prescriptions. People with amputations may struggle to get prescriptions and insurance coverage for prosthetic devices, especially for options with more advanced technology. Rheinstein cites insurance coverage for prosthetic limbs \u2014 specifically the lack of coverage for activity-specific prosthetics \u2014 as one of the most difficult parts of his patients\u2019 rehabilitation journeys. \u201cDemonstrating to payers the value of the outcomes we provide and how outcomes-based prosthetic care reduces overall healthcare costs\u201d is one of the biggest challenges the industry faces today, he said. For example, the\u00a0BionX emPOWER prosthetic is the only motor-driven prosthetic on the market, according to Herr, and many people with limb loss aren\u2019t able to access it. Although AMI neuroprostheses aren\u2019t available to the public, the AMI surgery has been performed on about 60 people around the world, according to Herr. At the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, where Carty is a staff surgeon in the Division of Plastic Surgery, AMI is now the standard of care for amputations, Carty said. \u201cThe [hospital\u2019s] ethical board determined it\u2019s unethical to offer the standard amputation, because we now know the AMI amputation is so beneficial,\u201d Herr said. \u201cWe hope it\u2019ll be standard not only in Boston, but in clinical sites all over the world.\u201d The more surgeons, prosthetists, researchers and patients work together on new developments, the better, according to Rheinstein, who hopes the AMI technique will \u201cbring attention to the importance of thoughtfully planned amputation surgery to a patient\u2019s successful rehabilitation.\u201d \u201cHollywood for decades has given us visions of these remarkable bionic humans \u2026 but science reality has been slower than science fiction,\u201d Herr added. \u201cWe\u2019re finally producing systems that we\u2019ve seen in the movies.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/bionic-leg-ami-neuroprosthesis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_health_worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness", "text": "Eating higher levels of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespans by more than 10%, according to a new, unpublished study of over 500,000 people whom researchers followed for nearly three decades. The risk went up to 15% for men and 14% for women once the data was adjusted, said study lead author Erikka Loftfield, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Asked about their consumption of 124 foods, people in the top 90th percentile of ultraprocessed food consumption said overly processed drinks topped their list. \u201cDiet soft drinks were the key contributor to ultraprocessed food consumption. The second one was sugary soft drinks,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cBeverages are a very important component of the diet and the contribution to ultraprocessed food.\u201d Refined grains such as ultraprocessed breads and baked goods ranked next in popularity, the study found. \u201cThis is one more large, long-duration cohort study confirming the association between UPF (ultraprocessed food) intake and all-cause mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Carlos Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health at Brazil\u2019s University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in an email. Monteiro coined the term ultraprocessed food and created the NOVA food classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made. Monteiro was not involved in the study, but several members of the NOVA classification system were coauthors. The NOVA classification system sorts foods from unprocessed or minimally processed \u2014 whole foods such as fruits and vegetables \u2014 to ultraprocessed foods such as deli meat and sausage. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food appetizing. Health risks linked to processed meats and soft drinks The preliminary study, presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago, analyzed dietary data gathered in 1995 from nearly 541,000 Americans ages 50 to 71 who were participating in the US National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. Researchers linked the dietary data to death rates over the next 20 to 30 years. Compared with those in the bottom 10% of ultraprocessed food consumption, people who ate the most overly processed food were more likely to die from heart disease or diabetes, according to the study. Unlike other studies, however, researchers found no rise in cancer-related death. Some ultraprocessed foods carried more of a risk than others, Loftfield said: \u201cHighly processed meat and soft drinks were a couple of the subgroups of ultraprocessed food most strongly associated with mortality risk.\u201d Diet drinks are considered ultraprocessed food because they contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium and stevia, and additional additives not found in whole foods. Diet beverages have been linked to a higher risk of dying early from cardiovascular disease as well as the onset of dementia,\u00a0type 2 diabetes,\u00a0obesity, stroke and\u00a0metabolic syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes. The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans already recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to premature death and the development of chronic disease. A March 2019 study found women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages\u00a0\u2014 defined as a standard glass, bottle or can \u2014 had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared with women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk. Processed meats such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, ham, corned beef, jerky and deli meats are also not recommended; studies have linked red and processed meats to bowel and stomach cancers, heart disease, diabetes and early death from any cause. \u201cThe evidence from this new study indicates that processed meat may be one of the most unhealthy foods, but people do not tend to view ham or chicken nuggets as UPF (ultraprocessed food),\u201d said Rosie Green,\u00a0a professor of environment, food and health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in a statement. She was not involved in the study. The study found that people who consumed the most ultraprocessed food were younger and heavier, and had an overall poorer quality of diet than those who ate fewer ultraprocessed foods. However, the increased health risk could not be explained by these differences, because even people with normal weight and better diets were also at some risk for early death from ultraprocessed foods, the study found. \u201cStudies which utilize food classification systems such as NOVA, which focus on the degree of processing, as opposed to the nutritional composition should be considered with caution,\u201d said Carla Saunders, president of the \u200eCalorie Control Council, an industry association, in an email. \u201cSuggesting the elimination of dietary tools like no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages, with proven benefits in the management of comorbidities like obesity and diabetes, is harmful and irresponsible,\u201d Saunders said. Results may underestimate risk One key limitation of the study was that the dietary data was gathered only once some 30 years ago, Green said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how dietary habits might have changed between then and now.\u201d Ultraprocessed food manufacturing has exploded since the mid-1990s, however, with estimates that as nearly 60% of the average American\u2019s daily calories come from ultraprocessed foods. That\u2019s not surprising, considering as much as 70% of the food in any grocery store may be ultraprocessed. \u201cIf anything, we are probably underestimating ultraprocessed food consumption in our study because we\u2019re being very conservative,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cThe intake is likely to have only grown over the years.\u201d In fact, a study published in May that found similar results \u2014 a higher risk of premature death and death from cardiovascular disease in over 100,000 health professionals who ate ultraprocessed foods \u2014 accessed ultraprocessed food intake every four years and found consumption doubled between the mid-1980s and 2018. \u201cFor example, the daily intake of packaged savory snacks and dairy-based desserts, such as ice cream, has essentially doubled since the \u201890s,\u201d said the lead author of the May study, Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIn our study, just as in this new one, the positive association was mainly driven by a few subgroups, including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d Song said. \u201cHowever, all categories of ultraprocessed food were associated with increased risk.\u201d Choosing more minimally processed foods is a one way to limit ultraprocessed foods in one\u2019s diet, Loftfield said. \u201cWe should really be focusing on eating diets that are rich in whole foods,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if the food is ultraprocessed, then look to see the levels of sodium and added sugars and try to make the best decision possible using the nutrition facts label.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_ftc-report-pbm-pharmacy-healthcare", "text": "Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate the terms for prescription drug access for hundreds of millions of Americans, are racking up profits while squeezing patients and independent pharmacies, according to an interim staff report released Tuesday by the Federal Trade Commission. The commission, which launched an inquiry into the opaque pharmacy benefit manager or PBM industry in 2022, found that a handful of dominant players \u201cwield enormous power over patients\u2019 ability to access and afford their prescription drugs, allowing PBMs to significantly influence what drugs are available and at what price.\u201d Also, \u201cPBMs hold substantial influence over independent pharmacies by imposing unfair, arbitrary, and harmful contractual terms that can impact independent pharmacies\u2019 ability to stay in business and serve their communities,\u201d according to the agency. The six largest managers handle nearly 95% of the prescriptions filled in the US. Most of them, including the three largest \u2013 CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx \u2013 are owned by or connected to health insurers, as well as affiliated with pharmacies. PBMs, which serve as middlemen in the drug supply chain by negotiating rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and others, could be steering patients to their own pharmacies and away from independent pharmacies, the report found. Pharmacy benefit managers have been in the spotlight in recent years, with the Biden administration and Congress seeking to increase transparency into the industry\u2019s operations. PBMs, which keep an undisclosed amount of the rebates they negotiate, are among the players in the drug industry blamed for the rising cost of medications, which plagues many Americans. The PBM industry\u2019s trade group blasted the commission\u2019s report, saying that it \u201cfalls far short of being a definitive, fact-based assessment of PBMs or the prescription drug market\u201d and that it \u201cis based on anecdotes and comments from anonymous sources and self-interested parties, and supported only by two cherry-picked case studies that are implied to be representative of the entire market.\u201d \u201cThe report completely overlooks the volumes of data that demonstrate the value that PBMs provide to America\u2019s health care system by reducing prescription drug costs and increasing access to medications,\u201d Pharmaceutical Care Management Association CEO JC Scott said in a statement. One of the agency\u2019s own commissioners also took issue with the report, saying it failed to live up to the FTC\u2019s rigorous standard. The report was plagued by process irregularities and concerns over the substance, Commissioner Melissa Holyoak wrote in her dissent. CVS Caremark, which handles about one-third of the market, said it stands by \u201cour record of protecting American businesses, unions, and patients from rising prescription drug prices.\u201d \u201cOur efforts have resulted in members on average paying less than $8 per 30-day supply of medication,\u201d CVS Caremark said in a statement. \u201cIndependent analyses show net brand drug prices have declined six years in a row despite significant inflation across the U.S. economy and egregious list price increases from drug makers.\u201d The pharmaceutical industry\u2019s main trade group, on the other hand, said the commission\u2019s report shows how PBMs are driving up costs. \u201cThe veil continues to lift exposing the ugly truth that PBMs put profits before patients at every turn,\u201d PhRMA spokesperson Alex Schriver said in a statement. \u201cThe FTC report makes it clear: PBMs have outsized control over what medicines people can get and the price they pay\u202fat the pharmacy counter.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/ftc-report-pbm-pharmacy-healthcare/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_election-stress-effects-sexual-health-wellness", "text": "Election season \u2014 with all its arguments about debates, political ads and fundraising text messages \u2014 brings a roller coaster of emotions. Whether you\u2019re glued to the news, debating with friends or scrolling through social media, stress and anxiety at this time can be overwhelming. If you feel that stress, you\u2019re in good company: Some 62% of Americans feel worn out by election coverage, according to a Pew Research Center survey in May. While you might know that stress from the presidential campaigns can affect your mood, energy and temper, it may surprise you to know it can also affect you below the belt. Here is what you can do about it. The connection between stress and sexual health Stress is a well-known libido killer because it triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with both sexual desire and performance. Elevated cortisol levels can lead to a decrease in testosterone, further affecting libido. The emotional fatigue and heightened stress from the current presidential campaigns can lead to an increase in cortisol and a decrease in testosterone levels, making it more challenging for people to feel in the mood. Chronic stress can also lead to other health issues that indirectly affect sexual health, such as cardiovascular problems, sleep disorders and mental health issues. All these factors combined can create a cycle in which stress has a negative impact on sexual health, leading to further stress and health complications. Erectile dysfunction and anxiety Anxiety is another common byproduct of election stress. Constant worrying about the future can trigger performance anxiety, leading to erectile dysfunction, or ED. Men with high levels of anxiety are more likely to experience ED, according to a 2021 study in the International Journal of Impotence Research. So if you\u2019re finding it difficult to perform in the bedroom, the anxiety induced by the campaign might be to blame. Election scrolling can disrupt sleep patterns Poor sleep quality is directly linked to sexual dysfunction, as it can lower testosterone levels and increase stress hormones such as cortisol. So try not to stay up late to catch every news update on the campaigns. And this recommendation isn\u2019t limited to election coverage; any form of prolonged screen time and stress-inducing content can similarly affect sleep and, consequently, sexual health. Prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule and reducing nighttime screen exposure can help maintain your overall well-being and sexual health. The humor in political stress Picture this: You\u2019re in bed, trying to get intimate, but all you can think about is the latest polling data or what one of the candidates said at a rally. It sounds ridiculous, but it\u2019s a reality for many of my patients. Humor can be a great stress reliever, so don\u2019t be afraid to laugh at the situation. Cracking up with your partner about the craziness of the election season can help break the tension and bring you closer together. Embracing humor in stressful times can not only ease anxiety but also strengthen your bond. READ MORE: Sex \u2014 does it actually improve your life? How to get election stress out of your sex life To manage election stress and maintain sexual health, it\u2019s essential to engage in relaxing activities. Take breaks from politics to read a book, take a walk, practice yoga or do whatever you enjoy to help you calm down. Practicing mindfulness through techniques such as meditation and deep breathing can also help you stay grounded. Staying active is another natural stress reliever. Regular physical activity can boost your mood, improve sleep and enhance your sexual health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Open communication with your partner about how you are feeling can help reduce stress and anxiety. Walk together, discuss your worries and find ways to support each other during these tense times. The importance of voting Even with all this stress, it\u2019s important to remember the power and privilege of voting. Not everyone around the world gets to vote. Your voice matters, and participating in the democratic process is an essential way to contribute to the future you want to see. If you haven\u2019t registered to vote, you can do so at vote.gov. Even when you\u2019ve done all you can do, know that election stress is real and can have surprising effects on your sexual health. By acknowledging the problem and taking proactive steps to manage your stress, you can maintain a healthy and satisfying sex life, even during the most turbulent political times. So, take a deep breath, focus on what really matters \u2014 your health and well-being \u2014 and remember to cast your vote. And then have some fun with your partner.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/election-stress-effects-sexual-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness", "text": "More water, please. Millions of Americans are experiencing a record-breaking heat wave that has continued for days on end. We know that keeping hydrated is important to staying healthy in the summer heat, but is water still the best drink during a heat wave? Or should people turn to sports drinks instead? What about soda, coffee and beer \u2014 is it advisable to keep drinking these beverages during extremely hot weather? To help guide us through drinks we should choose \u2014 and avoid \u2014 during hot weather events, I spoke with CNN wellness health expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: How much water should people normally drink, and does that change during extreme hot weather? Dr. Leana Wen: A quick rule of thumb that\u2019s often cited is the \u201c8 x 8 rule,\u201d which is eight 8-ounce glasses of water, or 64 ounces, of water per day for adults. That\u2019s half a gallon. This rule is not set in stone. There are many factors that influence how much water people need, including the type of food they eat, their body size and their physical activity. Other factors include air temperature and humidity, and, specifically, how much time you spend outdoors during hot weather. People working in the heat or otherwise engaging in physical activity should drink an 8-ounce cup of water every 15 to 20 minutes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This would total about 24 to 32 ounces per hour. People should also keep well hydrated before and after their outdoor time in the heat. CNN: Is it possible to drink too much water? Wen: Yes. The CDC guidance is that people should not drink more than 48 ounces (about 1.5 quarts) of water or other fluids in an hour. A large amount of fluid all at once can dilute the concentration of salts in our blood and be unsafe. CNN: When it\u2019s really hot outside, is water still the best fluid, or should people turn to sports drinks?  Wen: Sports drinks are beverages with added electrolytes. Their main purpose is to replenish water and electrolytes that are lost with sweating. These drinks contain electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Some have added sugars like fructose, glucose and sucrose.  Most people do not need drinks other than water. In general, adults engaging in mild to moderate physical activity and kids playing on the playground or doing recreational after-school sports do not need electrolyte replacement. The foods that we eat contain the electrolytes we need. People who could consider sports drinks are athletes who are engaging in vigorous exercise for at least an hour outdoors in hot weather. Again, though, not all these individuals will need electrolyte replacement beyond what they get from eating normally. Whether they do depends on factors such as how much they sweat, how hot and humid the environment is and how intensely they exercise. CNN: What\u2019s better, a sports drink that comes ready-made in a bottle or an electrolyte powder that you can add to make your own drink? Wen: Personally, I prefer the powder. There are also tablets that dissolve in water. These do-it-yourself options are cheaper, and I like to choose the brands that don\u2019t have much added sugar or chemicals. But this is a question of personal preference. Whatever you buy, make sure to look carefully at the ingredients. For instance, if you don\u2019t want added sugar or caffeine, make sure what you\u2019re drinking doesn\u2019t have these ingredients. CNN: What about energy drinks? Are these a good replacement for water? Wen: This is an important question. The short answer is no, energy drinks are not a replacement for water. They should be used with caution in adults, and children should not drink them. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which are meant to help you restore water and electrolytes. Energy drinks are not meant mainly to hydrate you. They often contain large amounts of caffeine and other legal stimulants such as L-carnitine and guarana. While caffeine can boost energy in the short term, it is also a diuretic, meaning that it causes someone to lose water. Too much caffeine also can cause jitteriness, anxiety and irregular heartbeats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against energy drinks for children and adolescents. In some studies, though, as many as 30% to 50% of adolescents report using energy drinks. I urge parents to be careful to distinguish between sports drinks and energy drinks. Neither are needed, but energy drinks, in particular, should be used with caution. CNN: What about other drinks with caffeine, like coffee? Is a cold brew or iced mocha a bad idea in hot weather? Wen: Not necessarily, though people should be aware that these caffeinated drinks may not hydrate you and may even dehydrate you further. This doesn\u2019t mean you should stop all coffee when it\u2019s hot outside. Just be aware of the effect of caffeine and consider drinking extra water while you are enjoying caffeinated beverages. CNN: What about sodas, punches and alcoholic beverages? Wen: Sodas and punches are considered ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to many adverse long-term health consequences, such as increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. Consumption should generally be kept at a minimum, and hot weather is no exception. Again, water is the preferred substance for hydration. Alcohol is best avoided when it\u2019s very hot outside. Be especially careful not to drink large amounts and become inebriated, as this could blunt your body\u2019s response to temperature regulation. You also may miss early signs of heat-related illnesses. Alcohol can be dehydrating as well. If you do choose to drink alcohol, limit your drinks, make sure there are people around you in case you get into trouble medically and be sure to drink plenty of additional nonalcoholic fluids. CNN: What about kids who are in all-day sports camps? Wen: It\u2019s hard to answer this without knowing exactly how the camp is structured. Many sports camps have indoor activities for at least a portion of the day, and even those that are predominantly outdoors should move their activities indoors during extreme heat warnings. When in doubt, it\u2019s advisable to speak with the camp director and ask about how much time will be spent outdoors. If the time is limited, there are regular breaks and much of the activity is low to moderate intensity, it\u2019s probably sufficient to hydrate with water and supplement with nutrient-dense snacks such as watermelon, coconut and avocado. Also focus on hydrating before and after camp. Sports drinks probably aren\u2019t needed, and, again, it\u2019s advisable for children to avoid energy drinks. CNN: What other precautions would you follow during extreme heat? Wen: Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Take extra care of children and the elderly, as well as people with chronic medical conditions that could be exacerbated by the heat. Be careful while exercising and try to move activities indoors or go in the early morning or late evening. And make sure to keep well-hydrated with the best substance for hydration \u2014 water!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_health_gay-coming-out-parent-response-wellness", "text": "My 18-year-old daughter\u2019s coming out story does not belong to me. Even though I was there three years ago, and it is a core memory for me, it\u2019s not mine to tell. It\u2019s hers, and she wants to tell it. So, I\u2019m going to sit back and let her do just that with my heart in my throat as I worry about what will happen later. Here are Vivi\u2019s words: I sat in the car with my dad and spit it out. \u201cDad, I\u2019m gay,\u201d I said. In the two seconds of silence that followed, I wasn\u2019t scared of how he would respond. I simply wondered how he would handle it. His oldest child and his only daughter just announced to him that she is something different than what\u2019s considered traditional. Another part of me considered his background. How would his Southern roots react to the unusual? His response: \u201cYou still have to mow the lawn. And we are going to have pizza for dinner.\u201d Back to me, Vivi\u2019s dad. I will never forgive myself for my boring response. I did not say, \u201cHi Gay, I\u2019m Dad.\u201d She set me up with the perfect dad joke opportunity, and I missed it. This has haunted me for the last three years. But seriously. I am honored that my daughter trusted me enough to know I would be there for her, even if she had her doubts. I worry more about what other parents might say to their children because I know there is a lot that parents get right and wrong when our children are brave enough to talk to us about their sexuality. Let\u2019s be clear here \u2014 the stakes are high. The Trevor Project reports that 41% of LGBTQ+ young people have considered suicide, while 28% have reported\u00a0being homeless because of their orientation. All this comes with depression, anxiety and even self-harming behaviors. This was on my mind when my daughter decided to tell her story. What do parents get right and wrong when our kids come out I know that how men respond as fathers to this most vulnerable moment has plenty of far-reaching consequences. So, what do we do? \u201cThe biggest risk is this irreversible fractioning of the relationship between the teen and the dad,\u201d said James Moran, director of education and public relations at Our Spot KC in Kansas City, Missouri, which provides housing, technical assistance and other support for the local LGBTQ+ community. \u201cThis can translate into difficulty forming relationships, housing, low self-esteem, and not having basic adult skills as a result of this conflict and lack of support.\u201d How should a father react when our teens come out to us? Moran has advice. \u201cThank you for trusting me with that,\u201d Moran suggested. Or \u201cHow can I support you? I don\u2019t think young folks are looking for you to be an expert but need you to show your support and heart even if the words come out wrong.\u201d That was what I tried to communicate in my response to my daughter. I wanted her to know that this was normal and no big deal. And since it wasn\u2019t a big deal, life needed to continue, and the grass was getting long. Plus, who doesn\u2019t love pizza for dinner? As she said recently, \u201cI understand my privilege to say that I was not scared to come out to my father. I recognize that I have a family that loves me, supports me, and will always have my back. My father has never been one to follow the tradition, so why should I?\u201d Knowing we are a family of gender-norm breakers, my daughter was referring to my role as an at-home dad for the last 16 years. And although I am proud that she had the confidence to be herself with me, my response wasn\u2019t perfect. I became concerned about how the world would treat her. Are we overprotective of our LGBTQ+ teens? No doubt parents are scared for their children to be \u201cout\u201d in the world, but at what cost? One mistake parents often make \u201cis prioritizing the protection of our kids over their identity,\u201d Moran said. Some parents ask their kids to \u201cnot be gay in public\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t show it anywhere.\u201d On the surface, that seems offensive. But it did cross my mind when I asked my daughter if she wanted to tell her story to help dads and their daughters. Her immediate response was yes, and then I was worried, even though it was my idea. It is not uncommon to get hateful comments on the articles that I write. My favorite is being accused of being \u201cless of a man\u201d because I\u2019m an at-home dad. Am I bringing that to my daughter? Fear and hate drive some people to acts of violence. CNN\u2019s article about LGBTQ rights and milestones details the struggles and discrimination that many in the community have faced. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier if she didn\u2019t tell her story and not come out to the entire world? No, it wouldn\u2019t be easier for her. It would mean she couldn\u2019t be herself, and I\u2019ve failed as a father if I would ever let that happen. It is important to me that she has agency in her life, and that begins by embracing who she is at her core, without apology. As I wrote this article, my daughter, her girlfriend and I talked about the advice they could give others who were going through the same coming out process. They told me to \u201cjust, as a dad, normalize it, and don\u2019t treat us differently than others. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Their statement makes me smile because it was said with the nonchalance of youth. Yes, to them it is not a big deal. But my daughter and her girlfriend having the confidence and support to come out and be who they truly are is a very big deal. They still have to mow the yard though. (But I\u2019ll buy the pizza.)

{"id": "2024_07_02_health_weight-gain-antidepressants-wellness", "text": "Antidepressants can be lifesavers for many struggling with so many mental health diagnoses \u2014 anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet taking these mood-altering substances can lead to an unpleasant side effect for some \u2014 weight gain. While many people never add extra weight, doctors say concerns over additional pounds are a key reason people may be hesitant to start taking an antidepressant for their mental health. Weight gain is also a reason why some stop their medications despite feeling less depressed or anxious while using them. Now, a new study sheds light on just how much weight gain might occur \u2014 on average \u2014 while taking eight of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. One of the most widely prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, also known by brand names Zoloft and Lustral, was associated with an average gain of nearly 0.5 pounds (0.2 kilograms) at six months. That rose to 3.2 pounds (1.46 kilograms) at 24 months, according to the study. Using that as a comparison, researchers found people taking escitalopram, known by the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex, had an average 15% increased risk over sertraline of gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight at six months. The risk was 14% for paroxetine, sold under the names Paxil, Aropax, Pexeva, Seroxat, Sereupin and Brisdelle, the study found. Duloxetine, sold by the brand names Cymbalta, Loxentia and Yentreve, was associated with a 10% increased risk of a patient gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight compared to sertraline, the study said. A weight gain of 5% or more over baseline is considered clinically significant for health, said lead study author Joshua Petimar, an assistant professor of population medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The typical adult gains an average of 1 to 2 pounds per year, which over time, can contribute to obesity. This weight gain can be driven by physical inactivity, stress, poor sleep and poor food choices, such as eating too many ultraprocessed foods, as well as medications, experts say. Weight gain by pounds The study, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, used electronic health record prescription and body mass to compare weight gain among more than 183,000 people. Researchers looked at weight at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months for individuals between the ages of 18 and 80 who were starting an antidepressant for the first time. When analyzing the data by pounds and kilograms of weight gained, people on escitalopram and paroxetine added an average of 1.4 pounds (0.63 kilograms) by six months. By 24 months, weight had risen by 3.6 pounds (1.63 kilograms) for escitalopram and nearly 3 pounds (1.33 kilograms) for paroxetine. Duloxetine was associated with an average gain of 1.2 pounds (0.55 kilograms) at six months and 1.7 pounds (0.78 kilograms) at 24 months. \u201cIn our study, the average weight at baseline was 84 kg, or about 185 lb,\u201d Petimar said in an email. \u201cThis means that in our study, a 5% increase in weight translated on average to a weight gain of 4.2 kg, or about 9 lb.\u201d However, the study found no significantly higher or lower risk for citalopram, sold as Celexa; fluoxetine, sold as Prozac; or venlafaxine, sold as Effexor, Effexor XR, Vensir, Vencarm, Venlalix and Venlablue, when compared to sertraline. \u201cWe need to remember these are average values; many people won\u2019t gain any weight, while others could gain considerably more,\u201d said Dr. Roy Perlis, associate chief of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who conducted a similar study in 2014. He was not involved with the new research. \u201cStill, having average values to work with \u2014 and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies \u2014 at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,\u201d Perlis said in an email. Not all patients perceive weight gain negatively, although it is more common for patients to want to avoid weight gain than to seek it when taking an antidepressant, Petimar said. For example, mirtazapine is an antidepressant that is sometimes used in the treatment of eating disorders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t examine mirtazapine in our study because it\u2019s not considered a common front-line medication for new users of antidepressants,\u201d he said. Weight loss occurred with one drug One antidepressant contributed to a small amount of weight loss at six months, the study found. \u201cBupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) on average had a 15% lower risk of gaining a clinically meaningful amount of weight compared to sertraline,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cOur study didn\u2019t explore reasons why bupropion was associated with less weight gain than other antidepressants, but other studies have similarly concluded that it is associated with less weight gain than other common antidepressants,\u201d he added. When analyzed by pounds or kilograms lost, people who took bupropion dropped almost one quarter of a pound (0.01 kilograms) at six months, before gaining 1.2 pounds (0.56\u00a0kilograms) at 24 months, according to the research. Why do antidepressants contribute to weight gain? Science doesn\u2019t yet know, Perlis said. \u201cRemarkably, we don\u2019t know the precise mechanism by which antidepressants contribute to weight changes. Worse, we really don\u2019t know much about who is most\u00a0likely to gain or lose weight, so we can\u2019t make good predictions in advance,\u201d he said. One caution, Perlis said, is that some people lose weight when depressed and lose their appetite. \u201cSome of what we\u2019re seeing may be people regaining weight they\u2019d lost as their depression or anxiety improves.\u201d The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them, experts say. \u201cPatients who are concerned about weight gain should have an open and honest conversation with their clinician about their concerns,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cThere are many clinical factors that determine which medication is right for a given patient,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cThese include the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, their medical history, any other drugs that they are already taking, and possible side effects that the patient is concerned about.\u201d Clinicians have to weigh all of these factors when they decide which is the best course of treatment, he added, while patients can strive to avoid weight gain by following healthy eating habits and exercising regularly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/weight-gain-antidepressants-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death", "text": "Lisa Pisano, the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney, died Sunday,\u00a0according to\u00a0NYU Langone Health, where she had the surgery. Pisano\u00a0received the transplant on April 12, but the organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed May 29. Her case was the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the animal\u2019s thymus gland. Pisano\u00a0was brave and altruistic, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute,\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday. She had said\u00a0during a news conference after the procedure that even if the organ transplant didn\u2019t work for her, it might for the next person. \u201cAt least somebody is going to benefit from it,\u201d she said. Montgomery said Tuesday that \u201cLisa\u2019s contributions to medicine, surgery, and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. \u2026 Lisa helped bring us closer to realizing a future where someone does not have to die for another person to live.\u201d Every eight minutes, another person is added to the transplant waiting list, and 17 people from this list die each day waiting for an organ, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Xenotransplantation, which involves using organs from other species, is a potential solution to the shortage of available donor organs, experts say. Doctors in the US perform xenotransplants in rare cases, with permission from the US Food and Drug Administration. For Pisano, the permission came through the agency\u2019s expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policy, which allows terminally ill patients who have no other treatment options to access experimental medical products. Due to Pisano\u2019s heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, she couldn\u2019t have a standard transplant, NYU Langone said in a news release. Before the xenotransplant, Pisano\u00a0said,\u00a0she had \u201ctried everything else\u201d and, with the surgery, was hoping to spend time with her grandkids and play with them. The pig kidney she received was genetically altered to evade human antibodies, which typically detect and attack foreign organs. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed beneath the pig kidney\u2019s cover to further help Pisano\u2019s body accept the organ. However, the kidney was removed in May after it was determined that it was \u201cno longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen,\u201d Montgomery said at the time. Pisano\u2019s \u201cbravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs,\u201d he said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cHer legacy as a pioneer will live on and she will forever be remembered for her courage and good nature.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_women-cancer-colon-breast-screening-wellness", "text": "An estimated 72 million women in the United States have skipped or delayed a recommended health screening,\u00a0according to a new survey. This poll, conducted by Gallup for medical technology company Hologic, found that 90% of women acknowledged the importance of regular health screenings \u2014 but more than 40% have skipped or delayed a test. Women have trouble prioritizing their own health, the survey found, with over 60% of women responding that it was hard to make their own health a priority. The numbers are particularly striking among younger women;\u00a074% of women in Generation Z and 70% of millennials said it was hard to prioritize their health, compared with 52% of baby boomers and 39% of the Silent Generation. Struck by these numbers, I wanted to speak with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen to learn more about why they are a cause for concern. What are the preventive screenings that younger women should receive? And what steps can women take to prioritize their health and well-being? Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What were the parts of the poll that stand out most to you? Dr. Leana Wen: I was disheartened, though not surprised, to see that it was so common for women, especially young women, to forgo health screenings. According to the results, most women in the survey mentioned factors such as caring for other family members first, struggling with work and other pressing matters. This is consistent with my experience as a clinician and\u00a0a\u00a0public health official. Unfortunately, too many women focus on their health only after they have been diagnosed with a chronic illness. Our society places too little emphasis on prevention, and there are many barriers in the way of people obtaining preventive care. CNN: Why are regular health screenings so important for women, including young women? Wen:\u00a0This study focused on health screenings for cancer, so let\u2019s start there.\u00a0One in five\u00a0women\u00a0around the world\u00a0will develop cancer over our lifetimes. Early treatment is key to improving survival rates, and that hinges on early diagnosis. This is why screenings are so important. Cancer screenings are conducted before people develop symptoms. There is a disturbing global trend of a\u00a0rise in early-onset cancers,\u00a0which is defined as cancer cases diagnosed in people younger than 50. Between 1990 and 2019, early-onset cancers increased by\u00a079%. In the US, while people older than 50 have experienced a drop in overall cancer rates between 1995 and 2020, the cancer incidence\u00a0has increased in people younger than 50. All of this\u00a0makes the survey results of young women neglecting their health screenings even more distressing. According to the survey, 41% of US women delayed or skipped screenings for breast cancer, 35% for cervical cancer and 33% for colorectal cancers. CNN: What cancer screenings are recommended for younger women? Wen:\u00a0Here are the recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force. For\u00a0breast cancer, the USPSTF recommends that women get screened every other year, starting from age 40 and continuing through age 74. This is a recent change. Previously, the recommendation was to start between age 40 to 50. For\u00a0cervical cancer, the task force recommends that women who are ages 21 to 29 get screened every three years with a Pap test that looks at cervical cells. For women ages 30 to 65, the recommendation is to get screened every three years with the Pap test, or every five years with either testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (a virus that could cause cervical cancer) or the virus testing combined with the Pap test. For\u00a0colon cancer, the USPSTF recommends that both women and men begin screenings at age 45. This also represents a change in response to the rise in colon cancer among younger individuals; until a few years ago, the recommendation was for colon cancer screenings to start at age 50. All the above recommendations apply to women at average risk of developing these cancers. Individuals at higher risk by virtue of family history, personal cancer history or other risk factors should speak with their physicians about whether they should start screening at earlier ages and more frequently. They may also need additional testing; for instance, women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer may be recommended for an MRI in addition to a mammogram and may be referred to genetic testing. CNN: What else should women know about regular screenings? Wen: Ideally, every woman has a primary care provider whom they visit every year. These appointments should keep track of what screenings have been done and when to do the next set of screenings. First, women should know whether they have personal medical circumstances that put them at higher risk compared with other people. Everyone should try to find out their family history of common ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Bring up lifestyle factors that may influence risk factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and physical activity. Second, discuss screening tests. What\u2019s recommended now and why? We\u2019ve spoken today mainly about cancer screening, but there are screenings for other chronic diseases that should be done. For instance, you should be getting your blood pressure checked at annual visits to screen for hypertension. The USPSTF also recommends screening for\u00a0diabetes\u00a0in adults ages 35 to 70 who have a body mass index that places them in the category of overweight or obesity and for\u00a0high cholesterol\u00a0in women ages 45 and older who are at increased risk of heart disease. Third, women should discuss issues regarding their reproductive health. If they want to become pregnant, they should optimize their health in preparation for pregnancy. If they do not, they should discuss contraceptive options. We have not yet discussed screening for\u00a0sexually transmitted infections, but this is also a part of routine health screening that should be discussed at the annual checkup. Last but certainly not least, it\u2019s important to discuss mental health issues. Mental health is a crucial determinant of overall health. Women should be sure to discuss concerns such as\u00a0depression,\u00a0anxiety\u00a0and\u00a0stress\u00a0with their providers. Many treatment options exist \u2014 no one should have to suffer in silence. CNN: How can women keep track of their screenings and what they need coming up? The problem is that many women do not have a regular provider. They may also neglect to see that person due to the issues highlighted in the survey \u2014 maybe these women are busy with other life circumstances and then only see a provider once something is wrong. The other issue highlighted in the survey is that providers may not be bringing up the screenings. Women are more likely to be screened if they and their provider have a discussion about the importance of screenings, the poll says. Yet these conversations are sometimes not happening for a variety of reasons. We need to have a better health care system that ensures access and continuity of care for all people, and clinicians must have adequate time to address crucial issues like prevention during the annual visit. In the meantime, I recommend that women keep track of what screenings they have received and have an idea of when the next one is due. Bring that list with you when you are going for your annual checkup and ask your doctor if you are up to date.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/women-cancer-colon-breast-screening-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

The case was flagged Friday from preliminary test results, and the potential source of the infection is still under investigation, the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment said in a\u00a0news release. The plague is an infectious disease caused by bacterium, Yersinia pestis, transmitted by fleas. Although it is best known for \u201cThe Black Death,\u201d an outbreak that killed millions of Europeans during the Middle Ages, the bacteria circulates naturally among wild rodents and\u00a0rarely\u00a0infects humans today, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Plague is transmitted to humans through bites from infected fleas, contact with infected animals or inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. Anyone who develops symptoms of plague should get medical attention immediately, the CDC says. Typical symptoms include sudden fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and, commonly, swollen lymph nodes with pain. \u201cPlague can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but an infected person must be treated promptly to avoid serious complications or death,\u201d said Alicia Solis, program manager of the Office of Communicable Disease and Emergency Preparedness at the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment, in the news release. \u201cWe advise all individuals to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\u201d the department says. One way to avoid infection is to eliminate places where wild rodents can exist around humans such as brush, rock piles, trash and piles of lumber around homes, garages, sheds and recreation areas, according to the department. Taking precautions around pets can also reduce risk of transmission. The department suggests treating dogs and cats for fleas, keeping pet food in rodent-proof containers and not letting pets roam in rodent areas or sleep in bed with you. From 1970 to 2022, there were 67 reported cases of plague in Colorado, according to the CDC. Worldwide, 3,248 human plague cases were reported from 2010 to 2015, most commonly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Peru, the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0found. \u201cA plague vaccine is no longer available in the United States,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cNew plague vaccines are in development but are not expected to be commercially available in the immediate future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/human-plague-case-colorado/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_mounjaro-ozempic-weight-loss-study-says", "text": "People taking tirzepatide injections lost more weight and were more likely to reach specific weight loss targets than those taking semaglutide, according to a new study. Researchers from Truveta, a health data analytics company, analyzed electronic health records for more than 18,000 adults, all of whom had overweight or obesity, who were using these medications in the real world between May 2022 and September 2023. The findings were published Monday in the JAMA Internal Medicine medical journal. Both medications were effective: The vast majority of people using either tirzepatide or semaglutide lost at least 5% of their starting body weight after one year of use. But 82% of people taking tirzepatide reached this important clinical benchmark, compared with about 67% of those taking semaglutide. And people taking tirzepatide were more than twice as likely to lose at least 15% of their starting weight than those taking semaglutide: about 42% compared with 18% after one year of use. Average weight loss was also consistently higher among those taking tirzepatide over time. After three months, people taking tirzepatide had lost about 6% of their body weight, on average, compared with an average of less than 4% loss among those taking semaglutide. At six months, average weight loss was 10% on tirzepatide and about 6% on semaglutide. And by one year, average weight loss was nearly double for those taking tirzepatide: more than 15%, compared with about 8% for those taking semaglutide. Tirzepatide and semaglutide both mimic the effects of the gut hormone GLP-1, which stimulates the body\u2019s production of insulin and slows the passage of food through the stomach. GLP-1 also signals the brain to help control appetite. Tirzepatide also stimulates a second gut hormone, called GIP, which may help boost its effects. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved versions of tirzepatide and semaglutide to treat both type 2 diabetes and obesity. Eli Lilly manufactures tirzepatide under the brand name Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for chronic weight management, while Novo Nordisk manufacturers semaglutide as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight management. The FDA approved higher doses of both tirzepatide and semaglutide to treat weight loss, but the new study looked only at the doses to treat type 2 diabetes. About half of the people who were included in this study had type 2 diabetes, while the other half had no indication of a diabetes diagnosis in their health records and were probably using these medications off-label for weight management at their doctor\u2019s discretion. When the findings from this study were first released in a preprint last year, Novo Nordisk told CNN that it wasn\u2019t a fair comparison. \u201cThe doses of semaglutide evaluated in this analysis have not been investigated for chronic weight management, and there are no head-to-head trials that have reported which evaluate Wegovy\u00a0and tirzepatide,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. According to the new study, individuals with type 2 diabetes had less significant weight loss than those without a diagnosis \u2014 but average weight loss was still greater among those taking tirzepatide. The researchers did not track mild gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting, noting that these types of complaints might not be captured in patient records consistently. But the risk of more serious adverse outcomes \u2014 such as bowel obstruction, gasteoparesis or pancreatitis \u2014 were found to be similar among those taking tirzepatide and semaglutide. Along with side effects, people who did not lose weight while taking these medications may be more likely to stop or switch drugs, the researchers say. Discontinuation was common \u2014 more than half of patients stopped their treatment before the end of the study \u2014 but rates were similar among those taking tirzepatide and those taking semaglutide. The findings from this study align with clinical trial results, but the study authors note that more research is needed to compare the effects that tirzepatide and semaglutide have on other key health outcomes, such as heart-related events.

{"id": "travel_summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn", "text": "Do you yearn for long days and short nights? Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers. The summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It\u2019s the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It\u2019s also the first official day of summer. Our ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion.\u00a0Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge). Pagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe. The mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility \u2013 both the plant and human variety \u2013 in destinations worldwide. The science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia. Summer solstice science Is it summer solstice all over the world? No. It\u2019s only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world\u2019s population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there. When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on\u00a0June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that\u2019s 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool. Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador\u2019s capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight. But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn\u2019t get that dark.\u00a0 The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They\u2019ll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order. Why don\u2019t we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night\u00a0back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That\u2019s because the Earth is aligned on an\u00a0axis, an imaginary pole\u00a0going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts \u2013 at\u00a0an angle of 23.5 degrees. \u201cAs Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun\u2019s direct rays,\u201d explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that\u2019s the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox. Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it\u2019s not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US. \u201cOn average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\u201d says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward. \u201cTemperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night \u2013 so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\u201d says Ward. \u201cThe only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\u201d\u00a0because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August. The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe. How to celebrate summer solstice What does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically. The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at\u00a0summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times. The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise. What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day. In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night \u2013 a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires. In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations\u2019 International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_voice-box-transplant", "text": "A Massachusetts man has regained his voice after surgeons removed his cancerous larynx and, in a pioneering move, replaced it with a donated one. Transplants of the so-called voice box are extremely rare, and normally aren\u2019t an option for people with active cancer. Marty Kedian is only the third person in the U.S. ever to undergo a total larynx transplant \u2013 the others, years ago, because of injuries \u2013 and one of a handful reported worldwide. Surgeons at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona offered Kedian the transplant as part of a new clinical trial aimed at opening the potentially lifechanging operation to more patients, including some with cancer, the most common way to lose a larynx. \u201cPeople need to keep their voice,\u201d Kedian, 59, told The Associated Press four months after his transplant \u2013 still hoarse but able to keep up an hourlong conversation. \u201cI want people to know this can be done.\u201d He became emotional recalling the first time he phoned his 82-year-old mother after the surgery \u201cand she could hear me. \u2026 That was important to me, to talk to my mother.\u201d The study is small \u2014 just nine more people will be enrolled. But it may teach scientists best practices for these complex transplants so that one day they could be offered to more people who can\u2019t breathe, swallow or speak on their own because of a damaged or surgically removed larynx. \u201cPatients become very reclusive, and very kind of walled off from the rest of the world,\u201d said Dr. David Lott, Mayo\u2019s chair of head and neck surgery in Phoenix. He started the study because \u201cmy patients tell me, \u2018Yeah I may be alive but I\u2019m not really living.\u2019\u201d Lott\u2019s team reported early results of the surgery Tuesday in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. The larynx may be best known as the voice box but it\u2019s also vital for breathing and swallowing. Muscular tissue flaps called vocal cords open to let air into the lungs, close to prevent food or drink from going the wrong way \u2013 and vibrate when air pushes past them to produce speech. The first two U.S. larynx transplant recipients \u2013 at the Cleveland Clinic in 1998 and the University of California, Davis, in 2010 \u2013 had lost their voices to injuries, one from a motorcycle accident and the other damaged by a hospital ventilator. But cancer is the biggest reason. The American Cancer Society estimates more than 12,600 people will be diagnosed with some form of laryngeal cancer this year. While today many undergo voice-preserving treatment, thousands of people have had their larynx completely removed, breathing through what\u2019s called a tracheostomy tube in their neck and struggling to communicate. Although the earlier U.S. recipients achieved near normal speech, doctors haven\u2019t embraced these transplants. Partly that\u2019s because people can survive without a larynx \u2013 while antirejection drugs that suppress the immune system could spark new or recurring tumors. \u201cWe want to be able to push those boundaries but do it as safely and ethically as we can,\u201d Lott said. Head-and-neck specialists say the Mayo trial is key to helping larynx transplants become a viable option. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a \u2018one-off,\u2019\u201d but an opportunity to finally learn from one patient before operating on the next, said Dr. Marshall Strome, who led the 1998 transplant in Cleveland. This first attempt in a cancer patient \u201cis the next important step,\u201d he said. Other options are being studied, noted Dr. Peter Belafsky of UC Davis, who helped perform the 2010 transplant. His patients at high risk of larynx loss record their voice in anticipation of next-generation speech devices that sound like them. But Belafsky said there\u2019s \u201cstill a shot\u201d for larynx transplants to become more common while cautioning it likely will take years more research. One hurdle has been achieving enough nerve regrowth to breathe without a trach tube. Kedian was diagnosed with a rare laryngeal cartilage cancer about a decade ago. The Haverhill, Massachusetts, man underwent more than a dozen surgeries, eventually needing a trach tube to help him breathe and swallow \u2014 and struggled even to muster a raspy whisper through it. He had to retire on disability. Still the once gregarious Kedian, known for long conversations with strangers, wouldn\u2019t let doctors remove his entire larynx to cure the cancer. He desperately wanted to read bedtime stories to his granddaughter, with his own voice rather than what he called robotic-sounding speech devices. Then Kedian\u2019s wife Gina tracked down the Mayo study. Lott decided he was a good candidate because his cancer wasn\u2019t fast-growing and \u2013 especially important \u2013 Kedian already was taking antirejection drugs for an earlier kidney transplant. It took 10 months to find a deceased donor with a healthy enough larynx just the right size. Then on Feb. 29, six surgeons operated for 21 hours. After removing Kedian\u2019s cancerous larynx, they transplanted the donated one plus necessary adjoining tissues \u2013 thyroid and parathyroid glands, the pharynx and upper part of the trachea \u2013 and tiny blood vessels to supply them. Finally, using new microsurgical techniques, they connected nerves critical for Kedian to feel when he needs to swallow and to move the vocal cords. About three weeks later, Kedian said \u201chello.\u201d Soon he\u2019d relearned to swallow, working up from applesauce to macaroni and cheese and hamburgers. He got to say hi to granddaughter Charlotte via video, part of his homework to just keep talking. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Kedian, who moves back to Massachusetts soon. His tracheostomy remains in place at least a few more months but \u201cI\u2019m pushing myself to make it go faster because I want these tubes out of me, to go back to a normal life.\u201d And just as Lott had assured him, Kedian retained his beloved Boston accent.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/voice-box-transplant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_gupta-biden-cognitive-testing-analysis", "text": "When the 46th President of the United States took the debate stage a week ago, it became apparent, even from his first answer, that this would not be the performance he hoped for. For me as a brain specialist, it was concerning to watch President Joe Biden, and it quickly became clear that I was not alone in my reaction. Over the past week, I received more than a dozen calls, texts and emails from medical colleagues who, like me, specialize in the brain. It wasn\u2019t that what we noticed was necessarily new but that it was particularly pronounced, and right from the start of the debate. From a neurological standpoint, we were concerned with his confused rambling; sudden loss of concentration in the middle of a sentence; halting speech and absence of facial animation, resulting at times in a flat, open-mouthed expression. To be clear, these are only observations, not in any way diagnostic of something deeper, and none of these doctors wished to suggest that was the case. The consensus from the doctors reaching out to me, however, was that the president should be encouraged to undergo detailed cognitive and movement disorder testing, and those results should be made available to the public. Over the past five years, I have reported extensively on the advances in the world of treating and reducing risk of dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia. For the documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I even went through extensive cognitive testing to demonstrate what it entailed and determine whether I had problems with executive functioning, judgment or memory lapses, as well as blood tests to determine things like the level of abnormal proteins that may be present in my brain and my B12 levels. My sense of smell and my genetic risk factors were checked. This type of testing is not necessary for most people as a matter of routine, but every one of the brain doctors I spoke to recommended that level of examination for Biden. Biden\u2019s health history The last official report in February was a health summary which concluded that the president was \u201cfit for duty.\u201d The White House said a team of 20 doctors, including a neurologist, participated in completing his physical. An \u201cextremely detailed\u201d neurologic exam found nothing consistent with neurological disorders, the summary said. It also found no evidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease that might explain his stiff gait and decreased expression in his face. Although Parkinson\u2019s disease is the most common cause of parkinsonism - a set of movement symptoms such as stiffness and tremor \u2013 there are other causes as well, and it was not clear in the medical report that those had been investigated. They did find evidence of neuropathy and arthritis\u00a0in his feet, which can cause numbness, weakness and pain. There was no mention of any sort of cognitive testing. Biden was examined by his physician after the debate to check on a cold, the White House said, but it was a \u201cbrief check\u201d and not a physical.\u00a0When White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked this week whether Biden should receive and release the results of any kind of cognitive test, she replied that his medical team has said it\u2019s \u201cnot necessary.\u201d It\u2019s true that the trajectory of aging varies from person to person. Biden is 81, and former President Donald Trump is 78. Both have already lived longer than the average American male lifespan of 74.8 years. This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, as both men have access to high-quality health care, and they don\u2019t drink or smoke. Biden\u2019s medical team has previously disclosed that he had two separate brain operations for aneurysms, including one that ruptured on the left side of his brain, in 1988, and there is some evidence that this type of hemorrhage may increase the risk of delayed cognitive problems later in life. Trump\u2019s father died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 93. Neither man has any other known risk factors for cognitive decline. Trump does at times display some of these same signs as Biden, including nonsensical rants as well as confusing names and current events. He said he\u2019d undergone the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, known as MoCA, in the past. According to his medical team, he received a perfect score when he took the test in 2018. Trump said he took a second cognitive test for his last physical exam at the end of 2023 and \u201caced it.\u201d In a note at the end of last year, Dr. Bruce Aronwald wrote that Trump\u2019s cognitive exams \u201cwere exceptional.\u201d Trump has not released his actual medical records, and memos about his health that were previously released have at times used hyperbolic language, unusual for medical documentation. The MoCA isn\u2019t the same level of cognitive testing the medical experts I spoke to would like to see Biden do, but it could serve as an initial screening tool for cognitive decline. For Trump, this might be considered either a screening test or a baseline to understand how his cognition might be changing. It\u2019s not clear that Biden has ever had such a baseline examination for comparison. An \u2018episode\u2019 or a \u2018condition\u2019? To be clear, there are aspects of aging that can be beneficial to the job of the presidency. Older people may \u201chave something called crystalized intelligence, which is the accumulated wisdom associated with the passage of time,\u201d according to Jay Olshansky, professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois-Chicago. This is our knowledge that comes from learning and experiences. On the other hand, there are definitely aspects of cognition that decline as we age \u2014 especially fluid abilities like processing speed, attention span and memory. This is normal and expected and doesn\u2019t necessarily stand in the way of someone\u2019s ability to do their job. But for a minority of us, that decline is steeper and can lead to dementia. Think of this as the difference between forgetting where you put your keys and not understanding what your keys are for. Still, determining a diagnosis of dementia is not as straightforward as many believe, and there are many other things that could account for the clinical observations I described above. A poor night\u2019s sleep or low blood sugar can have an impact. A viral illness or the medications used to treat those symptoms can result in temporary brain fog. Biden and his aides have said it was a \u201cbad night.\u201d The White House press team said Biden had a cold but did not take any medications to treat symptoms. After the debate, Jean-Pierre added that he had jet lag following overseas travel earlier in the month and worked late doing his presidential duties as well as preparing for the debate.\u00a0According to three sources briefed on these comments, Biden told Democratic governors during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he will stop scheduling events after 8 p.m. so he can get more sleep. The debate started at 9 p.m. Eastern. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question\u201d whether Biden\u2019s debate performance was an \u201cepisode\u201d or a \u201ccondition,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during an MSNBC interview Tuesday. That is precisely why detailed testing is important. It can help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning. As a doctor, I would want to understand the possibility of underlying dementia because, over the past several years, we have learned that there are medical treatments and lifestyle changes that can delay and, in some cases, even reverse the symptoms of the disease. These are hopeful days when it comes to dementia, and early diagnosis and treatment is better than it has ever been. Seeking answers With an election looming in November, we don\u2019t have answers about Biden. The White House has rejected requests from the press to release more medical records and question Biden\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor. Biden\u2019s press secretary said O\u2019Connor watched the debate and had no concerns afterward. Elected officials, like anyone else, are entitled to some level of privacy, and under federal health-care laws, there is no ability for someone to obtain personal medical information on an individual unless authorized, even the president. There is also no requirement for the president or candidates to disclose that information. Most do not. In fact, in the 23 years I have been reporting on these topics, only Sen. John McCain \u2014 one of the oldest presidential candidates in US history \u2014 shared all of his records with me and the American public. We often hear that observing a candidate on the campaign trail is the best assessment of the individual\u2019s physical and cognitive health. Back in 2020, Biden said he was \u201cconstantly tested\u201d by the work of running for president. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is watch me,\u201d he said then. The country is watching now, and that assessment gives cause for concern \u2014 and a need for transparent testing.

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_07_05_health_plague-human-risk-explainer", "text": "Plague, one of the deadliest bacterial infections in human history, caused an estimated 50 million deaths in Europe during the Middle Ages when it was known as the Black Death. While extremely rare, the disease is still around today, with a man in New Mexico dying of plague in March after being hospitalized for the disease and a person in Oregon being diagnosed with bubonic\u00a0plague in February after likely being infected by their pet cat. It\u2019s transmitted by fleas that live on rodents. Symptoms usually appear within one to seven days after infection and include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, in the groin, armpit or neck areas as well as fever, chills and coughing. How do you get the plague? Plague affects humans and other mammals. Usually, people get the plague after being bitten by a rodent flea carrying Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the disease, or by handling an infected animal, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cats, which become sick themselves, can directly infect humans, while hardier dogs may simply carry the fleas back to their owners. People also can become sick by inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. The bacteria persists because low levels circulate among populations of certain rodents, according to the CDC. These infected animals and their fleas serve as long-term reservoirs for the bacteria. \u201cThe reason why it hasn\u2019t been eliminated is because there\u2019s an animal reservoir,\u201d Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,\u00a0said in February. \u201cThe bacteria can infect animals, and because we can\u2019t treat all animals\u00a0in the wild, it persists in nature and thus occasionally\u00a0causes a limited number of human cases.\u201d Where can you get the plague? Plague occurs naturally in rural areas in the western United States, particularly Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. That\u2019s where an average of seven human plague cases are reported each year to the CDC. But significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia. From 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths, according to\u00a0the World Health Organization.\u00a0It said the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru. There are three types of plague \u2013 bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic plague. With the pneumonic form of plague \u2013 which means it affects the lungs \u2013 there is a risk of direct transmission from human to human. That was the case\u00a0in the large outbreak in Madagascar in 2017, where there were 2,348 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and 202 deaths. The last urban plague epidemic in the United States occurred in Los Angeles from 1924 through 1925, the CDC said. How worried should I be? Modern antibiotics \u2013 streptomycin is the usual first-line treatment \u2013 can prevent complications and death if given promptly after symptoms appear. The treatment is used for the two most common types of plague: bubonic and pneumonic. \u201cThe reason why it caused such widespread death and destruction in the Middle Ages is because we didn\u2019t have antibiotics at that time,\u201d Barouch said in February about plague. \u201cAlthough it can be a serious illness, it\u2019s usually easily treatable with antibiotics as long as it\u2019s caught early. So now it\u2019s a very treatable disease. It shouldn\u2019t create the fear that people had in the Middle Ages of the Black Death,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone develops symptoms consistent with the plague \u2014 usually the initial symptoms are fever, chills and swollen lymph node \u2014 then seek medical attention, because at the early stages, the plague is easily treatable with antibiotics.\u201d Bubonic plague has a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60%\u00a0when left untreated,\u00a0while pneumonic plague, when left untreated, is always fatal,\u00a0according to WHO. However, a strain of bubonic plague with\u00a0high-level resistance to streptomycin\u00a0has been seen in Madagascar. More than 80% of US cases have been the bubonic form, which is the most common form of infection. Untreated bubonic plague can turn into the more serious pneumonic plague, which causes rapidly developing pneumonia after bacteria spread to the lungs. Is there a vaccine for the plague? There is a\u00a0Yersinia pestis vaccine, but it is recommended only for high-risk people like scientists who work directly with the bacterium, Dr. Harish Moorjani, an infectious disease specialist at Phelps Hospital in New York, part of Northwell Health, said in February. \u201cMost people don\u2019t need the vaccine,\u201d Moorjani said. A 2019 review\u00a0of experimental plague vaccines suggests that researchers are exploring a variety of approaches to develop an effective plague inoculation. Since different vaccine designs lead to different mechanisms of immunity, the authors conclude that combinations of different types might overcome the limitations of individual vaccines and effectively prevent a potential plague outbreak. How do you protect yourself and your family? Key steps for prevention of plague include eliminating nesting places for rodents around your home, sheds, garages and recreation areas by removing brush, rock piles, trash and excess firewood. Report sick or dead animals to law enforcement or your local health officials; do not pick up or touch them yourself. If you absolutely must handle a sick or dead animal, wear gloves. If you live in an endemic area,\u00a0take added precautions. Use insect repellent that contains DEET to prevent flea bites and treat dogs and cats for fleas regularly. Do not sleep with your pets as this increases your risk of getting plague. Finally, your pets should not hunt or roam rodent habitats, such as prairie dog colonies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/plague-human-risk-explainer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

McGonigal\u00a0said exercise allows for the creation and release of \u201chope\u201d molecules, technically called myokines, during muscle contractions \u2014 for example, when we work out or even just move around. Some of these myokines can have antidepressant effects. \u201cOur muscles do more than just move our bones around or stabilize our skeleton,\u201d she said. \u201cOur muscles are almost like endocrine organs. They manufacture these molecules that they can release into the bloodstream that then travel around and affect all of our organs.\u00a0And some of them can cross the blood-brain barrier and affect your brain, including your mood and your mental health and your brain health.\u201d Exercise enables you to see your body as an ally, according to McGonigal. \u201cI think this is one of the coolest bits of the science of movement and exercise, particularly because of how it allows us to feel like our body is our friend,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our partner, not something we\u2019re trying to fix or control through movement.\u201d McGonigal said many other brain chemicals get released during exercise that can affect someone\u2019s state of mind, resulting in, for example, a runner\u2019s high, a flow state and even euphoria. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a lot of different kind of brain states you could experience in movement; it\u2019s not one \u2018thing,\u2019\u201d she said. You can listen to the full discussion here. What can you do to tap into joy during exercise and movement? McGonigal has these five tips. Take your workout on the road Head out into nature. \u201cWe know that mindful forms of movement, as well as moving outdoors in nature, tends to put the brain in a state of this heightened awareness to the present moment that feels like vitality and connection to life,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cPeople often feel a relief from inner chatter and stress and worrying. \u2026 It\u2019s changing which systems of the brain are most active and putting you in a state that\u2019s like meditation.\u201d Pump up the volume Queue up your favorite playlist and get moving. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a workout where you\u2019re listening to music you love that\u2019s high energy, you\u2019re moving to the beat, and you\u2019re doing things that really get your heart rate up \u2026 it often is more like euphoria,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel incredible, and you\u2019ve got those endorphins, and that brain chemistry also really helps you feel connected to other people.\u201d Join the group Being social helps you exercise. \u201cMake movement social. We know that people form friendships and communities of support through movement, whether it\u2019s strength training or running,\u201d McGonigal said. These days, who couldn\u2019t use another friend or source of support? Exercise also helps you be more social. \u201cPeople who exercise, they report being less lonely, they report having better relationships with others and \u2014 for reasons that range from the biochemical and how the brain chemistry of exercise primes you to be more social \u2014 to be able to connect with others better,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIf you are socially anxious and you exercise, by the end of that workout, you\u2019re going to be almost like a more extroverted version of yourself.\u201d Get back to basics Find something you really like doing. \u201cThink about positive experiences you\u2019ve had with movement in your life,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cMaybe go back to something that you miss or find a new way to do it.\u201d Change your mindset to one of gratitude While you are moving, find ways to appreciate your body for being able to move, as opposed to monitoring it. Adopt a \u201cmindset switch of, \u2018Wow, body \u2014 that was incredible!\u2019 Or \u2018Thank you, body, for having the energy to let me do this,\u2019\u201d McGonigal said. We hope these five tips help you tap into joy through movement. Listen to the full episode here.

{"id": "2024_07_06_health_biden-debate-cognitive-tests", "text": "President Joe Biden said Friday that his poor performance in last week\u2019s debate was a bad night but not evidence of a serious condition. \u201cI have medical doctors traveling everywhere. Every president does, as you know. Medical doctors from the best of the world travel with me everywhere I go,\u201d Biden told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos. \u201cI have an ongoing assessment of what I\u2019m doing. They don\u2019t hesitate to tell me if they think there\u2019s something else wrong.\u201d Biden said he spoke with his doctor after the debate and was told, \u201cyou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d Being president, he said, means \u201cI get a full neurological test every day.\u201d But doctors who work with aging patients say there\u2019s no single moment or test that determines a person\u2019s mental fitness or ability to function. In-depth evaluations can provide more answers, including ruling out potential problems. Such tests might start with short questionnaires, then expand to physical exams, blood tests, brain imaging, lengthy interviews with the individual and conversations with family members and friends. In an analysis published Friday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta urged the president to undergo detailed cognitive and neurological tests and to make those results public. Such testing \u201ccan help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning,\u201d Gupta wrote. When asked on Friday whether he\u2019s had cognitive tests and an exam by a neurologist, Biden said no. \u201cNo one said I had to. \u2026 They said I\u2019m good,\u201d the president said. Biden gave no indication he would be willing to have such tests conducted in the aftermath of his debate performance. Effects of typical aging Most people who are aging normally will experience some cognitive changes, but when and how much varies from person to person. Slow, age-related cognitive decline starts around age 27, studies show, even for healthy and well-educated people. A person\u2019s reasoning and problem-solving skills, along with their ability to maintain the thread of a conversation, can get tougher with age, but not so much that it impairs what doctors consider normal functioning. \u201cEvery aging researcher will tell you, though, that not everything declines as you get older, and not everything declines at an equal rate,\u201d said Dr. Charan Ranganath, a professor of psychology and neuroscience and the director of the Dynamic Memory Lab at the University of California, Davis. For example, the ability to remember facts \u2014 an essential skill for a president \u2014 doesn\u2019t disappear with age, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re slower to pull it up, and you\u2019re more likely to struggle to pull up the facts when you need it,\u201d Ranganath said. And it\u2019s not just memory that changes with age, said Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University. \u201cIt\u2019s reasoning and sociability and attention and orientation, and emotional stability and judgment and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cSome get impaired with age, and some actually get better with age, such as vocabulary.\u201d A person\u2019s moral\u00a0reasoning and judgment or their capacity for compassion and empathy will not necessarily decline, Ranganath added. Unless there is some kind of cognitive impairment, those aspects of personality can improve in some people with normal aging. \u201cSo, again, pretty important for a job like president,\u201d Ranganath added. Cognitive impairment \u2014 a loss of memory and other mental abilities that affect daily life \u2014 is different and is not considered normal or inevitable with aging. It occurs in 12% to 18% of people older than 65 and is more prevalent with advancing age, Rowe said. By age 80, more than 25% of people may have some mild cognitive impairment. They may start to lose things and miss appointments, \u201coccurrences that could be characterized as impairing your function,\u201d Rowe said. A minority in this group will go on to develop dementia each year, he said. And some may adapt, maybe seeming to have improved function. \u201cThey always put the key in the same place. They write down all their appointments,\u201d Rowe said. Screening for cognitive impairment To screen for cognitive impairment, a person\u2019s primary care physician will often start with the Mini Mental State Exam, known as the MMSE, or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, also called the MoCA. The MMSE is a 5- to 10-minute 11-question assessment that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. Former President Donald Trump, who has faced questions about his cognitive function, has repeatedly said he \u201caced\u201d the MoCA \u2014 a 30-point test that takes about 10 minutes. It evaluates the ability to concentrate and tests executive function, memory, language, conceptual thinking and orientation, the ability to do calculations and the ability to organize and manipulate spatial information to create a design. Both ask for simple information, like what the date is and where the participant is, and ask to count backward from 100 using a particular number. Both tests ask a person to draw. The MMSE asks the participant to identify particular objects in the room and to take a piece of paper in their right hand, fold it in half and put it on the floor. For the MoCA, the person will be told five words and then asked to repeat them in five minutes. The tests are not in-depth. Ranganath describes the MMSE as a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d: Unless someone has established language problems, he said, \u201cbasically, you have to be seriously cognitively impaired\u201d to do poorly, \u201cespecially for somebody who is functioning at a high level, like a high-level politician.\u201d The MoCA, he said, is good at detecting when someone has mild cognitive impairment. It\u2019s a test for \u201cwhen people can really tell there\u2019s a memory problem, and that\u2019s often when they\u2019ll be talking to a doctor about it,\u201d Ranganath said \u2014 and perhaps seeking more detailed results. More detailed cognitive tests If a doctor or family member suspects more serious cognitive problems, a person may be referred to specialists who can do further tests that may take one or two days to complete. Usually, the person will be referred to a behavioral neurologist who specializes in aging and dementia and non-dementia diagnosis, as well as a neuropsychologist and possibly a social worker who will meet with them and their family, according to Dr. Emily Rogalski, a professor of neurology who runs the University of Chicago\u2019s Health Aging & Alzheimer\u2019s Research Care Center. \u201cPart of those evaluations will look at the overall health of the individual, from neurologic health to also cognitive health,\u201d she said. Cognitive health includes how a person can learn, think and remember. Neurological health involves the nervous system. Neurological disorders like Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s, or even a headache, can affect cognitive functions. But other conditions can have an impact too, such as an infection or tumor. \u201cThe neuropsychologist is able to do an in-depth evaluation of the strengths and challenges that an individual may be experiencing and start to understand the interactions between those strengths and challenges,\u201d Rogalski said. Testing could also include blood tests or imaging that may tell doctors what\u2019s going on in the brain itself. There will also be a physical examination. If a person has a history of congestive heart failure, a doctor may do a cardiac exam to check for deterioration that could contribute to cognitive issues, said Dr. Brad Dickerson, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and an associate neurologist who sees patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cYou have to take all that into consideration when you\u2019re trying to figure out why their cognitive functioning may be different than it was,\u201d he said. At this level of testing, part of the evaluation will also include a report from people close to the patient. \u201cThat sometimes is a spouse or a close family member who can comment on whether the individual is experiencing significant change from their previous level of function and whether that change is interfering with what we call activities of daily living,\u201d Rogalski said. Who should get tested \u2014\u00a0and when Dickerson said patients will often ask him when they should get tested. His answer: It depends. If, for example, an 80-year-old tells him that they keep forgetting the name of an actor in a movie they\u2019ve just seen or that they go into another part of the house to get three things and remember only two, and if the problem has gotten more annoying but over time isn\u2019t too disruptive, they could get a baseline cognitive and neurological assessment in the office. He said he would not be worried that this was a sign of a progressive disorder that needs to be diagnosed and treated. \u201cThere are elements of the history that would raise a doctor\u2019s concerns about a significant problem or would reduce the doctor\u2019s concerns about a significant problem,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cSometimes, you can\u2019t be sure of that until you sit down in the office and interview people.\u201d Rowe said he tells concerned family members and patients that the time to get tested is when they start asking whether they should. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in getting tested,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have a baseline so that you can get tested again in a year or two if you think things are getting worse.\u201d Testing, he said, should be able to tell them if they have issues that impair their function. But people shouldn\u2019t worry if they can\u2019t remember someone\u2019s name. Rowe, who served as chairman and CEO of the insurance company Aetna and was president and CEO of Mount Sinai NYU Health, believes that testing should be the default for people in several roles: presidential candidates, regardless of age; US Supreme Court justices; airline pilots. He says the public shouldn\u2019t get \u201ccarried away\u201d with scores: If one candidate\u2019s score is higher than the others, that doesn\u2019t mean that one is more qualified to be president, he said. \u201cBut if somebody fails a test,\u201d Rowe said, \u201cI think that it\u2019s something that people should know.\u201d Testing doesn\u2019t always lead to a dementia diagnosis. Addressing other health problems, such as a sleep disorder or medications interacting with each other, may lead to improvement. Patients may see symptoms reduced through lifestyle changes. If someone is found to have early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s, new treatments can slow the progression of disease. Distinguishing between cognitive impairment and typical age-related cognitive decline \u201care not trivial questions,\u201d and it\u2019s not something a family doctor can typically do, Ranganath said. Even in-depth testing may not give a clear indication of what a person is capable of now or in the near future. \u201cThere is also a bit of an art in figuring out how to translate someone\u2019s test results into a statement about real world functioning (i.e., whether a person is fit to drive, live independently, do a demanding job, etc.),\u201d Ranganath wrote in an email. \u201cMany times, the recommendation is obvious, but on occasion, it can be hard to tell and there are no clear cut answers. And if someone seems relatively competent at the moment, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they will be doing so well 2-4 years later.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang and John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/health/biden-debate-cognitive-tests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_health_alzheimers-association-criteria", "text": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0\u201cDr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: The Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient\u201d airs at 8 p.m. ET Sunday, July 7, on CNN. With another pricey Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment expected to receive an approval decision soon, the nonprofit Alzheimer\u2019s Association has published the final version of its new diagnostic criteria for the disease. And for the first time, the criteria call on doctors diagnosing the disease to rely on biomarkers \u2014 pieces of beta amyloid and tau proteins picked up by lab tests or on brain scans \u2014 rather than pen-and-paper tests of memory and thinking. The idea behind the change, the authors say, is to catch the condition in its earliest and most treatable stages, even before symptoms develop.\u00a0However, it also means people could be diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s based on a blood test alone, even if they don\u2019t have any memory difficulties. Biology should be the basis of the diagnosis, the authors argue, rather than symptoms.\u00a0Furthermore, they say, just because a person doesn\u2019t have symptoms doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t develop them down the line. But the criteria have been criticized by outside experts and drug industry watchdog groups who point out that people can have beta amyloid proteins in their brains and blood without ever developing dementia symptoms. They also point out that there\u2019s no research to support the idea that giving a person expensive, risky injected medications before they show symptoms will benefit them in the long run. Risks and benefits of early diagnosis In clinical trials, the new drugs \u2013 which are antibodies that recognize and grab onto pieces of beta amyloid to remove them from the brain \u2013 showed modest benefits. Beta amyloid peptides are protein pieces that form sticky plaques in the brain. Together with another protein, tau, which makes fibrous tangles that block the communication of nerve cells, they are considered a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There\u2019s still debate about the role of beta amyloid in the disease, however, and some experts contend that plaques are a consequence of the condition rather than its cause. In an 18-month study of people who were in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the antibody lecanemab \u2013 which the US Food and Drug Administration approved in 2023 \u2013 slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 27% compared with a placebo. Also last year, the experimental drug donanemab appeared to slow the progression of disease by about 35% compared with a placebo.\u00a0This month, a group of experts that advises the FDA on its drug approval decisions unanimously recommended the approval of donanemab for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The drugs come with some risk.\u00a0As they remove amyloid, they can lead to fluid accumulation, swelling and even microbleeds in the brain, which may lead to hospitalization. Both trials were in people who had early symptoms of memory decline. Studies that have tested antibodies in patients who had amyloid buildup in their brains but no symptoms have not found a benefit to patients. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence for it,\u201d said Dr. George Perry, a neurobiologist and editor of the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Critics say the new criteria could dramatically expand the number of people eligible to take the new drugs and could generate huge profits for drug manufacturers in the process. \u201cThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association should lose all credibility by releasing\u00a0guidelines labeling perfectly normal people as having Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, director of PharmedOut, a program based at Georgetown University that tracks pharmaceutical marketing tactics. \u201cIf followed, these guidelines will ruin the lives of tens of thousands of\u00a0people who\u00a0will be misinformed that they have dementia,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only entities that gain from this travesty are the pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s and the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, which is preying\u00a0on fear.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Association says its criteria is based on the latest developments in Alzheimer\u2019s science. Because Alzheimer\u2019s therapies haven\u2019t been approved for people without symptoms, for now, it recommends against diagnostic testing in people without cognitive impairment, according to the working group that developed the criteria. \u201cOur goal in sharing them now \u2014 even as the field and our knowledge continues to evolve \u2014 is to advance diagnosis, treatment and prevention in order to improve individual care and reduce the societal impact of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Dr. Maria C. Carrillo, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association\u2019s chief science officer and medical affairs lead, and senior author on the new criteria. Financial conflicts of interest The new criteria \u2013 from the leading patient advocacy organization for Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 were developed by a 20-member working group, many of whom reported financial ties to many of the companies that are marketing new drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s or that have new drugs in development. A third of the expert panel is directly employed by pharmaceutical companies, while another third has reported some other kind of payment from pharmaceutical or testing companies.\u00a0Two members of the panel were employees of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, which also takes funding from pharmaceutical companies.\u00a0Only a handful of members of the work group declared no relevant conflicts of interest. \u201cWe should not be relying on this paper that was basically developed by industry. It\u2019s just not standard of practice how we think about guidelines,\u201d said Dr. Eric Widera, a geriatrician at the University of California San Francisco who authored a commentary in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society on the new criteria. Widera says it\u2019s a familiar playbook for the pharmaceutical industry: expanding the market for a drug by first expanding the population diagnosed with the disease that it treats. \u201cThis is diagnostic creep,\u201d he said. He cites examples such as the \u201cIs it low T?\u201d awareness campaign, launched by Abbott Labs, which made a testosterone replacement product as well as a more sensitive test for the hormone. Biogen similarly created the \u201cIt\u2019s Time We Know\u201d campaign in 2021 to spread awareness of mild cognitive impairment after its Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm won a controversial FDA approval the same year. Aduhelm has since been taken off the market. Widera estimates that as many as 1 in 10 normally functioning 50-year-olds would test positive for beta amyloid under the new criteria. Currently, about 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s, but estimates suggest roughly 40 million would test positive for beta amyloid. \u201cPublications such as this are a necessary component of a strategy aimed at selling as many monoclonal antibodies as possible,\u201d said Dr. Karl Herrup, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Defending the need for industry input Dr. Clifford Jack, who studies brain imaging at the Mayo Clinic, led the development of the new guidelines and says he is proud of what the committee accomplished. \u201cI personally wrote about 99% of the text in the final document. And I have no conflict of interest at all,\u201d he said. The change in the guidelines was spurred, the authors say, by the availability of the first drugs to slow the progress of the disease as well as new blood tests for amyloid and tau proteins.\u00a0Those tests are available to doctors and patients through the specialty labs that make them, but they have not been approved by the FDA, which requires rigorous proof that a test doesn\u2019t give too many false negative or false positive results before it gives a green light for widespread use. In a comment on the new criteria, published Friday in the journal Nature Medicine, members of the work group said it was composed of members from industry, clinical medicine and academia as well as the FDA and the federal National Institute on Aging, to incorporate a diversity of viewpoints. \u201cWe want these criteria to reflect the best available current scientific knowledge, and some of that knowledge is contained in industry, who are the ones who are actually running these trials,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI can honestly say that I did not see any attempt at any point by a committee member to insert any kind of commercial interest into these guidelines,\u201d he said. The first draft of the criteria, which were first presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in 2023, noted that they were being developed as a collaboration between the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and the National Institute on Aging. But the new criteria received criticism, and the institute removed its name from the title after it was asked to do so by administration within the wider National Institutes of Health.\u00a0The collaboration violated an NIH policy not to endorse private entities, products or services, according to an email from the National Institute on Aging. \u201cNIA continues to serve on the working group and looks forward to continuing its collaborative efforts with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and other involved workgroup organizations,\u201d the agency said in a statement. Since the draft criteria were released, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association has clarified that these are not meant to serve as detailed diagnostic guidelines for clinicians. Instead, the criteria are meant to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between research and the doctor\u2019s office. New guidelines in the works The association said it plans to convene a new workgroup, with different members, to develop \u201cnuts-and-bolts\u201d guidelines for Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis for doctors.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear how much those guidelines will be based on the diagnostic criteria. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be very concrete, and it probably will include recommendations that describe specific commercial products,\u201d Jack said. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association is committed to the development of trustworthy clinical practice guidelines \u201cand other types of evidence-based guidance informing clinical decision-making at the individual, health system, and population levels,\u201d spokesperson Niles Franz said. \u201cA core criterion for trustworthy guidelines, as defined by the National Academy of Medicine, involves collaboration between an organizing body and panels of clinical and subject-matter experts who are minimally conflicted both intellectually and financially,\u201d Franz said in a statement. \u201cTo that end, the Association recently established rules for collecting [conflict of interest] disclosures from guideline panel nominees, criteria for evaluating these forms and selecting panel members, and process for managing existing and new conflicts during and after guideline development,\u201d he said. Franz said the association hopes to have the new clinical guidelines ready for publication by 2025. In the meantime, Widera and others say the decision to take one of the new amyloid-clearing drugs is highly personal and one that should be made in close collaboration with a physician. \u201cThere is, I would say, probably more controversy around these guidelines than there are about the drugs themselves,\u201d Widera said. Widera says he hopes that in the next round of guidelines, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association will consider the risks involved. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to broaden the definition of what a disease is, you should also say what is the risk and harm of doing so,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/alzheimers-association-criteria/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_bird-flu-fourth-human-case-in-us", "text": "A fourth person in the United States has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak among dairy cattle across the country. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Wednesday that it has identified the state\u2019s first human case of H5 avian influenza associated with the multistate outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle. This case is the fourth identified nationally in connection to the outbreak; two other human cases have been reported in Michigan and one in Texas. More than a quarter of dairy herds in Colorado have reported cases of bird flu, according to data from the state health department. As of Wednesday, federal\u00a0data\u00a0shows that seven states have confirmed cases in the past 30 days, and 40% of them are in Colorado \u2014 more than any other state. The infected person in Colorado had mild symptoms, reporting only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as a symptom, according to state health officials. He worked at a dairy farm in northeast Colorado and had direct exposure to dairy cattle infected with avian flu. After testing positive,\u00a0the man was treated immediately with the antiviral medication oseltamivir, and he has recovered, according to the state health department. \u201cThe risk to most people remains low. Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,\u201d Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist at the CDPHE, said in Wednesday\u2019s announcement. The last human case of\u00a0H5N1 in Colorado was in 2022\u00a0in a person who was exposed to infected poultry. In the current outbreak connected to infected dairy cattle, the first two human cases identified in the United States also reported eye-related symptoms and eye infections or conjunctivitis. The third human case in the US reported more respiratory symptoms, such as cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes. None of those three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission of the virus. On the national level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that it continues to monitor the situation carefully, using its flu surveillance systems to watch for H5N1 activity in people. The agency said Wednesday that the human case in Colorado \u201cdoes not change CDC\u2019s current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.\u201d However, the case \u201cunderscores the importance of\u00a0recommended precautions\u00a0in people with exposure to infected animals,\u201d according to the CDC. \u201cPeople with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.\u201d The CDC repeatedly\u00a0has recommended\u00a0that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. CDC officials said Tuesday that the United States has enough H5 bird flu tests to respond to the outbreak. \u201cWe have an ample number of H5-specific tests in the public health system for the current outbreak. As of right now, there are roughly 750,000 H5-specific tests available today and another 1.2 million such tests coming online in the next two to three months,\u201d Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cThis is on top of a robust supply of influenza A tests, the general tests that are available at doctor\u2019s offices around the country,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThe way that our system works is such that if someone tests positive for influenza A at the doctor\u2019s office, their specimen is sent to a public health laboratory for what\u2019s called subtyping. That tells us if the influenza A virus is a common seasonal one, or a rarer version like H5N1. That subtyping happens more commonly than you might think.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/bird-flu-fourth-human-case-in-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk", "text": "GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy may help lower the risk of certain cancers, a new study suggests. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting 13 types of cancer, and the risk increases the longer a person is overweight and the more excess weight they gain. About 40% of new cancer diagnoses are associated with excess weight, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, there were about 170 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people, CDC data shows. But a study published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with a class of GLP-1 drugs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with 10 of the 13 obesity-associated cancers than those who were taking insulin. The risk was cut by more than half for gallbladder cancer, meningioma, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, a kind of liver cancer. It was also significantly reduced for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and kidney cancer. Excess weight can cause changes in the body such as long-lasting inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones that can cause cancer, according to the CDC. And GLP-1 medications interact with systems related to insulin production. The new findings that link GLP-1 treatment to reduced risk of some cancers \u201ccompare favorably\u201d with similar effects linked to intensive lifestyle intervention and metabolic-bariatric surgery that have been found in other trials, the study authors wrote. However, the research found that GLP-1 treatment was not associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, which CDC data shows is the most common type of cancer associated with obesity. Risk was also not reduced for stomach cancer or thyroid cancer. In fact, other research has found that GLP-1s may interact with the body\u2019s insulin production in ways that negatively affect the thyroid, and the study authors note that patients should be aware of potential thyroid-related risks that are included on the medication\u2019s packaging. The new study also found that the risk of cancer diagnosis for people with type 2 diabetes was not different among those who were treated with GLP-1s compared with those where were being treated with metformin. In fact, the risk of diagnosis with kidney cancer was higher among those using GLP-1s than those on metformin. For this study, researchers from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and the MetroHealth System analyzed more than a decade of medical records for nearly 1.7 million people with type 2 diabetes. More information is needed about how reduced cancer risk may relate to the scale of weight loss, but the findings provide \u201cpreliminary evidence of the potential benefit of GLP-1RAs for cancer prevention in high-risk populations and support further preclinical and clinical studies,\u201d the study authors wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_health_multiple-alarms-wake-up-sleep-wellness", "text": "Let\u2019s say you need to wake up by 7 a.m. to get to work on time. So you set your first smartphone alarm for 6:30 a.m., your second at 6:45 a.m. and your third at 6:55 a.m. to avoid the snooze button. And you throw in 7:05 a.m. just to be cautious. Does this sound familiar? If you are clogging your clock app with all those morning alarms, you\u2019re setting yourself up for a groggy morning, experts say. Hitting the snooze button for increments of nine minutes of sleep at a time does the same thing, said Dr. Brandon Peters, a neurologist and sleep medicine physician with Virginia Mason Franciscan Health in Seattle. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying in the moment to hit the snooze and delay getting out of bed and starting the day, but it does actually fragment and undermine that sleep quality,\u201d Peters said. For the last hours of sleep, people usually go in and out of the fourth and last stage of the sleep cycle, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This stage is particularly important for memory processing and creative thinking, he added. Having that stage of sleep fragmented could impact that brain function. He recommends setting one alarm, allowing for deep sleep to continue uninterrupted until you need to wake up in the morning. Here\u2019s how to train your mind and body to get out of bed after that first alarm goes off. Why do I have trouble getting up in the morning? Certain sleep disorders could be causing someone to have trouble waking up in the morning to one alarm, such as sleep inertia, which causes a difficult transition out of sleep, said Dr. Cathy Goldstein, a sleep medicine physician at the Michigan Medicine Sleep Disorders Centers. That may result in someone unknowingly turning off and snoozing alarms when first woken up. Most of the time, however,\u00a0someone who needs multiple alarms to wake up in the morning is sleep deprived, she said. First, try to get to any underlying issues that could be causing this problem, Goldstein noted. \u201cNumber one: are you actually getting the sleep you need? Not the amount of sleep you think you should get or that you want to get, but the amount of sleep that you actually need. And are you getting that on a nightly basis?\u201d asked Goldstein, who is also a clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Most adults need around\u00a0seven to nine hours\u00a0of sleep a night, but it does take time to figure out how much sleep you need. Goldstein recommends students use summer break to find how many hours of sleep they get naturally after a few weeks. For others, a long vacation could provide some helpful answers. Another reason someone may battle the alarm clock every morning is that they\u2019re naturally a night owl, but their work schedule calls for an early bird, said Dr. Alicia Roth, a clinician at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Sleep Disorders Center in Ohio. \u201cIn an ideal world, we would go to bed when we\u2019re sleepy, and we would wake up when we wake up. That is not the world we live in.\u201d But\u00a0there are ways to gradually shift your body clock and\u00a0make early mornings easier, she added. How to wake up to one alarm If you have to wake up at 7 a.m., and the alarm starts at 6 a.m., you are getting an hour of bad-quality sleep, instead of just sleeping through until 7 a.m, Roth said. While setting just one alarm is best, it might be hard to wake up to only one after using multiple alarms as your safety net, she added. Roth recommends testing out different alarm clocks, such as one that utilizes light or an alarm that makes you get out of bed to turn it off. Getting 15 to 30 minutes of sunlight in the morning can also help shift the internal body clock and is particularly important for those who are natural night owls, said Peters, author of the new book \u201cThe Sleep Apnea Hypothesis.\u201d It is also important to wake up and go to sleep around the same times each day, Goldstein said. \u201cIf you\u2019re somebody who sleeps really well from 3 a.m. to noon, and that\u2019s how you sleep on the weekends, but on Monday morning, you have to wake up at 6 a.m. to commute,\u201d that will be hard, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s earlier than your biology is prepared to wake up, and it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get up.\u201d Goldstein recommends shifting bedtime 30 minutes earlier every few days, or an hour earlier once a week for those looking to change their biological clocks. Avoiding harsh lights and limiting screen time up to four hours before bed can also help promote the body\u2019s natural melatonin production, she added. If someone finds they have woken up before their alarm goes off, Peters doesn\u2019t recommend checking the time, because doing so could make it difficult to fall back asleep if they start to worry about the sleep time they have left or the day ahead of them. Instead, Peters recommends trying to fall back asleep until it feels as though 15 to 20 minutes have passed. If you\u2019re still awake, then you can check the time and decide if you want to get up for the day, he added. \u201cIf it\u2019s close to your normal wake time, you might start your day a little early. If it\u2019s in the middle of the night, you might go off and do something quiet, like read, and then come back to bed when you\u2019re feeling more drowsy or sleepy.\u201d While some may be able to naturally wake up without using an alarm, it is not a realistic goal for everyone, particularly those who experience sleep inertia, or have naturally later biological clocks, Goldstein said. \u201cWe never want to sleep shame people,\u201d she said. \u201cIn medicine, and in public health we operate on averages a lot of the time, what\u2019s best for the most. But there are these biological differences, and we want to make sure that everybody is optimizing their sleep the best that they can.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/multiple-alarms-wake-up-sleep-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_how-to-do-hammer-curls-wellness", "text": "While there is no magic bullet for gaining strength, variety is key. To that end, although classic bicep curls often take center stage for building arm strength, another arm exercise deserves attention in your workouts: the hammer curl. This powerful movement not only builds impressive arm muscles but also enhances overall body strength, function, stability and resiliency. Hammer curls are a variation of regular bicep curls. Like their traditional counterpart, one of the primary muscles targeted by hammer curls include the biceps brachii, the muscle best known as \u201cthe bicep.\u201d However, hammer curls also emphasize two other arm muscles: the brachialis, a muscle beneath the biceps brachii that helps support the elbow joint, and the brachioradialis, a forearm muscle that enhances grip strength. Aptly named, hammer curls mimic the action of holding and using a hammer. Unlike regular bicep curls, which use a palms-up grip, hammer curls are performed with a neutral grip with palms facing each other. This simple adjustment shifts the muscle focus for more comprehensive strength development. This variation also decreases wrist and elbow strain, reducing the risk of overuse injuries and making it a safer option for those with joint concerns. The everyday functional benefits of hammer curls Despite their somewhat obscure reputation, hammer curls aren\u2019t just for gym enthusiasts. This exercise can benefit anyone wanting to improve their ability to perform the physical tasks of daily living. Here\u2019s a detailed list of benefits: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Because the neutral hand position needed to perform hammer curls boosts forearm and grip strength, it also boosts your ability to hold and lift heavier weights to make greater total-body strength gains in other exercises, as well as enhanced performance in other fitness and sport activities. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Hammer curls build arm and hand muscles needed for daily activities that require lifting, holding, and carrying, such as caring for children and performing household tasks and yard work. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Enhanced grip strength also helps with opening jars, using tools and completing basic household tasks, making hammer curls particularly beneficial for older adults trying to maintain functional independence. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 The controlled motion and neutral grip of hammer curls help strengthen the muscles and tendons around the elbow and wrist joints, reducing the risk of common injuries associated with weaker muscles and improper lifting techniques. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 With less wrist rotation than traditional curls, hammer curls minimize the risk of injury, especially for those people with previous wrist or elbow issues. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Performing hammer curls correctly involves significant core engagement, which improves balance and overall strength. \u2022\u00a0Bonus: For anyone wanting more visibly toned arms, hammer curls build up the brachialis muscle, which underlies the primary biceps brachii muscle and boosts muscle visibility even when your arms are not flexed. How to perform hammer curls To reap the full benefits of hammer curls, it is crucial to perform them with proper form and an appropriate weight for your fitness level. Use a weight that feels challenging but is light enough that you can comfortably perform at least eight repetitions of the exercise with good form. Be sure to mind the cues for how to breathe as you perform this exercise, exhaling as you lift the weights and inhaling as you lower them. Proper breathing mechanics help maintain and strengthen core stability to ensure correct form. 1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells at your sides with your palms facing inward in a neutral grip. Alternatively, you can be seated as long you can sit forward enough on the seat edge for the dumbbells to hang unobstructed at your sides. 2. Exhale as you slowly curl both dumbbells up toward your shoulders, keeping your elbows close to your torso and your core braced to remain stable. Pause slightly at the top of the movement. 3. Inhale as you lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent. Take your time, lowering your arms gradually, as the eccentric (lowering) phase is a crucial part of the exercise. 4. Repeat for 8 to 12 reps with good form. 5. Complete two to three sets of your desired number of repetitions, resting for at least one to two minutes in between sets. Optional variation: If you feel more comfortable lifting one arm at a time rather than both together, you can alternate right and left repetitions within each set to perform a total of 16 to 24 reps (8 to 12 reps on each arm) per set. To maintain proper form and decrease risk of injury, avoid these common mistakes: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swinging the dumbbells to use momentum to lift them rather than bracing through your core and relying on your arm strength \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Losing proper arm position and letting your elbows flare out \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using dumbbells that are too heavy or too light \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neglecting the eccentric (lowering) phase and dropping the weights too quickly \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Forgetting to breathe properly and maintain core stability As you begin feeling stronger in the exercise, you can progress by increasing the weight of your dumbbells or the number of repetitions within the 8 to 12 rep range. You may find that when you initially increase the weight, you need to decrease your reps to maintain good form. That is OK provided you can still perform a minimum of eight reps properly. Getting the most out of this new exercise To maximize the benefits of hammer curls, you need to integrate them into your fitness program a couple times per week. Hammer curls fit well into both arm-specific and full-body workout days. They can be alternated with other bicep and tricep exercises for a comprehensive arm workout or included in a circuit that features a mix of upper and lower body exercises. Remember, hammer curls are more than just an alternative to bicep curls. By incorporating this exercise into your routine, you can significantly enhance not only your arm strength but also your functional abilities essential for daily activities and overall improvement of total-body strength and resiliency for years to come.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/how-to-do-hammer-curls-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_lilly-azheimers-donanemab-fda", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Donanemab, made by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly, works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Lilly said it will be sold under the name Kisunla and would cost $695 per vial before insurance, what would amount to $12,522 for a six-month course or about $32,000 for a year, depending on when the patient would complete their treatment. Donanemab is not a cure, but clinical trials showed that it slowed the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s, allowing people to live independent lives for longer and safely participate in everyday activities. Lilly told\u00a0a committee of FDA advisers in June that\u00a0late-stage clinical research data\u00a0showed \u201chighly meaningful results\u201d for people who took donanemab, with about 35% lower risk of progression of the disease over a year and a half compared with those who got a placebo. The FDA advisers\u00a0voted\u00a0that the treatment appeared safe and effective. Although rare, there were some serious adverse events during the drug trial, Lilly told the committee, occurring in only 2% of patients. The participants who took donanemab had a slightly higher mortality rate: 2%, compared with 1.7% in the placebo arm of the trial. Three people died while taking the drug after developing ARIA, micro-hemorrhages known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Because most of the ARIA\u00a0incidents came in the first six weeks of the trial, Lilly told the FDA advisers that it added another MRI exam to the trial before giving second doses in order to detect people with asymptomatic ARIA. If it was detected, providers would pause treatment so it could resolve and not become more serious or symptomatic. Kisunla is not the first monoclonal antibody treatment approved to treat early Alzheimer\u2019s. Eisai and Biogen\u2019s\u00a0lecanemab, sold as Leqembi, is already being used. Another drug by Biogen, aducanumab, sold as Aduhelm, in 2021 became the first such therapy to get accelerated FDA approval, but\u00a0the company said\u00a0it will stop making it by the\u00a0end of this year\u00a0as it shifts resources to its other Alzheimer\u2019s drug. In trials of Leqembi, the drug that\u2019s already on the market, some participants also had ARIA, but it was at a lower rate than seen in the donanemab trial. Leqembi has also\u00a0been tied\u00a0to patient deaths. Kisunla was approved with instructions that prescribers can consider stopping the patient\u2019s treatment if they see improvement based on brain scans. The potential to complete the treatment after a limited course of therapy, Lilly said, could lower out-of-pocket costs. Kisunla otherwise costs more than Leqembi, which runs about $26,500 per year. Lilly said Tuesday that because the medicines work best in the early symptomatic stage of the disease, it\u2019s working with others to improve early detection and diagnosis. \u201cEach year, more and more people are at risk for this disease, and we are determined to make life better for them,\u201d said Anne White, executive vice president and president of Lilly Neuroscience. One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia,\u00a0according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, killing more people than prostate and breast cancer combined. Successful treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s can\u2019t come fast enough,\u00a0advocates for patients say, and could be a big help to a growing number of people who are predicted to develop the disease. The number of people projected to have Alzheimer\u2019s is predicted to grow to nearly 14 million by 2060,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0As of 2023,\u00a0about 6.7 million Americans 65 and older  live with Alzheimer\u2019s. The disease doesn\u2019t just affect patients. More than 11 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias in 2022 alone,\u00a0research\u00a0shows,\u00a0while there has been an\u00a0ongoing shortage of paid workers and medical professionals. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association said Tuesday that it was celebrating the announcement of the approval of the treatment. \u201cThis is real progress. Today\u2019s approval allows people more options and greater opportunity to have more time,\u201d Dr. Joanne Pike, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said in a news release. \u201cHaving multiple treatment options is the kind of advancement we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2014 all of us who have been touched, even blindsided, by this difficult and devastating disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/lilly-azheimers-donanemab-fda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_health_parents-kids-screen-time-wellness", "text": "Whether it\u2019s\u00a0lockboxes\u00a0or\u00a0control apps, parents have searched far and wide for ways to reduce their child\u2019s screen time. A new\u00a0study\u00a0suggests that the answer may lie in the parent\u2019s own screen habits. Using a phone in front of your child can have more of an effect than you might think. The study, published this month in\u00a0the journal Pediatric Research, shows that parents\u2019 screen use is associated with increased adolescent screen time \u2013 along with problematic social media, video game and mobile phone use. Problematic use can include addictive behaviors such as withdrawal, building tolerance, relapse and obsessive thoughts, which may disrupt daily functioning, according to the study. The researchers analyzed data from the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, involving over 10,000 families with 12- and 13-year-olds. The data revealed that\u00a072.9% of parents said they use screens around their adolescents. This is a huge predictor of a child\u2019s screen use, according to Dr. Jason Nagata, lead study author and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. When a child sees their parent using a screen, experts say, they are likely to mimic the behavior. Surveyed parents rated their agreement with statements such as \u201cWhen I am with my child, I use a screen-based device\u201d on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Each point increase was associated with a nearly 40-minute rise in their children\u2019s screen time. \u201cEven if parents think their kids are not paying attention, the data shows one of the biggest predictors of preteen screen use is what their parents do with screens in front of them,\u201d Nagata said. Dr. Ken Ginsburg, a professor of pediatrics at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who was not involved in the study, added that parents are role models for their children 24/7. \u201cOur actions can speak so loudly that kids can\u2019t hear the words we are saying. Practicing what we preach makes all the difference,\u201d he said. Using screen time as a reward or consequence might also be counterproductive, increasing usage.\u00a0Preteens, who may be increasingly turning to social media for support and identity exploration, can view these parenting practices as intrusive, leading to rejection of rules, according to the study. \u201cWhen parents are overly controlling, it backfires,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cKids watch what we do and don\u2019t like to be controlled. When kids perceive we set rules to control them, they always go around those rules.\u201d The screen age Children\u2019s average daily screen time more than doubled during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to\u00a0previous research, and some nations are grappling with how to curb the potential negative effects. Regulators in China have\u00a0proposed\u00a0a two-hour daily limit on phone time for minors. In the US, the surgeon general has\u00a0called\u00a0for warning labels on social media apps to mitigate \u201csignificant harms\u201d associated with their use. \u201cScreen use is on the rise for everyone,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cWhile screens in themselves are not inherently bad \u2026 teenagers are particularly vulnerable to excessive use.\u201d Specifically, screen overuse reduces the essential sleep time and quality needed for a kid\u2019s healthy development, according to Nagata and previous research. Beyond role modeling, open communication and creating a media plan are effective strategies for balanced screen use, according to the study and guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Family Media Plan. Dr. Susan Tomopoulos, co-developer of the plan and an associate professor of pediatrics at NYU\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine who was not part of the new study, said the increased pandemic screen times were an impetus for the academy to update its media recommendations. \u201cAfter the pandemic, parents were turning to doctors because they wanted to manage their family\u2019s media habits,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they were overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know where to start.\u201d Setting up healthy media practices begins with a family conversation to customize screen time guidelines and outline screen-free zones around the house, according to the academy. This is especially important in the bedroom and dining room, where screen presence is associated with higher adolescent screen time and problematic social, video game and mobile phone use, the study found. Prioritizing screen-free activities and face-to-face time is crucial for a child\u2019s healthy development, according to Tomopoulos. \u201cIt is so easy for adults, as well as kids, to get caught up in swiping and scrolling. We really want entire families to check their digital habits at home \u2026 and to talk early and often about technology media,\u201d she added. How to have a conversation with your child Initiating a productive discussion on media use starts with conveying to the child, \u201cI set rules because I care,\u201d according to Ginsburg, who is also co-founder and program director of the\u00a0Center for Parent and Teen Communication. \u201cOne of the biggest myths is that teenagers do not care what their parents say. When we set rules, it is important we communicate why,\u201d he said. \u201cThe baseline should be \u2018I care about you, and therefore blank,\u2019 instead of \u2018don\u2019t do blank.\u2019 \u201d The conversation may end with an agreement on certain principles such as establishing a \u201cone screen at a time\u201d rule and limiting screens at mealtime, bedtime and study time, as\u00a0recommended\u00a0by the American Academy of Pediatrics. As the ABCD Study continues to follow participants into adulthood, research into the long-term effects of excessive adolescent screen use is also unfolding. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot more guidance for parents to help their children navigate social media,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cThe goal is to give children the skills to develop healthy screen behaviors for their young adulthood and beyond.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story spelled Dr. Ken Ginsburg\u2019s name incorrectly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/parents-kids-screen-time-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
