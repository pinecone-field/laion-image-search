Our bodies produce many different unusual, sometimes repellent secretions, and their function doesn\u2019t always seem entirely clear. But each has their own important role, which often goes unappreciated. Flaky or dry scalp is an extremely common condition, but in severe cases it certainly doesn\u2019t feel trivial. Put aside notions that it\u2019s a factor of poor hygiene \u2014 the underlying cause is not completely clear, but it may be exacerbated by hair care regimes that dry or irritate the scalp. What is known is that flakes of dandruff are made up of cell complexes, arising from sloughed off skin. The outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is composed in part of dead cells that act as an\u00a0essential protective barrier. Dead cells shed more easily and will be replaced with new ones as skin constantly regenerates and grows. If this happens at too great a rate, the result is dandruff. The first measure is to try an over-the-counter, anti-dandruff shampoo. These contain antifungal and anti-inflammatory compounds both understood to have dandruff-healing properties since fungi and inflammation are believed to be potential factors in the development of a crusty scalp. These compounds \u2014 selenium and coal tar for instance \u2014 can also help relieve the symptoms of itch that may often prove worse than the flaking. It\u2019s worthwhile trying a different formula if the first doesn\u2019t work. Certain conditions such as\u00a0psoriasis\u00a0and eczema can also be the underlying cause and may require alternative treatment. Scabs may be unsightly \u2014 but they function beautifully Scabs are the body\u2019s natural response to being wounded. Cuts, punctures or breaks in the skin open up blood vessels to the atmosphere around us. In response, the bloodstream recruits its clotting agents \u2014 the platelets \u2014 to help plug the gap. Platelets bring blood cells together to form a clot, creating a bung to stop bleeding and prevent bacteria shifting from the skin into the circulation, where they can do more damage. When the clot dries out, a scab is formed. Scabs can look horrible, but don\u2019t worry \u2013\u2014 they\u2019re meant to. Sometimes pus forms, which can give scabs a yellow rather than reddish-brown color and might suggest that an infection is brewing.\u00a0Redness of the uninjured skin\u00a0around and tracking away from the scab is another telltale sign of possible infection, too. Resist the temptation to pick off a scab from the skin, no matter how tempting it may seem. Scabs may be unsightly, or itchy, but they\u2019re performing the job they\u2019re supposed to \u2014 keeping out bugs and allowing wounds to heal. Take good care of them instead, by keeping them untouched and clean, and wait for them to shed themselves. READ MORE: Is hot yoga good for you? Exploring the science behind the sweat The eyes have it Sleep sand. Eye bogies. Doze dust. The debris we find in the corners of our eyes each morning goes by many different names. Few of us know exactly what it is, why it\u2019s there, or its scientific name, rheum. Tears lubricate the exposed surface of the eyes, stopping them from getting dry and sore. They also hose away grit and dust and have\u00a0natural antibacterial properties\u00a0to fight infections. But our eyes make more than just tears. The lids have many little glands that discharge\u00a0natural oily substances\u00a0allowing tears to spread evenly across the eye and prevent them evaporating away. In addition,\u00a0mucus-secreting glands, much like those in the nose that make snot, make a thin mucus that also helps to trap and eliminate rogue particles. In large amounts, oil and mucus can irritate the eyes but normally get swept away by tears and blinking during the day. By night, our eyes remain shut, and rheum builds up. Whether they take on the appearance of sticky bogies or crusts depends on how dry they get overnight, and may be proportional to how long you sleep. READ MORE: Why do my armpits smell? (Ear) waxing lyrical Earwax is a largely invisible entity \u2014 more often felt than seen. Notice a feeling of blocked or congested ears, or a smothered sense of hearing, and the wax in your ears might be becoming problematic. It also has a clinical name \u2014 cerumen. In part,\u00a0it\u2019s made of oils and sweat\u00a0from glands lining the ear canal. The majority of earwax though is keratin, the natural protein that toughens skin, hair and nails. This is because the\u00a0ear canal is lined with skin, all the way up to the eardrum. In mixing with the secretions, shed skin produces a waxy substance ranging in colors across the brown spectrum. Fresh, healthy earwax tends to be yellow to honey-brown in color, whereas older, thicker earwax becomes darker brown, sometimes even black. Notice red or green staining? Then blood or bacteria may be mixing with the wax. Among other diagnoses, this raises the possibility of an ear infection, especially if there\u2019s also a runny or foul-smelling discharge. Like many of the other bodily secretions, cerumen also traps debris and other nasties (even insects) that could irritate or damage the delicate eardrum. But problems arise if the wax builds up or hardens too much, blocking conduction of sound to the drum, and dampening your hearing. Nothing smaller than an index finger (with well-trimmed nails) should ever go in your ear canal. Stop cleaning with cotton buds, too. All this does is compress cerumen into little impacted cakes. Instead, medicinal olive oil from the pharmacy can help soften it down,\u00a0making it easier for the ear to clear it naturally. Blood, sweat and tears \u2014 and wax, skin and mucus \u2014 can cause many commonplace issues. But look beyond these minor ailments and be grateful that they\u2019re there. You\u2019d be sorry if they weren\u2019t.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Two teams of scientists have discovered a theoretically habitable planet, smaller than Earth but bigger than Venus, orbiting a small star about 40 light-years away. The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said. But though the exoplanet could potentially be habitable for humans and is relatively \u201cnear\u201d our solar system in astronomical terms, it is unlikely that anyone will visit there soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not reachable, it\u2019s 12 parsecs away,\u201d said Palethorpe, adding that it would take about 225,000 years to reach Gliese 12b with the fastest spacecraft that currently exist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_08_23_health_avian-flu-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds.   There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called \u201cInfluenza A (H5N1),\u201d or the \u201cH5N1 virus.\u201d Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces.  Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia.   The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu.

{"id": "2023_01_09_health_live-longer-diet-wellness", "text": "You can reduce your risk of an early death for any reason by nearly 20%, just by eating more foods from your choice of four healthy eating patterns, according to a new study. People who more carefully followed any of the healthy eating patterns \u2014 which all share a focus on consuming more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes \u2014 were also less likely to die from cancer, cardiovascular illness, and respiratory and neurodegenerative disease.  The results of the study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, show \u201cthere is more than one way to eat well and derive the attendant health benefits,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a lifestyle medicine specialist who was not involved in the study. People often get bored with one way of eating, study coauthor Dr. Frank Hu said, \u201cso this is good news. It means that we have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating our own healthy dietary patterns that can be tailored to individual food preferences, health conditions and cultures. \u201cFor example, if you are eating healthy Mediterranean, and after a few months you want to try something different, you can switch to a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet or you can switch to a semi-vegetarian diet,\u201d said Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology and chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cOr you can follow US dietary guidelines and create your own healthy eating plate.\u201d A long-term study The study followed the eating habits of 75,000 women participating in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and more than 44,000 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study over 36 years. None of the men and women had cardiovascular disease at the start of the study, and few were smokers. All filled out eating questionnaires every four years. \u201cThis is one of the largest and longest-running cohort studies to examine recommended dietary patterns and the long-term risk of premature deaths and deaths from major diseases,\u201d Hu said. Hu and his team scored participants on how closely they followed four healthy eating styles that are in sync with current US dietary guidelines.  One is the Mediterranean diet, which stresses eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish and a high amount of olive oil, Hu said. \u201cThis dietary pattern emphasizes healthy fats, especially monounsaturated fat, in addition to plant-based foods and moderate alcohol,\u201d he said. The next is called the healthful plant-based diet, which also focuses on eating more plant products but gives negative points for all animal products and any alcohol. \u201cIt even discourages relatively healthy options, like fish or some dairy products,\u201d Hu said, adding that the eating plan frowns on unhealthy plant-based foods such as potato products. \u201cSo you can imagine that vegetarians are probably on the higher end of this diet score,\u201d he said, \u201cand people who eat a lot of animal products or highly processed carbohydrate foods would be at the lower end of this score.\u201d The Healthy Eating Index tracks whether people follow basic US nutritional guidelines, which stress healthy, plant-based foods, frown on red and processed meat, and discourage eating added sugar, unhealthy fats and alcohol, Hu said. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index was developed at Harvard, Hu said, and uses the \u201cbest available evidence\u201d to include foods and nutrients most strongly associated with a lower risk of chronic disease. \u201cWe explicitly included nuts, seeds, whole grains and lower consumption of red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages,\u201d he added. \u201cA moderate consumption of alcohol is allowed.\u201d  Findings by disease After each person\u2019s eating pattern was scored, the participants were divided into five groups, or quintiles, from highest to lowest adherence to one or more of the eating patterns.  \u201cThe highest quintile of diet quality as compared to the lowest was associated with a roughly 20% reduction in all-cause mortality,\u201d said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. The study also found reductions in risk of death from certain chronic diseases if people improved their diet over time, Hu said. Participants who improved the health of their diet by 25% could reduce their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by a range of 6% to 13% and dying from cancer by 7% to 18%, he said. There was up to a 7% reduction in risk of death by neurodegenerative disease, such as dementia. \u201cRespiratory disease mortality reduction was actually much greater, reducing risk by 35% to 46%,\u201d Hu said. The study relied on participants\u2019 self-reports of food preferences and therefore only showed an association, not a direct cause and effect, between eating habits and health outcomes. Still, the fact that the study asked about diets every four years over such a long time frame added weight to the findings, Hu said. What is the takeaway of this large, long-term study? \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to adopt healthy eating patterns, and the benefits of eating a healthy diet can be substantial in terms of reducing total premature deaths and different causes of premature death,\u201d Hu said. \u201cPeople also have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating their own healthy dietary pattern. But the common principles \u2014 eating more-plant based foods and fewer servings of red meat, processed meats, added sugar and sodium \u2014 should be there, no matter what kind of diet that you want to create.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/01/09/health/live-longer-diet-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

Juul said Thursday its products will remain on the market during scientific review. On Thursday, the FDA said court decisions since then \u201cestablish new case law and inform the FDA\u2019s approach to product review to maintain the agency\u2019s commitment to issuing final decisions that are appropriate on both the scientific merits and the law.\u201d In 2022, the FDA\u00a0issued a marketing ban on Juul products, including devices and tobacco and menthol-flavored pods. The marketing denial order was stayed weeks later as \u201cscientific issues warranted additional review,\u201d but had not been rescinded. Juul appealed the decision and the products stayed on store shelves pending the appeal. Recission of the marketing ban \u201cis not an authorization or a denial and does not indicate whether the applications are likely to be authorized or denied,\u201d the FDA said Thursday. \u201cThe agency\u2019s continued review does not alter the fact that all e-cigarette products, including those made by JUUL, are required by law to have FDA authorization to be legally marketed.\u201d As of the end of May, the FDA says it has only authorized 23 e-cigarette products and devices after the products have undergone what the FDA says is \u201crigorous scientific review\u201d that includes toxicologic assessments. To get the green light, the products must also be appropriate by the FDA\u2019s product standard. In a statement, Juul said it\u00a0looks forward to \u201cre-engaging with the agency on a science- and evidence-based process to pursue a marketing authorization for JUUL products.\u201d The American Lung Association said on Thursday that it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the FDA\u2019s decision. \u201cThe Lung Association is deeply troubled that the marketing denial orders for Juul have been rescinded and urge FDA to issue marketing denial orders for all of its products. Juul is largely responsible for the youth e-cigarette epidemic from 2017-2019. These products and its manufacturer clearly do not meet the standard for protecting the public health. FDA must\u00a0follow the law and not permit any Juul product or other tobacco product to be sold in the U.S. prior to it receiving a premarket authorization,\u201d said Erika Sward, the association\u2019s assistant vice president of nationwide advocacy, in a statement. Juul has remained one of the most popular e-cigarette products on the market and are also among the most popular with young people. For the past decade, the FDA and US Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s annual National Youth Tobacco Survey has found that in general e-cigarettes are the most popular tobacco products among young people. In a statement, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids cited the popularity of the brand and said, \u201cthe FDA\u2019s continuing delays in reviewing Juul\u2019s marketing applications are unacceptable and harmful to America\u2019s kids.\u201d \u201cThe FDA should swiftly finish its review and again deny marketing applications for all Juul products given Juul\u2019s primary role in causing the youth e-cigarette epidemic and the continuing popularity of Juul\u2019s products among youth,\u201d Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids CEO and president Yolonda Richardson said in part in the statement. \u201cThere is no question that Juul fueled this epidemic by introducing a sleek, easy-to-hide product that was sold in appealing flavors including menthol, marketed in ways that appeal to kids, and delivered massive doses of nicotine that can quickly addict kids. Juul\u2019s history shows that its products are highly appealing to kids, and it cannot be trusted to act responsibly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/juul-vaping-products-fda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

On Monday, vaccine maker Moderna announced positive late-stage trial results for its Covid-flu combination vaccine it calls mRNA-1083. Calling the outcome of the late-stage trial \u201cbreakthrough results,\u201d Moderna\u2019s Chief Medical Affairs Officer Francesca Ceddia told CNN that people in the trial who got mRNA-1083 showed an improved immune response compared with those who got the standalone flu and Covid vaccines that are available now. The results were true even for people in the trial who were 65 years and older. Generally, older people don\u2019t mount as robust a response to vaccines as younger people do. \u201cWhen we think about the combination vaccine, we often only think about the element of convenience, one shot instead of two, but what is really, really breakthrough is the fact that you not only offer that advantage, you also offer the proof of clinical benefit. I think this is the most important message,\u201d Ceddia said. Other companies have been testing a combined Covid-flu vaccine, but Moderna is the first to announce positive late-stage trial results. Public health leaders say the world could use more ways to protect people from both viruses. Millions of people get sick with the flu and now Covid every year. For the last flu season, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 35 to 64 million people got sick with the flu in the United States. Between 390,000 and 810,000 people were so sick they were hospitalized and up to 71,000 people died. Just for last fall and winter,\u00a0Covid sent more than a half-million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000, according to data presented last week to the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s independent vaccine advisers, who were discussing how to update Covid vaccines for the fall. Moderna\u2019s Phase 3 trial was a randomized, observer-blind, active control study, meaning that even the clinicians giving the shots didn\u2019t know who got which vaccines.\u00a0The trial studied the vaccine in two different age groups with about 4,000 adults in each age category. For one part of the study, Moderna compared the immune reaction of adults 65 and older who got mRNA-1083 and another group with the same age range who got a co-administered Covid-19 vaccine, Moderna\u2019s Spikevax, and an enhanced flu vaccine, Fluzone HD. Doctors recommend seniors get more powerful flu vaccines due to their inhibited immune systems. For the other part of the trial, researchers compared how slightly younger adults, ages 50 to 64, did when they got the mRNA-1083 vaccine to another group within the same age range who got Spikevax and a standard dose flu vaccine called Fluarix. Study results showed that in both age groups, the experimental combination vaccine elicited a statistically significant higher immune response against three strains of the flu and against Covid-19, compared with the co-administered shots. \u201cThe titers are significantly higher,\u201d Ceddia said. \u201cThis is better actually.\u201d A titer is a lab test that measures the number of antibodies in the blood and it can be used to prove how immune someone is to the disease. In terms of safety, the combined vaccine was well-tolerated, Moderna said, and the adverse reactions were similar to what people experienced with the co-administered vaccines. The most common complaints were pain at the injection site, tiredness, muscle pain and headaches. The study isn\u2019t peer-reviewed yet, but Moderna said it plans to present data from this late-stage trial at an upcoming medical conference and it will also submit the trial for publication. Moderna also said it will talk to the FDA about possible next steps. \u201cWe need to engage with regulators but our aspiration is to have it approved for fall 2025,\u201d Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel told CNN. Sue Peschin, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Aging Research, a nonprofit dedicated to improving aging and health that encourages more equitable access to vaccines, said a combined shot could be a significant help to public health. In addition to intensifying vaccine hesitancy in the US, people have developed a kind of vaccine fatigue  after the pandemic, Peschin said. Peschin pointed to the drop in the uptake in standard vaccines such as the MMR vaccine, as well as in seasonal vaccines. Few people got the latest Covid shot, studies show. Only about 25% of the eligible population has received the latest Covid-19 vaccine, according to a presentation to the FDA last week. Many more adults got the flu shot with nearly half of the adult population getting one last season, according to the CDC, a number that was slightly higher than the year before. \u201cWe want to see that go up and if there\u2019s a way to do that by combining the vaccines, then that\u2019s better for everyone because it helps protect everyone in the community,\u201d Peschin said. \u201cWe would love to see the combination vaccines come to market if the FDA deems them safe and effective.\u201d CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/moderna-covid-flu-combination-vaccine-positive-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_health_mdma-ptsd-fda-advisers", "text": "A federal advisory committee on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly against of the use of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. The novel treatment has the potential to transform a field with significant need, but the committee had concerns about the integrity of the particular trials up for review. After hearing presentations from the US Food and Drug Administration, treatment sponsor Lykos Therapeutics and members of the public, the independent committee voted on recommendations to be made to the FDA. Two of the 11 committee members said that they considered the treatment effective, while nine said that it was not. Only one committee member said that the benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks as presented, but the other 10 voted that they did not. This was the first time FDA advisers have considered a psychedelic drug for\u00a0medical\u00a0use. MDMA is known as an entactogen, a class of psychoactive drugs that produce experiences of emotional communion, relatedness and emotional openness. It\u2019s currently classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and changing this status would be a marked shift. The FDA has final say on whether the treatment is formally approved. The agency often follows recommendations from its independent advisory committees but does not have to do so. About 5% of adults in the United States \u2013 about 13 million people \u2013 experience PTSD in any given year, according\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the National Center for PTSD. But current treatment options \u2013 including antidepressants and some specialized forms of cognitive behavioral therapy \u2013 are limited in their scope and effectiveness, with few alternatives available to help those don\u2019t respond well to them. At Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Lykos Therapeutics presented positive data from two late-stage clinical trials that used MDMA in combination with therapy to treat PTSD. Many of the FDA advisory committee members applauded the exploration of this line of treatment and lauded the potential it holds, but several shortcomings \u2013 notably regarding bias in efficacy data and missing information about safety \u2013 raised critical doubts. About 200 people participated in the Lykos trials, with a treatment program that involved three eight-hour sessions where participants took MDMA in the presence of two therapists. The MDMA sessions were spaced about a month apart, along with additional therapy sessions. \u201cParticipants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms,\u201d the FDA wrote in a briefing document about the studies. But the agency also noted that \u201cseveral factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment for this application,\u201d posing key questions for the members of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee to consider. The studies were designed to be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the MDMA treatment and who didn\u2019t. This type of study is considered the gold standard because it helps reduce bias in results by minimizing the effects of external factors. But MDMA\u2019s hallucinogenic effects have \u201cprofound alterations\u201d on a person\u2019s state of being, and the vast majority of participants knew which group they were in simply by the nature of their experience. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that conducts independent reviews of treatments, tests and procedures, also cited \u201csubstantial concerns about the validity of the results\u201d of the Lykos trials in a report published in March. Those concerns centered around bias, both from the unblinding of the trial and from other influences on patient perspectives. In addition to blurry data on efficacy, there were concerns about safety data, the FDA said. MDMA is known to have potential for abuse, but the FDA cautions that the research did not appropriately assess this as an adverse event in the context of the treatment program. Reports from illicit use of MDMA suggest that it may pose risks to both heart and liver health. The phase III clinical trials showed \u201csignificant increases in both blood pressure and pulse\u201d among participants, the FDA said, but certain related assessments were incomplete. And liver health was assessed only in small groups from earlier phases of the clinical trials. The unique factors of this type of treatment and the complexity of the considerations at hand were acknowledged throughout the committee meeting. \u201cI absolutely agree that we need new and better treatments for PTSD, especially in the somatic treatment space. However, I also note that premature introduction of a treatment can actually stifle development and stifle implementation and lead to premature adoption of treatments that are either not completely known to be safe not fully effective or not being used at their optimal efficacy,\u201d said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer, deputy director for research at the National Center for PTSD. As a member of the advisory committee, he voted against the treatment. \u201cI think this is a really exciting treatment. I\u2019m really encouraged by the results to date, but I feel that both from an efficacy and a safety standpoint it is still premature.\u201d Dr. Walter Dunn, a staff psychiatrist at the Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California Los Angeles, was the only committee member to vote in favor of the treatment on both questions of efficacy and the balance of risks and benefits. His confidence in the risk-benefit analysis was low, he said; psychotherapy is an integral component of this treatment program, and it could be \u201cthe greatest strength of the treatment\u201d but \u201calso its greatest liability\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s not within the FDA\u2019s scope to regulate, he said. And specific guardrails the FDA outlined to be put in place with approval of the treatment to protect patient safety were incomplete. \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m voting yes because I\u2019m putting on my clinician hat,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWorking in the VA, as a former servicemember myself, I have colleagues who deployed who have PTSD, and this has the potential to make a to make a difference. Now, that\u2019s not without its risks.\u201d The questions are all familiar to Lykos, and the company has had conversations with the FDA throughout its research, CEO Amy Emerson told CNN before the meeting. \ufeffThe advisory committee meeting is the \u201cnext big milestone\u201d in the process and an opportunity to gather even more information, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just such an urgent patient need for new treatment options, and we really use that as our guiding light as we develop MDMA-assisted therapy,\u201d she said. \u201cAll along, we\u2019ve been really committed to safety, and that will always be top of mind.\u201d There is growing interest and support to explore the use of psychedelics as therapeutics. Along with MDMA, drugs like ketamine and psilocybin mushrooms are being studied in clinical trials to treat a variety of mental health disorders. \u201cDepression, PTSD, eating disorders \u2013 they\u2019re all different. You can\u2019t just lump these together and say, \u2018Psychedelics are good for this,\u2019\u201d Emerson said. \u201cYou need to study it, you need to look at the safety and efficacy profiles of each, and we have to be careful to not treat these things as panaceas or like a magic bullet.\u201d The Lykos treatment is the first to reach this point in the process, and the way the FDA and its advisory board proceed could set key precedents. \u201cIt\u2019s an early but exciting moment. The promise is there, the potential is there, and we just have to find out through careful study and time how impactful these medications will be,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Many questions remain about the specific conditions needed to achieve effective use of this treatment, and even the most supportive experts caution about\u00a0the limitations of the treatment and recommend additional research. \u201cI hope that the drug gets approved but in a way where it can be made available and monitored in a responsible manner,\u201d said Dr. Rachel Yehuda, director of the Center for Psychedelic Psychotherapy and Trauma Research at Mount Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee. \u201cMy fear would be that we stop being curious, we stop asking the right questions, we stop trying to figure out mechanisms of action, we stop trying to perfect and scale like we do with any other treatment.\u201d It\u2019s critical to protect vulnerable populations who may benefit from this treatment, experts say. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that psychedelics are probably uniquely susceptible to the blurring of the boundaries between strictly applied medical treatments that are provided by experienced clinicians under very well-monitored circumstances versus recreational use, so there\u2019s a great interest in trying to get this as right as possible,\u201d said Dr. Jon Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s research council and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \u201cThe last thing you want is for a promising treatment for a devastating condition to go off the rails in an unbounded, unmonitored kind of use.\u201d Also, the trials have excluded people who may be most vulnerable to substantial side effects of MDMA, such as adolescents and those with coinciding conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and it\u2019s important to continue gathering data to understand how the treatment works in these populations, he said. \u201cAny\u00a0FDA\u00a0approval\u00a0of\u00a0MDMA\u00a0must\u00a0be\u00a0accompanied\u00a0by rigorous regulations, strict prescribing and dispensing controls, comprehensive patient education, and ongoing monitoring and surveillance systems,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association wrote in a letter to the FDA\u2019s advisory committee. In addition to potentially setting a precedent in mental health treatment, the particular treatment program that Lykos has studied is \u201clabor-intensive,\u201d Yehuda said. It requires a significant amount of investment \u2013 both logistically and emotionally \u2013 from participants and providers, which is challenged by the shortage of mental health professionals in the US. \u201cWe never had a situation where something that the government had deemed harmful gets a 180 and becomes an approved treatment for a condition,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, the question is, \u2018Are we going to be able to use the moment in a way that really furthers the mental health of our population?\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/mdma-ptsd-fda-advisers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_eye-exercises-debunk-conversation-partner-wellness", "text": "You may have seen advertisements claiming to eliminate the need for eyeglasses through vision therapy or vision training \u2014 basically, eye exercises. These exercises include putting pressure on or palming the eye; eye movement exercises; or straining to read by using the wrong prescription glasses to \u201ctrain\u201d the eyes. As a professor of ophthalmology \u2014 and as an eye doctor who has seen thousands of patients \u2014 I can tell you that no study to date shows strong evidence that these exercises eliminate the need for glasses or offer any long-term significant benefits. The science simply isn\u2019t there. READ MORE: Nearsightedness is at epidemic levels \u2014 and the problem begins in childhood What the science says The lack of evidence holds true for virtually all eye conditions and diseases, including common afflictions such as myopia, or nearsightedness, which refers to when closer objects are clear, but distant objects are blurry. It\u2019s also true for farsightedness \u2014 also called hyperopia \u2014 which happens when objects are clear in the distance but blurry up close. Nor do these eye exercises help with presbyopia, or the need for reading glasses, which generally begins at around age 40. With presbyopia, the patient is neither nearsighted nor farsighted and requires no glasses for distance vision. Yet as the lens of the eye becomes stiffer over time, the eye struggles to focus on fine print and smaller text. This decline will continue with age \u2014 and, with it, the need for stronger reading glasses will increase. Although some methods claim to alleviate the need for reading glasses, there is limited if any evidence to suggest benefit. That said, here are some things everyone can do to maintain healthy eyes: READ MORE: Why so many animals have a third eyelid, including our pets Vision development in children All children should have a baseline eye exam during infancy  and then again between 6 and 12 months of age. They should have a third  exam between ages 1 to 3, and then a more formal exam between ages 3 to  5 to check for eye misalignment, ocular health and the potential need  for glasses. Failing to address eye misalignment, or to provide glasses for a child who needs them, may lead to abnormal visual development or amblyopia, which is a weak, lazy eye. Progression of nearsightedness in children can be slowed by taking breaks and avoiding hour after hour on the phone or computer. Limiting up-close reading time outside of school \u2014 screen time or otherwise \u2014 may help slow the progression of nearsightedness in children. Prolonged screen time can cause eye strain and dryness. I suggest following the 20-20-20 rule: Take 20-second breaks every 20 minutes to look 20 feet away from your device. Focus on relaxing the eyes and blinking. The occasional use of artificial tears, which can be bought over the counter at drugstores, may help with dry eye. Spending more time outdoors is good for your eyes. It has been correlated with a reduced incidence of nearsightedness in childhood. One caution: Staring directly into the sun, even briefly, is dangerous and can cause permanent retinal damage. READ MORE: Bacteria live on our eyeballs Blue light blockers and supplements Ads for blue-light-blocking glasses claim they prevent headaches and  eye strain and improve sleep. But some studies, including a large,  randomized control trial, found that blue-blocking lenses did not alter symptoms of eye strain. Additionally, there is only limited evidence to show that these glasses improve circadian rhythm. Be wary of supplements or natural remedies that claim to be a  cure-all for any eye condition. These assertions are not backed by  rigorous scientific evidence, and there is no proof they improve vision,  reduce eye floaters or eliminate the need for glasses. The same is true for claims that essential oils or other topical substances may improve vision. While omega-3s have been previously touted for dry eye symptoms, there is no strong evidence that they help, although this does not discount their many other health benefits. One study did demonstrate that progression of intermediate age-related macular degeneration  slowed in some patients after using over-the-counter vitamins;  specifically, the AREDS2 formula. However, these vitamins were not  beneficial in patients with early or no signs of the disease. READ MORE: Cataract surgery: What you need to know about What does work There are some ocular conditions where vision therapy may be  recommended, including issues such as misalignment of the eyes and  trouble converging on objects up close, which can result in symptoms  such as diplopia, or \u201cdouble vision.\u201d  Ultimately, these conditions are best addressed by your eye doctor and  are unrelated to the need for reading or distance glasses. For overall eye health, a diet rich in vegetables and other healthy foods may help reduce the incidence of some eye diseases. Some studies also show that exercise is associated with a reduction in risk for developing glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration. Cigarette smoking is associated with several eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, so quitting or avoiding smoking is critical.

{"id": "2024_06_04_health_internet-addiction-teen-brain-activity-wellness", "text": "Teens who spend lots of time on social media have complained of feeling like they can\u2019t pay attention to more important things like homework or time with loved ones. A new study has possibly captured that objectively, finding that for teens diagnosed with internet addiction, signaling between brain regions important for controlling attention, working memory and more was disrupted. The findings are from a review, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Mental Health, of 12 neuroimaging studies of a few hundred adolescents ages 10 to 19 between 2013 and 2022. \u201cThe behavioural addiction brought on by excessive internet use has become a rising source of concern since the last decade,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. The criteria for clinical diagnosis of internet addiction in the included studies were \u201cone\u2019s persistent preoccupation with the internet, withdrawal symptoms when away from the internet, and sacrificing relationships (for) time to spend on the internet over an extended period of time (e.g., 12 months),\u201d said Max Chang, first author of the study and outreach case manager at the nonprofit Peninsula Family Service in San Francisco, via email. \u201cThe pattern of behaviour results in significant impairment or distress in the individual\u2019s life.\u201d Given the changing state of adolescent brains compared with adults, the authors felt understanding the impacts of internet addiction on the teenage participants\u2019 brains was vital. When participants clinically diagnosed with internet addiction engaged in activities governed by the brain\u2019s executive function network \u2014 behaviors requiring attention, planning, decision-making and impulse control \u2014 those brain regions showed substantial disruption in their ability to work together, compared to those in peers without internet addiction. The authors think such signaling changes could suggest these behaviors can become more difficult to perform, potentially influencing development and well-being. \u201cWhile this paper presents a straightforward systematic review suggesting that there are associations between functional connectivity in the brain and internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 there are a number of fundamental limitations to be aware of that are critical to any interpretation,\u201d Dr. David Ellis, a behavioral scientist at the University of Bath\u2019s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour, said in a news release. \u201cCause and effect cannot be drawn from these studies,\u201d said Ellis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cSecond, the focus on functional connectivity comes at the expense of any critique about the key measure of interest. Specifically, internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 which was initially conjured up by (psychiatrist) Ivan K. Goldberg in 1995 as a joke. \u201cToday, the conceptualisation and measurement of internet \u2018addiction\u2019 is neither universally accepted and certainly not diagnosable using the survey instruments used in the studies included as part of the review,\u201d Ellis added. \u201cSimilarly, the enormity of activities that the internet allows for immediately makes this definition somewhat redundant.\u201d In the United States, internet addiction isn\u2019t included in the DSM-V \u2014 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the US. It does, however, list internet gaming disorder. All the studies the authors reviewed were all conducted in Asia and consisted of mostly male participants. China was the first country to declare internet addiction a \u201cpublic health crisis.\u201d \u201cSuch definitions, despite being widely critiqued, also have a tendency to move the focus away from genuine online harm and towards a conclusion that suggests the removal of technology from people\u2019s lives will be helpful,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSolid evidence to suggest that removing the internet brings any tangible benefits has not been forthcoming.\u201d Additionally, all studies were conducted at one point in time, said Dr. Eva Telzer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cGiven that there are no longitudinal data,\u201d Telzer said, \u201cit is very possible that adolescents who have underlying differences in brain connectivity patterns are more vulnerable to developing internet addiction.\u201d Overcoming internet addiction If internet addiction is what caused the disruption in participants\u2019 brain signaling, the reason why may have to do with neural pathways related to addiction, said Dr. Smita Das, an addiction psychiatrist and clinical associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine in California. Das wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The functional connectivity patterns in participants\u2019 brains are, in fact, in line with those observed in people with substance addictions, said Dr. Caglar Yildirim, an associate teaching professor of computer science at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston. Yildirim wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cOverall, the mechanisms underlying internet addiction are more like an emerging pattern than a finished picture,\u201d Chang said. \u201cA lot of causality between what happens in the brain and what is displayed through behavior is still being understood. As of now, observation using biomarkers such as functional connectivity helps bridge that gap.\u201d\u00a0 If you\u2019re wondering if your teen struggles with internet addiction, behaviors such as withdrawing from relationships are a telltale sign, Chang said. \u201cSimilar to substance and gambling disorders, internet addiction rewires the brain, making it harder to resist internet related stimuli,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, unlike gambling or substance usage, the internet is an important part of our lives. Balancing the usefulness and dangers of the internet is a field that is very crucial going forward in adolescent development.\u201d Find what keeps your teen off the internet and help them do more of it, Yildirim suggested. You can also talk with your child\u2019s doctor to see if behavioral strategies can work, Das suggested. Therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness and motivational interviewing are helpful. The latter, which originated in the field of addiction treatment, is a counseling method that aims to increase a patient\u2019s motivation for, and commitment to, behavioral change by eliciting and exploring the patient\u2019s own reasons for wanting change. In severe cases, a psychiatrist may suggest medication to treat certain types of technology addiction, she added.

{"id": "2024_05_31_health_mediterranean-diet-women-early-death-risk-wellness", "text": "Women who closely followed a Mediterranean diet lived much longer than those who did not, according to a new study that followed more than 25,000 women for 25 years. \u201cFor women interested in longevity, our study shows that following a Mediterranean dietary pattern could result in about one quarter reduction in risk of death over more than 25 years with benefit for both cancer and cardiovascular mortality, the top causes of death,\u201d senior study author Dr. Samia Mora, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said in an email. The Mediterranean diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with much of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods should be avoided. Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. \u201cIn this study, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was a proxy for diet quality. Those who adhered most closely were eating more legumes, more vegetables, more fruits, less meat, and less processed meats,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. While the study was observational and thus could not show a direct cause and effect, \u201cthe finding is entirely consistent with many other studies of the now famously healthful Mediterranean diet,\u201d said Katz, who was not involved in the research. \u201cWe may be comfortable inferring that a high quality diet did, indeed, \u2018cause\u2019 a lower risk of death,\u201d Katz said in an email. Why studying women is important The Mediterranean diet has a long list of scientific kudos: The Mediterranean style of eating may reduce the risk for breast cancer,\u00a0dementia, depression,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0high cholesterol and memory loss. Adherence to the diet can also lead to stronger bones, a\u00a0healthier heart and\u00a0longer life. It\u2019s also good for healthy weight loss. In all that data, however, are few details on the specific ways the Mediterranean diet may affect women, especially long-term. That\u2019s important, experts say, because women are not little men. A woman\u2019s brain works differently on a molecular level than a man\u2019s brain. The size of a woman\u2019s heart may differ from a man\u2019s, and women have completely different symptoms for a heart attack than men. Women\u00a0metabolize alcohol and medications differently than men. And then there\u2019s the obvious difference of menarche and menopause, which creates an entire class of health risks specific to women. Every bite counts In the new study, published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open, researchers asked 25,315 healthy women participating in the Women\u2019s Health Study about their diet and collected blood and other biomarkers between 1993 and 1996. Those women were reevaluated between 2018 and 2023. Not only did closely following the Mediterranean diet cut the risk of early death by 23%, it lessened the risk of dying from cancer by 17% and dying from cardiovascular disease by 20%, the study found. \u201cThere was a graded stepwise increase in benefit \u2014 the more committed the more benefit,\u201d said lead author Shafqat Ahmad, an associate professor of molecular epidemiology at Uppsala University in Sweden, in an email. Each increase in adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a 6% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 5% reduced risk of dying from either heart disease or cancer, Ahmad said. \u201cWhat might be worth noting is that the adherence measure \u2018corrects\u2019 for distortions of the Mediterranean diet,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIn the US, simply adding olive oil to French fries might result in someone claiming to be \u2018on\u2019 the Mediterranean diet.\u201d However, the study corrects for distortions by looking at all the \u201ckey features of a \u2018true\u2019 Mediterranean diet, and thus precludes that kind of misrepresentation,\u201d Katz said. Want to start the Mediterranean diet? It\u2019s not hard to incorporate a Mediterranean style of eating into your life, experts say. Start by adding more veggies and legumes to each meal and use all kinds and colors to get the broadest range of nutrients, phytochemicals and fiber. Cook, roast or garnish them with herbs and a bit of extra-virgin olive oil. Add whole grains and fruit to every meal, but use nuts and seeds as a garnish or small snack because of their higher calorie and fat content. Cut way back on the use of red meat. Instead turn to fish and other seafood, which are often consumed at least twice a week. Get as much protein as you can from beans and other legumes. Start with one bean-based meal a week, then add two and build your nonmeat meals from there. Mix in cheese and yogurt daily to weekly in moderate portions. Chicken, pork and eggs are OK on occasion.

The JN.1 version of the virus, along with its descendants KP.2 and KP.3 are the most common strain of the virus that are getting people sick right now,\u00a0according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA\u2019s\u00a0committee of independent advisers\u00a0voted unanimously Wednesday to recommend that the agency tell vaccine manufacturers to update the Covid-19 shots for the fall. The FDA told the advisory committee Wednesday that studies have shown that the currently available\u00a0Covid-19 vaccines appear to be less effective against the variants that are now in circulation. When manufacturers updated their vaccines last year to better match the variants that were in circulation then, the reformulated vaccines seemed to offer better protection, the FDA said. Covid-19 cases are relatively low right now. Only 3% to 4% of people who are getting tested are positive for the virus,\u00a0the CDC told the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisers this week. By comparison during the height of the pandemic, rates were at 30%. Hospitalization rates are also currently the lowest they have been since March 2020, the CDC told the committee. Many people in the US have some protection against the virus through vaccination or prior infection, but that protection wanes over time. In just the fall and winter months last season,\u00a0Covid sent more than half a million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000 people, according to data presented at the meeting. The people most likely to get seriously ill or die were unvaccinated, studies show, and among\u00a0the children who were hospitalized, half had no underlying conditions. Covid vaccine makers Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax said their new products should be ready by the fall. The challenge may now be on how to convince people to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Only about 25% of adults have been vaccinated with the most recent version of the vaccine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/fda-updated-covid-vaccine-for-fall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_health_anxiety-positive-energy-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014  Tossing and turning in the wee hours. A low but constant buzzing in the brain that thwarts concentration. A feeling of tense restlessness. Most have experienced this sort of anxiety \u2014 not clinical anxiety, which might result in a full-on panic attack, but the run-of-the-mill kind that leaves you feeling uncomfortable. \u201cAnxiety is this simple definition: that feeling of fear or worry that comes in situations of uncertainty,\u201d neuroscientist Dr. Wendy Suzuki\u00a0recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life. \u201cThat\u2019s my simplistic definition of everyday anxiety.\u201d That experience is not pleasant. \u201cThe general feeling is, \u2018I just want to get rid of it,\u2019\u201d said Suzuki, a professor of neural science and psychology at New York University as well as dean of the school\u2019s College of Arts and Science. She is also the author of \u201cGood Anxiety: Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion.\u201d \u201cThe misunderstanding is that it is valuable,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning system that we all need. It is a tool that helps us figure out what we hold dear. If we don\u2019t have that, I think something important will be taken away from our lives.\u201d You can listen more on how anxiety can be good here. Suzuki explained how anxiety evolved to protect us. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that in this day and age,\u201d she said. But 2.5 million years ago, \u201can ancestor with a little baby (was) walking around trying to find food, and there\u2019s a crack of a twig and that could either be \u2026 a big animal coming to eat her or it could be the crack of a twig.\u00a0She better be ready, or we\u2019re not going to have any ancestors after her.\u201d The crack of the twig left her anxious but alert to danger. \u201cAnd then her body is (in) the fight-or-flight response,\u201d she said. \u201cThat same response, including all of the fight-or-flight (reaction), gets activated when we look at the news, when we look at social media, at what\u2019s going on today,\u201d she said. \u201cOur heart rates are going up, our respiration rates are going off \u2014 that is not good physiologically for us. And so \u2026\u00a0that is your No. 1 reason to learn how to modulate that stress response.\u201d The first step toward getting to \u201cgood\u201d anxiety, Suzuki said, is learning how to lower your level of everyday anxiety. So, what can you do to ratchet it down? Here are Suzuki\u2019s top five tips: Take a deep breath Practice breath meditation. \u201cBreath meditation is the oldest form of meditation and can be so effective in really calming ourselves down \u2014 and immediately,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cThat\u2019s my No. 1 go-to for people who say, \u2018I just need something right now.\u2019\u201d One calming pattern is box breathing. To do it, inhale deeply for four counts, hold for four counts, exhale for four counts and hold again for four counts. \u201cRepeat to calm your mind and body,\u201d she said. Get moving Go for a short walk, Suzuki recommended. \u201cDid you know that just 10 minutes of walking can significantly reduce anxiety and depression levels in people? You don\u2019t even have to change your clothes to get that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat that\u2019s doing is stimulating the release of neurotransmitters that don\u2019t necessarily decrease your anxiety, but they increase your feelings of reward and happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cThose neurotransmitters that go up include dopamine and serotonin and noradrenaline and endorphins.\u00a0Every single time you move your body, it\u2019s like giving your brain a wonderful bubble bath of neurochemicals, and it works immediately.\u201d Reframe your anxiety Turn anxiety-inducing situations into personal challenges to foster growth and resilience \u2014 and enjoy the newness of uncertain circumstances. Paraphrasing Deepak Chopra, Suzuki recommended embracing uncertainty because it can make life interesting to live. \u201cIn my life, the uncertainty can be something that brings excitement, can bring joy. Not all the time, but maybe you can take part of that and embrace it as something useful,\u201d she said. For example, she said, \u201cIf the same thing happened every single time I went on vacation, that would not be a fun vacation. I like the newness; I like learning new things and being exposed to new things. And I can\u2019t control that by definition.\u201d Spin straw into gold Turn your worry into action. To enhance productivity and reduce worry, transform your anxious what-if list into a productive to-do list, Suzuki advised. \u201cI like to say that there are gifts that come with your anxiety,\u201d she said, citing what often happens to her right before she goes to sleep. \u201cI have this worry list that hits me right before I\u2019m going to go to sleep. And so what do I do? I turn that what-if list into a to-do list,\u201d she said. \u201cI just say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to remember these things, so Wendy, you can go to sleep now.\u2019 But the next morning I go and take all those things that made me not sleep the night before, and I go do something about them. \u2026 In that way, I make myself more productive. And I use my anxiety as the tool that it\u2019s supposed to (be).\u201d Practice compassion Support others, Suzuki said, letting them know they are not alone. \u201cReach out with a kind word to someone experiencing similar anxiety,\u201d she said, noting that some people feel shame about being anxious over a certain situation. \u201cThis simple act can release dopamine and improve your own mood.\u201d We hope these five tips help you turn your anxiety into something more productive. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week on the Chasing Life podcast when we delve into therapy and learn what it can and can\u2019t do to increase your happiness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/health/anxiety-positive-energy-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_swimsuit-color-pool-safety-wellness", "text": "The color of your child\u2019s swimsuit could impact their safety at a swimming pool or the beach. That\u2019s according to water safety experts who have taken a close look at how the hue of swimwear may influence how visible a child is under water. \u201cA child\u2019s swimsuit color can significantly impact their visibility in the water, which is crucial in preventing drownings. Bright and contrasting colors stand out more clearly against the water, making it easier for lifeguards and parents to spot a child quickly, especially in an emergency situation,\u201d Bernard Fisher, director of health and safety for the American Lifeguard Association, said in an email. \u201cPeople should avoid swimsuits in light blue, gray, or green as they can blend with the water and pool surroundings, making it difficult to spot a child. We recommend bright and contrasting colors such as neon yellow, orange, pink, and bright red,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cThese colors are highly visible both underwater and on the surface. Swimsuit colors are not talked about enough in public safety, said Wyatt Werneth, a coastal lifeguard in Florida and spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association. \u201cThe bright clothes are something that we\u2019ve identified as being a game-changer. If you have the same colors of the water or the environment, you\u2019re going to blend in,\u201d Werneth said while patrolling Cocoa Beach. \u201cWe consider this also with missing children. Not only the fact that the bright colors are going to help us locate them in a pool environment or the beach, but one of the things that lifeguards do more than anything else \u2013 you think we go out and wrestle with sharks and save people from rip currents \u2013 but we also look for missing children at the beach,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re wearing a bright color, and if you take a picture of those children before, then we\u2019ll have a picture and know what to look for. So, you can help us \u2013 not only can drowning be prevented, missing persons\u2019 [cases] can be prevented as well.\u201d Swimsuit color test A company called Alive Solutions, which specializes in water safety, has found in two separate experiments that certain swimsuit colors are easier to spot in a swimming pool or open water, such as a lake. In tests, the company\u2019s water safety experts placed swimsuits of various colors in swimming pools and lakes to determine how visible they may be. The tests were conducted independently and not published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cIn our main testing we did 14 different colors,\u201d Natalie Livingston, co-founder and owner of Alive Solutions, said in an email. \u201cWater is not like looking through air.\u00a0Even the tiniest bit of surface agitation, glare, or movement in the water can cause objects and people to become distorted,\u201d she said. \u201cVisibility in water can be increased or decreased depending on the color of a swimsuit or clothing.\u201d Livingston, who has been a lifeguard for more than 25 years, remembers watching her children at the pool one afternoon with other parents and that\u2019s when she realized that some children wearing either dark- or pastel-colored swimsuits seemed to visibly disappear in the water. Her colleagues and she later decided to conduct the tests from 2019 through last year. In a swimming pool, with a light-colored bottom, the company\u2019s tests showed that neon pink and neon orange appeared to be the most visible. Darker colors showed up against the light pool bottom, but could often be dismissed for shadows, leaves or dirt. White and light blue swimsuits were not as visible and seemed to disappear completely in the pool. \u201cLight colors or blues tend to look like glare spots or cloud reflections, or completely blend in with the environment,\u201d Livingston said in the email. In 18 inches of lake water, the tests showed that bright neon colors \u2013 including neon orange, yellow and green \u2013 were most visible against the lake bottom, but neon pink did not perform well. White swimsuits appeared more due to reflecting light, but not as much as the bright neon colors. All other colors were not very visible. Overall, Livingston said, neons won for visibility in all environments. \u201cWe have heard from so many parents that said they had their kid in a bright-colored swimsuit and the color caught their attention out of the corner of their eye and they responded to prevent a drowning event,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cOf course, the color of the suit doesn\u2019t matter if no one is supervising effectively, but it can and does help in partnership with effective supervision and other layers of water safety prevention.\u201d Layers of water safety It certainly makes sense that bright swimsuit colors can play a role in making a child more visible in the water in case of an emergency, but there isn\u2019t \u201creal-world evidence\u201d that having a child in a neon bathing suit leads to better outcomes in a drowning event, said Dr. Maneesha Agarwal, an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Emory University School of Medicine. \u201cThe goal is that you never have to even rely on your child\u2019s bathing suit color to find them in a drowning event at all,\u201d Agarwal said, adding that appropriate water safety includes various layers of protection. \u201cOther important layers include making sure your child is water-competent \u2013 so that means swim lessons. Making sure your child has good supervision whenever they are in the water, which means that the parents or a designated adult is watching the child in the water,\u201d she said, adding that it is important to look out for signs of drowning. Unlike how drowning is portrayed in the movies \u2013 with loud splashing and screams for help \u2013 drowning events in the real world occur silently and quickly, Agarwal said. \u201cThe child that\u2019s drowning, they\u2019re not going to be yelling for help. They are typically going to be struggling to keep their face above water level, so you might see their face kind of going up and down above the water level. And it really can only take 30 to 60 seconds before they\u2019re completely submerged,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cYou also want to make sure that you are doing everything you can to prevent your child from getting into the water unsupervised. That means if you have a pool, wherever you live or wherever you are visiting, making sure there\u2019s appropriate four-sided pool fencing that keeps children from accessing the pool,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then if the unthinkable happens, making sure that you are prepared \u2013 you know how to perform CPR, and you are able to rapidly call 911, and if you happen to be near an open body of water in particular, life jackets are imperative.\u201d The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data last month showing that accidental drowning rates are on the rise in the United States. The new numbers show that more than 4,500 people drowned each year between 2020 and 2022, which is about 500 more\u00a0drowning\u00a0deaths each year compared with the previous year in 2019. Children especially are at high risk, as drowning\u00a0is the number-one cause of death for children 1-4 years old in the United States. But some studies have shown that participating in formal swimming lessons is associated with an 88% reduced risk of drowning in young children, said Chris DeJong, founder and president of Big Blue Swim School, which offers swimming lessons to children. He added that wearing bright-colored swimsuits is just one tool in a toolbox of many steps children can take to be safer while in or around a swimming pool. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends swim lessons as a layer of protection against drowning and says they can start for many children as early as 1. \u201cStarting at that very early age can help make them more comfortable as we start to get into more advanced lessons when they\u2019re older \u2013 so they\u2019re not starting from scratch and having to overcome a fear of something brand new, which can be challenging with swim lessons,\u201d DeJong said. \u201cSwim lessons are the most important tool to help kids save themselves and know what to do in an emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd know your risk factors. Younger children, typically under the age of 10, are most commonly drowning victims in residential pools, whereas drowning victims over the age of 14 are typically in natural bodies of water.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/swimsuit-color-pool-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_07_29_health_aids-hiv-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at the origins, treatments and global response to HIV and AIDS. Facts HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. HIV/AIDS is spread through sexual contact with an infected person, sharing needles with an infected person, through transfusions of infected blood or through an infected mother. People infected with HIV go through three stages of infection: HIV-1 and HIV-2 can both cause AIDS. HIV-1 is the most common human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-2 is found mostly in western Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) involves taking a cocktail of HIV medications used to treat the virus. In 1987, Azidothymidine (AZT) became the first FDA-approved drug used to attempt to treat HIV/AIDS. Statistics from UNAIDS: 38.4 million - Number of people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2021. 5.9 million - Approximate number of people living with HIV globally that are unaware of their HIV-positive status in 2021. 160,000 - Newly infected children worldwide in 2021. 1.5 million - New infections worldwide in 2021. 650,000 - Approximate number of AIDS-related deaths worldwide in 2021. Of the 4,500 new infections each day in 2019, 59% are in sub-Saharan Africa. 40.1 million - Approximate number of AIDS-related deaths worldwide since the start of the epidemic. Sub-Saharan Africa is comprised of the following countries: Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Timeline 1981 - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publish the first reports of men in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco who were previously healthy and are suffering from rare forms of cancer and pneumonia, accompanied by \u201copportunistic infections.\u201d  1982 - The CDC refer to the disease as AIDS for the first time. 1983 - French and American researchers determine that AIDS is caused by HIV. 1985 - Blood tests to detect HIV are developed. December 1, 1988 - First World AIDS Day. 1999 - Researchers in the United States find evidence that HIV-1 most likely originated in a population of chimpanzees in West Africa. The virus appears to have been transmitted to people who hunted, butchered and consumed the chimpanzees for food. January 29, 2003 - In his State of the Union speech, US President George W. Bush promises to dramatically increase funding to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa.  May 27, 2003 - Bush signs H.R. 1298, the US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003, also known as PEPFAR (US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), that provides $15 billion over the next five years to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria abroad, particularly in Africa. July 30, 2008 - H.R. 5501, The Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, becomes law and authorizes up to $48 billion to combat global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Through 2013, PEPFAR plans to work in partnership with host nations to support treatment for at least four million people, prevention of 12 million new infections and care for 12 million people. October 2011 - In his book, \u201cThe Origins of AIDS,\u201d Dr. Jacques Pepin traces the emergence and subsequent development of HIV/AIDS to suggest that initial AIDS outbreaks began earlier than previously believed.   July 24, 2012 - Doctors announce during the 19th International AIDS Conference that Timothy Ray Brown, known as the \u201cBerlin patient,\u201d has been clinically \u201ccured\u201d of HIV. Brown, diagnosed with leukemia, underwent a bone marrow transplant in 2007 using marrow from a donor with an HIV-resistant mutation. He no longer has detectable HIV.  March 3, 2013 - Researchers announce that a baby born infected with HIV has been \u201cfunctionally cured.\u201d The child, born in Mississippi, was given high doses of antiretroviral drugs within 30 hours of being born. A year later, the child now has detectable levels of the virus in her blood, 27 months after being taken off antiretroviral drugs, according to scientists involved with her case. June 18, 2013 - Marking the 10th anniversary of PEPFAR, Secretary of State John Kerry announces that the millionth child has been born HIV-free due to prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs (PMTCT). March 14, 2014 - The CDC reports on a case of likely female-to-female HIV transmission. Unlike previous announcements of other cases involving female-to-female transmission, this case excludes additional risk factors for HIV transmission. July 24, 2017 - A 9-year-old child from South Africa is reported to have been in remission for over eight years without treatment, according to Dr. Avy Violari, who spoke at the 9th International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Science in Paris. November 2018 - According to PEPFAR\u2019s website, they have \u201csupported life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART) for more than 14.6 million men, women and children\u201d since 2003. March 5, 2019 - According to a case study published in the journal Nature, a second person has sustained remission from HIV-1. The \u201cLondon patient\u201d was treated with stem cell transplants from donors with an HIV-resistant mutation. The London patient has been in remission for 18 months since he stopped taking antiretroviral drugs. The study also includes a possible third remission after stem cell transplantation, this person is referred to as the \u201cD\u00fcsseldorf patient.\u201d May 2, 2019 - A study of nearly 1,000 gay male couples, where one partner with HIV took antiretroviral therapy (ART), found no new cases of transmission to the HIV-negative partner during sex without a condom. The landmark, eight-year study, published in the Lancet medical journal shows that the risk of passing on the HIV virus is eliminated with effective drugs treatment. October 7, 2019 - Governor Gavin Newsom signs a bill making HIV prevention drugs available without a prescription in California starting on January 1, 2020. The medications covered by the new legislation are pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which both help prevent HIV infections. California becomes the first state in the country to allow pharmacists to provide the drugs without a physician\u2019s prescription. November 6, 2019 - According to a study published in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, a team of scientists has detected a new strain of HIV. The strain is a part of the Group M version of HIV-1, the same family of virus subtypes to blame for the global HIV pandemic, according to Abbott Laboratories, which conducted the research along with the University of Missouri, Kansas City. June 15, 2020 - A study is published in the journal JAMA Network Open showing that the life expectancy of people with HIV approaches that of people without the virus, when antiviral therapy is started early in infection. However, disparities still remain in the number of chronic health problems that people with HIV endure. July 7, 2020 - Scientists presenting at the 23rd International AIDS Conference announce a new study that found an injection of the investigational drug cabotegravir every eight weeks was more effective at preventing HIV than daily oral pills. It is also announced that a Brazilian man might be the first person to experience long-term HIV remission after being treated with only an antiviral drug regimen \u2013 not stem cell transplantation. November 16, 2021 - A new study finds a second patient whose body has seemingly rid itself of HIV. The international team of scientists reports in the Annals of Internal Medicine that the patient, originally from the city of Esperanza, Argentina, showed no evidence of intact HIV in large numbers of her cells, suggesting that she may have naturally achieved what they describe as a \u201csterilizing cure\u201d of HIV infection. The 30-year-old woman in the new study is only the second patient who has been described as achieving this sterilizing cure without help from stem cell transplantation or other treatment. December 20, 2021 - The US Food and Drug Administration announces that it has approved the first injectable medication for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to lower the risk of getting HIV through sex. February 15, 2022 - A US woman becomes the third known person to go into HIV remission, and the first mixed-race woman, thanks to a transplant of stem cells from umbilical cord blood, according to research presented at a conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. December 1, 2022 - An experimental HIV vaccine, called eOD-GT8 60mer, has been found to induce broadly neutralizing antibody precursors among a small group of volunteers in a Phase 1 study. The clinical trial results, published in the journal Science, suggest that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine, given eight weeks apart, can elicit immune responses against the human immunodeficiency virus.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2013/07/29/health/aids-hiv-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

You grab your neck pillow, eye mask and a glass of wine to make sure you are well-rested on the other side. That tactic isn\u2019t such a good idea, according to new research. Airplane cabins are pressurized to maintain the equivalent of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) of elevation, meaning the air pressure and oxygen levels are lower than what most people experience on Earth. Combine that with alcohol consumption and sleep, and it\u2019s more likely a person will experience an intensified drop in oxygen saturation in their blood, according to a study published Monday in the journal Thorax. \u201cPlease don\u2019t drink alcohol on board of airplanes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Eva-Maria Elmenhorst, deputy of the department of sleep and human factors and leader of the Working Group on Performance and Sleep at the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne, Germany, in an email. To investigate, researchers created an atmospheric environment similar to an airplane cabin in flight. Over two nights, 48 healthy adults slept for four hours in two different environments \u2014 once without alcohol and once after drinking the equivalent of two glasses of wine or cans of beer, according to the study. On the nights with alcohol, researchers saw a lowered amount of oxygen and an increased heart rate, the study showed. \u201cThe combination of alcohol intake with sleeping under hypobaric conditions poses a considerable strain on the cardiac system and might lead to exacerbation of symptoms in patients with cardiac or pulmonary diseases,\u201d the researchers said. The study is small, but it provides a starting point from which researchers should keep investigating the relationship between sleep, flight and alcohol, said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. Many people may be drinking onboard to help them get to sleep in an often uncomfortable cabin \u2014 but doing so negatively impacts both long-term health and the immediate goal of getting some rest, experts said. Alcohol gets you sleep \u2014 but not good sleep The study authors didn\u2019t just collect data on heart strain. They also took a closer look at the participants\u2019 quality of sleep. It wasn\u2019t great. Time in REM sleep \u2014 the rapid-eye movement stage that may be important to memory consolidation and brain recuperation \u2014 was shorter for people in the airplane conditions who had alcohol, the study showed. The finding isn\u2019t a surprise, Freeman said. Alcohol may help you get to sleep, but the quality isn\u2019t as good as sleep while sober, he said. \u201cMany people have witnessed when people drink heavily, their snoring and the sleep apnea is much more severe,\u201d Freeman said. The quantity of sleep under the influence also tends to be different, said Dr. Shalini Paruthi, adjunct professor at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. People tend to get more fragmented sleep after drinking, meaning they wake up more in the night and tend not to sleep as long, said Paruthi, an American Academy of Sleep Medicine spokesperson. She was not involved in the research. \u2018Sometimes people will just think about the immediate effect of \u2018ooh it will make me fall asleep faster\u2019 but they forget about all the other effects of the alcohol,\u201d she said. Be especially careful not to mix sleep aids with alcohol, because both are depressants and intensify their sedative effects when taken together, Freeman said. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen \u2026 people taking sleeping pills combined with alcohol, which is a major issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, there\u2019s oftentimes a medical emergency.\u201d How to rest before your destination If possible, try to keep to your natural body cycles when flying, Freeman said \u2014 although that might not always be possible. That can look like choosing a flight that lines up with your sleep patterns so you can either land and just finish sleeping or land and start your day, he said. Avoid creating those sleep and wake cycles with too many stimulants such as coffee or energy drinks and depressants like alcohol, he added. Next, stay hydrated, because flying typically involves a dry environment and people don\u2019t always hydrate properly, Freeman said. The best thing to drink is water, he said. Foods served at airports and airplanes can lean salty, greasy and heavily processed, so Freeman recommends either packing your own or finding airport options that are lighter and largely plant-based. Exercise can also help you sleep better, so he advises avoiding the elevators and moving sidewalks to get some steps in instead. If you are on a long flight, try to get up and get some movement as well, Freeman said. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019ll point out is there\u2019s lots of evidence that suggests that the blue lights that are emitted from screens and all that interfere with our sleep patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are trying to sleep on a plane, consider getting a noise-canceling headphone and maybe not use your screens, especially while you\u2019re waiting for the flight to take off.\u201d It may be harder to keep up your healthy habits on days when you fly, but making efforts to do so can help you arrive feeling good and ready for an adventure, Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/health/alcohol-planes-heart-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness", "text": "It\u2019s a true blessing to have great friends who frequently get together. At times, however, those blessings may overflow, according to \u201cB,\u201d a 43-year-old Atlantan who CNN is not identifying for privacy reasons. \u201cI love Champagne bubbles and having Champagne on a patio on Sunday with friends \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0it\u2019s an ideal day,\u201d B said. \u201cBut my friends hang out all the time, and even on a weeknight, it would end up being bottles of wine. I felt like I should have invested in box wine, especially during the pandemic.\u201d Today, B has given up alcohol, turning instead to marijuana gummies when she wants a buzz. The use of weed to replace alcohol is a growing trend in the United States. In fact, a recent study found \u2014 for the first time ever \u2014 the daily use of cannabis of any kind among Americans surpassed the daily use of alcohol. In sheer numbers, of course, many more people still drink alcohol on occasion than use marijuana, which is now legal for recreational use in\u00a024 states and Washington, DC, and for medical use in\u00a038 states\u00a0and DC. Still, nearly 18 million people age 12 and older reported using marijuana daily or near daily in 2022, compared with about 15 million who said they used alcohol with the same frequency, according to the study\u2019s analysis of the most recent data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual government survey. \u2018My heart was racing\u2019 For B, giving up alcohol was a necessity. Her periodic binge drinking with friends was taking a toll. Hangovers and an increasing sense of anxiety on the mornings after affected her work performance and her ability to exercise, an enjoyable part of her life. \u201cI\u2019m really healthy, I eat clean and work out all the time, and I just was not feeling good anymore,\u201d B said. \u201cThen one day I was laying on my couch, and my heart was racing like it was coming out of my chest.\u201d Both alcoholism and heart disease ran in B\u2019s family: \u201cI\u2019ve had relatives that have dropped dead of a heart attack in their driveway.\u201d Simply drinking less wasn\u2019t an option for her. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to moderate in the past, but it\u2019s hard to do that when you\u2019re around people who are drinking,\u201d B said. \u201cSo I decided to quit alcohol completely. My friends were really supportive, and it was easier than I thought it would be.\u201d After a few months of total sobriety, however, B began to experiment with cannabis gummies and found them easy to incorporate with a nonalcoholic drink or two. \u201cI don\u2019t like getting super high,\u201d B said. \u201cI\u2019ll just cut off a fourth of a gummy to take the edge off after a long day at work. If I\u2019m with friends at a party where I know I\u2019ll be there awhile, I might take a half or even a whole one.\u201d Weed or alcohol: Which is better? Is replacing alcohol with weed a healthier option? It depends, experts say. \u201cQuestioning one\u2019s relationship with alcohol is a very healthy trend,\u201d said Carol Boyd, founding director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was not involved in the analysis. \u201cWe know that moderate alcohol consumption has health risks, and risk increases as alcohol consumption increases,\u201d Boyd said in an email. Just one drink a day can raise blood pressure, trigger a dangerous irregular heartbeat or even shrink your brain, studies have found. Those are just a few of the many pitfalls of alcohol use, including the risk of cancer. Binge drinking, defined as consuming four or more drinks in two hours for women (five or more for men) was on the rise during the pandemic. Binging was higher in women, sending twice as many to the emergency room during the pandemic than before. In fact, the alcohol-induced death rate for both sexes jumped 26% between 2019 and 2020, the first year of the pandemic. At first glance, the harms of marijuana appear equally worrisome. By using cannabis before the age of 25, young people can permanently damage their brains, wreaking havoc with their ability to learn, remember, solve problems and pay attention, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Daily marijuana use\u00a0raises the risk of stroke by 42%\u00a0and heart attack by 25%, even if there is no prior history of heart disease and the person has never smoked or vaped tobacco, according to a February 2024 study. Weed has\u00a0also been linked\u00a0to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation; myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle;\u00a0spasms of the heart\u2019s arteries\u00a0and a higher risk of\u00a0heart failure. However, many participants in those cardiovascular studies are smoking or vaping marijuana instead of ingesting it, said Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician and cannabis specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who authored \u201cSeeing\u00a0 Through the Smoke: A Cannabis Specialist Untangles the Truth About Marijuana.\u201d \u201cNo doctor recommends smoking marijuana, unless someone is in acute pain or has cancer and is on chemotherapy, when they might want the faster pain relief that comes from inhaling,\u201d Grinspoon said. Burning anything, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, creates\u00a0toxic compounds that are harmful to health when inhaled, said marijuana reseracher Dr. Beth Cohen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cCannabis smoke contains toxins, carcinogens, and particulate matter that have been linked to cancer, lung damage, and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cWith potential harms for any substance, we would expect to see a dose response. So, I\u2019m particularly concerned about the increases in daily or near daily use of cannabis.\u201d In fact, marijuana smoke may even be more harmful than tobacco because users hold the hot smoke in their lungs longer to maximize their high. A March 2021 study by Boyd found teens twice as likely to report \u201cwheezing or whistling\u201d in the chest after vaping marijuana than after smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes. \u201cNew data is beginning to show\u00a0that secondhand marijuana smoke may be just as dangerous as the primary smoke,\u201d Robert Page II, a\u00a0professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora, told CNN in a prior interview. However, there are many other options than inhaling marijuana smoke, Grinspoon said, including \u201cusing topicals like oils, lotions or a skin patch, or a suppository, or a tincture put under the tongue or in tea, or an edible. You don\u2019t have to smoke the cannabis.\u201d There is a problem, however. Research on edibles, such as baked goods, candies and beverages, and other methods of using cannabis is in its infancy. Whether there are longer-term impacts on human health than ingesting too much at one sitting and getting an uncomfortable high are unknown. \u201cWe do not yet know risks of daily use of edibles \u2014 thus, I cannot say whether the trend will end up as a healthy one,\u201d Boyd said in email. \u201cRegulation is uneven, products vary, and use is still illegal under federal law. We need better data!\u201d \u2018Like the Wild West\u2019 B lives in Georgia, a state where only medical marijuana is allowed. Therefore, B began using hemp-based gummies laced with delta-9, the most abundant form of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the part of the cannabis plant that creates a high. The synthetic form used in edibles is called delta-9 THC-O acetate. With the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which removed the hemp plant from the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s schedule of controlled substances, B can buy numerous brands of hemp gummies nearly everywhere, including her local gas station. \u201cFirst, I want to commend her for giving up alcohol,\u201d said Grinspoon, who is on the board of the advocacy group Doctors for Drug Policy Reform, which addresses cannabis, psychedelic and drug regulation in general. \u201cBut the hemp products she buys at the gas station or liquor store or the like are completely unregulated, sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids like delta-8, delta-9 and delta 10 that are pretty cheap to make. \u201cThat\u2019s really dangerous for a million reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in these new synthetic cannabinoids. You can get all kinds of industrial byproducts, a mixture of all kinds of synthetics, or an extremely high or low dose of the synthetic. It\u2019s like the Wild West out there.\u201d \u201cPotentially harmful chemicals \u201care needed to convert cannabinoids in hemp into synthetic products like delta 8, according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while manufacturing may \u201coccur in uncontrolled or unsanitary settings.\u201d Of the nearly 2,400 calls about delta 8 to the National Poison Center in one year from 2021 to 2022, 70% required a doctor\u2019s care and 8% were admitted, the FDA said. One child died. A June 2018 review of existing literature on synthetic versions of cannabis found they may cause more severe adverse effects, which could include breathing problems, a spike in blood pressure, chest pain and a rapidly beating heart, cognitive impairment. anxiety, agitation, suicidal ideation, and even death. \u201cIn and of itself, it\u2019s not good that more people are using cannabis,\u201d Grinspoon said. However, If they are going to use it to replace alcohol, he added, \u201cpeople should be buying marijuana and hemp cannabis products at a legal, regulated dispensary in a state where the product is tracked from beginning to end and tested along the way.\u201d If a person chooses to buy weed or hemp online or at a smoke shop, be sure to choose a product with a label that shows they have paid an independent outside company to assure the purity of their products, he said. \u201cMy other advice for people who want to use weed is to get educated,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t smoke it. Start at a very low dose and go slow. Don\u2019t use it before driving. And get it from a medical marijuana dispensary or well-regulated legal shop, as that is much safer than these hemp-derived products that are unregulated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_fda-committee-recommends-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-donanemab", "text": "On Monday, a panel of independent advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted to endorse Eli Lilly\u2019s drug donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease, agreeing that it was safe and effective. One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, killing more people than prostate and breast cancer combined. Donanemab works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildups in the brain  that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These plaques are harmful deposits that can form in the brain as people age. Removing the plaque seems to slow down the brain changes that seem to happen with Alzheimer\u2019s. As the drug enters the brain it binds to the amyloid plaques and its presence catches the attention of the immune system that facilitates the plaque removal. There is no cure and there is still no drug to prevent the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, but donanemab and Leqembi, another drug that is already on the market made by Eisai and Biogen, has been shown to slow the progression of the disease in its early stages. Lilly told the FDA\u2019s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee that its data from late-stage clinical research showed \u201chighly meaningful results\u201d for patients who took donanemab, with a 37% lower risk of progression of the disease over a year and a half compared to patients who got the placebo. Serious adverse events were \u201cgenerally comparable\u201d among all the groups in the trials, and were infrequent, Lilly told the committee, occurring in only 2% of patients. The patients on donanemab had a slightly higher mortality rate \u2014 2%, compared with 1.7% in the placebo arm of the trial. Three people died while taking the drug after developing ARIA, or micro-hemorrhages known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. In trials of Leqembi, the drug that\u2019s already on the market, some patients experienced ARIA, but it was at a lower rate than seen in the donanemab trial. Leqembi has also been tied to patient deaths. Since most donanemab patients who experienced problems with ARIA did so in the first six weeks of the trial, Lilly told the committee that it added another MRI to the trial to look for the problem before giving the patient a second infusion. The aim would be to detect patients with asymptomatic ARIA. If it was detected, providers would pause treatment so it could resolve and not become more serious or symptomatic. Looking at these results from the late-stage clinical trials, the FDA committee voted on\u00a0two specific questions and discussed three other main topics. The committee voted an unanimous \u201cyes\u201d to the questions of whether the data showed that the drug is effective for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and whether the benefits of the drug outweighed the risks in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s in the population enrolled in the clinical trials. The FDA will take the committee\u2019s advice into consideration as it decides whether to greenlight the drug. Committee member\u00a0Dr. Dean Follmann, assistant director for Biostatistics at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he voted yes because the evidence \u201cwas strong and consistent across subgroups.\u201d In voting yes, Sarah Dolan, the acting consumer representative on the committee and a consultant with the Critical Path Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said she was pleased with the outcome of\u00a0the research. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge unmet medical need here that hopefully can be addressed,\u201d Dolan said. Committee member Dr. Kathleen Poston, the director of Stanford Movement Disorders Center, said she voted yes believing there was a benefit to the drug, \u201cas long as the risks are being monitored.\u201d The trials only included patients that had low-medium levels of tau, a protein that can become abnormal and contribute to the disease. Lilly excluded patients that had no or very low tau because the study wouldn\u2019t follow the patients long enough to see if the drug made a difference. They also excluded people with high amounts of tau. The committee had some concern about extrapolating the results to a subset of patients with other levels of tau; they wanted to see more data. The majority of the committee also wasn\u2019t comfortable with the FDA requiring a tau PET test to determine if a patient was eligible to take the drug\u00a0since the test is not widely available and would make it difficult for some people to get the drug. The\u00a0FDA also asked the committee to consider additional factors about ongoing research and factors related to the possible administration of the drug. Lilly suggests patients may be able to stop the drug if they show enough progress on it. The committee suggested research would have to show what would be the appropriate criteria to stop or restart the drug if symptoms came back. The committee also noted that there was little diversity in the trial, most participants were White, and said future research will need to include more people of color to understand how the drug works in diverse populations. The committee also noted that if the drug is approved, doctors will have to educate their patients about the benefit versus the risk of taking this medication. Initially, when the FDA said that it was going to hold this meeting, it came as a\u00a0surprise announcement\u00a0since many experts had thought the drug would have been approved by the FDA\u00a0last year. Before the votes, Dr. Reisa Sperling, a professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School told the committee that without treatments, the growing number of people with Alzheimer\u2019s could become a serious threat to the country. \u201cWe\u2019re doing such a good job at keeping people alive longer, we are creating a public health emergency if we don\u2019t find a way to stave off this disease,\u201d Sperling said. In the meantime, Lilly said it is working on additional Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cRecognizing the enormous burden this disease carries, we take the responsibility of bringing a well characterized disease modifying therapy to patients very seriously,\u201d Dr. David Hyman, chief medical officer with Eli Lilly and Company told the committee. Lilly views donanemab as \u201can important but ultimately incremental\u201d step in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Ultimately, Hyman said Lilly would like to develop a drug that would treat the disease before someone even starts to show symptoms and are working on such a drug. \u201cPatients deserve more, and we continue to work on additional approaches to address this disease,\u201d Hyman said. After the meeting, Lilly said it was happy with the committee\u2019s positive vote. \u201cWe are pleased with the committee\u2019s unanimous recognition of donanemab\u2019s positive benefit-risk profile,\u201d said Mark Mintun, Eli Lilly\u2019s group vice president of neuroscience research and development in a news release. \u201cWe look forward to bringing this treatment option to patients.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Association had urged the committee to recommend approval of donanemab, welcomed the committee\u2019s unanimous vote in favor of the drug. \u201cA future with more approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatments is a tremendous advancement for people eligible for these drugs,\u201d said Dr. Joanne Pike, Alzheimer\u2019s Association President and CEO. \u201cProgress with treatment is happening.\u201d USAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s, a national nonprofit, that testified in favor of the drug during the public comment period in the meeting said that there is an urgency and a \u201cmassive unmet need\u201d for Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cIf approved by the FDA, donanemab would be the second drug on the market to help people in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s live a better quality of life for a longer period of time, while providing patients and their doctors with another option for their treatment plans,\u201d said chair and co-founder George Vradenburg. \u201cWe are grateful to the advisory committee for its endorsement of this promising treatment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/fda-committee-recommends-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-donanemab/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_plant-based-junk-food-study-wellness", "text": "Want to reduce your risk of developing chronic disease and live longer while also helping the planet? Eat a plant-based diet, experts say. Does that mean you can fill your plate with boxed macaroni and cheese, deep-dish frozen veggie pizza or fast-food French fries and have a doughnut or three for dessert? While all of those ultraprocessed choices may be meat-free, they are not without risk, said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston Medical School in Birmingham, United Kingdom. \u201cWe can\u2019t always assume plant-based means healthy, as after all sugar is plant-based,\u201d Mellor said in a statement. \u201cMany foods that do not contain animal products, which includes biscuits, crisps, confectionary and soft drinks, are technically plant-based but would not be considered essential as part of a healthy diet by the majority of people.\u201d In fact, eating such plant-based junk foods dramatically raises bad cholesterol and hypertension and can lead to associated heart disease and early death, according to a new study authors call \u201cthe first\u201d to show ultraprocessed plant foods are associated with an increase in the risk of cardiovascular diseases. \u201cEating plant-based products can be beneficial, acting as protection against health problems, or it can represent a risk \u2014 it all depends on the level of processing of these foods,\u201d said senior study author Renata Levy, a researcher in the Epidemiological Research Center in Nutrition and Health at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, known as Nupens/USP, in Brazil. Ultraprocessed foods undergo multiple industrial processes, such as heating, fracking of nutrients and proteins, molding and compression, and have added chemicals to cosmetically alter color, smell, taste and texture. Foods in this category are formulated to be hyper-palatable to human taste buds and are often extremely convenient, requiring little to no preparation time. Unprocessed foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs and milk.\u00a0Minimally processed foods\u00a0include culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils, and foods such as canned goods and frozen vegetables that combine culinary ingredients with unprocessed foods. \u201cFood additives and industrial contaminants present in these foods might cause oxidative stress and inflammation, further aggravating the risks,\u201d said first author Fernanda Rauber, a researcher with Nupens/USP. \u201cTherefore, our results support the shift towards plant-based food choices that consider the degree of processing to improve cardiovascular health outcomes,\u201d Rauber said in a statement.

More than 118,000 people between the ages of 40 and 69 years answered questions about their diet. That information was later linked to hospital and mortality records on the development of cardiovascular risk factors. Ultraprocessed foods made from plants increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by 5% while increasing the risk of early death by 13%, the study found. Researchers also found that each 10% replacement of plant-based ultraprocessed foods with fresh, frozen or minimally processed plants lowered the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 7% while offering a 13% reduction in the risk of dying from heart disease. The study also looked at plant-based meat products, such as sausages, nuggets and burgers, which by their very nature fall into the ultraprocessed bucket. However, it was hard to determine just how much risk those foods carried, said Peter Scarborough, a professor of population health at the University of Oxford in the UK. He was not involved in the study. \u201cPlant-based meat alternatives make up only 0.5% of all the plant-based ultraprocessed foods included in this paper,\u201d Scarborough said in a statement. Over half of the plant-based ultraprocessed foods studied in the paper were packaged breads, pastries, buns, cakes and cookies. \u201cIt is therefore very difficult to conclude from this paper that plant-based meat alternatives are bad for your health,\u201d Scarborough added. In addition, much of what is reported in the paper is already known, said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt is well accepted that well-balanced plant-based diets such as the Mediterranean or DASH diets are favorable for cardiovascular health and these already emphasize avoiding unhealthy foods such as crisps etc., sugar sweetened beverages, cakes, biscuits and confectionary,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThese latter foods are unhealthy regardless of whether they are made industrially or home-made.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/plant-based-junk-food-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other. Doing so should allow the satellites to collect data about phenomena that take place on a short time scale and require frequent measurements \u2014 such as how the amount of cloud cover affects the temperature on Earth beneath it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/world/nasa-prefire-mission-launch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Looking back, Tammy Maida, 67, said things started to change in her late 50s. At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

But even with those worries, I have some leverage, whether it\u2019s the keys or the Wi-Fi password. It\u2019s the things I can\u2019t control that keep my mind running all night. It\u2019s a scary road for a parent to contemplate because of what I see out there. There is the \u201cmanosphere,\u201d the collection of male influencers who plant seeds of hate in our young boys\u2019 ears. That self-hate can turn inward until it explodes, either in self-harm, partner violence or mass shootings. That\u2019s what keeps me up at night. That\u2019s what Ruth Whippman tackles in her new book, \u201cBoyMom: Reimagining Boyhood in the Age of Impossible Masculinity,\u201d which published on Tuesday. \u201cI was pregnant with my third son when the #MeToo movement just exploded,\u201d Whippman told me. \u201cI realized at that moment there was just this rolling horror show of bad news about men.\u201d The journalist, cultural critic and documentary filmmaker realized that #MeToo was exposing a \u201cdeep, systemic problem\u201d with the way that we raise and socialize boys. \u201cThe fact that this experience of sexual violence and sexual assault is so common \u2014 there is somewhere that we\u2019re going wrong. It\u2019s clearly a blind spot.\u201d Whippman takes her audience into those influences our boys are exposed to, including the incel population, the pull of the false machismo of men influencers and the world that our sons are expected to join as adults. I sat down with Whippman to learn about her experiences as a boy mom, what worries her as a parent and the surprising things she discovered during research for her book. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: You start \u201cBoyMom\u201d with an interesting fact that baby boys are not nurtured as much as girls. How so?  Ruth Whippman: They\u2019re about six weeks behind baby girls (in development), so a baby boy needs more help with self-regulating with emotions. They need more early care, but they get less. And there is a ton of research and studies that show that. But the way that parents respond to baby boys \u2014 they project all these masculine qualities into them. So, when they cry, parents assume they\u2019re angry rather than sad, and they pick them up less. They give them less positive touch. They use less emotional language. This is a pattern that goes on all the way through childhood into adulthood. So, all of the things that we think of as caregiving and nurturing \u2014 baby girls receive more of that. So, boys need more, and they get less. That has really long-term implications for the development of empathy, social skills and morality. CNN: As boys grow, you say that they are not taught relationship skills or emotional development. The stories we read to boys are different than what we read to girls.  Whippman: This is something that really surprised me, because it was so invisible to me that this was even absent. It would have been so normal for me to read about relationships as a young girl. My boys will never read a story like that unless I actively go and give it to them. There are very, very few role models for boys or stories for boys \u2014 movies, TV shows and books \u2014 where (boys) are saying that they have to take on emotional labor, that they have to think about other people\u2019s feelings, track them and worry about letting somebody down.Their stories are always about adventure, battles and fighting. It all contributes to boys not growing up with a model of how to be a fully formed, relational, connected human being. I see it with my kids all the time. CNN: What pressures does society put on boys as they reach school age?  Whippman: We give boys this vision that\u2019s all about being almost superhuman in the hero narratives and these stories where boys see themselves as being special and important and the main character \u2014 but they have to be emotionally invulnerable. They can\u2019t admit to weakness or admit to (having) feelings. They have to be the best. They have to be better than girls and women. The story is that boys get girls, and women generally tend to be these kinds of side characters that boys get as prizes for being heroes. The damaging part of it is that in a million ways we communicated to boys that they need to be strong. They need to be stoic. They can\u2019t admit their feelings, that they can\u2019t be weak. We teach that sort of intimacy and vulnerability goes for women, but not men. So, I think this has a huge impact on their mental health. CNN: How does that translate into how they act in school and with their peers?  Whippman: Boys\u2019 issues are seen as behavioral problems rather than emotional deficiencies. We see boys as this kind of angry, masculine characters that are acting out rather than the sort of vulnerable emotional beings they are. We tell them it\u2019s shameful to be sad and to cry and to show weakness. We teach them to cope with their emotions such as anger or destructiveness on their own. We don\u2019t give them other outlets or other tools to express their emotions. We don\u2019t see the hurt and the emotions behind it. They\u2019re scared to reach out, and they don\u2019t get the help they need. They get deeper and deeper into these toxic spaces. On the one hand, they\u2019re the most hate-filled, horrifying, misogynistic, racist spaces. But there\u2019s also this brotherhood amongst many of them. These are spaces where they find connection, and I think that is the problem. CNN: Explain the term incel. In \u201cBoyMom,\u201d you spend time with this population. Who are they? Whippman: They\u2019re kind of unique within the manosphere because they are the guys who are (considered) losers in this system, as they say themselves. Involuntarily celibate. They\u2019re very lonely, generally very depressed, and they\u2019ve given up hope. They think feminists are to blame for everything and men are the real victims. This is very twisted, very horrible politics, and it comes along with a lot of misogyny. You can\u2019t get women because it\u2019s predecided (by this system). CNN: What were the biggest surprises for you when talking with the involuntary celibate?  Whippman: One was that the of level of connection and brotherhood and tenderness between men, which was really shocking to me. I was so surprised that in all the places to find it, it was there and then. I mean a lot of them are horrifying misogynists. And I went in depth with one guy who really was like that. But I think I saw a lot of just sadness and trauma and feeling stuck and feeling like they had no hope to get anywhere else. They couldn\u2019t really see therapy. They thought they\u2019d been boxed so far into this corner that if they went to talk to a therapist, that they would get rejected and told the same narrative, which is \u201cyou\u2019re so privileged, shut up.\u201d Which I think is a real narrative in our culture. One of the biggest surprises was I expected incels to be these very fringe people, who were saying something completely different from the kind of so-called regular boys would say. It really shocked me just how similar they were to many of the sort of so-called regular boys that I talked to. That all the concerns that they were raising about loneliness, about friendship, about masculinity, about feeling emasculated, about the pressures of masculinity, all those things were actually just very mainstream. CNN: Did you find any correlation between their father\u2019s masculinity and behavior and their own judgment of themselves? Whippman: Several guys said to me that their father had always said, \u201cMan up.\u201d I think that fathers are probably doing this out of love.\u00a0I think fathers often encourage their boys to be tough and masculine and not to cry or express emotions out of love, because that is how they were taught, and that is how they think their sons need to be to survive in the\u00a0world. They want to protect their sons and (are) probably doing it the best way they know how because that\u2019s how they were taught. But these messages are so harmful, and they have lasting consequences. I saw it all over with boys who have different backgrounds.  CNN: How do we reconcile these two halves of men? How do we keep traditionally masculine-identified values such as courage and assertiveness, and encourage feminine-identified values such as empathy and sensitivity? Whippman: We start from the beginning. Take the gendered expectations out of those words. Bravery, courage, strength, assertiveness, empathy, humanity, nurturing and caregiving are human qualities. Get away from girls do this, boys do that. Then we would give people, boys and girls, more ability to be fully human. CNN: How do we as individual men support the boys and men in our lives?  Whippman: We need to change the cultural conversation and give respect and admiration to the men who are trying to change the narrative and the women who are trying to help them in that effort. In the home, I think it\u2019s about making time for emotions with boys. Try to see boys as these emotional things, give them role models who express emotions, whether that\u2019s in real life from dads, families and communities. Boys and men don\u2019t have the vocabulary to talk about this problem. We don\u2019t know what to even call the harm that the patriarchy has caused to men. The more we talk about it, the more we can name it, the more we can correct it.

{"id": "2024_06_06_health_mpox-vaccine-lgbtq-pride-month", "text": "As the LGBTQ+ community gears up for Pride celebrations this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hopes people will get more than just their rainbow gear and sunscreen ready. The agency is urging more people \u2013 particularly some gay and bisexual men \u2013 to get the mpox vaccine. The US Department of Health and Human Services plans to be at dozens of Pride and community events across the country to remind people that mpox is still a problem in the United States, but with vaccination, it doesn\u2019t have to be. Anyone can get sick with mpox, the painful and sometimes deadly disease formerly known as monkeypox. But in the global outbreak that started in 2022, certain members of the LGBTQ+ community are considered especially vulnerable. According to recent case reports, 90% of those who got mpox in the US during this outbreak who reported their sexual orientation were men who identified as gay or bisexual. And nearly all of those who got sick were unvaccinated. \u201cFor folks who have not yet gotten two doses of the Jynneos vaccine, it\u2019s really important for protecting them from this disease,\u201d said Alex Tuttle, an epidemiologist with the Poxvirus and Rabies Branch of the CDC. \u201cAbout a quarter of the population that we believe is at risk is currently vaccinated, so we really want to push that up, especially as we\u2019re going into these summer months where risk might be heightened a little bit.\u201d Mpox is a viral disease that can spread easily between people and from infected animals. It can spread through close contact such as touching, kissing or sex, as well as through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles, according to the World Health Organization. Symptoms include a fever, a painful rash, headache, muscle and back pain, low energy and enlarged lymph nodes. For decades, the disease had largely been found in Central and West Africa, but in the 2022 outbreak, cases also began spreading in Europe and North America. Case numbers in the US remain stable and are nowhere near as high as in 2022, when WHO declared the outbreak in North America and Europe a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But there were about 59 new cases a week reported in the US as of the end of April, according to a report published in May, which Tuttle co-authored. By comparison, at the height of the outbreak in 2022, there were about 3,000 new cases reported per week in the US. Another report published by the CDC Thursday looked at the kinds of patients who were seeking care at their local emergency room for mpox between June and December of last year. Of the 196 patients with rashes that doctors suspected could be mpox, three actually were infected. All three were gay or bisexual men who who engaged in sex with one or more partners that they initially met through dating apps. None had been vaccinated. Other studies have shown that the vaccine, which is now commercially available, can help keep people safe. A recent report confirmed that two doses of the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic are highly effective in preventing many mpox cases. If someone who was vaccinated did get sick, the vaccine can reduce the severity of symptoms. There have been scattered reports of infections among vaccinated people, including one cluster in May 2023 in Chicago, but these cases are rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases, the CDC said. Mpox isn\u2019t just an uncomfortable inconvenience. About 10% of people who got sick with mpox in the US in the latest outbreak were hospitalized, and five have died since October. People with compromised immune systems, particularly those with advanced HIV, have more severe infections, the CDC says. Another reason to get the vaccine is the threat of a deadlier version of the virus known as clade I, which carries a case fatality rate of up to 10%, compared with 0.1% to 3.6% for clade II, the version currently in circulation in the US. This version of the disease, the CDC said, is also more transmissible. It hasn\u2019t made its way to the US yet, but it is at the heart of an outbreak that the CDC is monitoring in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tuttle said the Jynneos vaccine should protect against clade I as well as clade II. \u201cThe measures that we have right now, both the vaccine and any of the antivirals, are expected to work on both clade I and clade II of the virus, should it come here,\u201d Tuttle said. Brian Hujdich, executive director of the\u00a0National Coalition for LGBT Health, said his organization and others will continue to work hard to encourage mpox vaccination. \u201cWith all the Pride events over the summer and just being summertime, there\u2019s going to be more interaction. And we\u2019ve seen already that there has been an increase in Virginia and in New York City and in some other locations,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it might not be in numbers that get a lot of attention, but even a small increase can be a preamble to an outbreak.\u201d The CDC is working with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, local organizations and community health partners on what it calls the Summer of Pride initiative, which includes a campaign to remind people that although mpox case numbers have declined significantly, the threat has not disappeared. \u201cI do think some people are surprised that it is still a problem,\u201d said Adrianna Boulin, director of racial equity, social justice and community engagement at Fenway Health, an organization that advocates for and delivers equitable care focused on the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cLast year, we had such a robust program of getting education and information out to people, and we saw mpox rates decline initially, so everyone is surprised, like \u2018wow, this is still an issue.\u2019 It\u2019s important for everyone to know about it, because it can impact all of us.\u201d Boulin, who is also president of Boston Pride of the People, the group that puts on that city\u2019s Pride parade and celebrations on June 8, said there is a health corner at the festival where a number of organizations will talk about the programs and services they offer, including information about the mpox vaccine. Fenway had been running mpox vaccination clinics when the outbreak started, but as the number of cases declined, fewer people were showing up, so it now offers the vaccine by appointment only. Across the country, doses have become much more readily available than early in the outbreak, when people had to stand in long lines at special clinics. Now, pharmacies and many regular medical providers have the vaccine. In addition to the big Pride festival, Fenway Health plans to be at several other LGBTQ events, Boulin said, and at each, workers will talk about mpox. \u201cPeople are excited that they\u2019re outside at these events and they\u2019re motivated, they\u2019re open, they\u2019re listening, and so those are all recipes for really getting information out to folks that they need to help their health,\u201d Boulin said. Key West Pride, which is one of the first of the year and runs from from June 5 to 9, said it will also have a visible health organization presence that will offer educational materials at its Street Fair/Dance Party about mpox and the benefits of the mpox vaccine. The local department of health also provides resources on mpox and vaccination, he said. Hujdich said an important message that health organizations will want to emphasize is that mpox vaccines provide not only protection but real peace of mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be worried about being in contact with people if you\u2019ve been vaccinated,\u201d Hujdich said, \u201cSo it gives you the freedom to enjoy and be proud during Pride.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/mpox-vaccine-lgbtq-pride-month/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and they went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products. The February 2023 erythritol in study found the risk of heart attack and stroke nearly doubled within three years when people had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood. For the new study on xylitol, the results were basically the same \u2014 people with the highest levels of xylitol compared to those with the lowest levels had nearly twice the risk of heart attack, stroke and death, Hazen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a receptor on our platelets, which we as yet don\u2019t understand, that is recognizing this molecule and signaling to the platelet to be more prone to clot,\u201d he said. \u201cOur tastebuds can\u2019t tell the difference in the structures between sugar and these other sweeteners, but clearly our platelets can.\u201d The World Health Organization warned consumers in 2023 to avoid artificial sweeteners for weight loss, and has called for additional research on the long-term toxicity of low- and no-calorie sweeteners, the study said. \u201cThrough their work, the investigators have shined a light on the safety of sugar substitutes. There is more to learn,\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s Tomey said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is worth remembering that sugar substitutes are no substitute for a sincere commitment to the several elements of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_illegal-e-cigarettes-new-task-force", "text": "Federal health officials are partnering with the US Department of Justice to fight the illegal sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. The US Food and Drug Administration and Justice Department announced Monday that they are creating a task force to target the issue. The task force will include people from the US Marshals Service, US Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies to identify and target illegal sales and distribution of e-cigarettes. \u201cUnauthorized e-cigarettes and vaping products continue to jeopardize the health of Americans \u2013 particularly children and adolescents \u2013 across the country,\u201d Benjamin Mizer, the acting associate attorney general with the Justice Department, said in a news release Monday. \u201cThis interagency Task Force is dedicated to protecting Americans by combatting the unlawful sale and distribution of these products,\u201d Mizer said. \u201cAnd the establishment of this Task Force makes clear that vigorous enforcement of the tobacco laws is a government-wide priority.\u201d While the FDA has authorized the sale of 23 specific tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices to date, several unauthorized e-cigarettes have emerged illegally on the market, some of which appeal to minors. More than 1 in 10 young adults in the United States regularly use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey found that about 2.1 million youth reported currently using e-cigarettes. Under current regulations, new tobacco products must receive marketing authorization from the FDA before they can be sold; pre-existing e-cigarette products have been allowed to remain on the market, but the agency has asked\u00a0manufacturers to submit applications to keep them there. The new federal task force will hone in on several issues, \u201cincluding investigating and prosecuting new criminal, civil, seizure and forfeiture actions,\u201d according to the news release, and violations \u201ccan result in felony convictions and significant criminal fines and civil monetary penalties,\u201d as well as the seizures of unauthorized products. \u201cEnforcement against illegal e-cigarettes is a multi-pronged issue that necessitates a multi-pronged response,\u201d Dr. Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in the news release. \u201cThis \u2018All Government\u2019 approach \u2013 including the creation of this new Task Force - will bring the collective resources and experience of the federal government to bear on this pressing public health issue.\u201d The creation of this new task force comes after the FDA has issued more than 1,100 warning letters to several distributors, manufacturers, importers and retailers for illegally selling or distributing unauthorized tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. In December, the FDA announced seizing about 1.4 million units of unauthorized e-cigarette products. \u201cThe U.S. Marshals Service Asset Forfeiture Division stands ready to work with our Task Force partners in the seizure of unauthorized e-cigarettes from domestic distributors seeking to sell them unlawfully,\u201d Ronald Davis, director of the US Marshals Service, said in Monday\u2019s news release. Meanwhile, the American Lung Association has announced that it applauds the launch of the new federal task force. \u201cFor too long, manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers have acted without regard for the law or public health. The Lung Association has urged enhanced law enforcement actions be taken to hold manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors accountable for selling illegal tobacco products and to protect the public health, especially children\u2019s health,\u201d Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement Monday. He added that youth vaping is a \u201cserious\u201d public health concern. \u201cMany of the illegal e-cigarettes currently on the market are flavored products, which attract youth,\u201d Wimmer said in part. \u201cThe American Lung Association commends the DOJ, FDA and other agencies involved in this task force.

Research shows that art experiences, whether as a maker or a beholder, transform our biology by rewiring our brains and triggering the release of neurochemicals, hormones and endorphins. In response to a growing body of evidence that art can radically improve both physical and mental health in effective and measurable ways, more health care practitioners are prescribing arts engagement as part of treating a wide array of conditions, including: obesity, heart disease, chronic pain, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, loneliness and depression. The power of diverse arts practices to promote healing, well-being and even longevity provides benefits that rank right up there with exercise, nutrition and sleep, argued Susan Magsamen in her bestseller, \u201cYour Brain on Art: How the Arts Transform Us,\u201d coauthored with Ivy Ross. Could this be why the arts have evolved over millennia to become central to human experience? \u201cI always thought of art as a luxury,\u201d conceded Bianca Bosker in her new book, \u201cGet the Picture: A Mind-Bending Journey among the Inspired Artists and Obsessive Art Fiends Who Taught Me How to See.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t feed you, house you or be used to kill predators.\u201d But she discovered that many scientists consider art a basic human need. \u201cArt is one of our oldest creations (humans invented paint long before the wheel), one of the earliest means of communication (we drew long, long, long,\u00a0long\u00a0before we could write), and one of our most universal urges,\u201d she wrote. Both Bosker and Magsamen recommend that everyone make art a daily practice, based on evidence and experience. Here\u2019s why they see art as anything but a luxury. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: You both argue that art is fundamental to human existence. How do you explain that to skeptics? Susan Magsamen: We are literally physiologically wired for the arts. Input from our senses builds connections among our brains\u2019 86 billion neurons. Engaging with art, whether as a spectator or creator, actually brings information into our bodies and profoundly impacts our biological circuitry. Art\u2019s simultaneous activation of multiple neurological and physiological systems \u2014 a unique evolutionary phenomenon \u2014 involves the entire brain, body and spirit. The next time you feel moved by your favorite song, consider that an artist\u2019s choices are changing you on a cellular level. Bianca Bosker: Many experts agree that art is both an innate human impulse and a biological predisposition that has helped our species survive. It\u2019s only a modern-day misconception that looking at art is purely philosophical or intellectual. At its core, art is a physical experience \u2014 and that applies not only to music \u2014 with its thrumming bass that you can feel \u2014 but also to painting and visual arts as well. For the past 100 years or so, society has focused on the ideas behind artwork \u2014 that the thought trumps the thing. But when you watch artists making art, it is a physical experience. It\u2019s practically athletic. Engaging with artwork in person, as two bodies in space, is crucial. Research shows that factors like an artwork\u2019s size, or how we move around it, can change how we value art. \u00a0You can think about connecting with art the way you do with people. Just as a virtual meeting with someone is different from sitting across the dinner table, it\u2019s very different to look at a tiny image of an artwork on Instagram than it is to be body to body with, for example, a huge Mark Rothko painting. There\u2019s fascinating anecdotal evidence of how artworks can act on people at a physical level. The term \u201cStendhal syndrome\u201d describes people going to pieces \u2014 struck with dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, fainting spells or crying \u2014 in front of pieces of art. Stories like how a woman in a museum in Houston stripped naked in front of a Cy Twombly\u00a0\u00a0 painting suggest that, on a physical level, art can move us to do some incredible things. Magsamen: Not all artworks are positive, of course. It\u2019s critical to consider the kinds of sensorial experiences you bring into your life because of their power to make you feel, change your mood and affect your body. CNN: Bianca, you discuss finding value in some art experiences that might be considered unpleasant. What are the benefits of work that confuses us or makes us uncomfortable? Bosker: The fact that art isn\u2019t always pleasant is often part of its power. Scientists have puzzled over this question of why, over the last many thousands of years, humans have continued to keep engaging with art, even when, as they put it, it can \u201churt our sense of beauty.\u201d One compelling explanation is that we\u2019re drawn to uncomfortable, confounding images and experiences because our brains love the prediction errors they offer, aka surprises. Some researchers think art helps us fight the reducing tendencies of our minds. Contrary to common assumptions, we do not see the world like a video camera, dispassionately recording what\u2019s around us. Instead, our brains evolved to compress reality, acting like trash compactors, and for good reason. Oversimplifying our view of the world enabled us to spot the lion jumping out to eat us. But that ability also comes with risks. As some scientists put it, vision is a hallucination. What we\u2019re seeing is a construction based on our own individual filters of expectation that preemptively sort, dismiss and prioritize all the raw data coming in, even before we get the full picture. Looking at art can yank off those filters, surprising us and knocking our brains off their well-worn pathways. The glitch that art introduces is a gift that opens us to experiencing more nuance and beauty in the world around us. Magsamen: Art that pushes us beyond our limits helps form new neural pathways that might not otherwise develop in our day-to-day. Exercising these through art can help build resilience to get us through the suffering and uncertainties of life. When you\u2019re in despair, entering a church or other grand building can evoke awe, wonder and the sense of something bigger than you. Similarly, art, music and design\u00a0\u00a0 can alter our moods, taking us outside of ourselves. Building that capacity is an evolutionary imperative. CNN: What physiological benefits do the arts bring? Magsamen: Pinning down a definition of art can make some of the research tricky, but what we know suggests that artworks have very real effects on our mental and physical well-being. Physicians around the world prescribe visits to museums, engagement with arts and encounters with beauty. Different art forms affect the brain and body in different ways. Just as when we are prescribed medications, (it\u2019s true that) types, doses and durations of art work differently for different people. Doctors, social workers and public health practitioners are beginning to understand enough to collaborate with their clients to personalize their recommendations of particular artistic endeavors in specific frequencies and amounts to effect beneficial outcomes. Like exercise and good nutrition, engaging in the arts routinely will support your health. CNN: How can people develop an art practice to get those benefits? Bosker: Everything you need to have a meaningful experience with art is right in front of you. You don\u2019t need to have studied art history or spent years going to art fairs. You need attention and curiosity. An artist gave me great advice on how to engage with a work\u2014just try to notice five things about a piece, either in the work or in how it makes you feel.\u00a0Like,\u00a0\u201cThis pink makes me want to lick it\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201cThis green won\u2019t let me look away.\u201d The other foundational advice I give is to slow down. Many museum\u00a0visitors spend more time reading the description of the art than looking at the art itself, with the median time we spend with a work of art, both the piece and the label, being\u00a0just 21 seconds. Try \u201cslow looking.\u201d And pay attention to the physical form. Examining the artist\u2019s decisions offers you a pathway into the piece and a way to engage with art on your own terms. I used to take a scorched-earth approach to visiting museums with the attitude that seeing every single thing was how I\u2019d get my money\u2019s worth. That\u2019s the visual equivalent of binging at an all-you-can-eat buffet and then wondering why you feel ill. Instead of racing between masterpieces, spend more time with art that surprises you. And look for art everywhere, observing the everyday with an art mindset to counteract the reductionist tendencies of our brains. CNN: Do we have to be \u201cgood\u201d at art to reap its benefits? Magsamen: No. The art you\u2019re making doesn\u2019t have to be good for it to be valuable for you. One study showed that doing just 45 minutes of any kind of art lowered the stress hormone cortisol by as much as 25%.\u00a0\u00a0 Other research suggests artmaking builds skills in executive function, decision-making and, if you\u2019re working with others, collaboration. Playing music builds cognitive skills and enhances learning. And just one art experience per month can extend your life by 10 years. The process, not the product, is what\u2019s important. Bosker: You do not need any sort of license to engage with art. Art is a choice. It\u2019s a decision to fight against complacency and forge a life that\u2019s richer, more uncomfortable, more mind-blowing, more uncertain and ultimately, more beautiful.

{"id": "2024_06_04_health_cardiovascular-disease-report-2050", "text": "About 61% of US adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, new research from the American Heart Association predicts. The biggest driver of this trend will be the large number of people who have or will develop high blood pressure, which makes them much more likely to develop dangerous problems like a heart attack or stroke. Other cardiovascular problems include heart attacks, arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or a-fib, heart failure and congenital heart disease. Despite innovations in treatments, heart disease has been the leading killer of Americans for decades, responsible for more than 800,000 deaths every year. In the research published Tuesday, the association predicts that 45 million adults will have some form of cardiovascular disease \u2013 excluding high blood pressure \u2013 or will have a stroke in 2050, up from 28 million in 2020. An aging population will be another force behind these trends, as the older you get, the more likely you are to have heart problems. By 2050, 22% of the US will be over the age of 65, whereas seniors made up just 13% of the population 10 years ago, studies say. The median age in the US is projected to increase from 37 in 2010 to 41 in 2050, other research shows. The American population is also becoming more diverse, and communities of color tend to have a disproportionate number of heart problems. By 2050, people who identify as Hispanic will make up about a quarter of the US population, vs. about 20% today, and people who identify as Black will be 14.4% of the country, up from 13.6% today. The number of people who identify as Asian will also increase, from 6.2% of the population to 8.6%, according to US Census predictions. People who identify as Hispanic are projected to have the greatest population growth for cardiovascular disease or stroke, the new research says. Black adults now have the highest number of heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, the association\u2019s research shows. They also are projected to have the most problems with poor diet and an inadequate amount of sleep, both behaviors contribute to heart problems. The biggest overall increase among cardiovascular conditions will be in the number of people who have a stroke, the American Heart Association predicts, jumping from 3.9% to 6.4%. That would nearly double the number of people who have a stroke from 10 million to 20 million adults between 2020 and 2050. In terms of risk factors, growing numbers of people with obesity and/or diabetes will also raise the risk of heart problems. Poor diet, which can hurt heart health, is projected to be the health behavior that will affect the most people. The report suggests that nearly 70 million young adults alone will be eating poorly in 2050. The new research predicts that the number of people with obesity will increase from 43.1% to 60.6%, affecting more than 180 million people by 2050. The number with diabetes will increase from 16.3% to 26.8% and impact more than 80 million in that period, the report said. The report also offers a closer look at the heart health of children. It finds \u201cconcerning trends\u201d in key risk factors, including a predicted increase in the number of kids living with obesity, in large part due to a lack of exercise and poor diet. The report projects that the number of US children with obesity will jump from 20.6% in 2020 to 33% in 2050, meaning 26 million kids will have obesity by that time. There\u2019s one positive heart health note, the researchers said: The number of people with high cholesterol is projected to decline. It\u2019s been falling for years, studies show, due in part to the sharp increase in the number of people who take drugs called statins, which can reduce the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver. A 2023 study found that more than 92 million adults in the US \u2013 more than a third of the population \u2013 took a statin in 2018-19, a 197% increase from 2008-09. \u201cClinical and public health interventions are needed to effectively manage, stem, and even reverse these adverse trends,\u201d the researchers wrote. One significant change they suggest is the creation of clinical and policy interventions specifically to help people of color, who are already disproportionally affected by heart problems and who tend to have less access to basic affordable health care. Prevention efforts to improve population health would also be important, the researchers said, and would save the US a significant amount of money. The costs of cardiovascular problems \u2013 including direct health care costs and productivity losses \u2013 are expected to almost triple to more than $1.8 trillion by 2050.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/cardiovascular-disease-report-2050/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_male-birth-control-gel-wellness", "text": "After decades of false starts, researchers say they are finally making progress on a long-acting and reversible birth control option for men. The experimental product is a hormonal gel that men rub on their shoulders once daily. Over time, it blocks the production of sperm in the testes. The gel was developed by the National Institutes of Health and the nonprofit Population Council, and it takes much the same approach as birth control pills for women. It uses two hormones: nestorone, a progestin, and testosterone, the male sex hormone.\u00a0The nestorone suppresses the production of testosterone in the testes and, with it, the development of sperm. But testosterone serves many functions in the body: It is responsible for muscle maintenance and libido, for example, and men need some in their circulation to function normally. The gel replaces enough to keep them healthy but not so much that they make enough sperm to get someone pregnant. Researchers have been formulating and refining the dose and concentration of the gel since 2005.\u00a0In this latest test, which included more than 300 couples, they think they got it right. Normal sperm counts range from about 15 million to 200 million sperm per milliliter of semen, and studies have shown that sperm counts of less than 1 million per milliliter are low enough to prevent pregnancy. In a clinical trial, 86% of men achieved these low sperm counts by 15 weeks of using the gel.\u00a0For some, it worked even faster, suppressing sperm production within four to eight weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been just really excited by the results. The combination seems to provide better, faster suppression than we expected,\u201d said Diana Blithe, branch chief of the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who gave an update on the trial results this week at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Boston. Blithe declined to say whether there were any unintended pregnancies during the trial.\u00a0The researchers hope to have the final data published in a medical journal, and she said she didn\u2019t want to give away the results. \u201cI would say our expectation was that it would be similar to hormonal birth control pills. And I can just say that it\u2019s much, much better than that,\u201d she said. With typical use, birth control pills, rings and patches for women have failure rates of about 7%, meaning 7 women of every 100 who use the method for a year will get pregnant.\u00a0Condoms have a failure rate of about 13%. The gel also seems to have other advantages over female birth control. For example, if a woman misses a day or two of the pill, she can ovulate, making it more likely that she\u2019ll have an unintended pregnancy. With the gel, if a man\u2019s sperm production is fully suppressed and he misses a day or two of usage, his hormones would start to recover, but it takes about 8 to 10 weeks for a man\u2019s sperm count to recover to levels that would cause a pregnancy. Blithe says that in clinical trials, the researchers are not seeing the kind of mood swings and depression that women can experience with birth control pills, either. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s a small percentage who have mood swings that they don\u2019t like, but that\u2019s it\u2019s a relatively small number. And we\u2019ve actually been surprised at how few,\u201d she said. The World Health Organization tested injections that used a similar combination of hormones. The approach seemed effective, but the study enrollment was stopped early, in 2011, because the shots caused too many side effects, including serious depression. Blithe said that was because the hormones were clearing at different rates when injected.\u00a0With the gel, a concentration of hormones seems to build up in the skin and create a reservoir that releases more slowly. \u201cThat fluctuation is not really happening, so we\u2019re not creating ups and downs,\u201d she said. Matthew Trevi\u00f1o, 35, of Sacramento, California, participated in the study. He rubs a little gel on each shoulder first thing in the morning and says it\u2019s become as routine as showering and brushing his teeth. Aside from a little weight gain, he\u2019s had no complaints, he said.\u00a0If anything, his sex drive has increased. \u201cI\u2019ve only experienced increased libido,\u201d he told the \u201cUnfold\u201d podcast, which is produced by the University of California at Davis, which was also one of the study sites.  \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just lucking out, but I hope this is the case for the majority of participants. If it is, it\u2019s definitely going to change contraception as a whole.\u201d To participate in the study, couples had to be in committed relationships, and they signed on for a two-year commitment to the research. Men are warned that they could experience a number of side effects from the gel, including dry or oily skin, increased or decreased libido, hair growth or loss, and mood swings. For Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s partner, Emily Fletcher, 28, participating in the research meant giving up her own birth control \u2013 an IUD \u2013 and taking a big leap of faith right around the time the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. \u201cI was worried,\u201d she told \u201cUnfold.\u201d \u201cThere was still a thought in the back of my mind that \u2018maybe this will be an issue if the drug doesn\u2019t work, and I get pregnant.\u2019 \u201c Fletcher and Trevi\u00f1o, who are both researchers at UC Davis, ultimately felt like it was important to participate in the study. Trevi\u00f1o told the podcast he\u2019s been interested in a male contraceptive for a long time. To him, it doesn\u2019t feel fair that his partner has to shoulder the burden of birth control. Women release an egg only once a month, on average, whereas men produce about 1,000 sperm every second. \u201cMaybe the burden is on the wrong side,\u201d Trevi\u00f1o said. \u201cI kind of think it\u2019s unfair that it only lands on the women.\u201d  After men stop using the gel, their sperm count returns to normal levels within two or three months.\u00a0After the recovery phase of the trial, many of the participants went on to become fathers, proving that the method is fully reversible, Blithe said. That\u2019s a big step forward. Right now, the only birth control options for men are condoms, which have a high failure rate, and vasectomy, a surgical procedure that can be hard to reverse. The researchers have started a conversation with the US Food and Drug Administration about how to test the gel in a final definitive trial.\u00a0No male contraceptive method has ever made it this far, Blithe said. Normally, drugs that make it to this stage have to be compared head-to-head against a placebo. But testing a true placebo in research where the goal is to prevent pregnancy just wouldn\u2019t be ethical, said Dr. Christina Wang, a co-principal investigator on the trial, who specializes in male reproductive biology at the Lundquist Institute at UCLA\u2019s Harbor Medical Center. If the researchers get the FDA\u2019s nod for a trial, they hope to start the final phase of testing in 2025.\u00a0It will take another couple years, and Wang said they\u2019ll probably expand the study to more locations and recruit more couples. Big trials usually require significant investment, too. Blithe says she\u2019s hopeful they\u2019ll get interest from pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Brian Nguyen, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Southern California who has been involved in helping participants with the social and behavioral needs during the trial, says he\u2019s looking forward to seeing the gel come to market and usher in a new era of gender equity in birth control. \u201cWe often think of men as kind of not being aware or not wanting to be involved. But when you think about men who are in very close partnerships, how does a female partner hide the fact that they are either in pain, or they\u2019re having abnormal bleeding, or mood swings?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a couples-driven medication, which is very unique.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/male-birth-control-gel-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_with-bird-flu-infecting-dairy-cattle-fda-asks-some-states-to-curb-sales-of-raw-milk", "text": "As the H5N1\u00a0bird flu\u00a0virus spreads through dairy cattle, the US Food and Drug Administration\u00a0is asking states to take more steps to protect the public from the risks of raw milk. In an open letter posted to the agency\u2019s website on Thursday,\u00a0it\u00a0urged states to\u00a0warn the public more strongly about the dangers of raw milk\u00a0and to\u00a0test\u00a0herds that produce it for sale. The\u00a0FDA\u00a0also recommended that states use their regulatory authorities to stop the sale of raw milk\u00a0within the state or\u00a0in areas where dairy herds have tested positive. On Thursday, Minnesota became the 10th\u00a0state\u00a0to report infected herds.\u00a0According to the US Department of Agriculture, 82 herds in the US have tested positive for the H5N1 virus. The FDA doesn\u2019t allow the sale of raw milk across state lines, but several states allow the sale of raw milk for human consumption within their borders, with varying requirements. Some states allow raw milk to be sold as pet food labeled \u201cnot for human consumption,\u201d\u00a0understanding that what people do with the milk in their own homes is up to them. Raw milk\u00a0can carry high levels of the H5N1 bird flu virus because the virus appears to infect cows through their udders.\u00a0It is not yet known whether people can get bird flu by drinking milk contaminated with the virus.\u00a0 However, cats living on farms with infected cows have died after consuming unpasteurized milk, and three\u00a0dairy\u00a0workers exposed to raw milk have been infected. \u201cGiven the current and potential future risks that HPAI H5N1 virus poses to our nation\u2019s public health, as well as the health of our nation\u2019s food-producing animals and wildlife, it is important to work together to minimize the additional exposure of humans and other animal species,\u201d wrote Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, who is leading the agency\u2019s H5N1 response. Beyond bird flu, the FDA says health risks of raw milk include illness, miscarriages, stillbirths, kidney failure and death. In addition to stronger warnings about the dangers of consuming raw milk, the FDA is asking states to monitor dairy cattle herds for signs of illness that would indicate infection with H5N1 bird flu virus and tell farms to safely discard milk from sick cows. Any raw milk or raw milk products from exposed cattle that are fed to calves or any other animals should be heat-treated or pasteurized, the FDA said. The FDA is also calling on states to implement surveillance testing for the presence of H5N1 virus in dairy herds that might be engaged in producing raw milk and to report their results to\u00a0state and federal regulatory agencies. The agency said it would soon share new research and data on both bird flu virus in raw milk and raw milk products.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/with-bird-flu-infecting-dairy-cattle-fda-asks-some-states-to-curb-sales-of-raw-milk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
