Not necessarily, according to a new study. \u201cNearly everyone seems to think that internet-powered technologies are driving an epidemic of ill-being and mental health problems,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Matti Vuorre, assistant professor of social psychology at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, in an email. \u201cOur study of over two million individuals from 160+ countries runs contrary to this idea.\u201d People with access to home internet and/or mobile internet and actively use internet report greater well-being across eight different categories \u2014 including life satisfaction and social life, according to a study published Monday in the journal Technology, Mind, and Behavior. Researchers analyzed data from nearly 2.5 million people across 168 countries using the annual Gallup World Poll, trying to answer the following question: Do individuals who have access and actively use the internet report greater or lower levels of well-being than those who do not? \u201cBecause even such a simple question can be statistically answered in many different ways, we analyzed the data in tens of thousands of different ways,\u201d he added. Across all those ways of crunching the numbers, about 85% showed that those who have and use the internet report greater well-being that those who do not, according to the research. The global perspective is useful, and the data analysis of the research is strong, said Dr. Markus Appel, professor of the psychology of communication and new media at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany. He was not involved in the research. Other research has shown that the connection between mobile internet use and well-being is complex and varies among individuals, he added. \u201cThe internet is neither a curse (nor) a blessing for people\u2019s well-being,\u201d Appel said. \u201cIt depends on what people do with it.\u201d Online users report greater well-being This study was observational, meaning that the data doesn\u2019t show that the internet access necessarily caused the better well-being \u2014 there might be other factors responsible for the association. \u201cOur results might then simply indicate that individuals with more money, access to healthcare, etc, report greater well-being,\u201d Vuorre said in an email. The researchers accounted for that in their data and tried to adjust for factors such as income levels and still found that internet users reported greater well-being than those non-internet users, Vuorre said. Cut the internet or keep scrolling? The internet is used for a wide variety of things \u2014 including online banking, shopping, finding services, reading the news and cyberbullying \u2014 and those different uses will have different effects on well-being, Vuorre said. Much of life has moved online very quickly, and it hasn\u2019t left much time to investigate all the impacts of the internet, he added. \u201cWe as a society and/or academic scientists don\u2019t have time to sufficiently learn and develop methodology to address each panic carefully and therefore do not learn sufficiently to be able to inform policy and make conclusions with confidence,\u201d Vuorre said. \u201cCaution is warranted on all sides.\u201d Many studies have shown concerning connections between social media use and mental health, particularly among younger people. Scrolling through images of other people\u2019s lives and comparing them with your own has been associated with a poor effect on mood, for example. Before institutions advise harsh limitations on computers and mobile phones, more research is needed on both the potential harms and benefits, Vuorre said. \u201cAlthough prominent narratives and the cautionary principle might suggest draconian limitations to technology use, ours and many other findings provide a much more nuanced and mixed view,\u201d he added. To get the best out of your internet use, Appel recommends being mindful of your own experience. \u201cIf you sense that some activity on the internet makes you feel sad or envious \u2014 stop it. Look out for something else,\u201d Appel added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/internet-greater-well-being-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_health_ultraprocessed-food-bad-health-wellness", "text": "When\u00a0you open a bag of nacho-flavored chips or cheese puffs, you probably know that you\u2019re about to indulge in an unhealthy snack. The dead giveaway? It\u2019s the yummy, spicy, cheesy, neon-orange dust that coats each morsel and gets all over your fingers. Ditto for a frozen pizza and chicken nuggets. But what about a granola bar? An applesauce pouch? String cheese? Flavored yogurt? Surely these foods \u2014 snacks that millions of children and adults eat every day \u2014 are not bad, right? Well, it turns out that many fall under the category of ultraprocessed foods \u2014 depending on their exact ingredients. This type of food has been studied a lot lately, and the results aren\u2019t great. Ultraprocessed foods represent a relatively new way of categorizing foods. Proposed in 2009 by researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, the system, called NOVA, is based not on what kind of food it is \u2014 meat, grains, vegetables, etc. \u2014 but rather on how processed it is. NOVA separates foods into four groups, starting with natural and minimally processed foods in the first category to ultraprocessed foods, which use industrial formulations and manufacturing techniques, in the fourth. \u201cMy operating definition for ultraprocessed (foods) is you can\u2019t make it in your home kitchen because you don\u2019t have the machinery and you don\u2019t have the ingredients,\u201d food policy expert Dr. Marion Nestle told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell on the Chasing Life podcast recently. Nestle is the Paulette Goddard Professor of nutrition, food studies and public health, emerita, at New York University. Listen to more of the conversation between Nestle and Tirrell here. Ultraprocessed foods contain additives such as flavor enhancers, colors and thickeners \u2014 basically ingredients you wouldn\u2019t usually use in your cooking.\u00a0It makes them shelf-stable, easy to prepare (just heat and serve) and in many cases hard to resist. (The food industry pushes back on the NOVA system, saying there is no agreed-upon scientific consensus on the definition of ultraprocessed.) Due to a confluence of historical, regulatory and economic factors, Nestle said, food companies in the 1980s \u201cdid a lot of work on trying to figure out what flavor and texture and color combinations would be most attractive to people and started producing foods that would make them lots of money.\u201d She said tens of thousands of new products have hit store shelves since then. \u201cMost of them fail, but the ones that win, win big,\u201d Nestle said. Before you reach for that can of soda, bag of chips or frozen dinner, why not learn more about what you\u2019re eating? Here are five things to know about ultraprocessed foods: Ultraprocessed foods are linked to bad health outcomes Eating a lot of ultraprocessed foods isn\u2019t healthy. \u201cNow there have been more than 1,500 observational studies \u2014 all of them demonstrating a consistent finding, which is that eating ultraprocessed foods is linked to obesity,\u00a0type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, bad outcome from Covid-19, overall mortality,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cAny bad health problem you can think of that\u2019s related to diet is related specifically to ultraprocessed foods.\u201d The most recent study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, analyzed more than 30 years\u2019 worth of data and found that eating ultraprocessed foods was associated with a 4% higher risk of death by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths. Other studies have linked ultraprocessed foods to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Nestle pointed out that these studies have been observational and not designed to prove causation \u2014 that ultraprocessed foods caused these bad health outcomes. \u201cYou can do that when you have a controlled clinical trial,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd guess what? We have one.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods cause weight gain That one randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that ultraprocessed foods actually caused people to gain weight. These types of studies are not easy or cheap to undertake, which is why they are not done more often. To conduct this one, Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, had 20 volunteers spend four weeks living at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. For two weeks, they ate a diet made up of 80% healthy ultraprocessed foods (think yogurt and whole wheat bread, not chips and soda). For the other two weeks, they ate a diet that contained no ultraprocessed foods. The diets were matched, among other things, for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients. Participants did not know what exactly the study was measuring. \u201cWe basically just asked people, you know, just eat as much or as little of the food that you\u2019d like,\u201d Hall told Tirrell. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be trying to change your weight, (you) shouldn\u2019t be trying to gain weight or lose weight.\u00a0Just eat to the same level of appetite as you normally would.\u201d Researchers found that when the participants were on the ultraprocessed diet, they ate about 500 calories more per day than when they were on the minimally processed one. This difference in calories translated quickly to the scale. Participants gained on average 2 pounds during the two weeks on the ultraprocessed diet and lost 2 pounds on the minimally processed one. And their blood work showed lower markers of inflammation when they were on the latter. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with nutrition research, you have no idea what an important finding this is,\u201d said Nestle, who was not involved in the study. \u201cFive hundred calories is huge.\u201d Hall said it\u2019s unclear what drives people to consume more calories when they are on an ultraprocessed diet. \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re really interested in now,\u201d he said, \u201cis to figure out what the mechanisms were.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods are hard to avoid Ultraprocessed foods are everywhere, and most of us consume them without even realizing it \u2014 even when you think you are eating something relatively healthy, such as baked potato chips or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, researchers found that ultraprocessed foods make up more than half of American adults\u2019 diets. For US children, that percentage is even higher, at 67%. Ultraprocessed foods are cheap and convenient Yup, that\u2019s right: Truly eating \u201cclean\u201d costs more. \u201cTo actually create the minimally processed menu, it was about 40% more expensive than the ultraprocessed menu,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even account for the time that it takes to make the foods, right? So, all those factors probably play a huge role in \u2026 the foods that we choose to eat in the real world.\u201d Not all ultraprocessed foods are bad Some ultraprocessed foods can provide important nutrients, such as whole wheat bread and yogurt. And others, in Hall\u2019s study, were shown not to increase caloric intake. \u201cThe snacks were neutral in terms of how many calories (the participants) ate,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhich goes to show that not all ultraprocessed foods necessarily drive this effect.\u201d Hall\u2019s team is conducting a new study to tease out which ultraprocessed foods are harmful and which are neutral, or even healthy. Americans may soon get more help sorting through the health effects of ultraprocessed foods. The US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration will soon issue new Dietary Guidelines, which are updated every five years. Nestle said that the scientific advisory committee guiding this process has been asked to consider the connection between ultraprocessed foods and poor health outcomes. We hope these five things help you understand ultraprocessed foods a bit more.

{"id": "2024_05_17_health_flirt-covid-variants-summer-wave-risk", "text": "Covid-19 levels are about the lowest they\u2019ve ever been in the United States, but another new crop of virus variants once again threatens to disrupt the downward trend as the country heads into summer. KP.2 \u2014 one of the so-called FLiRT variants \u2014 has overtaken JN.1 to become the dominant coronavirus variant in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data through May 11 shows that it\u2019s responsible for more than a quarter of cases in the country, which is nearly twice as many as JN.1. A related variant, KP.1.1, has caused about 7% of cases, CDC data shows. FLiRT variants are offshoots of the JN.1 variant \u2014 all part of the broader Omicron family \u2014 that caused this winter\u2019s wave. The acronym in the name refers to the locations of the amino acid mutations that the virus has picked up \u2014 some in places that help it evade the body\u2019s immune response and others that help it become more transmissible. Covid-19 variants are \u201caccumulating mutations that do one of two things: They either cause antibodies that you\u2019ve accumulated from vaccination or infection to no longer bind to the to the virus \u2014 we call that escape from immunity \u2014 or they increase the strength in which the viruses bind to cells,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This has become a familiar pattern in the way the virus that causes Covid-19 continues to evolve, but experts say we still don\u2019t know enough to predict exactly where the changes will occur next or how they will affect the way the virus moves through the population. The mutations of the FLiRT variants make increased transmissibility \u2014 and a possible summer wave \u2014 a real threat. Covid-19 is settling into some seasonal patterns, which have included a summer bump in years past, but the exact level of risk for this year is unclear. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some variants in the past that start out kind of strong and then don\u2019t take over. These subvariants could progressively become dominant, or they could get up to accounting for somewhere between 20% and 40% of the cases and then just stay there. We just have to see,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThe virus continues to be in charge. It\u2019s going to tell us what it\u2019s going to do. All of our crystal balls are rather cloudy.\u201d Covid-19 surveillance has scaled back significantly since the US public health emergency ended a year ago, which also adds to the uncertainty. But the data that is available is consistent. For now, wastewater surveillance suggests that viral activity is very low and decreasing in all regions of the country, and Covid-19 hospitalization rates remain extremely low. \u201cWe learned from the laboratories that FLiRT variants appeared, so far, to be as transmissible as the other Omicron subvariants, which means they\u2019re really quite contagious. But they do not appear to be producing more severe disease or any sort of illness that\u2019s distinctive from the point of view of clinical presentation symptoms,\u201d Schaffner said. As of May 1, the requirement for all hospitals to report Covid-19 data to the federal government has expired. But Schaffner\u2019s Vanderbilt University Medical Center is part of a CDC-run surveillance network that continues to track trends based on a sample of hospitals that cover about 10% of the US population. Covid-19 hospitalization rates have fallen from nearly 8 new admissions for every 100,000 people in the first week of the year to about 1 new admission for every 100,000 people at the end of April, the data shows. While the FLiRT variants pose some risk this summer, experts remain focused on what might happen in the fall. \u201cIf I were to predict, I would say that this might result in a few extra cases, a small surge this summer. But it\u2019s really going to be about which variant is around when we get to the fall,\u201d Pekosz said. \u201cThe fall is probably when we should expect to see a surge of Covid cases. And if we have a variant around there that has a lot of these mutations that avoid immunity, then the potential in the fall to have a larger surge is greater.\u201d The fall and winter pose a greater risk because of the immunity that has built up in the population, he said. \u201cThe virus now needs better conditions to transmit, and those better conditions to transmit are probably going to happen in the fall when weather gets cooler, people are spending more time indoors and they\u2019re more likely to be in environments where respiratory virus transmission occurs more efficiently.\u201d Research published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA is a reminder of the burden that Covid-19 continues to have in the US. This winter, while Covid-19 hospitalization rates were far lower than they were in earlier years, it was still deadlier than the flu. A study of thousands of hospital patients found that 5.7% of Covid-19 patients died, compared with 4.2% of those hospitalized for influenza. In other words, Covid-19 carried about a 35% higher risk of death than flu. People who received the latest Covid-19 vaccine this past fall may still have some protection against the latest variants; that vaccine targeted a different strain but was found to be similarly effective against JN.1, and experts say that some of those benefits may extend to its FLiRT relatives. People who had a recent infection \u2014 especially since the start of the year, when JN.1 was prominent \u2014 may also have some protection. But immunity wanes over time. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee will meet to discuss recommendations for the version of the Covid-19 vaccine that will be available this fall. The meeting was postponed by about three weeks in order to \u201callow for additional time to obtain surveillance data\u201d to have \u201cmore up-to-date information when discussing and making recommendations,\u201d according to a post on the federal agency\u2019s website. For now, experts say, risk remains relatively low. \u201cAs with all things Covid, our outlook may change in a week or two. But at the moment, we\u2019re in really a very good place \u2014 the best place we\u2019ve been in for a long, long time,\u201d Schaffner said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/flirt-covid-variants-summer-wave-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_health_maycember-survival-guide-wellness", "text": "When my kids were in elementary school, the weeks between spring break and summer vacation seemed to go by at warp speed, mostly because I spent most of that time running the children from event to event in between work meetings. From Spring Sing to Mother\u2019s Day breakfast to field day and beyond, there was always a reason to be at school, send something to school or procure some special outfit for some event at school. It was exhausting. Cut to the teen years. You might think it\u2019s a little less intense, and perhaps parents of teens are even just a bit nostalgic for a Spring Sing, but sadly that\u2019s not the case. Sugar-fueled class parties were replaced with stress-fueled study groups for Advanced Placement exams, and field day morphed into an endless loop of sports tournaments (all of which require at least 45 minutes of commuting), not to mention prom, volunteer hours, extra credit projects, awards ceremonies, banquets, fundraisers and requests for parent volunteers to assist with a long list of school events. \u201cMaycember\u201d is a term that online content creators the Holderness family coined to describe the sheer chaos of the month of May, much like the month of December. Regardless of the age of your kids, both May and December are packed with social and school-related responsibilities, and it can become overwhelming. Sometimes it feels like Mayhem. Between the nonnegotiables, such as standardized testing and preparing for finals, and the carrots dangled to help them succeed, such as extra credit projects and appearances, teens are running on empty as the school year comes to an end. While it\u2019s certainly a nice gift to earn extra credit points by attending a school event, time off to rest on the weekend is another gift most exhausted teens can use as they crawl toward the finish line. While the teen years are generally characterized by increased independence and spending more time with friends than family, the expectations for parent involvement remain high this time of year. Though I\u2019ve been known to \u201cbuy time\u201d by donating extra funds if I can\u2019t take time off from work to volunteer on campus, there\u2019s still a lot to do before we store the backpacks for the season. While so many of these May obligations are impossible to move, I\u2019ve learned that there are some ways to make this time of year a little less hectic. Try these suggestions if you like \u2014 but don\u2019t make them another obligation! Hold your boundaries Setting boundaries is easy; it\u2019s holding boundaries that can be tricky. I\u2019m always grateful for the people who volunteer their time to head up committees on the PTA or parent board. Schools need parents who can transform ideas into reality and make things happen. It\u2019s their job to seek help (sometimes on repeat) until every action item is accounted for and every event is complete, but not every parent can volunteer for every event. Be clear and confident with your boundaries. If you can\u2019t volunteer for an event, but you can make a financial contribution, do that. If you can\u2019t do either, say that you would love to help another time. It\u2019s important to set boundaries around your time for volunteering, but it\u2019s equally important to set boundaries with your own kids. If attending every event isn\u2019t possible, talk with your kids about the events they hope you\u2019ll attend and why, then make a plan that works for everyone. You might even ask a grandparent or other relative to attend an event on your behalf. Telling your family that you simply can\u2019t do it all might feel like a failure, but it\u2019s a valuable life lesson. When families learn to prioritize, they take the time to consider what an event means to them and why it\u2019s important to attend. One way to start this conversation is to ask each kid to list their top three events for May and discuss them over an ice cream cone. You might even find that the things you thought were important (prom!) come in second place to something completely different (quiz bowl, anyone?). Parent guilt is real, and it can feel like missing these moments will be remembered for a lifetime. But the truth is that kids will remember the time you spent together and how they felt in your presence. Kids crave relational safety from their parents, not a camera roll full of snapshots from school events. Prioritize mental health No good comes from a family running around from event to event without a moment even to enjoy the ones they attend. Just like it\u2019s OK to skip out on some holiday parties in December, families are not required to respond \u201cyes\u201d to every invitation for end of the year celebrations. Particularly with teens, it\u2019s essential to model positive actions that promote mental health. Teens are wired to do all the things, so they don\u2019t always make the choice to slow down and pay attention to their minds and bodies. Parents can help by creating some mental health safe zones. Creating quiet nights to offset the celebrations takes the guesswork out of it for teens. Instead of trying to manage multiple events, they can simply say, \u201cI have a family thing tonight,\u201d and take a break from the action. Will every teen love this approach? No. That\u2019s OK. It\u2019s not your job to win coolest parent ever, but it is your job to help your teens learn to slow down when life gets overwhelming. They\u2019ll thank you for it one day. Watch your social media consumption People love to worry about how scrolling through social media affects teens, but not nearly enough attention is paid to how the same behavior affects parents. Seeing the perfect report cards, perfect test scores and parent attendance at every single thing can really wear you down, but you don\u2019t have to go there. You can set a time limit on your phone to decrease your own scrolling and think about replacement behaviors that feel better. I don\u2019t often feel great after getting lost in social media, but I always feel good after a rousing game of Bananagrams with my teens. It\u2019s an easy swap. Give yourself a break from comparison culture and focus on enjoying the time you can spend with your family during this busy season. In a few short weeks, Maycember will be behind us for another year, and we\u2019ll all breathe a sigh of relief. (Don\u2019t get me started about camp.) Until then, focus on relationship building over checking things off the list. You\u2019ll be glad you did.

{"id": "2024_05_18_health_alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness", "text": "Preventive neurologist Dr Richard Isaacson stared at the numbers on the fax in astonishment. Blood biomarkers of telltale signs of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the brain of his patient, 55-year-old entrepreneur Simon Nicholls, had all but disappeared in a mere 14 months. \u201cI had to catch my breath. It was a complete shock: The blood tests on his brain had normalized,\u201d said Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. Was this stunning result the work of some new miracle drug designed to combat dementia? Not at all. This is a story of old-fashioned grit and determination. \u201cSimon was on a mission, as if the Grim Reaper was peering over his shoulder. He was going to kick ass and take names,\u201d Isaacson said. Nicholls reduced his risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle changes recommended by Isaacson, including diet, exercise, reducing stress and optimizing sleep, along with a few strategically chosen supplements and medications prescribed by his cardiologist. \u201cI was very worried,\u201d Nicholls told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in his new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d which is airing on \u201cThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.\u201d \u201cI have a 3-year-old son and an 8-year-old son. It\u2019s really important for me, as I get older, to try and be there for them in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many [changes] in lifestyle you can do to hopefully push the disease backwards and give yourself more time, which is all we need until we find a cure.\u201d Unlucky genes When it came to genetics and dementia, Nicholls had drawn the short straw. He carried two copies of the APOE4 gene, one from each parent, which may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s at least tenfold. \u201cSadly, my mum passed away from what we think is Alzheimer\u2019s in her 70s,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cFor the last 10 years of her life, she just sat in a chair, rocking, while on about 14 medications. I\u2019d much rather have a longer health span and then just go quickly.\u201d Not everyone with one or even two copies of APOE4 develops Alzheimer\u2019s, however, creating a tantalizing opportunity. Can a person diminish their genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle and various medical interventions, especially if started early, before too much damage is done? Isaacson, who also has a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, believes the answer is yes. He began the first US clinic devoted to Alzheimer\u2019s prevention in New York City in 2013 before moving his program to Florida in 2021. His research has shown that following a dozen or more lifestyle interventions, when practiced 60% or more of the time, can improve cognitive function, especially in women. Today, scientists around the world are also investigating the impact on cognition of such lifestyle changes as a healthy plant-based diet,\u00a0stress reduction,\u00a0strength training, aerobic exercise and quality sleep habits \u2014 behaviors that Isaacson and his team outlined in a recent review\u00a0published in Nature. \u201cI don\u2019t use the term \u2018reverse.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what reverse means when it comes to the field of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut the results we\u2019ve seen with Simon and some other patients in our research are extremely exciting.\u201d How the heart and the brain are intertwined Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t the only pathway to a life of dwindling memory and the inability to think, plan and interact with loved ones. Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can be caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks, stroke, blood clots and more, all of which can further damage the body and brain. Poor hearts and their consequences can run rampant in a family over generations, a fact Nicholls knew all too well. \u201cMy whole family had endless heart attacks, resulting in my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side dying around age 50,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother had three heart attacks, the first at age 50, then a triple bypass before she went on to develop dementia.\u201d Carrying an APOE4 gene further increases the risk for heart disease as well as dementia, experts say. \u201cMy sister had three heart attacks, and when I was 40, I was told that I had atherosclerosis, with a ridiculously massive coronary artery calcium score of like 1,500 and occlusions in about 96% of my arteries.\u201d A normal coronary artery calcium score is zero. For a man in the prime of his life, the news was crushing. Doctors tried to use lifestyle changes and statins to reverse the plaque buildup but finally resorted to surgery, opening three of Nicholls\u2019 arteries with stents. He also began using an injectable drug called evolocumab, designed to boost the liver\u2019s ability to remove \u201cbad\u201d \u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, from the body. \u2018It was time to turn to my brain\u2019 Slowly, Nicholls\u2019 heart condition began to improve, but the bad news didn\u2019t end there. A brain scan found telltale signs of vascular damage in Nicholls\u2019 brain, which occurs when the tiniest blood vessels are starved of oxygen. \u201cThe doctors said I had too many white matter lesions.\u00a0I told myself that since I now had my heart more or less under control, it was time to turn to my brain,\u201d Nicholls said. In January 2023, Nicholls became participant No. 34 in a novel clinical trial at Isaacson\u2019s Florida center. The trial is designed to uncover cognitive risk factors and counter them with a personalized plan of attack. (Full disclosure: I am participant No. 20 in the same trial; you can read about my experience here.) \u201cThe overall goal of the study is democratize access to preventive neurology care by eventually using at-home blood testing to cost-effectively reach the most people,\u201d Isaacson said. As part of the trial, Nicholls underwent a battery of tests, including a unique blood test that can track levels of amyloid, tau\u00a0and other\u00a0hallmark biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other degenerative conditions. Deposits of amyloid can begin accumulating in the brain decades before symptoms begin,\u00a0even in a person\u2019s 30s and 40s. \u201cSimon\u2019s first test came back with a score of 70. Anything over 58 was positive for amyloid in the brain,\u201d Isaacson said.\u00a0\u201cThe results backed up the amyloid PET scan Simon had taken in 2019, where I could see the plaque in his brain.\u201d 10,000 steps a day: \u2018I\u2019m very consistent\u2019 Nicholls needed to loose weight, so he began taking tirzepatide (the active ingredient in the medications Mounjaro and Zepbound), one of the newer injectable drugs that suppress appetite by stimulating hormones that control blood sugar levels. At the same time, Nicholls was encouraged to step up his physical activity by incorporating strength training three times a week while adding 45 to 60 minutes a day of zone 2 exercise, in which you briskly walk, ruck, jog or cycle at 60% to 70% of your heart rate. \u201cI love going for a walk every morning at sunrise for an hour and a half with a podcast. I get in 10,000 steps or more every day. I\u2019m very consistent,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cI also do a very slow full-body workout with weights three times a week for an hour\u2019s time.\u201d Avoiding sugar, artificial sweeteners, alcohol and ultraprocessed foods is a must, as is following a plant-based meal plan such as the Mediterranean diet. \u201cWhen I first saw Simon, he had a bit of a middle, like most guys in their 50s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen I saw him at nine weeks, I did a double take. He was totally buff, ripped even. \u201cWithin those nine weeks, he had lost 21 pounds, about 80% of that fat, and put on muscle, which was excellent,\u201d Isaacson added. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d The weight loss and increased muscle mass lowered Nicholls\u2019 fasting blood sugar levels, ending his march toward diabetes, while some tweaks to his cholesterol medications further optimized his good and bad cholesterol numbers. In August 2023, it was time to repeat the blood test for amyloid. By then, the company that administers the tests had added a measurement for tau, another key hallmark sign of Alzheimer\u2019s, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease. \u201cSimon\u2019s amyloid probability score on the new APS2 test had dropped to 53, which was phenomenal,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut he was still positive, as anything between 48 and 100 is considered to reflect a high probability of amyloid brain plaques on a brain scan.\u201d \u2018Turn on the screws\u2019 Now that the big concerns of cholesterol, insulin, diet, exercise and fat mass were addressed, it was time \u201cto turn on the screws,\u201d Isaacson said, with personalized recommendations based on Nicholls\u2019 biology. \u201cWe optimized Simon\u2019s omega-3 fatty acid levels, which is especially important for people with APOE \u03b54, as they need more omega-3. We also added B complex vitamins to control elevated homocysteine in his blood,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cHowever, we would not give B complex vitamins to anyone who did not have higher homocysteine levels.\u201d Elevated homocysteine, which is an amino acid used by the body to make protein, is a risk factor for brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. A September 2010 randomized controlled trial found that supplementation slowed brain atrophy in people with mild cognitive impairment. In the meantime, Nicholls, an avid researcher who loves to read medical journals, was adding some interventions of his own. \u201cI have steam and sauna rooms in my home, I do a lot of that. I love it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried cold water plunges, and I have lists of things to do I get from podcasts, from walking to sleeping to gratitude to yoga to sleep routines. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I do that Dr. Isaacson doesn\u2019t agree with: I get stem cell injections twice a year,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cSadly, I have arthritis in my hands, and that definitely feels better when I use stem cells, and I like to think they may be helping my brain, as well.\u201d There was one more big issue to tackle: Nicholls\u2019 sleep, or lack of it, which studies have shown can hasten cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s. With business around the world, Nicholls is a frequent flyer with \u201cterrible sleep\u201d due to jet lag and insomnia.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m also a worrier type of person,\u201d he confessed. Adding a sleep medication approved for insomnia helped, \u201cbut Simon really needs to tackle his sleep by improving his sleep hygiene with a more regular sleep schedule,\u201d Isaacson said. An unbelievable result On Halloween 2023, the next APS2 score arrived. Amazingly, Nicholls had reduced the amount of amyloid and tau in his blood to 40: He was testing negative in blood for signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. Shocked and amazed, Isaacson remained skeptical. \u201cI was very cautious. You know, promise not to overpromise. I needed to retest.\u201d A few days before Christmas, the repeat test results arrived. When it too was a negative finding of 40, Isaacson decided to tell Nicholls in person. \u201cDr. Isaacson drove all the way from Boca Raton to Miami excited, very happy,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cWe walked on a beach together, and we were ecstatic that we\u2019d actually been able go from positive to negative for amyloid.\u201d Although Nicholls is ecstatic about the improvements, he\u2019s also very humble about his efforts to improve his health. \u201cI\u2019m really not all that compliant. To comply is just horrendously difficult, right? Of course I want to have a beer or a hamburger or something stupid. I love gummy bears and eating crappy food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped that I have some great doctors to help me, but to be honest, my biggest motivator are my children,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cI\u2019d love to see my sons get married and have their own kids, and to do that, I have to put in the work to stay the way I am now.\u201d Even lower amyloid levels and a larger hippocampus It appears Nicholls is well on his way toward that goal. In March, his APS2 score had dropped to 25, an unbelievably low number. Not only was Nicholls blood negative for amyloid and tau, the test suggested that his brain amyloid might be normal, with no distinguishable signs of the disease. The only way to definitively prove this, however, would be to repeat his amyloid PET scan, Isaacson said. \u201cWhat really drove his score down was the amyloid value,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cIt normalized at .101, which is like crazy good. That\u2019s not matter for discussion; for amyloid, .1 or above is normal.\u201d Even more startling: Brain volume scans showed that the hippocampus, the tiny seahorse-shaped organ responsible for memory, had actually grown in volume in Nicholls\u2019 brain since he started the intervention. In early Alzheimer\u2019s stages, the hippocampus loses tissue rapidly and then atrophies as the disease progresses. Despite these amazing outcomes, Isaacson remains cautious. After all, this is one person, and similar findings have not been been replicated in a larger, more controlled sample and published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the term \u2018reverse\u2019 because I don\u2019t know what will happen if the person stops doing the intervention,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cI also don\u2019t know if the brain might normalize for a short period of time and then, five years later, catch up. Until I have more data, I don\u2019t think that reverse is the right word.\u201d That doesn\u2019t stop his wonder at the results and his gratitude to Nicholls for his continuing dedication to the study and the personalized interventions. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d seen this before, but only in people who are taking anti-amyloid medications,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen you work your entire career and are told by everyone, \u2018It\u2019s not possible to do this,\u2019 and then you see it \u2014 well, I\u2019m still humbled and amazed.\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s and brain health resources", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/health/alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

The inhospitable location has long puzzled archaeologists, some of whom had found evidence that the Nile River once flowed near these pyramids in some capacity, facilitating the landmarks\u2019 construction starting 4,700 years ago. Using satellite imaging and analysis of cores of sediment, a new study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment has mapped a 64-kilometer (40-mile) long, dried-up, branch of the Nile, long buried beneath farmland and desert. \u201cEven though many efforts to reconstruct the early Nile waterways have been conducted, they have largely been confined to soil sample collections from small sites, which has led to the mapping of only fragmented sections of the ancient Nile channel systems,\u201d said lead study author Eman Ghoneim, a professor and director of the Space and Drone Remote Sensing Lab at the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s department of Earth and ocean sciences. \u201cThis is the first study to provide the first map of the long-lost ancient branch of the Nile River.\u201d Ghoneim and her colleagues refer to this extinct branch of the Nile river as Ahramat, which is Arabic for pyramids. The ancient waterway would have been about 0.5 kilometers wide (about one-third of a mile) with a depth of at least 25 meters (82 feet) \u2014 similar to the contemporary Nile, Ghoneim said. \u201cThe large size and extended length of the Ahramat Branch and its proximity to the 31 pyramids in the study area strongly suggests a functional waterway of great importance,\u201d Ghoneim said. She said the river would have played a key role in ancient Egyptians\u2019 transportation of the enormous amount of building materials and laborers needed for the pyramids\u2019 construction. \u201cAlso, our research shows that many of the pyramids in the study area have (a) causeway, a ceremonial raised walkway, that runs perpendicular to the course of the Ahramat Branch and terminates directly on its riverbank.\u201d Hidden traces of a lost waterway Traces of the river aren\u2019t visible in aerial photos or in imagery from optical satellites, Ghoneim said. In fact, she only spotted something unexpected while studying radar satellite data of the wider area for ancient rivers and lakes that might reveal a new source of groundwater. \u201cI am a geomorphologist, a paleohydrologist\u00a0looking into landforms. I have this kind of trained eye,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile working with this data, I noticed this really obvious branch or a kind of riverbank, and it didn\u2019t make any sense because it is really far from the Nile,\u201d she added. Born and raised in Egypt, Ghoneim was familiar with the cluster of pyramids in this area and had always wondered why they were built there. She applied to the National Science Foundation to investigate further, and geophysical data taken at ground level with the use of ground-penetrating radar and electromagnetic tomography confirmed it was an ancient arm of the Nile. Two long cores of earth the team extracted using drilling equipment revealed sandy sediment consistent with a river channel at a depth of about 25 meters (82 feet). It\u2019s possible that \u201ccountless\u201d temples might still be buried beneath the agricultural fields and desert sands along the riverbank of the Ahramat Branch, according to the study. Why this branch of the river dried up or disappeared is still unclear. Most likely, a period of drought and desertification swept sand into the region, silting up the river, Ghoneim said. The study demonstrated that when the pyramids were built, the geography and riverscapes of the Nile differed significantly from those of today, said Nick Marriner, a geographer at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. He was not involved in the study but has conducted research on the fluvial history of Giza. \u201cThe study completes an important part of the past landscape puzzle,\u201d Marriner said. \u201cBy putting together these pieces we can gain a clearer picture of what the Nile floodplain looked like at the time of the pyramid builders and how the ancient Egyptians harnessed their environments to transport building materials for their monumental construction endeavors.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_world_first-warm-blooded-dinosaurs-scn", "text": "Were dinosaurs warm-blooded like birds and mammals or cold-blooded like reptiles? It\u2019s one of paleontology\u2019s oldest questions, and gleaning the answer matters because it illuminates how the prehistoric creatures may have lived and behaved. Challenging the prevailing idea that they were all slow, lumbering lizards that basked in the sun to regulate their body temperature, research over the past three decades has revealed that some dinosaurs were likely birdlike, with feathers and perhaps the ability to generate their own body heat. However, it\u2019s hard to find evidence that unquestionably shows what dinosaur metabolisms were like. Clues from dinosaur eggshells and bones have suggested that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and others were not. A new study published in the journal Current Biology on Wednesday suggested that three main dinosaur groups adapted differently to changes in temperature, with the ability to regulate body temperature evolving in the early Jurassic Period about 180 million years ago. Based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, the new study looked at the spread of dinosaurs across different environments on Earth throughout the dinosaur era, which started some 235 million years ago\u00a0and ended 66 million years ago when an asteroid slammed into Earth. Two of the three main groups \u2014 meat-eating therapod dinosaurs, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, whose notable members included Triceratops and Stegosaurus \u2014 spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, the research suggested. These dinosaurs may have evolved endothermy, or the ability to internally generate body heat, according to the study. Two adaptable dinosaur groups Therapods and ornithischians lived in a broad range of thermal landscapes in their respective evolutionary histories and were \u201cremarkably adaptable,\u201d the researchers wrote. Recent fossil discoveries have shown that different species of dinosaurs even thrived in the Arctic, giving birth and living there year-round. \u201cWarm-blooded animals are generally more active, for example, cold-blooded animals usually don\u2019t build nests,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, Royal Society Newton International Fellow at University College London\u2019s department of Earth sciences. By contrast, the towering, plant-eating sauropods kept to warmer, lower-latitude regions of the planet, and the availability of richer foliage in certain habitats wasn\u2019t the only factor why, the study found. Sauropods, which included Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, also appeared to thrive in arid, savannahlike environments and practiced \u201cprolonged climatic conservatism,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIt reconciles well with what we imagine about their ecology,\u201d Chiarenza said. \u201cThey were the biggest terrestrial animals that ever lived. They probably would have overheated if they were hot-blooded.\u201d What\u2019s more, he added, the amount of plant matter they would have needed to consume if they were warm-blooded would have been unsustainable. \u201c(These animals) were living in herds and we know that each one of them was the equivalent of 10 African elephants. (If they were warm-blooded) they would just destroy plant life. It makes more sense, as living animals, for them to be more cold-blooded.\u201d However, Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said that the findings from this study contrasted with her own research, which looked at molecular traces of oxygen intake found in dinosaur fossils. Her 2022 study suggested that ornithischians were more likely cold-blooded and sauropods were warm-blooded. She questioned to what extent the biogeographic range of a dinosaur was determined by its metabolic capacity as opposed to other factors such as behavior, growth strategy, dietary preferences and other ecological interactions. \u201cSome animals with incredibly fast growth rates (i.e., sauropods), and by requirement, fast metabolisms, are here found to be cold-blooded, while other animals with very slow growth rates (i.e., ceratopsians) are recovered as endotherms,\u201d Wiemann said. \u201cThese discrepancies will need to be addressed.\u201d Evolutionary trigger Chiarenza said that the model, developed by researchers at UCL and Universidade de Vigo in Spain, suggested that the earliest dinosaurs were more reptilian and cold-blooded. But a period of global warming resulting from volcanic activity 180 million years ago, known as the Jenkyns Event, may have been a trigger for the evolution of the ability to generate body heat internally. \u201cAt this time, many new dinosaur groups emerged. The adoption of endothermy, perhaps a result of this environmental crisis, may have enabled theropods and ornithischians to thrive in colder environments, allowing them to be highly active and sustain activity over longer periods, to develop and grow faster and produce more offspring,\u201d he said in a news release. As with all research based on models, the study made predictions grounded in existing information. New fossils or climatic information might alter that picture. \u201cOf course, if a sauropod turned up in the Arctic that would change things,\u201d Chiarenza said. Paleontologist Anthony Fiorillo, executive director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science, said the study was \u201cintriguing\u201d and the \u201cfirst real attempt to quantify broad patterns that some of us had thought about previously.\u201d Fiorillo, who is also a senior fellow at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, wasn\u2019t involved with the research. \u201cTheir modeling helps create a robustness to our biogeographical understanding of dinosaurs, and their related physiology,\u201d he said. \u201cThis study provides a platform for us to further test what we think we might know.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/world/first-warm-blooded-dinosaurs-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

Florida enacted a new law\u00a0on May 1, 2024, that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, with\u00a0a few exceptions\u00a0\u2013 including documented rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Florida joins the majority of\u00a0Southern states\u00a0that now have complete bans or highly restrictive abortion laws, enacted since the Supreme Court overturned the\u00a0federal right to get an abortion\u00a0in June 2022. Many of the restrictive laws ban abortion after a set number of weeks. Florida Republicans supporting the bill have labeled it a\u00a0reasonable compromise between a full abortion ban and few abortion restrictions. READ MORE: Mexico is a destination for Americans seeking reproductive health services  Some OB-GYNs\u00a0have explained that\u00a0many women\u00a0do not even know they are pregnant at\u00a0six weeks.\u00a0Research shows that women\u00a0on average find out they are pregnant at five and a half weeks. About 23% do not know until seven weeks of pregnancy or later. So, do Americans, including those enacting six-week bans, actually understand how the timing or dating of pregnancy works? We are\u00a0scholars\u00a0of\u00a0political science,\u00a0gender and public opinion\u00a0and are writing a book about public opinion on abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the federal right to get an abortion in June 2022. How does pregnancy work? To gain insights into this issue, we developed a few pregnancy questions and included them in a research survey in late September 2023. The survey had 1,356 respondents, who were broadly representative of the U.S. population. The respondents\u2019 median age was 46. Approximately 49% of these people were men, while 70% were white and 29% were college graduates. Meanwhile, 43% of them were Democrats, and 38% were Republicans. READ MORE: Fetal personhood rulings could nullify a pregnant patient\u2019s wishes for\u00a0end-of-life\u00a0care The first question asked respondents how pregnancies are dated.\u00a0The correct answer\u00a0is that pregnancies are dated using the first day of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period, which is often two to three weeks before conception. The second question asked about trimesters. Many Americans are familiar with the term trimester, and\u00a0polling consistently shows\u00a0that Americans find abortion most acceptable during the first trimester. We asked Americans if they knew approximately how many weeks a trimester was. The correct answer is 13. Americans\u2019 pregnancy knowledge We found that only one-third of respondents knew how pregnancy is dated. A majority \u2013 approximately 60% \u2013 falsely thought that pregnancy is dated from conception or in the weeks since the woman last had sex. Less than one-fourth of the respondents answered both pregnancy knowledge questions correctly. In our survey, we also asked respondents whether they support a six-week abortion ban. Similar to other\u00a0national surveys, we find that most Americans oppose strict abortion restrictions \u2013 only 35% support six-week bans. Importantly, we find that those who support six-week abortion bans are significantly less likely than others to correctly understand the timing of pregnancy. The statistically significant relationship between having low levels of pregnancy timing knowledge and support for a six-week abortion ban holds in analyses controlling for potentially confounding variables. Some anti-abortion lawmakers\u00a0have demonstrated\u00a0their\u00a0ignorance\u00a0about pregnancy\u00a0before. There is, for example, a long history of some anti-abortion politicians saying, incorrectly, that it is\u00a0extremely rare\u00a0for a person who is raped to get pregnant. Our survey shows that a large swath of those opposing abortion lack knowledge about the basics of pregnancy. A gender disparity Perhaps not surprisingly, women in this survey knew more about pregnancy than men. The question about how pregnancies are dated, for example, was answered correctly by 43% of women compared with only 23% of men. As mentioned above, a majority of Americans incorrectly believe pregnancy is dated from conception, but significantly more men than women think this is true. This finding is particularly important when considering the gender breakdown of the Florida state lawmakers who approved the six-week ban. Although we do not have data on the pregnancy knowledge of those legislators, we do know that those who voted for the ban were\u00a0overwhelmingly men. Florida\u2019s six-week ban will make it much harder for anyone to get abortions there \u2013 and it will also affect people in\u00a0neighboring states\u00a0who want or need an abortion. In 2023, Florida was home to the closest abortion clinic for\u00a06.4 million women\u00a0living in the South. In 2023,\u00a0around 7,700 women\u00a0from other Southern states,\u00a0where abortion is now largely banned, traveled to Florida to get abortions. Overall, our findings raise serious questions about whether Americans without medical training \u2013 much like those in our state legislatures \u2013 have the necessary knowledge needed to regulate abortion access.

{"id": "2024_05_17_health_ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness", "text": "The ultraprocessed foods your kids eat now may be putting them a greater risk for cardiometabolic problems \u2013 like heart attack, stroke and diabetes \u2013 in adulthood, a new study suggests. \u201cOne of the important things to learn is that some of the things that we deal with in the adult world, more likely than not start very early in life,\u201d said Dr. Stuart Berger, a pediatric cardiologist and chair of the section of cardiology and cardiac surgery for the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the research. The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, analyzed data from more than 1,400 children ages 3 to 6 recruited from schools across seven cities in Spain. The children\u2019s caregivers met with researchers in person and completed questionnaires at home on physical activity, food consumption and demographics from 2019 to 2022, according to the study. Researchers divided the data from the children into three groups based on the amount of ultraprocessed food they ate. Children who consumed the most ultraprocessed foods were more likely to have risk factors like a higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure and waist-to-height ratio, the study showed. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, chicken nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. \u201cAmericans eat ultraprocessed foods every day,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. A group of Americans in a study published on May 8 ate at least three servings of ultraprocessed food a day, with one group eating an average of seven daily servings, the study showed. Many studies have shown the negative health effects of ultraprocessed foods in adults, but Friday\u2019s study is among the first to show the impact they can have on the cardiometabolic health of young children, said Berger, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago. \u201cThis particular topic, ultraprocessed food consumptions and risk, is a very important topic in kids,\u201d he said. Starting young The study is observational, meaning that while researchers can identify an association between how much ultraprocessed foods children eat and their health, they cannot say that one causes the other, Berger said. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be mindful of ultraprocessed foods for young children, because how they eat for the rest of their lives is greatly impact by their early nutrition, he said. \u201cWhat we know is people who eat a certain way, even moms who eat in utero, set up baby\u2019s preferences,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere are a ton of publications that have shown that what we eat early in life \u2026 actually sets the stage for what happens in the future.\u201d Shifting your child\u2019s diet away from ultraprocessed foods and toward more fresh options is easier to do when they are very young, Berger said. Ultra-convenient The problem is that avoiding ultraprocessed foods is not equally easy for everyone. The study found that the children with the highest amount of ultraprocessed foods in their diet had mothers who were younger, had a higher BMI and had lower levels of education and employment. In places where fresh food might be harder to obtain, ultraprocessed foods are more accessible and inexpensive, Freeman said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are also ultra-convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, people reach for them when they feed their kids, and their kids aren\u2019t hungry, but they\u2019re filled with all these different chemicals and substances and seasonings and salts of sugars and whatever that they become very addicted to.\u201d Freeman stressed that giving kids ultraprocessed foods without also providing fresh fruits and vegetables sets them up for problems down the road. Adding in more nutritious foods and encouraging physical activity as much as possible is critical, Berger added. \u201cIf you can do something to create a healthy lifestyle early, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that you can you can eliminate metabolic syndromes later in life like diabetes, obesity, and all the complications associated with diabetes and obesity,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_world_blue-origin-rocket-ns-25-mission-scn", "text": "Blue Origin\u2019s tourism rocket has launched passengers to the edge of space for the first time in nearly two years, ending a hiatus prompted by a failed uncrewed test flight. The New Shepard rocket and capsule lifted off at 9:36 a.m. CT (10:36 a.m. ET) from Blue Origin\u2019s facilities on a private ranch in West Texas. NS-25, Blue Origin\u2019s seventh crewed flight to date, carried six customers aboard the capsule: venture capitalist Mason Angel; Sylvain Chiron, founder of the French craft brewery Brasserie Mont-Blanc; software engineer and entrepreneur Kenneth L. Hess; retired accountant Carol Schaller; aviator\u00a0Gopi Thotakura; and Ed Dwight, a retired US Air Force captain selected by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to be the nation\u2019s first Black astronaut candidate. Despite completing training at the Aerospace Research Pilot School\u00a0and receiving an Air Force recommendation, Dwight ultimately didn\u2019t make the NASA Astronaut Corps. He went on to become an entrepreneur and a sculptor; a new National Geographic documentary on Black astronauts, \u201cThe Space Race,\u201d highlights Dwight\u2019s pioneering story. \u201cI had no intention of being an astronaut. That was the last thing on my bucket list,\u201d Dwight said in the documentary. \u201cBut once I was given the challenge, then everything changes.\u201d Dwight completed that challenge and reached the edge of space at the age of 90, making him the oldest person to venture to such heights, according to a spokesperson from Blue Origin. \u201cI thought I didn\u2019t need it in my life,\u201d Dwight said of the experience on Blue Origin\u2019s livestream after the capsule touched down at 9:46 a.m. CT (10:46 a.m. ET). \u201cBut I lied. I really, really did need it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing experience,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody needs to do this.\u201d The rocket booster landed safely a couple minutes prior to the capsule. During the mission, the crew soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. The rocket vaulted the capsule past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, an area 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface that is\u00a0widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot of\u00a0gray area. And at the peak of the flight, passengers experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and striking views of Earth through the cabin windows. The launch followed the success of an uncrewed science mission in December \u2014 the New Shepard program\u2019s first flight since the mishap more than a year earlier. New Shepard\u2019s 2022 failure A New Shepard rocket and spacecraft were set to launch a batch of science instruments on September 12, 2022. But one minute into flight, the rocket endured Max Q \u2014 an aerospace term that refers to a moment of maximum stress on a vehicle. It occurs when the rocket is at a relatively low altitude \u2014 where the atmosphere is still fairly thick \u2014 but the spacecraft is moving at high speeds, creating a moment of intense pressure on the vehicle. Around that time, the rocket appeared to emit a massive burst of flames. The New Shepard capsule, which rides atop the rocket, then initiated its launch abort system \u2014 firing up a small engine to blast itself safely away from the malfunctioning rocket. That system worked as intended, parachuting the capsule to a safe landing. Blue Origin later\u00a0revealed\u00a0that the cause of the failure was a problem with the engine nozzle, a large cone that directs the flaming exhaust at the rocket\u2019s bottom. Onboard computers accurately detected the failure and shut the engine down, according to the company. No injuries were reported on the ground, and Blue Origin said the science payloads and the capsule could be flown again. But the rocket, left without a functioning engine, smashed back into the ground\u00a0and was destroyed. Typically after New Shepard launches, the rocket booster guides itself back to a safe upright landing so it can be flown again. During a December interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Bezos\u00a0said the escape system that jettisoned the capsule to safety is the most difficult piece of engineering in the entire rocket \u2014 but \u201cit is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone go on New Shepard.\u201d \u201cThe (rocket) booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it,\u201d Bezos added. \u201cThe power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. \u2026 So the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. \u201cA tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view \u2026 to be as safe as one can make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it perfectly safe. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Rocket fix and return to service The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches and is charged with ensuring public safety, oversaw an investigation into the failure. The probe revealed that the engine nozzle failed because it experienced higher temperatures than what the company had anticipated. To fix the issue, Blue Origin said it implemented \u201cdesign changes to the combustion chamber\u201d \u2014 the area of the engine where fuel explosively mixes with oxidizer \u2014 and adjusted \u201coperating parameters,\u201d or the data that the company uses to model safe flights. \u201cAdditional design changes to the nozzle have improved structural performance under thermal and dynamic loads,\u201d the company said in a March 2023\u00a0statement. The FAA formally concluded the mishap investigation on September 27, 2023, outlining 21 \u201ccorrective actions\u201d Blue Origin needed to implement before returning to flight. The agency did not reveal details on what those actions were,\u00a0noting the report\u00a0\u201ccontains proprietary data and U.S \u00a0Export Control\u00a0information and is not available for public release.\u201d The changes and New Shephard\u2019s successful December flight teed up the company to restart its trips to space for thrill seekers. Before the September 2022 failure, New Shepard rockets had flown 22 consecutive successful missions \u2014 including six with passengers on board.\u00a0Bezos flew aboard the rocket\u00a0in 2021. Other notable space tourists previously carried by the vehicle include \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor William Shatner and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host Michael Strahan.

{"id": "2024_05_13_health_parent-burnout-wellness", "text": "When I was knee-deep in the early years of parenting, Facebook was in its infancy and Instagram and TikTok weren\u2019t even on the horizon. I was stuck in the revolving door of work and parenting, and nothing about my personal life was Instagram-worthy. Dishes piled up, laundry was rarely folded, and Whole Foods did a fair amount of the cooking for me. And none of my life was online. Somewhere between 2006 and now, parenting became a crash course in achievement, with social media grading us at every turn. With perceived perfection as the end goal, as measured by child success, and pictures to prove it cross-posted on Facebook and Instagram, kids and parents alike unknowingly entered a relentless pressure cooker. \u201cParental achievement culture, and the chronic stress that comes with it, is real, if only because the resulting anxiety and churning stomach juices is real,\u201d said Jessica Lahey, author of \u201cThe Gift of Failure.\u201d \u201cHowever, much of that stress comes from us, from the media we consume, the parents we hang out with and the childhood milestones we focus on, and it can really warp our thinking.\u201d The nature of childhood changed as parents did their best to ensure that their kids were front-loaded with everything they needed to succeed in childhood. Free play was replaced with adult-directed activities and story time was swapped for reading practice. Even preschoolers became mini-achievers, with their early reading success a marker of exceptional parenting. It was a recipe for burnout. It\u2019s no surprise to me that researchers at the Ohio State University College of Nursing confirmed that parents are, indeed, facing burnout. In a 2023 survey of more than 700 parents nationwide, 57% of parents self-reported burnout. Parent burnout is strongly associated with both internal and external expectations. These include whether a person feels like a good parent, perceived judgment from others, whether they have enough time to play with their children, their relationship with their spouse, and keeping a clean house. I could live in a house littered with toys and unfolded clothes and throw a pizza on the table when work ran late without an online spotlight, but parents of young children today face impossible expectations. They have to work, create perfect learning conditions for child success, play with their children (but make sure the play involves education), cook organic everything from scratch on the daily, and make sure to update the sizzle reel often. One other concerning finding from the survey is that parents of children with mental health disorders reported higher levels of burnout and a greater likelihood of using harsh parenting practices, including insulting, criticizing, screaming at, cursing at and/or physically harming their children. These can result in a cycle of increased mental health issues for both the parent and the child. The researchers suggest engaging in positive parenting practices, including setting realistic and clear expectations, creating healthy boundaries and following predictable routines. Those are great starting points, especially for parents with young children, but there are other steps you can take as well: Monitor your social media use Social media has some benefits: It keeps us all connected, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s a healthy escape in small doses. But it also has downsides. Comparison culture is fueled by endless scrolling, we don\u2019t always see the story beneath the story, and frequent use can correlate to feelings of low self-esteem. There are two social media tricks that can be life-changing for adults: Mute accounts (you\u2019re the only one who will know!) that leave you feeling stressed and set a time limit using your phone settings. You\u2019re better off binging your favorite show on Netflix than jealous-scrolling and feeling defeated as a result. Embrace \u2018good enough\u2019 While perfection across contexts has long been a norm in our society, we would do well to tap into the work of Dr. Donald Winnicott. The pediatrician made a splash in the field of parenting in the 1950s when he introduced the concept of \u201cthe good enough mother.\u201d Noting that perfectionism is often counterproductive, Winnicott cautioned that no child seeks perfection from parents; they simply seek connection, physical needs and emotional safety. I suggest updating that language to \u201cthe good enough caregiver,\u201d but otherwise the principles hold up. To attempt perfection in child-rearing is to set kids up for a lifetime of stress and disappointment. Human beings are not perfect. Rather, doing our best on any given day is a far more realistic portrayal of how the world works. Reframe your thinking Lahey suggests stepping back from monitoring for signs of perceived achievement. \u201cOur kids need to know we love them no matter what grade, point or score they bring home,\u201d she said. \u201cOur children are more than the sum of their accomplishments and we \u2014 their parents \u2014 are not measured by those things either.\u201d Lahey cautions parents to remember that parenting is a long-haul job with peaks and valleys and that kids can and do learn from their mistakes along the way. Quit the competition One thing that will always remain true is that all children learn and grow at their own developmental paces. Milestones are simply goalposts to monitor for the extremes, but they are flexible. No two children are the same. You have the choice to step back, decrease the classes, sports and other activities you feel are essential because of external expectations, and find the right pace for your family. I often encourage parents to use a whiteboard calendar to write down every single thing they have to do in a week and then step back and remove at least two things. Small changes can reap big rewards, including decreased parental stress and burnout. You can quit the competition, and your kids will be better for it.

{"id": "2024_05_15_health_breastfeeding-mom-public-shame-sinf-cec", "text": "It\u2019s spring, and the air is filled with the melodies of mating songbirds. But when I walk down a tidy street near my suburban Virginia home, the jarring memory of another sound echoes in my mind: my daughter\u2019s piercing screams. Those desperate cries jolted me out of a daydream as I pushed her stroller down this very sidewalk back in December 2022. My daughter was home sick from daycare, and I\u2019d taken her on a walk hoping the cooler air would calm her cough. It seemed to be working, until suddenly, it clearly wasn\u2019t. There are so many moments as a parent when you find yourself doing something you vowed you\u2019d never do \u2014 especially when your child is having a meltdown in public. This was one of those moments for me, but that alone is not why it\u2019s seared in my mind. I will never forget that day, not because of what my child did, or even how I handled it, but because of the surprising way a stranger responded. On that December afternoon, my usually sweet 17-month-old was erupting into a full-blown meltdown. As her face reddened with rage, I tried handing her the bottle I\u2019d brought. She swatted it to the ground and kicked her feet so hard one of her shoes flew off. Even though she was still learning her first words, she had no trouble expressing herself. She didn\u2019t want milk from a bottle. She wanted it direct from the source: me. The way I saw it, that was simply impossible here \u2014 and the idea of it was mortifying. I hadn\u2019t brought my nursing cover, the tasteful shawl I made a point of wearing while feeding her in public.\u00a0Whenever she needed to nurse, I tried to cover up politely or slip away out of view. On this street, we were exposed. There was nowhere to hide. It\u2019s only as I describe it now that I realize how bizarre that sounds. There are so many parts of the world where women and children truly need to take cover to survive. I was lucky to be somewhere safe. And besides, I was proud to be a mom and loved feeding my daughter, so why was I acting so ashamed? Long before I ever had a child of my own, I\u2019d heard comments from TV personalities who\u2019d slammed breastfeeding in public, I\u2019d read news stories about women who were told to cover up, and I\u2019d even heard some snide remarks from members of my own family about the way moms nursed their kids. Of course, I\u2019d also read about celebrities and seen friends who defied these antiquated expectations. And once I started breastfeeding in public myself, most people didn\u2019t really notice \u2014 or at least, they acted like they didn\u2019t. But still, whenever I fed my daughter outside our home, part of me felt anxious about whether anyone was going to be offended. The years of comments I\u2019d heard sent a message so clear that I\u2019d developed a sense of shame around my body, and around feeding my child, without even realizing it. So even as my daughter\u2019s cries grew louder on that December afternoon, breastfeeding her seemed out of the question. In every direction I looked, there were blocks of houses and nicely manicured lawns, with no benches or parks in sight.\u00a0Plopping down in the middle of the sidewalk and lifting up my shirt was something I\u2019d NEVER do. Returning home was the only escape route I could see. I did a quick calculation. If I walked fast, we could probably get home in 10 minutes. Imagining the large number of houses we\u2019d have to pass with her screaming at the top of her lungs, I plowed ahead. But the meltdown only intensified with each step. And as I saw my daughter gasping to catch her breath with tears streaming down her face, and as I thought about how hard the past few nights had been, with coughing fits keeping her up for hours, I realized that giving her what she needed was the only thing that mattered. So suddenly, there I was \u2014 after months of trying to be discreet so I wouldn\u2019t make anyone else uncomfortable while I fed my child \u2014 sitting cross-legged in the middle of a sidewalk, lifting up my shirt and praying no one would notice us. I was relieved to see how quickly she relaxed, but I braced myself every time I heard a car engine rumbling or the jangle of a dog\u2019s leash. Someone was going to see us and say something. I wished I could sink into the ground and hide. In the distance, I saw a woman walking brusquely in our direction. I steeled myself for the criticism I knew had to be coming. Why was I blocking the sidewalk? Why was I flashing the neighbors rather than feeding my daughter at home? Why couldn\u2019t I get it together and control my child? But once she reached our stretch of the sidewalk, this stranger didn\u2019t ask any of those questions. Her words were kind and compassionate. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d she asked. I was stunned. I\u2019d been so certain she would judge me. \u201cYes,\u201d I said a bit sheepishly. \u201cShe just melted down, and I had to feed her.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t glare. She smiled. Then she told me how beautiful my daughter and I looked sitting there together, paired with the classical music piping through her headphones. She was standing a few feet away, but her words were an embrace I hadn\u2019t even realized I needed. In a matter of moments, I started to see the same beauty she did. I let go of the pressure and shame that had been weighing on me and found myself opening up. It\u2019s been more than a year since our paths crossed, and I can no longer remember this woman\u2019s face, but I can still feel her warmth. That day, I told her that we\u2019d been on a peaceful walk when suddenly the situation turned. My daughter had been home sick all week, I explained, and she was simply exhausted. The stranger nodded knowingly. She could see I was exhausted, too. She asked me how I was holding up. Tears welled up in my eyes. I told her I was OK, because thanks to her, I was.

{"id": "2024_05_14_health_omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness", "text": "Eating enough healthy fats is great for brain and heart health, but new research has possibly provided even more evidence for adding them \u2014 particularly omega-3s \u2014 to your diet. \u201cWe found that a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is associated with a greater risk of dying,\u201d said Yuchen Zhang, lead author of the April study published in the journal eLife, in a news release. Zhang is a doctoral student in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia\u2019s College of Public Health. Omega-3 fatty acids are naturally found in foods including fish \u2014 especially fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines \u2014 as well as flaxseed, walnuts, chia seeds and in dietary supplements such as fish oil. The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA; eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA; and docosahexaenoic acid, known as DHA, according to the National Institutes of Health. The body must obtain all three from foods, and omega-3s contribute to the health of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system and endocrine system. Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, on the other hand, include nuts, seeds, corn and soy \u2014 and the oils and preservatives produced from these foods, the authors said. Linoleic acid is the most common omega-6 fatty acid.\u00a0 \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that the high omega-6 to omega-3 fats ratio typical of Western diets \u2014 20:1 or even higher, compared to an estimated 1:1 during most of human evolution \u2014 contributes to many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and autoimmune disorders,\u201d Zhang said. But the results of past studies have been mixed, she added, and few have investigated the role of an imbalance in mortality. Also, accurately measuring fatty acid intake is difficult, partly due to reliance on participants\u2019 own recollections of their dietary intake. Zhang and the other researchers looked into the associations between the omega-3/omega-6 ratio in blood plasma \u2014 a more objective measure \u2014 and death from any cause and specifically from cancer or cardiovascular disease, the top two leading causes of death worldwide. They used data from 85,425 people who had participated in the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than half a million people between ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom for at least a decade. Participants, whose plasma samples were collected between 2007 and 2010, had answered questionnaires about their diet, including whether they took fish oil supplements. After nearly 13 years of follow-up, the authors found participants with the highest ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 were 26% more likely to die early from any cause, 14% more likely to die from cancer and 31% more likely to die from heart disease than those with the lowest ratios. Considered individually, both high levels of omega-6 and omega-3 were linked with a lower risk of premature death. But the protective effects of omega-3 were greater, likely explaining \u201cwhy having a high ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s was linked to harm,\u201d the authors said. Despite the findings, the study is \u201conly one \u2018snapshot\u2019 in time of biomarkers and dietary intake of omega 3s and 6s. This is correlation, not causation,\u201d said Dr. Lauren R. Sastre, director of the Farm to Clinic Program and assistant professor in the department of nutrition science at East Carolina University, via email. Sastre wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cAnd even that relationship cannot be strongly supported due to methodological flaws in not considering other dietary components to the overall health/clinical outcomes,\u201d Sastre added. \u201cThere are many anti-inflammatory food components (nutrients, phytochemicals, etc.) that are associated with reducing all-cause, cancer and (cardiovascular disease) mortality, and to only evaluate omega 3s and 6s \u2014 strong confounders may be present that would bias the results.\u201d Managing healthy fat intake If the omega-6/omega-3 balance actually does have more to do with premature death risk than the study has the capacity to prove, it could be due to the possible function of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of \u201cRegenerative Health: Discover Your Metabolic Type and Renew Your Liver for Life.\u201d Arachidonic acid is what the body converts from linoleic acid. It\u2019s a \u201cbuilding block for molecules that can promote inflammation, blood clotting, and the constriction of blood vessels,\u201d according to Harvard Health. But this fatty acid can also be converted into molecules that fight inflammation and blood clots. Omega-6s aren\u2019t inherently bad, but having too many may offset the anti-inflammatory factors associated with omega-3, Kirkpatrick said, so \u201ca more balanced approach \u2026 may be favorable.\u201d \u201cThe source of the omega 6s may also be a factor in offsetting the balance as well,\u201d she added via email. \u201cProcessed seed oils may also contain high amounts of omega 6s for example.\u201d Focusing on this balance and increasing your intake of foods rich in omega-3s can be more important than simply limiting those high in omega-6s, Kirkpatrick said. \u201cI would also look at the quality of the omega 6 foods in the diet,\u201d she added, \u201caiming for whole foods \u2026 rather than more processed products that may contain large amounts via the addition of seed oils.\u201d If you\u2019re curious what your blood plasma ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is, ask your physician about testing for it. In Kirkpatrick\u2019s practice, she often works with her patients\u2019 doctors for this purpose. Some patients request it with the goal of improving their mental health, heart health or risk of dementia, she said. Overall, \u201cit\u2019s important to note that an unbalanced ratio is only one chapter in our story of better or worse health span,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cGetting a variety of fiber-rich foods (beneficial to the microbiome) and other nutrient-dense foods, as well as adequate, good-quality sleep, stress management and physical activity play a large role in how long we will enjoy good health within our lifetime.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_health_genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Even if your genetics put you at greater risk for early death, a healthy lifestyle could help you significantly combat it, according to a new study. That risk could be mitigated by about 62% in people with a genetic predisposition, said lead author Dr. Xifeng Wu, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejiang Univeristy School of Medicine in China. Many studies have shown the connection between a healthy lifestyle and longevity and others have underscored the genetic component in lifespan, but the report published Monday in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine explored how the two come together. With data from more than 350,000 people and information on their genetics, education, socioeconomic status and disease history, this study had strong methodology, said Dr. Aladdin Shadyab, associate professor of public health and medicine at University of California San Diego. He was not involved in the research. The sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added. The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan. Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed. And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Wu, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University. Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed. \u201cAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,\u201d Wu said. The factors that made a difference The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan. But researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death. \u201cThe study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors \u2014 no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet \u2014 that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,\u201d Wu said. Adequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults. Moderate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Making lifestyle changes Building a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there. There are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking. A CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Committing to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of \u201cMindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,\u201d said in a previous CNN article. For a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil.

{"id": "2024_05_15_health_overdose-deaths-decrease-2023", "text": "After a steep rise during the Covid-19 pandemic, preliminary data shows that drug overdose deaths in the United States ticked down in 2023 for the first time in five years. About 107,500 people died from a drug overdose in 2023, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics \u2014 about 3,500 fewer than in 2022. Last year\u2019s decrease is the first since 2018, but the 3% drop is far less substantial than the surges that pushed overdose deaths to record levels in recent years. Overdose deaths\u00a0spiked\u00a030% between 2019 and 2020 and rose another 15% between 2020 and 2021, CDC data shows. Preliminary data is subject to change as death certificates are reviewed and records are assessed, but estimates suggest that, despite the decline, overdose deaths in 2023 were still almost twice as high as they were five years ago, according to the CDC data. \u201cIt is a hopeful trend in some ways,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Keyes, a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health whose research focuses on substance use epidemiology. \u201cWe know that this drug epidemic is dynamic and changes quite quickly, so any time you see a leveling off or a slight decrease, it is promising. It is certainly not a sign that we need to take the foot off the gas of overdose prevention.\u201d The US Department of Health and Human Services launched a coordinated national strategy to prevent overdoses two years ago. \u201cThis progress over the last 12 months should make us want to reinvigorate our efforts knowing that our strategies are making a difference,\u201d CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry\u00a0said in a statement, but \u201cthere are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses at staggering numbers.\u201d \u201cOur thoughts remain with those who have lost loved ones and those who are struggling with addiction or know someone who is.\u00a0Our country is committed to ending this epidemic and preventing unnecessary death and suffering,\u201d she said. Fentanyl has been driving the latest wave of overdose deaths, with synthetic opioids involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths. These highly potent narcotics continue to play an outsized role: they were involved in nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023. However, there were about 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023 than in 2022, the new data shows. Still, the deadly threat of fentanyl \u2014 which is about 50 times more potent than heroin \u2014 remains. In one indicator of its pervasiveness, a study published Monday shows that law enforcement seizures of illicit fentanyl have surged in recent years. More than 115 million pills containing illicit fentanyl were seized by law enforcement in 2023, compared with about 71 million in 2022 and less than 50,000 in 2017. \u201cFentanyl has continued to infiltrate the drug supply in communities across the United States and it is a very dangerous time to use drugs, even just occasionally,\u201d Dr. Nora Volkow, director of National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a statement. She was not directly involved in the new study, but the research was funded by the federal agency. \u201cIllicit pills are made to look identical to real prescription pills, but can actually contain fentanyl. It is urgently important that people know that any pills given to someone by a friend, purchased on social media, or received from any source other than a pharmacy could be potentially deadly \u2014 even after a single ingestion.\u201d The number of deaths due to fentanyl remains \u201calarmingly high,\u201d Keyes said. But the more promising trends reflect significant, multi-pronged efforts from many different sectors, she said, including use of treatments for opioid use disorder, expanded access to naloxone and other harm reduction programs and reducing opioid prescribing. \u201cI think that has been a real success story for public health,\u201d she said. While overdose deaths involving opioids declined, those involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamine increased, according to the preliminary data from the CDC. There were more than 36,000 deaths involving psychostimulants in 2023, a 2% increase from the year before. And deaths involving cocaine rose 5%, to nearly 30,000. About a third of all overdose deaths in 2023 involved psychostimulants, and cocaine was involved in more than a quarter. Much of this increase is likely due to the proliferation of fentanyl throughout the drug supply, Keyes said. \u201cWe know that when stimulants mix with opioids, it\u2019s particularly lethal,\u201d she said. But expanded surveillance can help those who are working to address the overdose crisis understand its rapidly changing epidemiology and adapt their efforts in real-time. Vast disparities in overdose deaths remain, including state-level differences; the latest CDC data shows \u201cnotable\u201d increases in some Western states such as Washington and Oregon, with overdose deaths increasing at least 27% year-over-year. In other states, including Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana and Maine, overdose deaths dropped by at least 15%. \u201cState-to-state differences point to the need for continued expansion of these efforts,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cBut I think the trends you see nationally are indicative of how it can work. We can address the opioid epidemic. This is not inevitable.\u201d For many state and local governments, funds from opioid settlements have been \u201cinstrumental\u201d to overdose prevention efforts and increased access to treatment and recovery support, Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, jurisdictions will continue to prioritize investments in harm reduction, prevention, and addressing the social determinants of health across communities that have been hardest hit by the overdose crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, state and territorial health agencies will continue to coordinate with partners to build a comprehensive response to this complex public health issue. Lastly, jurisdictions will continue to monitor and prepare to respond to changes in overdose rates and emerging threats within the drug supply.\u201d Recent surveys suggest that drug use among teens in the US has been relatively low and trending down. But overdose deaths have been rising in this age group and millions of adults and adolescents have a drug use disorder. \u201cResearch has shown that delaying the start of substance use among young people, even by one year, can decrease substance use for the rest of their lives. We may be seeing this play out in real time,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cThis trend is reassuring. Though, it remains crucial to continue to educate young people about the risks and harms of substance use in an open and honest way, emphasizing that illicit pills and other substances may contain deadly fentanyl.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/overdose-deaths-decrease-2023/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_05_14_health_abortion-telehealth-shield-laws-wecount-report", "text": "Most abortions in the United States are medication abortions, and telehealth has become an increasingly common way to access abortion pills \u2014 especially since the US Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to an abortion. In the last few months of 2023, nearly 1 in 5 abortions nationwide \u2014 about 17,000 each month \u2014 were medication abortions in which the pills were mailed to a patient after a remote consultation with a clinician, according to a new report from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning. When #WeCount started collecting data from abortion providers in April 2022, about 4% of all abortions were medication abortions provided through telehealth. Medication abortion is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two drugs \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 rather than having a surgical procedure. The US Food and Drug Administration approved the drugs for abortion use more than two decades ago, and the regimen is approved for use up to 10 weeks gestation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA provided regulatory flexibilities that allowed for broader access to medication abortions through telehealth. Earlier models often required patients to visit a clinic for ultrasounds or other in-person tests, but options for fully remote screening and use of mail-order pharmacies became more widely available in 2021. Telehealth abortions have surged in recent months as newer policies offered protection for people in states with abortion bans or severely limited to access care, the new report shows. Over the past year, five states where abortion is legal \u2014 Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Washington and Vermont \u2014 have enacted shield laws that allow providers in those states to prescribe medication abortion drugs via telehealth to people living in states with bans or restrictions. More than 40,000 people accessed telehealth abortions under shield laws in the second half of 2023, according to the new report. And by December, nearly a 10th of all abortions in the US \u2014 about 8,000 a month \u2014 were telehealth abortions provided under shield laws. Research has\u00a0long found\u00a0that medication abortion is safe and effective, and recent studies have shown that to be true even when the patient gets the medicine through a telehealth appointment. In addition to further supporting evidence that medication abortion provided through the mail is highly effective and safe, a study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday found the experience to be timely and broadly acceptable among patients. More than 90% of people who had abortion medication delivered through the mail said they were satisfied with the experience. Nearly all said they maintained their confidentiality through the process, and more than 85% said they received the medication within three days. The medication abortion was reported to be medically successful in about 98% of the cases, and the rare adverse events that did occur \u2014 less than 5% of people sought medical care \u2014 were not related to the mail-order dispensing, the study found. Recent data from Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, shows that there were 1 million abortions in the US in 2023, the highest rate in more than a decade and a 10% jump from 2020. The new #WeCount report supports these findings and shows that abortions are increasing in the US, even when those provided under shield laws are excluded from the trends. \u201cEven as the total national number of abortions nationally has increased, we can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that access to in-person abortion care has virtually disappeared in states where abortion is banned,\u201d Dr. Alison Norris, co-chair of the #WeCount project and professor at The Ohio State University\u2019s College of Public Health, said in a statement. \u201cThe loss of clinic-based care \u2014 which makes up more than 80% of abortion care \u2014 is a devastating loss to access for people across wide swaths of the country.\u201d In the year and a half after the Dobbs decision, there would have been about 145,000 more in-person abortions if it had not been banned in 14 states, according to estimates from the #WeCount report. But medication abortion, including telehealth abortion, has become a more common option than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible how many barriers get removed from the process\u201d with telehealth abortion, said Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, co-chair of the #WeCount project and professor at the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the ease and access, but telehealth is able to deliver abortion at a much lower cost.\u201d It\u2019s filled some of the gaps created by abortion bans, but building broader awareness of and trust in telehealth abortion remains a challenge, she said. But at the end of 2023, nine states where abortion remained legal still had restricted telehealth abortions in some way \u2014 requiring an in-person ultrasound or counseling before the procedure, for example. Telehealth abortion is \u201cespecially important for individuals living outside metropolitan areas, in low-income communities, or where high-quality reproductive and maternity care services are lacking because of legislative restrictions,\u201d a group of family medicine physicians wrote in an editorial that was published in JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday. Primary care physicians are an \u201cuntapped resource\u201d that can help abortion access through clinics or telehealth, they wrote. But legal threats challenge the future potential of telehealth abortion, too. Mail service is managed by the federal government, and a change to the administration could threaten mail-order delivery of abortion pills and patients who receive them, Upadhyay said. And in March, the US Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could severely limit access to mifepristone, the primary drug used for medication abortions. \u201cAccess to medication abortion through telehealth continues to play an ever-increasing role in abortion care nationwide \u2014 even as the Supreme Court weighs the fate of telehealth abortion care,\u201d Upadhyay said in a statement. \u201cThe need for abortion care across the country demands that providers, advocates, and lawmakers continue to come together to innovate new strategies to help people access abortion care.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/abortion-telehealth-shield-laws-wecount-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness", "text": "After decades of decline, accidental drowning rates are rising in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. With Americans getting ready to hit swimming pools and beaches on Memorial Day weekend, a new study shows that many lack the skills they need to stay safe in the water. Roughly 15% of US adults \u2013 40 million people \u2013 say they don\u2019t know how to swim.\u00a0More than half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to a new national survey by the CDC. The new data on swimming skills in the US population is included in a Vital Signs report released Tuesday by the CDC. It comes on the heels of an increase in drowning deaths in the US in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Each year, on average, about 4,000 Americans died from accidental drowning, a number that changed little from 2011 to 2020. But that number has been about 10% higher the past few years, adding 500 to 600 more deaths each year to the annual tally.\u00a0It\u2019s the first uptick in drowning rates in the US for at least\u00a0two decades. \u201cWhen I just look at the overall numbers, with over 4,000 people dying \u2013 that\u2019s over 12 people a day \u2013 that\u2019s really one person every two hours. And those are lives, not numbers,\u201d said Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC. The increases in drownings were even more dramatic for certain ages and racial groups. Drowning has long been the leading cause of death for preschool-age children. Drowning rates increased almost 30% in this age group in 2021 and 2022. Although the number of drowning deaths in children ages 4 and younger increased among young children in 2020, the rate increase was not statistically significant that year. Black people also saw drowning rates increase faster than the general population; compared with 2019, they were nearly 30% higher in 2021.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that Black Americans reported spending less recreational time in the water than White and Hispanic people.\u00a0If drowning rates were calculated based on exposure rather than population, the study authors noted, it\u2019s likely that the disparities for Black people would be even more pronounced. Additionally, the CDC\u2019s swimming skills survey found that 1 in 3 Black adults said they couldn\u2019t swim, compared with 1 in 7 adults in the general population, a legacy of segregation and discrimination in access to swimming pools in the US, according to the CDC. Hispanic Americans, a group that doesn\u2019t traditionally have disproportionately higher drowning rates compared with White non-Hispanics, also saw drowning rates increase by nearly 25% in 2022, compared with 2019. American Indian and Alaska Natives continued to have the highest rates of drownings of any racial or ethnic group overall. In 2019, there were about 3 drowning deaths for every 100,000 people among American Indian and Alaska Natives, a rate that has seen little change over the course of the pandemic.\u00a0By comparison, there were 1.2 accidental drowning deaths for every 100,000 among White people in 2019. Houry says it\u2019s hard to say exactly how the pandemic may have played a role in the increases.\u00a0The study can only make associations \u2013 it can\u2019t untangle the causes \u2013 but she notes that it was harder to get into public pools, with many closing or implementing policies that limited access.\u00a0Staffing was also problematic for many swim venues. \u201cThere would have been people, if swimming pools were closed for that year, who didn\u2019t get swim lessons and so might have been behind in getting swim lessons,\u201d Houry said. Berkeley Champlin didn\u2019t know the statistics around drowning deaths in young children until her son, Gordie, tragically became one of them. In July 2020, 3-year-old Gordie slipped unnoticed out of the sliding glass doors in Champlin\u2019s home in Livonia, Michigan, while Champlin was at work. Normally, he would have been in day care, but like many schools, it was shut down at the time. His father, who was home with him, later found him in the family\u2019s pool. He couldn\u2019t be revived. Gordie loved animals and couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night without special stuffed animals: an elephant and a bunny. \u201cI put his elephant and his bunny in his casket with him so that he has them always, because he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Champlin said.\u00a0She has drawings of the stuffies tattooed on her forearm. \u201cI wish he would have had swim lessons,\u201d she said. Every year since Gordie died, Champlin has channeled her grief into raising money for swim lessons for other children. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive.\u00a0It costs $120 a month in some places for a child to take lessons,\u201d said Champlin, who knows that may put them out of reach for some families. Champlin set a goal of paying for three kids to learn to swim each year.\u00a0This year, 42 families reached out to her for help, and she set up a\u00a0GoFundMe account\u00a0to raise money to cover them all. \u201cIf anyone else is ever in that situation, or if you go on vacation, or you\u2019re on the lake or a new pool or something that you don\u2019t have your standard parameters around, swim lessons is the way to prevent accidents from happening,\u201d she said. Houry, from the CDC, agrees. \u201cI think we forget drowning is still a really big problem for our young kids and that we can do something about it by making sure kids know how to swim,\u201d she said. Houry said the CDC is funding programs at the Red Cross and YMCA to help lower the cost of lessons and make sure everyone who needs them can get them \u201cbecause it\u2019s so important to have that equitable access,\u201d she added. Houry said kids should start getting swim lessons between the ages of 1 and 4. \u201cIf you are an adult and you don\u2019t know how to swim, it\u2019s never too late to get that swim lesson. It\u2019s really important,\u201d she said. But Houry\u00a0said that even if kids can swim, adults shouldn\u2019t leave them unattended, drink alcohol or get distracted while watching kids in the pool. In settings like a party, where it\u2019s easy for conversations or phones to divert attention, the CDC says it can be useful to assign an adult specifically to watch kids in the pool.\u00a0When swim time is over, the\u00a0CDC recommends\u00a0shutting and locking doors that give access to water.\u00a0In the event that something does happen, learning CPR can help you save a life before paramedics arrive. Houry says fencing that completely encloses a pool can help make backyard and community pools safer.\u00a0In open water, like lakes, life jackets are important for safety, too.\u00a0 When visiting a lake or ocean beach, it\u2019s a good idea to take stock of the hazards, such as rip currents, before going into the water. As Gordie\u2019s birthday approaches on July 12, Champlin said, she finds herself wondering what kind of a party he\u2019d want at age 6. Would he still love animals and superheroes as much, or would it be some kind of gaming thing like Roblox? Just as in past years, they\u2019ll spend his birthday at the zoo, a place that still holds vivid memories of her son. \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial", "text": "When Cheri Ferguson started taking Ozempic last year, she said, she hoped to lose about 50 pounds she\u2019d gained during the Covid-19 pandemic. Over about three months, she told CNN in June, the medicine \u2013 which is approved for type 2 diabetes and used off-label for weight loss \u2013 helped reduce the constant chatter in her brain urging her to eat, just what she\u2019d hoped it would do. But it had another unexpected effect: Ferguson said her desire to drink alcohol and use her vape pen also drained away. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone\u2019s just come along and switched the light on, and you can see the room for what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of these vapes and cigarettes that you\u2019ve had over the years, they don\u2019t look attractive anymore. It\u2019s very, very strange. Very strange.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling described by thousands of people taking these medicines, which are in a class known as GLP-1 receptor agonists and used by an estimated 15 million Americans, according to a recent poll. And now, Ozempic\u2019s maker, Novo Nordisk, said it intends to study the phenomenon. The company plans to start assessing the effects of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and other medicines on alcohol consumption this month in a newly announced clinical trial in alcohol-related liver disease \u2013 although cutting drinking isn\u2019t the study\u2019s main goal. A focus on liver disease, not addiction The Danish drug giant has been saying since at least last year that it doesn\u2019t plan to study semaglutide \u2013 which is also approved for weight loss as Wegovy \u2013 in areas like alcohol addiction, despite so many anecdotal reports like Ferguson\u2019s, and academic studies that are already underway. Novo Nordisk reiterated that stance Wednesday, noting that the main purpose of its new trial is to assess whether the medicines can improve liver health. Its primary measure is the medicines\u2019 effects on enhanced liver fibrosis, or scarring, over 28 weeks. \u201cSecondary endpoints include safety and tolerability and changes in alcohol consumption,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThere is a significant unmet medical need in alcohol-related liver disease, and the first line of treatment for the condition is lifestyle intervention to refrain from drinking alcohol.\u201d The trial, first reported by Bloomberg News, aims to enroll about 240 participants and is slated to begin May 20, according to a government database. \u201cEven though not all patients in the trial will have alcohol use disorder, it is natural to include alcohol consumption as a secondary endpoint,\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s spokesperson said, noting that the trial is part of the company\u2019s plans to address liver diseases more broadly. Nonetheless, researchers in addiction science cheered the news. A need for more treatments \u201cThose of us doing work in this area see this as a step in the right direction,\u201d Christian Hendershot, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Bowles Center of Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who is running one of the few studies in this area, said by email Wednesday. \u201cAdditional treatment options for this group are really needed.\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s CEO told CNN in August that the company had heard many similar anecdotal reports. \u201cWe\u00a0know\u00a0that\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0benefits\u00a0in\u00a0obesity\u00a0is\u00a0that\u00a0it\u00a0addresses\u00a0this\u00a0craving,\u00a0the\u00a0desire,\u00a0to\u00a0snack\u00a0and eat,\u201d Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. \u201cThat function in the brain, in this craving center, is perhaps also what is benefitting some of the other addictions.\u201d Studies in animals suggest the same thing, National Institutes of Health researcher Dr. Lorenzo Leggio told CNN last year. He published a study in May 2023 showing that semaglutide reduces alcohol drinking in rodents, noting that \u201cat least one of the mechanisms of how these drugs reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol,\u201d like those related to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Jorgensen said Novo Nordisk hadn\u2019t studied that effect and had no plans to do so at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0the\u00a0easiest\u00a0to\u00a0study,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t expect that we would go in and study these addictions widely.\u201d Jorgensen did say there could be \u201can opportunity to collect data when we do large studies,\u201d as well as to use artificial intelligence to mine large databases of experiences with the medicines in the real world for signals of effects on things like alcohol use. A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes tirzepatide-based competitors to Ozempic and Wegovy called Mounjaro and Zepbound, said Wednesday that it too had seen \u201canecdotal commentary in publications about the potential use of GLP-1s for additional indications like addiction.\u201d But while the Indianapolis-based drugmaker continues \u201cto evaluate future development options for tirzepatide,\u201d the spokesperson said the company hadn\u2019t announced any plans to develop its medicines for those uses. An unattractive market for drugmakers Medicines for addiction, and particularly for alcohol use, haven\u2019t been successful financially for the drug industry, leading to less interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing drugs in the space. Research from financial firm TD Cowen found that less than 5% of the 29 million Americans estimated to have alcohol-use disorder receive drug therapy. The firm pointed to issues like doctors not being familiar with medicines to treat alcohol use and compliance with the drugs. \u201cAlcohol is now the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver transplantation in the US,\u201d Leggio told CNN by email Thursday. \u201cWe do need to develop novel treatments for alcohol-associated liver disease itself, plus novel treatments for the underlying medical problem that leads to ALD; that is, alcohol use disorder.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very promising and exciting that a company like Novo Nordisk is taking the lead in conducting such an important clinical trial,\u201d Leggio said. Novo Nordisk is looking at multiple medicines in its newly announced trial in alcohol-related liver disease; in addition to semaglutide, the company said it will investigate experimental drugs cagrilintide and zalfermin \u2013 listed on the trial posting as NNC0194-0499 \u2013 alone and in combination. Cagrilintide is a medicine that mimics a hormone called amylin that Novo Nordisk is testing in combination with semaglutide \u2013 which mimics another hormone, called GLP-1 \u2013 in large trials in both diabetes and weight loss, calling the combination CagriSema. Zalfermin, the company said, acts like yet another metabolic hormone, FGF21, which is produced mainly in the liver. Though trials in use of semaglutide and similar medicines have been slow to start, so many reports of the drugs\u2019 effects on alcohol use have emerged that Leggio, Hendershot and other researchers warned in a commentary in the journal Nature Medicine that the drugs shouldn\u2019t be prescribed for alcohol-use disorder until their safety and efficacy has been proven in clinical trials. \u201cClinical decisions should follow from controlled studies, triangulated with other clinical and preclinical evidence,\u201d the researchers wrote in the December commentary. \u201cWell-controlled [trials] with scientific rigor are needed before any claim of efficacy for alcohol-use disorder and other substance use disorders can be made.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

The agency also proposed the group be blocked from receiving federal funds in the future, possibly\u00a0for\u00a0years. Before Covid-19 emerged, a US government grant to EcoHealth had funded studies into bat coronaviruses at the lab in Wuhan, China. Although US-funded research at the lab has not been linked to the pandemic, the US suspended funding\u00a0to EcoHealth in 2020. The grant was later reinstated it. US funding to the Wuhan lab has since been blocked. In a new\u00a0letter\u00a0to EcoHealth Alliance and its president, Dr. Peter Daszak, HHS lists 30 pieces of information, some dating back to 2013\u00a0to support its decision.\u00a0HHS said in a\u00a0memo\u00a0that EcoHealth failed to \u201cadequately monitor\u201d virus growth in experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, notify the National Institutes of Health that viruses studied there \u201cappeared to grow beyond permissible thresholds\u201d laid out in a grant or provide requested information in a timely manner. \u201cHHS believes there is adequate evidence in the record\u00a0for\u00a0this debarment cause and that immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest,\u201d Henrietta Brisbon, an HHS suspension and debarment official, wrote in the letter. In a statement, a spokeperson for EcoHealth Alliance said the organization is \u201cdisappointed by HHS\u2019 decision today and we will be contesting the proposed debarment. We disagree strongly with the decision and will present evidence to refute each of these allegations and to show that NIH\u2019s continued support of\u00a0EcoHealth\u00a0Alliance is in the public interest.\u201d An\u00a0HHS Office of the Inspector General\u00a0report last year found that despite\u00a0potential risks from research performed through the EcoHealth grant, the group was late to report information and the NIH failed to follow up. EcoHealth Alliance has said it was\u00a0unable to access the NIH reporting system because of technical problems, but in a new HHS action memo, it says a forensic report found the group was \u201cnever locked out of the system.\u201d Earlier this month, House lawmakers questioned Daszak about EcoHealth\u2019s record on research and safety, including at the Wuhan lab. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Wednesday, Brad Wenstrup, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Oversight Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, said its investigation into EcoHealth and the origins of Covid-19 is \u201cfar from over.\u201d The origin of the virus that caused Covid-19 continues to drive research and investigations by scientists, intelligence officials and lawmakers.\u00a0Previous scientific studies\u00a0have suggested the virus that causes Covid-19 likely emerged naturally in a Wuhan seafood market, but they have not identified a specific origin. The US intelligence community\u00a0has maintained\u00a0it\u2019s plausible that\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0originated in a laboratory or in the wild.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/us-government-suspends-fundingforvirus-research-group-at-center-of-covid-19-origin-controversy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers", "text": "Laboratory tests by the US Department of Agriculture haven\u2019t found any H5N1 bird flu virus in raw beef, but they are a good reminder why eating rare hamburgers can be risky. As part of a suite of tests conducted to check safe food handling advice after the detection of H5N1 bird flu virus in dairy cattle, the USDA recently mixed a substitute virus into ground beef and then cooked patties at varying times and temperatures. Researchers found none of the virus in hamburgers cooked to 145 degrees, roughly the temperature of a medium burger, or well-done burgers cooked to 160 degrees. They did, however, find some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, although the virus was present \u201cat much, much reduced levels,\u201d said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA. Whether that small amount of virus could make someone sick is still an unknown. The USDA already advises consumers to cook ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, as measured with a food thermometer, to avoid infections from bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli, he noted. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody needs to change any of the safe food handling or safe cooking practices that are already recommended,\u201d Deeble said. The USDA also announced $22 million in new government investments to protect animal health. The bulk of the funding will go to the Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and to a network of state laboratories called the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. \u201cThere are some labs that have equipment that needs to be updated or upgraded and additional folks that are interested in adding capacity to the laboratories that they operate. And so this funding is going to help support those types of projects,\u201d Deeble said Thursday. Between May 6 and May 12, the national lab network processed 1,100 tests for H5N1 bird flu in cattle, and 278 of those were presumed positive, Deeble said.\u00a0He cautioned that because multiple samples can be taken from the same animal or tests may be pooled, the number of tests doesn\u2019t reflect the number of animals tested or the number that are positive.\u00a0Approximately 600 of the tests were performed in accordance with the USDA\u2019s new order, which requires testing of dairy cattle moving between states.\u00a0Another 450 tests were performed on animals showing symptoms. USDA said that it had gotten a positive response to its offer last week to financially compensate producers who take steps to protect their herds and workers against further spread of the virus. However, it doesn\u2019t have the forms ready for farmers to fill out, so nobody has been signed up for the program.\u00a0It hopes to have the paperwork ready by the middle of next week, Deeble said. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency had not been able to find farmworkers willing to participate in studies looking at how bird flu transmits on dairy farms in return for $75. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up hope. We are in\u00a0constant conversation with a number of states. We\u2019re getting closer, but as of yet, nothing across the finish line,\u201d Shah said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta", "text": "I\u2019ve been reporting on Alzheimer\u2019s disease for more than two decades, and any progress in the field has seemed incremental at best, leaving most patients and their loved ones with few options. But in the process of filming a new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I met with people all across the country who had been diagnosed with or who are at high risk of the disease. With lifestyle changes alone, I saw levels of amyloid plaque decrease in their brains, their cognition improve and even signs of reversal of the disease. It was extraordinary and it also made me start to think about my own brain, because I have a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. So with some trepidation, I decided to learn more about my risk for dementia. It was one of the most personal and revealing\u00a0experiences I have ever gone through. To start, I underwent an intensive exploration of my brain, far deeper than I even thought possible. This wasn\u2019t a simple look at the anatomy or even the genetics that might predispose me to a particular type of dementia. The goal was to obtain a complete story of my brain, from my earliest days through my education and formative years to now: a man in his mid-50s. Most importantly, the in-depth testing could give me a clearer idea of where I was headed and how to steer my path in the most favorable direction. Even as a brain surgeon myself, I was surprised at how well the health of your brain can be measured. With the heart, it is pretty well-accepted that a battery of tests can help give us a clear idea of how to predict, prevent and treat heart disease. Until recently, however, we really could not say the same about the brain. Many brain doctors still struggle even to define the criteria for a healthy brain. The general consensus was that the \u201cblack box\u201d in your skull was pretty fixed and that there was little you could do to assess it, let alone optimize it. Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist, convinced me otherwise, and it led to one of the most fascinating \u2014 and somewhat frightening \u2014 days I have had in my life. I\u2019ve known Richard for a long time, and we are friends. We have had great conversations about our shared love for the brain, and I often turn to him to get his thoughts on neurological developments in the news. What has always struck me about Richard is that he is consistently unwilling to accept the status quo in medicine, almost more as a matter of justice rather than scientific pursuit, although he is that rare individual who is stellar at making a difference in both. So I immediately thought of him when considering the idea of a preventive neurology visit. To be clear, I wasn\u2019t going to Richard because I thought I had any sort of problem. But that is the point: When people refer to the US medical field as a \u201csick-care\u201d system instead of a health-care system, this is what I think they mean. Richard would certainly see me if I were sick, but he preferred to see me now, while I was healthy, fully believing he could help me maintain my brain, reduce my chance of dementia and even optimize my function, as he described in a 2018 study. I flew into Boca Raton, Florida, to see Richard at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases of Florida clinic on a beautiful day in March. He had advised me ahead of time to not exercise or eat that morning and to prepare for a day of intense mental gymnastics. Although this wasn\u2019t an IQ test, he said, in some ways, it would be far more personal. I must say that it felt very meta to get an assessment of my own brain and find out whether it was functioning as it should or if there were problems I had not yet noticed. Was I getting rusty? Maybe I was making errors that my family, friends and colleagues were too polite to tell me about. If there were gaps in processing speed or executive judgment, they might now be uncovered and unmasked. When I got to the clinic, I first underwent a battery of blood tests, checking my phosphorylated tau ratio, better known as the Alzheimer\u2019s blood test, and measures of my lipids, inflammation and glucose levels, to name just a few. I was also tested for my genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. If I was a carrier of the APOE4 gene, it could carry significant higher risk of the disease. I spit into a tube to check my oral health. After that, I stepped on a body composition scale to figure out where and how much bone, fat and muscle I had in my body. I was a little surprised to catch Richard in the corner, looking at the readout and saying, \u201cInteresting \u2026\u201d while stroking his chin. Nobody likes to see their doctors do that. Not even doctors like to see other doctors do that. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked across the room. \u201cOh,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably fine.\u201d He later told me that he saw evidence of an old left arm injury and accurately predicted that I had had an intense leg workout the day before. It was a real reminder of how clearly the body keeps score. Even though I hadn\u2019t thought about that injury in years, it had clearly left its mark on my body and still triggered a finding on this test. After that came the cognitive testing. This was perhaps the most surprising. At first, I was told to relax and listen to the detailed short story of an Atlanta football team captain, a quarterback who had injured his finger on a fishing trip before the big game. I thought I had been paying attention but suddenly realized I probably wasn\u2019t as engaged as I thought. \u201cWhat day did he injure himself, and how many stitches did he need? What was the player\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked 15 minutes later. Could I even be certain if it was his thumb or left ring finger? Quick: Recite as many words as you can starting with the letter \u201cG\u201d and then immediately rattle off as many animal names as possible, both in one-minute increments. The longer the words and the more unusual the animals, the better. There were lists of words to remember, three-dimensional cubes and clocks to be drawn, and dozens of faces to match with their names. I had to scratch and sniff 50 different smells and determine, in one instance, if something smelled more like gasoline, acetone or a forest fire. In another instance, it was lavender or lilac. I found myself suddenly being unsure and trying to summon up a memory of that smell to try to answer correctly. I felt like my brain was being cross-examined by a very skilled prosecutor. It wasn\u2019t just about the number of errors I made but the types of errors, how long I took to respond and whether I simply lost my attention. There are obvious red flags that pop up if someone draws a clock backward or if they have lost their ability to distinguish certain smells. The more subtle concerns were around visual-spatial construction or an ability to ignore incongruent stimuli in the Stroop Color and Word Test, such as identifying the color red, even if that word appears in purple on the screen. Although I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with dyslexia, Richard thinks it might be something I have. \u201cDo you count on your fingers?\u201d he asked me. I have always done that and never considered it to be notable or suggestive of something significant. Turns out I was less likely to remember words with lots of Bs and Ds in them because I may have always shied away from letters I more easily confused. These types of insights about my own brain, big and small, were all so fascinating (and a bit unsettling) to me. For Richard, however, they represented opportunities for early intervention, some of which are remarkably simple. \u201cMost doctors would look at your results and say you are doing fine,\u201d Richard explained before he showed me the results of my lab testing. \u201cBut what they are really saying is that you are probably fine \u2013 for the next few years. I am playing the long game here, and I think you are going to see a lot of areas we can start to address now, today.\u201d I am a pretty competitive guy, so I am used to having all \u201cgreens\u201d pop up when I review my lab testing results. After all, I take great pride in my health and approach it with the same rigor that I approached my grades in medical school. I wanted to do really well, certainly as well as I could possibly do. So when Richard flipped over my lab results and showed me a page that had not only a considerable amount of yellow but even a few reds, my heart dropped. My homocysteine level was elevated, but my B12 level was low. That wasn\u2019t surprising to Richard, because he had also found a mutation in my MTHFR gene, which meant that I probably didn\u2019t process homocysteine well. My omega-3 levels were all right, but not when you compared them with my omega-6 levels. My DHEA levels were a little low, which might partly explain why I have had more trouble putting on muscle than I did a decade ago. And I was surprised to learn that I was carrying more inflammation in my body than I expected, especially given that I felt fine. What was most revealing to me was how clearly these blood test abnormalities could be associated with neurological function. Richard told me that issues of metabolism, such as even slight insulin resistance, can accelerate amyloid deposition, which can lead to amyloid plaques, those telltale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, down the line. He also said that, in his experience, cholesterol and lipid abnormalities can be associated with problems with executive function and speed of processing. He added that he associates depression with lower attention and slower processing speeds. I\u2019ve been practicing neurosurgery for 30 years, and I had never heard of this. Richard was able to draw a link between very functional aspects of the brain to very specific problems in the body. And, more important, he has presented scientific evidence showing that optimizing those physical targets is associated with improved cognitive function. Richard also wanted to address an activity I did on a daily basis: my neighborhood walk with my three dogs. \u201cKeep doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now with a weighted vest.\u201d Why? Not having enough lean muscle mass is problematic. He told me people typically do a good job addressing their arms and legs, but loading the spine with additional weight helps activate core muscles, such as abdominals and obliques, as well as stimulating the growth of new bone cells. This could lead to a critical redistribution of the fat, muscle and bone in my body and help drive down any insulin resistance that I may be genetically predisposed to and eventually lower my risk of developing amyloid in the brain. On Richard\u2019s advice, I started to make a few changes to my nutrition and day-to-day routine. Over the years, I had gone back and forth on fish oil, not overly impressed with the data on heart health and finding it challenging to keep the pills refrigerated, especially when I was on the road. For Richard, though, it was clear. As healthy as my diet is, he had no doubt that I needed to take the extra steps to supplement with omega-3 fatty acids to help my omega-3/omega-6 ratio in the pursuit of better brain health. This would also help with the absorption of B vitamins, he added. Those needed to be supplemented as well, and Richard was very specific about this. \u201cMake sure to get the bottle with 1,000 micrograms of B12 and 400 micrograms of methylfolate along with 1.5 milligrams of B6.\u201d Those fairly straightforward recommendations to improve my fatty acids could probably make an impact with my executive function, he told me. In the recommendation about brain health, I did not expect an intervention involving my feet, but the nerves that run to the feet are the longest in our body. When you don\u2019t move your toes and feet regularly and freely, Richard says, you can lose sensory awareness, also known as proprioception, leading to a \u201csensory paralysis.\u201d Over time, the nerve connections that run from your feet to your brain start to disappear. Once your feet are weak, your weight will be unevenly distributed when walking and exercising. The better your feet can tolerate a load evenly, the more options they have for movement, the better and more cooperative things will be up the chain, including your knees, hips and lower back. Consider wearing toe spacers occasionally, he told me. Start with 10 minutes a day every few days, and increase the time as you get used to them. Some of the recommendations were more sophisticated. For example, Richard would ideally want even more testing. He\u2019d like to get a detailed DEXA scan of my entire body, not just for bone health but to get a clear look at how much visceral fat I am carrying. Visceral fat is not the subcutaneous fat that you can pinch between your thumb and your forefinger. Rather, it\u2019s the problematic stuff that chokes off the internal organs in your belly. Because visceral fat is so buried and woven into your internal organs, it\u2019s actually quite hard to assess how much someone has. A person could be skinny and still have a lot of visceral fat. Because I had some inflammatory elevations, he worried that I might be one of those people. He also suggested a brain MRI. He was worried that there might be cerebral blood vessel injury because of a slightly elevated fibrinogen level, a protein that can help the blood clot. The concern was that I might be making more frequent micro clots, which could put me at increased risk of vascular dementia later in life. And finally, a coronary calcium CT scan to detect coronary artery disease at its earliest stages, because as a general rule, what is bad for the heart is also bad for the brain. To be clear, most of these tests aren\u2019t part of routine care, and I struggle with the cost of it all. They can be expensive and probably wouldn\u2019t be covered by a person\u2019s insurance, especially if they aren\u2019t showing symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia or mild cognitive impairment. That is why Richard is also working to make much of it available for free at home. Nearly all the cognitive testing could be available in the future through a free app. Even the blood work could be done via finger-prick testing, if all goes as expected with Richard\u2019s research trial. Although a complete DEXA scan requires a facility, there are home scales that do a reasonably good job at measuring overall body composition, not just weight, and can help follow those trends over time. When I first visited with Richard after all my testing, I honestly expected to be told I was doing fine \u2013 even excellent. That is what every doctor had told me before. But the evidence is clear that when it comes to your brain, prevention and even optimization are possible. We know that in so many areas of medicine, there is a very large white space between being totally healthy and being sick. And it\u2019s an area that a sick-care system would not spend much time addressing, especially if the recommendations are as simple and wildly effective as a few vitamins, toe spacers and a rucksack. Going through this experience for \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient\u201d was more revealing and jarring than I could have imagined. After all, nobody wants bad news from a doctor, especially when it comes to your brain. But I can take comfort in knowing these tests aren\u2019t laying out a certain future or preparing me for inevitable catastrophe but rather giving me the personalized knowledge that I can use to take action toward a longer, healthier life and a sharper, healthier brain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_world_boeing-starliner-helium-leak-delay-update-scn", "text": "The target date for the highly anticipated inaugural crewed mission of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft has moved yet again. Starliner\u2019s first flight carrying astronauts was expected as soon as May 21 after two previous delays this month, but mission teams need more time to \u201cwork through spacecraft closeout processes and flight rationale,\u201d and are now aiming to launch no sooner than 3:09 p.m. ET on May 25, according to a NASA release. The update comes just days after Starliner teams reported a small helium leak in the service module of the spacecraft. They traced the leak to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. Additional time before launch will give specialists more time to evaluate this issue, though tests thus far have found that the leak doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the mission, according to NASA\u2019s latest update. \u201cPressure testing performed on May 15 on the spacecraft\u2019s helium system showed the leak in the flange is stable and would not pose a risk at that level during the flight,\u201d the space agency said in its news release. \u201cThe testing also indicated the rest of the thruster system is sealed effectively across the entire service module. Boeing teams are working to develop operational procedures to ensure the system retains sufficient performance capability and appropriate redundancy during the flight.\u201d This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The historic crewed flight was about two hours from liftoff on May 6 when it was scrubbed due to an issue with the a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, have been in preflight quarantine but returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families, Boeing said. Williams and Wilmore will fly back to NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida closer to the new launch date, according to the space agency\u2019s latest release. Boeing\u2019s historic aims The Crew Flight Test is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand US options for ferrying astronauts to the space station. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. A rocky start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. Williams and Wilmore were already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule May 6 when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the latest issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket\u00a0has caused further delay. If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit, as Starliner begins firing its own engines. The vehicle will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The history-making crew will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/boeing-starliner-helium-leak-delay-update-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_health_wegovy-trial-analysis", "text": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use. The analyses \u2013 of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss \u2013 also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used \u2013 and covered by insurers. \u201cThe implications are profound,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. \u201cWe have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.\u201d More than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans. One important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely \u2013 and how long \u2013 they\u2019ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years. Researchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways: Weight loss continued for more than a year The analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau. A previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events. It was sustained for up to four years The results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years. Patients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight. However, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did \u2013 almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug. Results vary for everyone In the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines. No safety surprises out to four years Overall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased. The researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn\u2019t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug\u2019s prescribing information because they\u2019d been seen previously in trials. Benefits beyond weight loss A key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play. That\u2019s because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didn\u2019t lose weight. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefit\u201d with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the new analyses. \u201cThat\u2019s because that\u2019s what GLP-1 does: It\u2019s cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you don\u2019t require weight loss \u2013 it\u2019s not the whole story.\u201d An analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight. \u201cThis suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,\u201d or body fat, the researchers concluded. A separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said. \u201cThese two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.\u201d A benefit from reducing inflammation Drucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,\u201d he said. But based on his lab\u2019s research, he said, \u201cone of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.\u201d Drucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis \u2013 driven by inflammation \u2013 who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive. The results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who don\u2019t have obesity or aren\u2019t overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event \u2013 another thing that would need to be studied. And, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely. \u201cWe probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are going to be helpful in terms of actually improving\u00a0health\u00a0and saving lives and saving\u00a0health\u00a0care dollars in people with obesity and heart disease even without much weight loss,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes and\u00a0death.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/health/wegovy-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_health_pig-kidney-recipient-transplant-death", "text": "A 62-year-old man has died months after becoming the world\u2019s first living recipient of a genetically edited pig kidney transplant, hailed as a medical milestone. Rick Slayman received the kidney at Massachusetts General in March after he had been diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year. The hospital emphasized there is no indication his death was a result of the transplant. After undergoing the four-hour surgery at the recommendation of his doctors, Slayman, a manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, was discharged from the hospital\u00a0in April. After the surgery, doctors said they believed the new kidney could last years, but acknowledged there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. \u201cMr. Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation,\u201d Massachusetts General said in a statement. \u201cWe offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Slayman\u2019s family and loved ones as they remember an extraordinary person whose generosity and kindness touched all who knew him.\u201d Slayman\u2019s family described him as a kind man who was fiercely dedicated to the people in his life. \u201cOur family is deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick but take great comfort knowing he inspired so many,\u201d a family statement said. \u201cMillions of people worldwide have come to know Rick\u2019s story. We felt \u2013 and still feel \u2013 comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant.\u201d Slayman had been a patient in the hospital\u2019s transplant program for 11 years, he previously said in a statement. He received a kidney from a human donor in 2018, after living with diabetes and high blood pressure for many years. The kidney began to show signs of failure five years later, and he resumed dialysis in 2023. \u201cI saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,\u201d Slayman wrote in the statement. Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, director of the Legorreta Center for Clinical Transplant Tolerance, performed the groundbreaking operation in March to a round of applause in the operating room. The need for organs far exceeds the number available in the US. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are more than 100,000 people currently waiting for an organ donation. Experts have long been researching how to safely and successfully transplant animal organs into people, which they say could help solve the organ shortage. Before Slayman\u2019s transplant, just two transplants using pig organs had been completed \u2013\u00a0both heart transplants performed under compassionate use. Both patients died weeks after receiving the hearts. EGenesis, the biotech company providing the genetically edited pig kidney, called Slayman \u201ca true pioneer\u201d in a statement late Saturday night. \u201cWe are profoundly grateful to Mr. Slayman and his family and we will honor his legacy and invaluable contribution to science and medicine by continuing our efforts to advance xenotransplantation for the millions of patients globally in need of lifesaving organs,\u201d the company added. Slayman\u2019s family also thanked his care team at across Massachusetts General in a statement. \u201cAfter his transplant, Rick said that one of the reasons he underwent this procedure was to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive. Rick accomplished that goal and his hope and optimism will endure forever. His legacy will be one that inspires patients, researchers, and health care professionals everywhere,\u201d his family said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/health/pig-kidney-recipient-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_health_alternatives-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness", "text": "Many people love their ultraprocessed foods. Sodas, chips, ice cream, lunch meat and other prepared foods are staples of the American diet. They are hard to avoid, too. More than\u00a070% of the US food supply\u00a0is made of ultraprocessed food. But a diet heavy in ultraprocessed food isn\u2019t good for us, science has shown. Eating\u00a0ultraprocessed foods\u00a0raises the risk of developing or dying from dozens of health conditions, according to a February review covering nearly 10 million people. Science has also shown that when you eat Mediterranean meals, which focus on vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and fish, you can reduce the risk of some\u00a0cancers,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0heart disease, high cholesterol\u00a0and stroke. Adopting this approach to eating can\u00a0also improve brain health, strengthen bones and ward off depression and dementia. Hot dogs and cookies are delicious, though. So, what to do? Spot the troublesome ingredients Many ultraprocessed foods have very long lists of ingredients and include additives, according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. If you can\u2019t pronounce the names in your food\u2019s ingredient list, that\u2019s a warning sign. The list may include preservatives designed to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing. All are signs that the food is ultraprocessed. Skip eating out when you can\u2019t tell what ingredients are in your food, and note that many items on fast-food restaurant menus can be ultraprocessed (such as hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets and fries). Start with breakfast Breakfast may be the easiest meal to change. Instead of sugar-fortified cereal or toaster waffles,\u00a0have some warm and filling ancient grains such as quinoa, sorghum or wheat berries cooked with milk, honey, nuts and fruits. No time in the morning to prepare breakfast? Prep these overnight oats the night before. Or have a simple small bowl of plain Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of sliced nuts to go. How processed is your lunch? Instead of a loaded deli sandwich or slices of pizza every day, try to bring your own plant-based lunch once or twice per week. I love adding roast chicken leftovers to this kale ricotta salad (sub in feta if you can\u2019t find the ricotta). Or make this dish by registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, founder of\u00a0Olive Tree Nutrition. She created her Warm Farro Grain Salad With Pomegranate for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better newsletter. Need more ideas? Check out CNN contributor Casey Barber\u2019s ideas for school lunch. Try our interactive to help you buy the least ultraprocessed lunch you can. Is it time for a snack? Snacks can be tricky. The no-fly list of ultraprocessed food is loaded with store-bought chips, sugar-packed yogurts and candy-filled trail mix. Instead, think about apples, oranges, bananas, carrot sticks, and other fruits and veggies. Protein-packed nuts and seeds are filling while also providing a brain boost and heart-healthy fats. If you want to get fancy, Al Bochi created this\u00a0roasted almond snack for CNN that features the Mediterranean spice blend za\u2019atar. Suzy Karadsheh\u2019s avocado salsa dip is also amazing for movie nights, the big game and parties (whichever one you choose). Dinner during the week With dinner a rushed affair for many overscheduled families, it can be impossible to cook during the week. Try to avoid fast-food burgers and chicken nuggets when you can.  Instead, consider grilling chicken or cooking ground turkey on the weekend for easy-assemble Tuesday taco night. Karadsheh also has a Mediterranean twist on tuna salad that will convert even the most anti-tuna eaters (which once included me). May I have dessert, please? Baked goods and ice cream are fine for special occasions, but for an everyday dessert that\u2019s not highly processed,\u00a0Al Bochi\u2019s recipe for Strawberry Ricotta Granola Parfaits is next level. For something grown-up, try poaching pears with\u00a0pomegranate juice\u00a0or port and serve them over yogurt or bake pears and other fruits in parchment. Does this still sound too hard? Ultraprocessed foods are designed to be fun and taste good. Reducing your reliance on them can be hard. Try one suggestion at a time, for a week at a time.

{"id": "2024_05_08_health_ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness", "text": "Eating ultraprocessed foods is associated with an early risk of death, according to a 30-year study \u2014 but different foods have different impacts. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. Processed meats and sugary foods and drinks aren\u2019t correlated with the same risks as ultraprocessed whole grains, for example, said lead study author Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. The study analyzed data from more than 100,000 health professionals in the United States with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. From 1986 to 2018, the participants provided information on their health and lifestyle habits every two years. Every four years, they completed a detailed food questionnaire. The group eating the least ultraprocessed food ate about three servings a day on average, while the highest averaged seven servings a day, according to the study published Wednesday in The BMJ journal. Those who ate the most had a 4% higher risk of deaths by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths, the data showed. Song described the correlation as \u201cmoderate,\u201d noting that the connection was not equally strong among all kinds of ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThe positive association is mainly driven by a few subgroups including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d he said. Findings in this study were consistent with hundreds of others in the field, but what makes this one unique is its parsing out of different subgroups within the ultraprocessed food category, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. Do we need to get rid of all ultraprocessed foods? Song wouldn\u2019t necessarily advise a complete rejection of all ultraprocessed foods because it is a diverse category, he said. \u201cCereals, whole grain breads, for example, they are also considered ultraprocessed food, but they contain various beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, I do think people should try to avoid or limit the consumption of certain ultraprocessed foods, such as processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and also potentially artificially sweetened beverages.\u201d There are also more questions that need to be answered when it comes to ultraprocessed foods. First, the recent study is strong because of the length of time covered\ufeff, but it is an observational study. That means that while researchers can observe a correlation, they can\u2019t say that the foods were the cause of the deaths, said Dr. Peter Wilde, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in the United Kingdom. Researchers also need to look more at the components of ultraprocessed foods that might be affecting health \u2014 whether they be food additives, emulsifiers or flavors \u2014 to advise governments and institutions on how to regulate foods, Song said. Overall diet matters most Researchers also found that the most important factor to reducing risk of death is the quality of a person\u2019s overall diet, Song said. \u201cIf people maintain a generally healthy diet, I don\u2019t think they need to be like scared or be freaked out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall dietary pattern is still the predominant factor determining the health outcomes.\u201d A healthy diet is varied, with as many colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains as possible, Wilde said. \u201cIf you are worried about food additives, then choose foods that have low levels of additives,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cJust be mindful of the nutritional content of (the ultraprocessed foods) that you do choose to consume.\u201d It is also important to recognize that foods need to be eaten in balance. Fruit juice contains beneficial vitamins, minerals and antioxidants when consumed in moderation, but too much will have high levels of sugar that may override their benefits, Wilde said. \u201cThis is not black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cA particular food is not either good or bad, it will contain elements of both, and the balance between the two may depend on how much you eat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

The term itself hails from medieval Norse meaning \u201clazy fellow\u201d \u2014 and later the middle English word meaning \u201cwalking, sitting or standing with a loose attitude.\u201d In the last 150 years or so, posture has come to be associated with aspects of a person\u2019s value, dignity, respectability and morality.\u00a0Erect posture\u00a0has been deemed \u201chealthy,\u201d \u201cthe aesthetic utopia,\u201d \u201cdignified,\u201d \u201ca backbone against subjugation,\u201d \u201cattractive\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d by various cultures, political movements and even social media influencers. READ MORE: Why sitting with crossed legs could be bad for you So it\u2019s not difficult to see then how slouching came to be considered \u201cbad\u201d for us since it\u2019s long been considered to be a bodily representation of negativity. But while posture is heavily overlaid with psychological meaning, is it really that bad for our spines if we slouch? Are certain postures really \u201cgood\u201d and others \u201cbad\u201d? The great news is that in the past two decades, there\u2019s been a plethora of rigorous clinical studies conducted which have concluded that there\u2019s\u00a0no relationship\u00a0between slouching and spinal pain. There\u2019s also\u00a0no evidence\u00a0that people who slouch are more likely to suffer with back or neck pain compared to non-slouchers. There\u2019s also no clear evidence that slouching while sitting at your desk or while using your phone causes damage to the spine. Even the UK government\u2019s latest guidance on\u00a0working with screens\u00a0puts less emphasis on an idealised posture at the workstation. READ MORE: Understanding that chronic back pain originates from within the brain helps recovery Instead, they emphasise the importance of adopting comfortable positions, varying your positions, avoiding awkward positions (such as flexing or arching your back or neck) and including regular breaks from your static posture throughout the day. All of these tips will help reduce the risk of\u00a0developing pain\u00a0and muscle fatigue. So if you experience back or neck pain, you can rest assured that the posture you adopt when walking or sitting probably isn\u2019t to blame as much as you might have been led to believe. Instead, it\u2019s probably related more to other features of life \u2014 such as how\u00a0stressed\u00a0or\u00a0physically active\u00a0you are and if you have\u00a0previously had back pain. There\u2019s a pretty good reason why slouching doesn\u2019t damage our spines, and that is because our spines are designed to allow movements as diverse as Olympic weightlifting to limbo dancing. Our spines aren\u2019t going to be damaged by a bit of sitting down, even if we happen to be wiggling our fingers on a keyboard at the same time. And while standing desks are popular, prolonged standing is no more comfortable for the spine than prolonged sitting READ MORE: Why you get shorter as you age The best thing to do throughout your day, to both make your body feel more comfortable and to\u00a0increase your productivity\u00a0and positive sense of well-being is to break up prolonged periods at your desk with breaks to walk, stretch, stand or sit down. Positive posture But there is one area where slouching may have a negative effect. Slouching has been linked to poorer information and memory recall, as well as worse mood when compared to\u00a0sitting upright. These memory and mood problems are shown to be\u00a0rapidly improved\u00a0when moving from a slouched to\u00a0erect posture. So perhaps there is some truth to the notion that slouching may still be a bodily representation of negativity. But aside from that, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests there\u2019s\u00a0no single, ideal or good posture. Differences in spinal posture are not related to pain. And, in fact, posture naturally varies from person to person \u2014 and can even vary depending on\u00a0race, sex, and even mood. So if you\u2019re a sloucher, rest assured that it isn\u2019t really bad for you and is as good as any other posture you adopt. Comfortable postures are safe and sitting is not dangerous. READ MORE: Surgery won\u2019t fix my chronic back pain, so what will?

If you can\u2019t move around and spend all day slouched in front of the computer, this may cause you some discomfort \u2014 but it\u2019s not actually damaging your spine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/health/slouching-spine-health-conversation-partner-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
