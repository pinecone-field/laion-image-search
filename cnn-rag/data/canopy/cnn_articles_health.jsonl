Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) is vegetable oil modified with the chemical bromine and has been used in small amounts to keep citrus flavoring from floating to the top in beverages, according to an FDA statement. Dozens of products \u2014 mostly sodas \u2014 use BVO as an ingredient, according to the Food Scores database run by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that focuses on consumer health, toxic chemicals and pollutants. The rule that no longer allows BVO in food will go into effect August 2, but companies will have one year after that date to reformulate and relabel their products as well as deplete their BVO inventory, according to the FDA statement. The food additive was removed from the FDA\u2019s list of Generally Recognized As Safe or \u201cGRAS\u201d substance list in 1970 and has been regulated since then, the agency said. Because of the past restrictions, there are only a small number of products that still contain BVO, the FDA said. \u201cOver the years many beverage makers reformulated their products to replace BVO with an alternative ingredient,\u201d James Jones, FDA deputy commissioner for human foods, said in a 2023 statement. Additionally, a 2012 Change.org petition with more than 200,000 signatures brought attention to health concerns, according to an EWG news release. It also said many companies eliminated it from consumer products due to market pressure. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation into law in October 2023 prohibiting the manufacture, sale or distribution of foods that contain BVO as well as red dye No. 3, potassium bromate and propylparaben. Studies point to health concerns Brominated vegetable oil can accumulate in the body and has been linked to health hazards, according to the EWG. Those include nervous system damage, headaches, skin and mucous membrane irritation, fatigue and loss of muscle coordination and memory. A 1976 study found that consumption of BVO by pigs damaged their hearts, kidneys, livers and testicles. The FDA cited a 2022 study in the proposal to revoke the BVO regulation that found rates given BVO had the substance\u2019s derivatives accumulated in their heart, liver and fat. The reconsideration of BVO regulations shows that the FDA is reviewing new evidence as it emerges and responding to public concerns, CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen said in a previous story. What should people do until the BVO ban goes into effect on August 2? \u201cMy takeaway from the studies is that how much and how often you drink matters,\u201d Wen said. \u201cIf someone drinks one soda at a barbecue that happens to contain BVO, that\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cHowever, if someone is drinking a soda a day, every day, they should be careful and check out the ingredients.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/fda-brominated-vegetable-oil-ban-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_health_cardiac-arrest-anxiety-depression-women-wellness", "text": "The care that comes after a cardiac arrest should include supporting mental health \u2014 especially for women, new research has found. In the five years that followed an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or OHCA, in which the heart suddenly stops beating, women were more likely than men to receive medication to treat anxiety or depression, according to a report published Monday in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. \u201cWe recommend monitoring of social and mental well being in individuals who survived an OHCA, not just directly after the event but also in the long-term,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author, Dr. Robin Smits, in an email. \u201cThis seems particularly relevant in women but will likely also benefit men.\u201d Researchers analyzed data from 259 women and 996 men in the Netherlands who survived at least 30 days after a cardiac arrest that took place outside a hospital between 2009 and 2015. The team compared the data on patients\u2019 socioeconomic status and mental health with those in the general population, according to the study. The amount of women taking anxiety or depression medications after cardiac arrest was also greater than in women in the general population, said Smits, a postdoctoral researcher at Amsterdam University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \u201cFurther investigation may shed light into which interventions are necessary for physicians to be able to help individuals thrive after OHCA,\u201d Smits said. Researchers have been learning more and more about how closely connected mental and cardiac health are, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. One in five people hospitalized for heart attack (a blockage of blood flow to the heart) or chest pain develop major depression \u2014 about four times the rate in the general population, according to the\u00a0American Heart Association. One in three\u00a0stroke survivors become depressed, along with\u00a0up to half\u00a0of those who undergo heart bypass surgery, past studies found. \u201cMental health and stress make cardiac events worse and more frequent, and we know that cardiac events make mental health worse,\u201d he said. Just the start delving into mental and cardiac health This new study investigates an important topic but it\u2019s just the beginning, Freeman said. While the authors did account for factors that might skew the results, there are a lot of them, he said. For example, the research was only able to look at the number of people prescribed medication \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they were the only people experiencing anxiety or depression, Smits said. \u201cThe results may also in part reflect that men may less often seek care for mental health and are perhaps less frequently assessed and prescribed medication,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cMoreover, the data do not fully reflect lived experience, such as forced changes in job responsibilities or effect in other areas of life.\u201d But this study highlights an important concept: that men and women often experience the world differently, and providers need to be conscious of that to give everyone their best care,\u00a0 Freeman said. Checking in on emotional well-being The biggest lesson of this latest research is for loved ones and health care providers to check in on people who have experienced cardiac arrest, Freeman said. \u201cIs there a strategy that we should be taking that\u2019s more proactive after people have a cardiac arrest, to sort of make sure that they\u2019re back on their feet, that they understand that they are amazing survivors in many cases?\u201d he said. Even if the doctor you are following up with isn\u2019t a psychiatrist, it is important to keep an open line of communication about your well-being \u2014 and then you may be referred to a mental health professional, he said. Fortunately, there are a lot of strategies to improve mental health. Past studies have shown cognitive behavioral therapy, regular exercise and proper sleep to be effective tools for managing emotional welfare. \u201cAs a physician, how do we help people avoid or treat these problems as they arise? Or even before they arise?\u201d Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/health/cardiac-arrest-anxiety-depression-women-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn", "text": "Do you yearn for long days and short nights? Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers. The summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It\u2019s the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It\u2019s also the first official day of summer. Our ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion.\u00a0Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge). Pagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe. The mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility \u2013 both the plant and human variety \u2013 in destinations worldwide. The science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia. Summer solstice science Is it summer solstice all over the world? No. It\u2019s only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world\u2019s population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there. When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on\u00a0June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that\u2019s 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool. Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador\u2019s capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight. But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn\u2019t get that dark.\u00a0 The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They\u2019ll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order. Why don\u2019t we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night\u00a0back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That\u2019s because the Earth is aligned on an\u00a0axis, an imaginary pole\u00a0going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts \u2013 at\u00a0an angle of 23.5 degrees. \u201cAs Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun\u2019s direct rays,\u201d explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that\u2019s the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox. Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it\u2019s not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US. \u201cOn average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\u201d says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward. \u201cTemperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night \u2013 so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\u201d says Ward. \u201cThe only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\u201d\u00a0because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August. The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe. How to celebrate summer solstice What does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically. The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at\u00a0summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times. The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise. What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day. In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night \u2013 a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires. In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations\u2019 International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_travel_van-life-travel-cec-wellness", "text": "Home is where you are. Home is where you make it. Home on the range. Home is \u2026 in a camper van? Absolutely! When I tried camper van life for the first time, I went all in. For three weeks, my husband and I drove a kitted-out, circa 2012 Ford Econoline van across North America, traveling from northern New Jersey to Los Angeles as we wound our way along the length of Route 66 in November 2019. It was a bold move, but I knew it was the most cost-efficient and efficient-efficient way to see as much of \u201cthe Mother Road\u201d as we could. My hope was that by renting a camper van, we\u2019d save money on purchased meals and hotel rooms and also feel more immersed in the journey and deeply connected to each town we visited. Our first night in the Bloomington, Illinois, Walmart parking lot was a little nerve-racking. I lay in my sleeping bag, listening to the activity beyond the van and wondering if we could handle this adventure. But after the first successful sleepover, we quickly settled into a routine. We\u2019d wake up each morning for a quick bathroom run and even shower at some of the surprisingly luxurious recreational vehicle parks we patronized. Then we\u2019d cook breakfast on our camp stove at the rear of the van and hit the road by 8:30 or 9 a.m. After a day covering roughly 130 miles and experiencing the historic sites, local museums, former filling stations and proudly kitschy roadside attractions along Route 66, we\u2019d make sure to arrive at our nightly destination by 4:30 p.m. \u2014 sundown in November comes early. By the time we dropped off the van near Los Angeles International Airport in late November, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a new but dear friend on the last day of summer camp. We\u2019d unwind, explore the sights of the town, treat ourselves to dinner away from the van, then bunk down in our sleeping bags and do it all again the next day. (We spent two-thirds of the trip sleeping in the van and the other third in historic lodgings along the route, such as Boots Court in Carthage, Missouri, and the El Rancho in Gallup, New Mexico.) The benefits of camper van travel Now, I\u2019m not saying you must spend weeks on an epic road trip to fully experience the joy of a camper van. And I\u2019m certainly not saying you need to sell all your possessions and become a full-time van lifer \u2014 I\u2019m grateful to return to my house and my cats after every trip. But even a few days of traveling and living in a camper van can give you a whole new perspective on yourself and the world around you. When you\u2019re in a camper van, everything you need is within reach \u2014 to an extent. I loved the challenge of condensing our lives into approximately 75 square feet and finding creative ways to live comfortably but efficiently. The morning coffee? It\u2019s right there. Your outfit for the day? Just reach behind you. If you need to change your shoes into hiking boots, grab a raincoat for an unexpected downpour, refuel with a quick snack or recharge with a 20-minute power nap, you don\u2019t need to go far. And you don\u2019t have to repack your bags to leave a hotel every morning. After the first night, I embraced the security and sanctuary of the van, knowing that whatever we had was around us. If we couldn\u2019t find it right away, it wasn\u2019t lost. We had exactly everything we needed \u2014 everything except, well, a bathroom, which brings me to the next life-changing aspect of a camper van. Camper van life makes you brave and gets you out there, interacting with others and connecting with the world. You\u2019re always in the environment, not separated by hotel corridors and lobbies. You\u2019re discovering creative places to stay for the night, looking forward to chatting with bartenders during the nightly dinner at a local restaurant or just fielding questions from strangers about the van and your trip. During our Route 66 adventure, our van prompted exchanges and allowed us to have moments we would likely have missed in a rental car. In Arcadia, Oklahoma, we stopped by Pops 66 Soda Ranch and struck up a conversation with a woman admiring our brightly painted camper van. She told us about one of the chairs at the nearby Oklahoma City National Memorial representing a boy named Zackary who loved collecting pennies. The next morning, we found Zackary\u2019s chair and placed a penny on it for him. Because the van functioned as a full campsite rig, we didn\u2019t have to figure out the logistics of bringing or renting equipment to camp in Joshua Tree National Park in California. We spent two nights in wonder among the granite boulders, with Cassiopeia shining brightly above, and two mornings waking up with the sun and the scent of high desert air. Tips for trying the van life Ready to try camper van travel? Companies rent vans that come fully equipped with mini kitchens and bedding, so it\u2019s almost as easy as booking an Airbnb. Some even come with toilets and showers, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a deal-breaker. Rent one for a quick round-trip weekend visit or explore further by taking a one-way jaunt to another rental hub and then flying home. If you\u2019re itching to have a new type of travel experience, you\u2019ll find it behind the rolling door of a camper van. As another well-loved saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey\u201d \u2014 but with a camper van, you\u2019ll get to appreciate both at once.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/travel/van-life-travel-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_human-plague-case-colorado", "text": "A case of plague has been confirmed in a person in Pueblo County, Colorado, officials said Tuesday. The case was flagged Friday from preliminary test results, and the potential source of the infection is still under investigation, the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment said in a\u00a0news release. The plague is an infectious disease caused by bacterium, Yersinia pestis, transmitted by fleas. Although it is best known for \u201cThe Black Death,\u201d an outbreak that killed millions of Europeans during the Middle Ages, the bacteria circulates naturally among wild rodents and\u00a0rarely\u00a0infects humans today, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Plague is transmitted to humans through bites from infected fleas, contact with infected animals or inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. Anyone who develops symptoms of plague should get medical attention immediately, the CDC says. Typical symptoms include sudden fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and, commonly, swollen lymph nodes with pain. \u201cPlague can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but an infected person must be treated promptly to avoid serious complications or death,\u201d said Alicia Solis, program manager of the Office of Communicable Disease and Emergency Preparedness at the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment, in the news release. \u201cWe advise all individuals to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\u201d the department says. One way to avoid infection is to eliminate places where wild rodents can exist around humans such as brush, rock piles, trash and piles of lumber around homes, garages, sheds and recreation areas, according to the department. Taking precautions around pets can also reduce risk of transmission. The department suggests treating dogs and cats for fleas, keeping pet food in rodent-proof containers and not letting pets roam in rodent areas or sleep in bed with you. From 1970 to 2022, there were 67 reported cases of plague in Colorado, according to the CDC. Worldwide, 3,248 human plague cases were reported from 2010 to 2015, most commonly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Peru, the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0found. \u201cA plague vaccine is no longer available in the United States,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cNew plague vaccines are in development but are not expected to be commercially available in the immediate future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/human-plague-case-colorado/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_election-stress-effects-sexual-health-wellness", "text": "Election season \u2014 with all its arguments about debates, political ads and fundraising text messages \u2014 brings a roller coaster of emotions. Whether you\u2019re glued to the news, debating with friends or scrolling through social media, stress and anxiety at this time can be overwhelming. If you feel that stress, you\u2019re in good company: Some 62% of Americans feel worn out by election coverage, according to a Pew Research Center survey in May. While you might know that stress from the presidential campaigns can affect your mood, energy and temper, it may surprise you to know it can also affect you below the belt. Here is what you can do about it. The connection between stress and sexual health Stress is a well-known libido killer because it triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with both sexual desire and performance. Elevated cortisol levels can lead to a decrease in testosterone, further affecting libido. The emotional fatigue and heightened stress from the current presidential campaigns can lead to an increase in cortisol and a decrease in testosterone levels, making it more challenging for people to feel in the mood. Chronic stress can also lead to other health issues that indirectly affect sexual health, such as cardiovascular problems, sleep disorders and mental health issues. All these factors combined can create a cycle in which stress has a negative impact on sexual health, leading to further stress and health complications. Erectile dysfunction and anxiety Anxiety is another common byproduct of election stress. Constant worrying about the future can trigger performance anxiety, leading to erectile dysfunction, or ED. Men with high levels of anxiety are more likely to experience ED, according to a 2021 study in the International Journal of Impotence Research. So if you\u2019re finding it difficult to perform in the bedroom, the anxiety induced by the campaign might be to blame. Election scrolling can disrupt sleep patterns Poor sleep quality is directly linked to sexual dysfunction, as it can lower testosterone levels and increase stress hormones such as cortisol. So try not to stay up late to catch every news update on the campaigns. And this recommendation isn\u2019t limited to election coverage; any form of prolonged screen time and stress-inducing content can similarly affect sleep and, consequently, sexual health. Prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule and reducing nighttime screen exposure can help maintain your overall well-being and sexual health. The humor in political stress Picture this: You\u2019re in bed, trying to get intimate, but all you can think about is the latest polling data or what one of the candidates said at a rally. It sounds ridiculous, but it\u2019s a reality for many of my patients. Humor can be a great stress reliever, so don\u2019t be afraid to laugh at the situation. Cracking up with your partner about the craziness of the election season can help break the tension and bring you closer together. Embracing humor in stressful times can not only ease anxiety but also strengthen your bond. READ MORE: Sex \u2014 does it actually improve your life? How to get election stress out of your sex life To manage election stress and maintain sexual health, it\u2019s essential to engage in relaxing activities. Take breaks from politics to read a book, take a walk, practice yoga or do whatever you enjoy to help you calm down. Practicing mindfulness through techniques such as meditation and deep breathing can also help you stay grounded. Staying active is another natural stress reliever. Regular physical activity can boost your mood, improve sleep and enhance your sexual health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Open communication with your partner about how you are feeling can help reduce stress and anxiety. Walk together, discuss your worries and find ways to support each other during these tense times. The importance of voting Even with all this stress, it\u2019s important to remember the power and privilege of voting. Not everyone around the world gets to vote. Your voice matters, and participating in the democratic process is an essential way to contribute to the future you want to see. If you haven\u2019t registered to vote, you can do so at vote.gov. Even when you\u2019ve done all you can do, know that election stress is real and can have surprising effects on your sexual health. By acknowledging the problem and taking proactive steps to manage your stress, you can maintain a healthy and satisfying sex life, even during the most turbulent political times. So, take a deep breath, focus on what really matters \u2014 your health and well-being \u2014 and remember to cast your vote. And then have some fun with your partner.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/election-stress-effects-sexual-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_women-cancer-colon-breast-screening-wellness", "text": "An estimated 72 million women in the United States have skipped or delayed a recommended health screening,\u00a0according to a new survey. This poll, conducted by Gallup for medical technology company Hologic, found that 90% of women acknowledged the importance of regular health screenings \u2014 but more than 40% have skipped or delayed a test. Women have trouble prioritizing their own health, the survey found, with over 60% of women responding that it was hard to make their own health a priority. The numbers are particularly striking among younger women;\u00a074% of women in Generation Z and 70% of millennials said it was hard to prioritize their health, compared with 52% of baby boomers and 39% of the Silent Generation. Struck by these numbers, I wanted to speak with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen to learn more about why they are a cause for concern. What are the preventive screenings that younger women should receive? And what steps can women take to prioritize their health and well-being? Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What were the parts of the poll that stand out most to you? Dr. Leana Wen: I was disheartened, though not surprised, to see that it was so common for women, especially young women, to forgo health screenings. According to the results, most women in the survey mentioned factors such as caring for other family members first, struggling with work and other pressing matters. This is consistent with my experience as a clinician and\u00a0a\u00a0public health official. Unfortunately, too many women focus on their health only after they have been diagnosed with a chronic illness. Our society places too little emphasis on prevention, and there are many barriers in the way of people obtaining preventive care. CNN: Why are regular health screenings so important for women, including young women? Wen:\u00a0This study focused on health screenings for cancer, so let\u2019s start there.\u00a0One in five\u00a0women\u00a0around the world\u00a0will develop cancer over our lifetimes. Early treatment is key to improving survival rates, and that hinges on early diagnosis. This is why screenings are so important. Cancer screenings are conducted before people develop symptoms. There is a disturbing global trend of a\u00a0rise in early-onset cancers,\u00a0which is defined as cancer cases diagnosed in people younger than 50. Between 1990 and 2019, early-onset cancers increased by\u00a079%. In the US, while people older than 50 have experienced a drop in overall cancer rates between 1995 and 2020, the cancer incidence\u00a0has increased in people younger than 50. All of this\u00a0makes the survey results of young women neglecting their health screenings even more distressing. According to the survey, 41% of US women delayed or skipped screenings for breast cancer, 35% for cervical cancer and 33% for colorectal cancers. CNN: What cancer screenings are recommended for younger women? Wen:\u00a0Here are the recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force. For\u00a0breast cancer, the USPSTF recommends that women get screened every other year, starting from age 40 and continuing through age 74. This is a recent change. Previously, the recommendation was to start between age 40 to 50. For\u00a0cervical cancer, the task force recommends that women who are ages 21 to 29 get screened every three years with a Pap test that looks at cervical cells. For women ages 30 to 65, the recommendation is to get screened every three years with the Pap test, or every five years with either testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (a virus that could cause cervical cancer) or the virus testing combined with the Pap test. For\u00a0colon cancer, the USPSTF recommends that both women and men begin screenings at age 45. This also represents a change in response to the rise in colon cancer among younger individuals; until a few years ago, the recommendation was for colon cancer screenings to start at age 50. All the above recommendations apply to women at average risk of developing these cancers. Individuals at higher risk by virtue of family history, personal cancer history or other risk factors should speak with their physicians about whether they should start screening at earlier ages and more frequently. They may also need additional testing; for instance, women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer may be recommended for an MRI in addition to a mammogram and may be referred to genetic testing. CNN: What else should women know about regular screenings? Wen: Ideally, every woman has a primary care provider whom they visit every year. These appointments should keep track of what screenings have been done and when to do the next set of screenings. First, women should know whether they have personal medical circumstances that put them at higher risk compared with other people. Everyone should try to find out their family history of common ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Bring up lifestyle factors that may influence risk factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and physical activity. Second, discuss screening tests. What\u2019s recommended now and why? We\u2019ve spoken today mainly about cancer screening, but there are screenings for other chronic diseases that should be done. For instance, you should be getting your blood pressure checked at annual visits to screen for hypertension. The USPSTF also recommends screening for\u00a0diabetes\u00a0in adults ages 35 to 70 who have a body mass index that places them in the category of overweight or obesity and for\u00a0high cholesterol\u00a0in women ages 45 and older who are at increased risk of heart disease. Third, women should discuss issues regarding their reproductive health. If they want to become pregnant, they should optimize their health in preparation for pregnancy. If they do not, they should discuss contraceptive options. We have not yet discussed screening for\u00a0sexually transmitted infections, but this is also a part of routine health screening that should be discussed at the annual checkup. Last but certainly not least, it\u2019s important to discuss mental health issues. Mental health is a crucial determinant of overall health. Women should be sure to discuss concerns such as\u00a0depression,\u00a0anxiety\u00a0and\u00a0stress\u00a0with their providers. Many treatment options exist \u2014 no one should have to suffer in silence. CNN: How can women keep track of their screenings and what they need coming up? The problem is that many women do not have a regular provider. They may also neglect to see that person due to the issues highlighted in the survey \u2014 maybe these women are busy with other life circumstances and then only see a provider once something is wrong. The other issue highlighted in the survey is that providers may not be bringing up the screenings. Women are more likely to be screened if they and their provider have a discussion about the importance of screenings, the poll says. Yet these conversations are sometimes not happening for a variety of reasons. We need to have a better health care system that ensures access and continuity of care for all people, and clinicians must have adequate time to address crucial issues like prevention during the annual visit. In the meantime, I recommend that women keep track of what screenings they have received and have an idea of when the next one is due. Bring that list with you when you are going for your annual checkup and ask your doctor if you are up to date.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/women-cancer-colon-breast-screening-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_bird-flu-fourth-human-case-in-us", "text": "A fourth person in the United States has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak among dairy cattle across the country. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Wednesday that it has identified the state\u2019s first human case of H5 avian influenza associated with the multistate outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle. This case is the fourth identified nationally in connection to the outbreak; two other human cases have been reported in Michigan and one in Texas. More than a quarter of dairy herds in Colorado have reported cases of bird flu, according to data from the state health department. As of Wednesday, federal\u00a0data\u00a0shows that seven states have confirmed cases in the past 30 days, and 40% of them are in Colorado \u2014 more than any other state. The infected person in Colorado had mild symptoms, reporting only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as a symptom, according to state health officials. He worked at a dairy farm in northeast Colorado and had direct exposure to dairy cattle infected with avian flu. After testing positive,\u00a0the man was treated immediately with the antiviral medication oseltamivir, and he has recovered, according to the state health department. \u201cThe risk to most people remains low. Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,\u201d Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist at the CDPHE, said in Wednesday\u2019s announcement. The last human case of\u00a0H5N1 in Colorado was in 2022\u00a0in a person who was exposed to infected poultry. In the current outbreak connected to infected dairy cattle, the first two human cases identified in the United States also reported eye-related symptoms and eye infections or conjunctivitis. The third human case in the US reported more respiratory symptoms, such as cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes. None of those three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission of the virus. On the national level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that it continues to monitor the situation carefully, using its flu surveillance systems to watch for H5N1 activity in people. The agency said Wednesday that the human case in Colorado \u201cdoes not change CDC\u2019s current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.\u201d However, the case \u201cunderscores the importance of\u00a0recommended precautions\u00a0in people with exposure to infected animals,\u201d according to the CDC. \u201cPeople with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.\u201d The CDC repeatedly\u00a0has recommended\u00a0that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. CDC officials said Tuesday that the United States has enough H5 bird flu tests to respond to the outbreak. \u201cWe have an ample number of H5-specific tests in the public health system for the current outbreak. As of right now, there are roughly 750,000 H5-specific tests available today and another 1.2 million such tests coming online in the next two to three months,\u201d Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cThis is on top of a robust supply of influenza A tests, the general tests that are available at doctor\u2019s offices around the country,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThe way that our system works is such that if someone tests positive for influenza A at the doctor\u2019s office, their specimen is sent to a public health laboratory for what\u2019s called subtyping. That tells us if the influenza A virus is a common seasonal one, or a rarer version like H5N1. That subtyping happens more commonly than you might think.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/bird-flu-fourth-human-case-in-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk", "text": "GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy may help lower the risk of certain cancers, a new study suggests. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting 13 types of cancer, and the risk increases the longer a person is overweight and the more excess weight they gain. About 40% of new cancer diagnoses are associated with excess weight, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, there were about 170 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people, CDC data shows. But a study published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with a class of GLP-1 drugs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with 10 of the 13 obesity-associated cancers than those who were taking insulin. The risk was cut by more than half for gallbladder cancer, meningioma, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, a kind of liver cancer. It was also significantly reduced for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and kidney cancer. Excess weight can cause changes in the body such as long-lasting inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones that can cause cancer, according to the CDC. And GLP-1 medications interact with systems related to insulin production. The new findings that link GLP-1 treatment to reduced risk of some cancers \u201ccompare favorably\u201d with similar effects linked to intensive lifestyle intervention and metabolic-bariatric surgery that have been found in other trials, the study authors wrote. However, the research found that GLP-1 treatment was not associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, which CDC data shows is the most common type of cancer associated with obesity. Risk was also not reduced for stomach cancer or thyroid cancer. In fact, other research has found that GLP-1s may interact with the body\u2019s insulin production in ways that negatively affect the thyroid, and the study authors note that patients should be aware of potential thyroid-related risks that are included on the medication\u2019s packaging. The new study also found that the risk of cancer diagnosis for people with type 2 diabetes was not different among those who were treated with GLP-1s compared with those where were being treated with metformin. In fact, the risk of diagnosis with kidney cancer was higher among those using GLP-1s than those on metformin. For this study, researchers from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and the MetroHealth System analyzed more than a decade of medical records for nearly 1.7 million people with type 2 diabetes. More information is needed about how reduced cancer risk may relate to the scale of weight loss, but the findings provide \u201cpreliminary evidence of the potential benefit of GLP-1RAs for cancer prevention in high-risk populations and support further preclinical and clinical studies,\u201d the study authors wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_latino-new-hiv-diagnosis-rates-reaj", "text": "When F\u00e9lix Hernandez learned that he had HIV, he had no one to lean on. In the years since his diagnosis, he found a way to support other people who may be feeling alone\u00a0by helping administer HIV tests at a Tennessee clinic. \u201cIn my case I didn\u2019t have anyone that I could count on besides from the medical staff,\u201d Hernandez, a 31-year-old HVAC technician, told CNN. \u201cSometimes you want somebody that can relate with you and unfortunately, even though the medical staff can be a great support system, sometimes they\u2019re not positive so they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through.\u201d While working at the clinic for the past two years, Hernandez says\u00a0he has noticed that HIV infections among Latinos are becoming more common. Latinos or Hispanic people represent less than 20% of the United States population but they made up nearly a third of new HIV diagnoses in 2022, according to the latest figures released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When compared to all racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic people have the second highest rate of new HIV diagnoses \u2013 there were about 19 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people, which is nearly double the national rate\u2013 and new diagnoses are rising quickly. Across the US, new HIV diagnoses overall held relatively steady between 2018 and 2022 but they increased 19% among Latinos or Hispanic people. In contrast, Black people had\u00a0the highest share of HIV diagnoses in 2022 but new cases have fallen in recent years, down nearly 6% since 2018, the data shows. Daniel Castellanos, vice president of research and innovation for the nonprofit Latino Commission on AIDS, said the estimates are a confirmation of a pattern that Latino advocates and health policy experts have been concerned about for years. A trend that he says has been\u00a0fueled by the high number of uninsured people, socio-economic instability, and the need for more mental health and substance abuse services. The uninsured rate among Hispanic or Latino people was nearly 18% in 2021, making it among the highest in the nation when compared to other racial and ethnic groups, according to a survey by the US Census Bureau. Overall, an estimated 8.6% of the US population was uninsured in 2021. \u201cFor instance, homelessness or housing stability is a major issue, or adhering to your treatment if you don\u2019t have a place to stay, or (if) you are staying with family members and constantly thinking about what people are going to say if they see you taking that medication,\u201d Castellanos said. When Hernandez tested positive in 2019, the stigma and misinformation surrounding HIV that often festers in Latino communities played a large role on how he first handled his diagnosis. \u201cThe emotions were just like \u2018nobody\u2019s gonna love me. I\u2019m not gonna have children, I\u2019m HIV positive.\u2019 It was more of guilt and disgust at the same time, but it was stuff that I had to overcome,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to go about it but just to keep quiet, (go) on with my daily life and just hide it,\u201d he added, saying that it took him several years to tell his parents, partly because of how they previously reacted when he shared with them that he was gay. Latino advocates and health policy experts said young gay Latino men, transgender women and newly settled immigrants are among the most adversely impacted by HIV. In 2022, Latino men who have sex with men accounted for more\u00a0new HIV diagnoses than any other race or ethnicity, according to the CDC data. Edgar Longoria, executive director of Entre Hermanos, a Seattle nonprofit serving the Latino LGBTQ community, said that not feeling comfortable sharing information with relatives or others is one of the main barriers faced by those at risk of getting HIV and those living with HIV. \u201cIn Latin America there\u2019s a Catholic influence, so it\u2019s taboo to speak about sex at home if you are heterosexual, and it\u2019s even less common to talk about sex if we are talking about gay sex,\u201d Longoria said. In the case of LGBTQ Latinos,\u00a0they strongly prefer anonymous HIV services and often check to see if anyone will see them entering an LGBTQ resources office or clinic out of fear, he added. Parallel to the growth of the Latino population in the Seattle area, Entre Hermanos says there has been an uptick of HIV cases in recent years. A decade ago, the nonprofit\u2019s medical case managers supported an average of 10 individuals. That number has grown to nearly 200 clients, said Martha Zu\u00f1iga, deputy director for Entre Hermanos. For Zu\u00f1iga, who began advocating for HIV education and access to care after losing seven of her close friends during the 1980\u2019s AIDS crisis, the statistics in Seattle and across the country are alarming. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad for me that this is a never-ending story. Even though there\u2019s a lot of resources in the world, they are\u00a0not in the right places, not in the hands of the right people, or on the way that it can better serve these communities,\u201d Zu\u00f1iga said. Entre Hermanos provides several services, including testing, HIV medical case management, support groups, and gaining access to pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP \u2013 a medication\u00a0that decreases a person\u2019s risk of getting HIV from sex\u00a0or injection drug use\u00a0by about 99%\u00a0when used as prescribed,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But Zu\u00f1iga says more institutions and the community at large are needed to increase awareness of HIV and PrEP. \u201cThere\u2019s young people who still think that HIV is a death sentence and people who grew up during the HIV epidemic that never got the correct information about what HIV is and how to protect themselves,\u201d Zu\u00f1iga said. \u201cIt looks like they are not getting any kind of sexual education at home and the same thing is happening at schools.\u201d In a 2021 report, the CDC said awareness of PrEP and referrals to PrEP providers\u00a0among Latinos who were tested for HIV at CDC-funded sites in 2019 was low compared to their White counterparts. Last month during a meeting of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, co-chair Vincent Guilamo-Ramos discussed the rising HIV rates among Latinos saying\u00a0the country \u00a0\u201ccannot end the HIV epidemic\u201d without an increased focus on the Latino community. Guilamo-Ramos presented\u00a0nine actions to \u201cturn the tide,\u201d including the equitable distribution of resources to the Latino community, eliminating barriers to care and building what he called a \u201cLatino HIV workforce.\u201d \u201cI think most of the time, I would argue that when you do hear about Latinos, it historically has been about the border and migration. We have many other needs and issues, we need to start to make that much more visible,\u201d Guilamo-Ramos said during the meeting. Longoria said he encourages medical providers to routinely offer HIV and STD testing, and consider offering it along with common tests such as blood sugar and cholesterol. \u201cThey need to offer it, because if they don\u2019t offer it, our community won\u2019t ask for it,\u201d Longoria said. For now, Hernandez says he is taking any opportunity to help increase awareness of HIV in the Latino community. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge community out there aside from the LGBTQ community that\u2019s here as a support system. There\u2019s so many agencies out there and you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s like a whole new family so you\u2019re not alone. We are in this together and we\u2019re here together until we eradicate HIV,\u201d Hernandez said. CNN\u2019s Deidre McPhillips contributed to this story.

{"id": "2024_07_02_health_weight-gain-antidepressants-wellness", "text": "Antidepressants can be lifesavers for many struggling with so many mental health diagnoses \u2014 anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet taking these mood-altering substances can lead to an unpleasant side effect for some \u2014 weight gain. While many people never add extra weight, doctors say concerns over additional pounds are a key reason people may be hesitant to start taking an antidepressant for their mental health. Weight gain is also a reason why some stop their medications despite feeling less depressed or anxious while using them. Now, a new study sheds light on just how much weight gain might occur \u2014 on average \u2014 while taking eight of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. One of the most widely prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, also known by brand names Zoloft and Lustral, was associated with an average gain of nearly 0.5 pounds (0.2 kilograms) at six months. That rose to 3.2 pounds (1.46 kilograms) at 24 months, according to the study. Using that as a comparison, researchers found people taking escitalopram, known by the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex, had an average 15% increased risk over sertraline of gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight at six months. The risk was 14% for paroxetine, sold under the names Paxil, Aropax, Pexeva, Seroxat, Sereupin and Brisdelle, the study found. Duloxetine, sold by the brand names Cymbalta, Loxentia and Yentreve, was associated with a 10% increased risk of a patient gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight compared to sertraline, the study said. A weight gain of 5% or more over baseline is considered clinically significant for health, said lead study author Joshua Petimar, an assistant professor of population medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The typical adult gains an average of 1 to 2 pounds per year, which over time, can contribute to obesity. This weight gain can be driven by physical inactivity, stress, poor sleep and poor food choices, such as eating too many ultraprocessed foods, as well as medications, experts say. Weight gain by pounds The study, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, used electronic health record prescription and body mass to compare weight gain among more than 183,000 people. Researchers looked at weight at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months for individuals between the ages of 18 and 80 who were starting an antidepressant for the first time. When analyzing the data by pounds and kilograms of weight gained, people on escitalopram and paroxetine added an average of 1.4 pounds (0.63 kilograms) by six months. By 24 months, weight had risen by 3.6 pounds (1.63 kilograms) for escitalopram and nearly 3 pounds (1.33 kilograms) for paroxetine. Duloxetine was associated with an average gain of 1.2 pounds (0.55 kilograms) at six months and 1.7 pounds (0.78 kilograms) at 24 months. \u201cIn our study, the average weight at baseline was 84 kg, or about 185 lb,\u201d Petimar said in an email. \u201cThis means that in our study, a 5% increase in weight translated on average to a weight gain of 4.2 kg, or about 9 lb.\u201d However, the study found no significantly higher or lower risk for citalopram, sold as Celexa; fluoxetine, sold as Prozac; or venlafaxine, sold as Effexor, Effexor XR, Vensir, Vencarm, Venlalix and Venlablue, when compared to sertraline. \u201cWe need to remember these are average values; many people won\u2019t gain any weight, while others could gain considerably more,\u201d said Dr. Roy Perlis, associate chief of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who conducted a similar study in 2014. He was not involved with the new research. \u201cStill, having average values to work with \u2014 and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies \u2014 at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,\u201d Perlis said in an email. Not all patients perceive weight gain negatively, although it is more common for patients to want to avoid weight gain than to seek it when taking an antidepressant, Petimar said. For example, mirtazapine is an antidepressant that is sometimes used in the treatment of eating disorders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t examine mirtazapine in our study because it\u2019s not considered a common front-line medication for new users of antidepressants,\u201d he said. Weight loss occurred with one drug One antidepressant contributed to a small amount of weight loss at six months, the study found. \u201cBupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) on average had a 15% lower risk of gaining a clinically meaningful amount of weight compared to sertraline,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cOur study didn\u2019t explore reasons why bupropion was associated with less weight gain than other antidepressants, but other studies have similarly concluded that it is associated with less weight gain than other common antidepressants,\u201d he added. When analyzed by pounds or kilograms lost, people who took bupropion dropped almost one quarter of a pound (0.01 kilograms) at six months, before gaining 1.2 pounds (0.56\u00a0kilograms) at 24 months, according to the research. Why do antidepressants contribute to weight gain? Science doesn\u2019t yet know, Perlis said. \u201cRemarkably, we don\u2019t know the precise mechanism by which antidepressants contribute to weight changes. Worse, we really don\u2019t know much about who is most\u00a0likely to gain or lose weight, so we can\u2019t make good predictions in advance,\u201d he said. One caution, Perlis said, is that some people lose weight when depressed and lose their appetite. \u201cSome of what we\u2019re seeing may be people regaining weight they\u2019d lost as their depression or anxiety improves.\u201d The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them, experts say. \u201cPatients who are concerned about weight gain should have an open and honest conversation with their clinician about their concerns,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cThere are many clinical factors that determine which medication is right for a given patient,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cThese include the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, their medical history, any other drugs that they are already taking, and possible side effects that the patient is concerned about.\u201d Clinicians have to weigh all of these factors when they decide which is the best course of treatment, he added, while patients can strive to avoid weight gain by following healthy eating habits and exercising regularly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/weight-gain-antidepressants-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_lilly-azheimers-donanemab-fda", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Donanemab, made by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly, works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Lilly said it will be sold under the name Kisunla and would cost $695 per vial before insurance, what would amount to $12,522 for a six-month course or about $32,000 for a year, depending on when the patient would complete their treatment. Donanemab is not a cure, but clinical trials showed that it slowed the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s, allowing people to live independent lives for longer and safely participate in everyday activities. Lilly told\u00a0a committee of FDA advisers in June that\u00a0late-stage clinical research data\u00a0showed \u201chighly meaningful results\u201d for people who took donanemab, with about 35% lower risk of progression of the disease over a year and a half compared with those who got a placebo. The FDA advisers\u00a0voted\u00a0that the treatment appeared safe and effective. Although rare, there were some serious adverse events during the drug trial, Lilly told the committee, occurring in only 2% of patients. The participants who took donanemab had a slightly higher mortality rate: 2%, compared with 1.7% in the placebo arm of the trial. Three people died while taking the drug after developing ARIA, micro-hemorrhages known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Because most of the ARIA\u00a0incidents came in the first six weeks of the trial, Lilly told the FDA advisers that it added another MRI exam to the trial before giving second doses in order to detect people with asymptomatic ARIA. If it was detected, providers would pause treatment so it could resolve and not become more serious or symptomatic. Kisunla is not the first monoclonal antibody treatment approved to treat early Alzheimer\u2019s. Eisai and Biogen\u2019s\u00a0lecanemab, sold as Leqembi, is already being used. Another drug by Biogen, aducanumab, sold as Aduhelm, in 2021 became the first such therapy to get accelerated FDA approval, but\u00a0the company said\u00a0it will stop making it by the\u00a0end of this year\u00a0as it shifts resources to its other Alzheimer\u2019s drug. In trials of Leqembi, the drug that\u2019s already on the market, some participants also had ARIA, but it was at a lower rate than seen in the donanemab trial. Leqembi has also\u00a0been tied\u00a0to patient deaths. Kisunla was approved with instructions that prescribers can consider stopping the patient\u2019s treatment if they see improvement based on brain scans. The potential to complete the treatment after a limited course of therapy, Lilly said, could lower out-of-pocket costs. Kisunla otherwise costs more than Leqembi, which runs about $26,500 per year. Lilly said Tuesday that because the medicines work best in the early symptomatic stage of the disease, it\u2019s working with others to improve early detection and diagnosis. \u201cEach year, more and more people are at risk for this disease, and we are determined to make life better for them,\u201d said Anne White, executive vice president and president of Lilly Neuroscience. One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia,\u00a0according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, killing more people than prostate and breast cancer combined. Successful treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s can\u2019t come fast enough,\u00a0advocates for patients say, and could be a big help to a growing number of people who are predicted to develop the disease. The number of people projected to have Alzheimer\u2019s is predicted to grow to nearly 14 million by 2060,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0As of 2023,\u00a0about 6.7 million Americans 65 and older  live with Alzheimer\u2019s. The disease doesn\u2019t just affect patients. More than 11 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias in 2022 alone,\u00a0research\u00a0shows,\u00a0while there has been an\u00a0ongoing shortage of paid workers and medical professionals. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association said Tuesday that it was celebrating the announcement of the approval of the treatment. \u201cThis is real progress. Today\u2019s approval allows people more options and greater opportunity to have more time,\u201d Dr. Joanne Pike, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said in a news release. \u201cHaving multiple treatment options is the kind of advancement we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2014 all of us who have been touched, even blindsided, by this difficult and devastating disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/lilly-azheimers-donanemab-fda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

The second one was sugary soft drinks,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cBeverages are a very important component of the diet and the contribution to ultraprocessed food.\u201d Refined grains such as ultraprocessed breads and baked goods ranked next in popularity, the study found. \u201cThis is one more large, long-duration cohort study confirming the association between UPF (ultraprocessed food) intake and all-cause mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Carlos Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health at Brazil\u2019s University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in an email. Monteiro coined the term ultraprocessed food and created the NOVA food classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made. Monteiro was not involved in the study, but several members of the NOVA classification system were coauthors. The NOVA classification system sorts foods from unprocessed or minimally processed \u2014 whole foods such as fruits and vegetables \u2014 to ultraprocessed foods such as deli meat and sausage. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food appetizing. Health risks linked to processed meats and soft drinks The preliminary study, presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago, analyzed dietary data gathered in 1995 from nearly 541,000 Americans ages 50 to 71 who were participating in the US National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. Researchers linked the dietary data to death rates over the next 20 to 30 years. Compared with those in the bottom 10% of ultraprocessed food consumption, people who ate the most overly processed food were more likely to die from heart disease or diabetes, according to the study. Unlike other studies, however, researchers found no rise in cancer-related death. Some ultraprocessed foods carried more of a risk than others, Loftfield said: \u201cHighly processed meat and soft drinks were a couple of the subgroups of ultraprocessed food most strongly associated with mortality risk.\u201d Diet drinks are considered ultraprocessed food because they contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium and stevia, and additional additives not found in whole foods. Diet beverages have been linked to a higher risk of dying early from cardiovascular disease as well as the onset of dementia,\u00a0type 2 diabetes,\u00a0obesity, stroke and\u00a0metabolic syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes. The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans already recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to premature death and the development of chronic disease. A March 2019 study found women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages\u00a0\u2014 defined as a standard glass, bottle or can \u2014 had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared with women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk. Processed meats such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, ham, corned beef, jerky and deli meats are also not recommended; studies have linked red and processed meats to bowel and stomach cancers, heart disease, diabetes and early death from any cause. \u201cThe evidence from this new study indicates that processed meat may be one of the most unhealthy foods, but people do not tend to view ham or chicken nuggets as UPF (ultraprocessed food),\u201d said Rosie Green,\u00a0a professor of environment, food and health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in a statement. She was not involved in the study. The study found that people who consumed the most ultraprocessed food were younger and heavier, and had an overall poorer quality of diet than those who ate fewer ultraprocessed foods. However, the increased health risk could not be explained by these differences, because even people with normal weight and better diets were also at some risk for early death from ultraprocessed foods, the study found. \u201cStudies which utilize food classification systems such as NOVA, which focus on the degree of processing, as opposed to the nutritional composition should be considered with caution,\u201d said Carla Saunders, president of the \u200eCalorie Control Council, an industry association, in an email. \u201cSuggesting the elimination of dietary tools like no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages, with proven benefits in the management of comorbidities like obesity and diabetes, is harmful and irresponsible,\u201d Saunders said. Results may underestimate risk One key limitation of the study was that the dietary data was gathered only once some 30 years ago, Green said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how dietary habits might have changed between then and now.\u201d Ultraprocessed food manufacturing has exploded since the mid-1990s, however, with estimates that as nearly 60% of the average American\u2019s daily calories come from ultraprocessed foods. That\u2019s not surprising, considering as much as 70% of the food in any grocery store may be ultraprocessed. \u201cIf anything, we are probably underestimating ultraprocessed food consumption in our study because we\u2019re being very conservative,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cThe intake is likely to have only grown over the years.\u201d In fact, a study published in May that found similar results \u2014 a higher risk of premature death and death from cardiovascular disease in over 100,000 health professionals who ate ultraprocessed foods \u2014 accessed ultraprocessed food intake every four years and found consumption doubled between the mid-1980s and 2018. \u201cFor example, the daily intake of packaged savory snacks and dairy-based desserts, such as ice cream, has essentially doubled since the \u201890s,\u201d said the lead author of the May study, Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIn our study, just as in this new one, the positive association was mainly driven by a few subgroups, including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d Song said. \u201cHowever, all categories of ultraprocessed food were associated with increased risk.\u201d Choosing more minimally processed foods is a one way to limit ultraprocessed foods in one\u2019s diet, Loftfield said. \u201cWe should really be focusing on eating diets that are rich in whole foods,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if the food is ultraprocessed, then look to see the levels of sodium and added sugars and try to make the best decision possible using the nutrition facts label.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

The government has 4.8 million doses of an H5 vaccine with a traditional platform under production, O\u2019Connell said. The vaccine is tailored to the currently circulating strains of the H5N1 bird flu virus and should come off the finishing line starting in the middle of this month \u2014\u00a0ahead of schedule, she said. The new $176 million contract with Moderna will help the government stay \u201cnimble\u201d in case it needs to act quickly against any kind of circulating strains of a pandemic flu virus, officials said. The mRNA vaccines wouldn\u2019t be available any time soon, O\u2019Connell said. Moderna has a vaccine candidate in early stage testing, and results should be available in the coming weeks, but late-stage testing of its vaccine wouldn\u2019t start until 2025.

{"id": "2024_07_09_health_ftc-report-pbm-pharmacy-healthcare", "text": "Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate the terms for prescription drug access for hundreds of millions of Americans, are racking up profits while squeezing patients and independent pharmacies, according to an interim staff report released Tuesday by the Federal Trade Commission. The commission, which launched an inquiry into the opaque pharmacy benefit manager or PBM industry in 2022, found that a handful of dominant players \u201cwield enormous power over patients\u2019 ability to access and afford their prescription drugs, allowing PBMs to significantly influence what drugs are available and at what price.\u201d Also, \u201cPBMs hold substantial influence over independent pharmacies by imposing unfair, arbitrary, and harmful contractual terms that can impact independent pharmacies\u2019 ability to stay in business and serve their communities,\u201d according to the agency. The six largest managers handle nearly 95% of the prescriptions filled in the US. Most of them, including the three largest \u2013 CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx \u2013 are owned by or connected to health insurers, as well as affiliated with pharmacies. PBMs, which serve as middlemen in the drug supply chain by negotiating rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and others, could be steering patients to their own pharmacies and away from independent pharmacies, the report found. Pharmacy benefit managers have been in the spotlight in recent years, with the Biden administration and Congress seeking to increase transparency into the industry\u2019s operations. PBMs, which keep an undisclosed amount of the rebates they negotiate, are among the players in the drug industry blamed for the rising cost of medications, which plagues many Americans. The PBM industry\u2019s trade group blasted the commission\u2019s report, saying that it \u201cfalls far short of being a definitive, fact-based assessment of PBMs or the prescription drug market\u201d and that it \u201cis based on anecdotes and comments from anonymous sources and self-interested parties, and supported only by two cherry-picked case studies that are implied to be representative of the entire market.\u201d \u201cThe report completely overlooks the volumes of data that demonstrate the value that PBMs provide to America\u2019s health care system by reducing prescription drug costs and increasing access to medications,\u201d Pharmaceutical Care Management Association CEO JC Scott said in a statement. One of the agency\u2019s own commissioners also took issue with the report, saying it failed to live up to the FTC\u2019s rigorous standard. The report was plagued by process irregularities and concerns over the substance, Commissioner Melissa Holyoak wrote in her dissent. CVS Caremark, which handles about one-third of the market, said it stands by \u201cour record of protecting American businesses, unions, and patients from rising prescription drug prices.\u201d \u201cOur efforts have resulted in members on average paying less than $8 per 30-day supply of medication,\u201d CVS Caremark said in a statement. \u201cIndependent analyses show net brand drug prices have declined six years in a row despite significant inflation across the U.S. economy and egregious list price increases from drug makers.\u201d The pharmaceutical industry\u2019s main trade group, on the other hand, said the commission\u2019s report shows how PBMs are driving up costs. \u201cThe veil continues to lift exposing the ugly truth that PBMs put profits before patients at every turn,\u201d PhRMA spokesperson Alex Schriver said in a statement. \u201cThe FTC report makes it clear: PBMs have outsized control over what medicines people can get and the price they pay\u202fat the pharmacy counter.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/ftc-report-pbm-pharmacy-healthcare/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_plague-human-risk-explainer", "text": "Plague, one of the deadliest bacterial infections in human history, caused an estimated 50 million deaths in Europe during the Middle Ages when it was known as the Black Death. While extremely rare, the disease is still around today, with a man in New Mexico dying of plague in March after being hospitalized for the disease and a person in Oregon being diagnosed with bubonic\u00a0plague in February after likely being infected by their pet cat. It\u2019s transmitted by fleas that live on rodents. Symptoms usually appear within one to seven days after infection and include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, in the groin, armpit or neck areas as well as fever, chills and coughing. How do you get the plague? Plague affects humans and other mammals. Usually, people get the plague after being bitten by a rodent flea carrying Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the disease, or by handling an infected animal, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cats, which become sick themselves, can directly infect humans, while hardier dogs may simply carry the fleas back to their owners. People also can become sick by inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. The bacteria persists because low levels circulate among populations of certain rodents, according to the CDC. These infected animals and their fleas serve as long-term reservoirs for the bacteria. \u201cThe reason why it hasn\u2019t been eliminated is because there\u2019s an animal reservoir,\u201d Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,\u00a0said in February. \u201cThe bacteria can infect animals, and because we can\u2019t treat all animals\u00a0in the wild, it persists in nature and thus occasionally\u00a0causes a limited number of human cases.\u201d Where can you get the plague? Plague occurs naturally in rural areas in the western United States, particularly Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. That\u2019s where an average of seven human plague cases are reported each year to the CDC. But significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia. From 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths, according to\u00a0the World Health Organization.\u00a0It said the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru. There are three types of plague \u2013 bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic plague. With the pneumonic form of plague \u2013 which means it affects the lungs \u2013 there is a risk of direct transmission from human to human. That was the case\u00a0in the large outbreak in Madagascar in 2017, where there were 2,348 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and 202 deaths. The last urban plague epidemic in the United States occurred in Los Angeles from 1924 through 1925, the CDC said. How worried should I be? Modern antibiotics \u2013 streptomycin is the usual first-line treatment \u2013 can prevent complications and death if given promptly after symptoms appear. The treatment is used for the two most common types of plague: bubonic and pneumonic. \u201cThe reason why it caused such widespread death and destruction in the Middle Ages is because we didn\u2019t have antibiotics at that time,\u201d Barouch said in February about plague. \u201cAlthough it can be a serious illness, it\u2019s usually easily treatable with antibiotics as long as it\u2019s caught early. So now it\u2019s a very treatable disease. It shouldn\u2019t create the fear that people had in the Middle Ages of the Black Death,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone develops symptoms consistent with the plague \u2014 usually the initial symptoms are fever, chills and swollen lymph node \u2014 then seek medical attention, because at the early stages, the plague is easily treatable with antibiotics.\u201d Bubonic plague has a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60%\u00a0when left untreated,\u00a0while pneumonic plague, when left untreated, is always fatal,\u00a0according to WHO. However, a strain of bubonic plague with\u00a0high-level resistance to streptomycin\u00a0has been seen in Madagascar. More than 80% of US cases have been the bubonic form, which is the most common form of infection. Untreated bubonic plague can turn into the more serious pneumonic plague, which causes rapidly developing pneumonia after bacteria spread to the lungs. Is there a vaccine for the plague? There is a\u00a0Yersinia pestis vaccine, but it is recommended only for high-risk people like scientists who work directly with the bacterium, Dr. Harish Moorjani, an infectious disease specialist at Phelps Hospital in New York, part of Northwell Health, said in February. \u201cMost people don\u2019t need the vaccine,\u201d Moorjani said. A 2019 review\u00a0of experimental plague vaccines suggests that researchers are exploring a variety of approaches to develop an effective plague inoculation. Since different vaccine designs lead to different mechanisms of immunity, the authors conclude that combinations of different types might overcome the limitations of individual vaccines and effectively prevent a potential plague outbreak. How do you protect yourself and your family? Key steps for prevention of plague include eliminating nesting places for rodents around your home, sheds, garages and recreation areas by removing brush, rock piles, trash and excess firewood. Report sick or dead animals to law enforcement or your local health officials; do not pick up or touch them yourself. If you absolutely must handle a sick or dead animal, wear gloves. If you live in an endemic area,\u00a0take added precautions. Use insect repellent that contains DEET to prevent flea bites and treat dogs and cats for fleas regularly. Do not sleep with your pets as this increases your risk of getting plague. Finally, your pets should not hunt or roam rodent habitats, such as prairie dog colonies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/plague-human-risk-explainer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_emtala-abortion-reminder-letter", "text": "In letters to health-care providers Tuesday, the Biden administration reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that pregnant people have access to emergency treatment, even if that treatment necessitates an abortion and the person lives in a state with an abortion ban. In the letters, US Department of Health And Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure reminded hospitals and provider associations of their legal duty to provide stabilizing medical care \u2013 or transfers, if appropriate \u2013 to all patients. The letters come soon after the US Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban that had prompted at least one large hospital system to send some pregnant patients out of state via air transport to protect their health. Idaho\u2019s ban criminalizes most abortions and does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion even if the patient\u2019s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself, in most circumstances. The Biden administration argued that the law violates the federal\u00a0Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also known as EMTALA. The 1986 law requires all US hospitals that have received Medicare money \u2014 nearly all of them \u2014 to screen everyone who comes into their emergency rooms to determine whether the person has an emergency medical condition, without regard for their ability to pay for those services. The law also requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or transfer them to a facility that has that capacity. Hospitals must treat patients \u201cuntil the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.\u201d Pregnant people were singled out in the law\u00a0in 1989, after reports that some hospitals were refusing to care for uninsured women in labor. Congress expanded EMTALA to specify how it included people who were pregnant and having contractions. In 2021, the Biden administration released the\u00a0Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor\u2019s duty to provide stabilizing treatment \u201cpreempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,\u201d although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided. In July 2022, the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0guidance\u00a0clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. Experts have said that the law around emergency treatment has been murky ever since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to make their own laws restricting abortions. Forty-one states now have\u00a0abortion bans\u00a0with only limited exceptions, and 14 states have total bans. Texas also sued the US government over its EMTALA guidance, and in 2022, a federal judge allowed the law\u00a0to be blocked. The federal government has asked the US Supreme Court to review the law, and that case could go before the court next term. Although last week\u2019s Supreme Court decision did not resolve the entire EMTALA matter, Tuesday\u2019s letter to providers spells out that \u201cEMTALA\u2019s protections remain in place.\u201d The letter reminds providers\u00a0that state law is pre-empted if it prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life and health of the pregnant individual and if they seek medical help that necessitates an abortion. \u201cNo pregnant woman or her family should have to even begin to worry that she could be denied the treatment she needs to stabilize her emergency medical condition in the emergency room,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs health care providers, you know better than anyone how crucial it is for anyone experiencing a medical emergency to receive appropriate care and to receive it quickly. And yet, we have heard story after story describing the experiences of pregnant women presenting to hospital emergency departments with emergency medical conditions and being turned away because medical providers were uncertain about what treatment they were permitted to provide.\u201d CMS says it will investigate all EMTALA complaints to make sure providers are following federal law. The agency also announced Tuesday that it had created an EMTALA complaint form in Spanish and had made it easier for people to file complaints directly at CMS.gov. CMS has created a website to help people understand exactly what protections are offered under EMTALA. If a provider is found to be in violation of EMTALA, CMS will offer one opportunity to come into compliance. Failure to do so may mean a fine or the loss of a Medicare provider agreement. The federal agencies said they will continue to educate the public about their rights to emergency medical care and will help support hospitals and health care professionals in their efforts to meet EMTALA obligations. \u201cWe will continue to do everything in our power to give you the clarity you need regarding the federal laws that protect you and your patients in emergency medical situations,\u201d the letter says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/emtala-abortion-reminder-letter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

Pisano\u00a0received the transplant on April 12, but the organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed May 29. Her case was the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the animal\u2019s thymus gland. Pisano\u00a0was brave and altruistic, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute,\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday. She had said\u00a0during a news conference after the procedure that even if the organ transplant didn\u2019t work for her, it might for the next person. \u201cAt least somebody is going to benefit from it,\u201d she said. Montgomery said Tuesday that \u201cLisa\u2019s contributions to medicine, surgery, and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. \u2026 Lisa helped bring us closer to realizing a future where someone does not have to die for another person to live.\u201d Every eight minutes, another person is added to the transplant waiting list, and 17 people from this list die each day waiting for an organ, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Xenotransplantation, which involves using organs from other species, is a potential solution to the shortage of available donor organs, experts say. Doctors in the US perform xenotransplants in rare cases, with permission from the US Food and Drug Administration. For Pisano, the permission came through the agency\u2019s expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policy, which allows terminally ill patients who have no other treatment options to access experimental medical products. Due to Pisano\u2019s heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, she couldn\u2019t have a standard transplant, NYU Langone said in a news release. Before the xenotransplant, Pisano\u00a0said,\u00a0she had \u201ctried everything else\u201d and, with the surgery, was hoping to spend time with her grandkids and play with them. The pig kidney she received was genetically altered to evade human antibodies, which typically detect and attack foreign organs. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed beneath the pig kidney\u2019s cover to further help Pisano\u2019s body accept the organ. However, the kidney was removed in May after it was determined that it was \u201cno longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen,\u201d Montgomery said at the time. Pisano\u2019s \u201cbravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs,\u201d he said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cHer legacy as a pioneer will live on and she will forever be remembered for her courage and good nature.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_gupta-biden-cognitive-testing-analysis", "text": "When the 46th President of the United States took the debate stage a week ago, it became apparent, even from his first answer, that this would not be the performance he hoped for. For me as a brain specialist, it was concerning to watch President Joe Biden, and it quickly became clear that I was not alone in my reaction. Over the past week, I received more than a dozen calls, texts and emails from medical colleagues who, like me, specialize in the brain. It wasn\u2019t that what we noticed was necessarily new but that it was particularly pronounced, and right from the start of the debate. From a neurological standpoint, we were concerned with his confused rambling; sudden loss of concentration in the middle of a sentence; halting speech and absence of facial animation, resulting at times in a flat, open-mouthed expression. To be clear, these are only observations, not in any way diagnostic of something deeper, and none of these doctors wished to suggest that was the case. The consensus from the doctors reaching out to me, however, was that the president should be encouraged to undergo detailed cognitive and movement disorder testing, and those results should be made available to the public. Over the past five years, I have reported extensively on the advances in the world of treating and reducing risk of dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia. For the documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I even went through extensive cognitive testing to demonstrate what it entailed and determine whether I had problems with executive functioning, judgment or memory lapses, as well as blood tests to determine things like the level of abnormal proteins that may be present in my brain and my B12 levels. My sense of smell and my genetic risk factors were checked. This type of testing is not necessary for most people as a matter of routine, but every one of the brain doctors I spoke to recommended that level of examination for Biden. Biden\u2019s health history The last official report in February was a health summary which concluded that the president was \u201cfit for duty.\u201d The White House said a team of 20 doctors, including a neurologist, participated in completing his physical. An \u201cextremely detailed\u201d neurologic exam found nothing consistent with neurological disorders, the summary said. It also found no evidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease that might explain his stiff gait and decreased expression in his face. Although Parkinson\u2019s disease is the most common cause of parkinsonism - a set of movement symptoms such as stiffness and tremor \u2013 there are other causes as well, and it was not clear in the medical report that those had been investigated. They did find evidence of neuropathy and arthritis\u00a0in his feet, which can cause numbness, weakness and pain. There was no mention of any sort of cognitive testing. Biden was examined by his physician after the debate to check on a cold, the White House said, but it was a \u201cbrief check\u201d and not a physical.\u00a0When White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked this week whether Biden should receive and release the results of any kind of cognitive test, she replied that his medical team has said it\u2019s \u201cnot necessary.\u201d It\u2019s true that the trajectory of aging varies from person to person. Biden is 81, and former President Donald Trump is 78. Both have already lived longer than the average American male lifespan of 74.8 years. This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, as both men have access to high-quality health care, and they don\u2019t drink or smoke. Biden\u2019s medical team has previously disclosed that he had two separate brain operations for aneurysms, including one that ruptured on the left side of his brain, in 1988, and there is some evidence that this type of hemorrhage may increase the risk of delayed cognitive problems later in life. Trump\u2019s father died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 93. Neither man has any other known risk factors for cognitive decline. Trump does at times display some of these same signs as Biden, including nonsensical rants as well as confusing names and current events. He said he\u2019d undergone the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, known as MoCA, in the past. According to his medical team, he received a perfect score when he took the test in 2018. Trump said he took a second cognitive test for his last physical exam at the end of 2023 and \u201caced it.\u201d In a note at the end of last year, Dr. Bruce Aronwald wrote that Trump\u2019s cognitive exams \u201cwere exceptional.\u201d Trump has not released his actual medical records, and memos about his health that were previously released have at times used hyperbolic language, unusual for medical documentation. The MoCA isn\u2019t the same level of cognitive testing the medical experts I spoke to would like to see Biden do, but it could serve as an initial screening tool for cognitive decline. For Trump, this might be considered either a screening test or a baseline to understand how his cognition might be changing. It\u2019s not clear that Biden has ever had such a baseline examination for comparison. An \u2018episode\u2019 or a \u2018condition\u2019? To be clear, there are aspects of aging that can be beneficial to the job of the presidency. Older people may \u201chave something called crystalized intelligence, which is the accumulated wisdom associated with the passage of time,\u201d according to Jay Olshansky, professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois-Chicago. This is our knowledge that comes from learning and experiences. On the other hand, there are definitely aspects of cognition that decline as we age \u2014 especially fluid abilities like processing speed, attention span and memory. This is normal and expected and doesn\u2019t necessarily stand in the way of someone\u2019s ability to do their job. But for a minority of us, that decline is steeper and can lead to dementia. Think of this as the difference between forgetting where you put your keys and not understanding what your keys are for. Still, determining a diagnosis of dementia is not as straightforward as many believe, and there are many other things that could account for the clinical observations I described above. A poor night\u2019s sleep or low blood sugar can have an impact. A viral illness or the medications used to treat those symptoms can result in temporary brain fog. Biden and his aides have said it was a \u201cbad night.\u201d The White House press team said Biden had a cold but did not take any medications to treat symptoms. After the debate, Jean-Pierre added that he had jet lag following overseas travel earlier in the month and worked late doing his presidential duties as well as preparing for the debate.\u00a0According to three sources briefed on these comments, Biden told Democratic governors during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he will stop scheduling events after 8 p.m. so he can get more sleep. The debate started at 9 p.m. Eastern. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question\u201d whether Biden\u2019s debate performance was an \u201cepisode\u201d or a \u201ccondition,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during an MSNBC interview Tuesday. That is precisely why detailed testing is important. It can help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning. As a doctor, I would want to understand the possibility of underlying dementia because, over the past several years, we have learned that there are medical treatments and lifestyle changes that can delay and, in some cases, even reverse the symptoms of the disease. These are hopeful days when it comes to dementia, and early diagnosis and treatment is better than it has ever been. Seeking answers With an election looming in November, we don\u2019t have answers about Biden. The White House has rejected requests from the press to release more medical records and question Biden\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor. Biden\u2019s press secretary said O\u2019Connor watched the debate and had no concerns afterward. Elected officials, like anyone else, are entitled to some level of privacy, and under federal health-care laws, there is no ability for someone to obtain personal medical information on an individual unless authorized, even the president. There is also no requirement for the president or candidates to disclose that information. Most do not. In fact, in the 23 years I have been reporting on these topics, only Sen. John McCain \u2014 one of the oldest presidential candidates in US history \u2014 shared all of his records with me and the American public. We often hear that observing a candidate on the campaign trail is the best assessment of the individual\u2019s physical and cognitive health. Back in 2020, Biden said he was \u201cconstantly tested\u201d by the work of running for president. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is watch me,\u201d he said then. The country is watching now, and that assessment gives cause for concern \u2014 and a need for transparent testing.

{"id": "2024_06_29_health_exercise-mental-health-happiness-wellness", "text": "Think back to when you were a kid and movement was instinctive \u2014 and often infused with pure joy. Maybe it was racing your sister and dad to the front door. Or jumping on the bed with friends during a sleepover. Or playing a team sport. Or riding your bike around the park. For many, the link between movement and joy was severed and forgotten somewhere along the road to adulthood, displaced by the realities and responsibilities of daily life. Movement might have been transformed into something more obligatory \u2014 we must do it to optimize our health or get in shape. Or it might have become too time-consuming. For some, it might even have become painful due to injury, disease or the passage of time. But we abandon movement at our own peril and at risk of our well-being. Studies have found that movement \u2014 and its more challenging and intentional cousin, exercise \u2014 is not only beneficial for physical health but is also closely associated with mental status and mood. \u201cI always say that exercise is like an intravenous dose of hope,\u201d psychologist Kelly McGonigal told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently. \u201cAnd it\u2019s any form of movement that you\u2019re willing to do with any part of your body that you can still move.\u201d McGonigal is the author of \u201cThe Joy of Movement: How Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage.\u201d A group fitness instructor and a lecturer at Stanford University, she has used movement and exercise throughout her life to manage her own anxiety and depression. McGonigal\u00a0said exercise allows for the creation and release of \u201chope\u201d molecules, technically called myokines, during muscle contractions \u2014 for example, when we work out or even just move around. Some of these myokines can have antidepressant effects. \u201cOur muscles do more than just move our bones around or stabilize our skeleton,\u201d she said. \u201cOur muscles are almost like endocrine organs. They manufacture these molecules that they can release into the bloodstream that then travel around and affect all of our organs.\u00a0And some of them can cross the blood-brain barrier and affect your brain, including your mood and your mental health and your brain health.\u201d Exercise enables you to see your body as an ally, according to McGonigal. \u201cI think this is one of the coolest bits of the science of movement and exercise, particularly because of how it allows us to feel like our body is our friend,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our partner, not something we\u2019re trying to fix or control through movement.\u201d McGonigal said many other brain chemicals get released during exercise that can affect someone\u2019s state of mind, resulting in, for example, a runner\u2019s high, a flow state and even euphoria. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a lot of different kind of brain states you could experience in movement; it\u2019s not one \u2018thing,\u2019\u201d she said. You can listen to the full discussion here. What can you do to tap into joy during exercise and movement? McGonigal has these five tips. Take your workout on the road Head out into nature. \u201cWe know that mindful forms of movement, as well as moving outdoors in nature, tends to put the brain in a state of this heightened awareness to the present moment that feels like vitality and connection to life,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cPeople often feel a relief from inner chatter and stress and worrying. \u2026 It\u2019s changing which systems of the brain are most active and putting you in a state that\u2019s like meditation.\u201d Pump up the volume Queue up your favorite playlist and get moving. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a workout where you\u2019re listening to music you love that\u2019s high energy, you\u2019re moving to the beat, and you\u2019re doing things that really get your heart rate up \u2026 it often is more like euphoria,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel incredible, and you\u2019ve got those endorphins, and that brain chemistry also really helps you feel connected to other people.\u201d Join the group Being social helps you exercise. \u201cMake movement social. We know that people form friendships and communities of support through movement, whether it\u2019s strength training or running,\u201d McGonigal said. These days, who couldn\u2019t use another friend or source of support? Exercise also helps you be more social. \u201cPeople who exercise, they report being less lonely, they report having better relationships with others and \u2014 for reasons that range from the biochemical and how the brain chemistry of exercise primes you to be more social \u2014 to be able to connect with others better,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIf you are socially anxious and you exercise, by the end of that workout, you\u2019re going to be almost like a more extroverted version of yourself.\u201d Get back to basics Find something you really like doing. \u201cThink about positive experiences you\u2019ve had with movement in your life,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cMaybe go back to something that you miss or find a new way to do it.\u201d Change your mindset to one of gratitude While you are moving, find ways to appreciate your body for being able to move, as opposed to monitoring it. Adopt a \u201cmindset switch of, \u2018Wow, body \u2014 that was incredible!\u2019 Or \u2018Thank you, body, for having the energy to let me do this,\u2019\u201d McGonigal said. We hope these five tips help you tap into joy through movement. Listen to the full episode here.

{"id": "2024_06_28_health_multiple-alarms-wake-up-sleep-wellness", "text": "Let\u2019s say you need to wake up by 7 a.m. to get to work on time. So you set your first smartphone alarm for 6:30 a.m., your second at 6:45 a.m. and your third at 6:55 a.m. to avoid the snooze button. And you throw in 7:05 a.m. just to be cautious. Does this sound familiar? If you are clogging your clock app with all those morning alarms, you\u2019re setting yourself up for a groggy morning, experts say. Hitting the snooze button for increments of nine minutes of sleep at a time does the same thing, said Dr. Brandon Peters, a neurologist and sleep medicine physician with Virginia Mason Franciscan Health in Seattle. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying in the moment to hit the snooze and delay getting out of bed and starting the day, but it does actually fragment and undermine that sleep quality,\u201d Peters said. For the last hours of sleep, people usually go in and out of the fourth and last stage of the sleep cycle, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This stage is particularly important for memory processing and creative thinking, he added. Having that stage of sleep fragmented could impact that brain function. He recommends setting one alarm, allowing for deep sleep to continue uninterrupted until you need to wake up in the morning. Here\u2019s how to train your mind and body to get out of bed after that first alarm goes off. Why do I have trouble getting up in the morning? Certain sleep disorders could be causing someone to have trouble waking up in the morning to one alarm, such as sleep inertia, which causes a difficult transition out of sleep, said Dr. Cathy Goldstein, a sleep medicine physician at the Michigan Medicine Sleep Disorders Centers. That may result in someone unknowingly turning off and snoozing alarms when first woken up. Most of the time, however,\u00a0someone who needs multiple alarms to wake up in the morning is sleep deprived, she said. First, try to get to any underlying issues that could be causing this problem, Goldstein noted. \u201cNumber one: are you actually getting the sleep you need? Not the amount of sleep you think you should get or that you want to get, but the amount of sleep that you actually need. And are you getting that on a nightly basis?\u201d asked Goldstein, who is also a clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Most adults need around\u00a0seven to nine hours\u00a0of sleep a night, but it does take time to figure out how much sleep you need. Goldstein recommends students use summer break to find how many hours of sleep they get naturally after a few weeks. For others, a long vacation could provide some helpful answers. Another reason someone may battle the alarm clock every morning is that they\u2019re naturally a night owl, but their work schedule calls for an early bird, said Dr. Alicia Roth, a clinician at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Sleep Disorders Center in Ohio. \u201cIn an ideal world, we would go to bed when we\u2019re sleepy, and we would wake up when we wake up. That is not the world we live in.\u201d But\u00a0there are ways to gradually shift your body clock and\u00a0make early mornings easier, she added. How to wake up to one alarm If you have to wake up at 7 a.m., and the alarm starts at 6 a.m., you are getting an hour of bad-quality sleep, instead of just sleeping through until 7 a.m, Roth said. While setting just one alarm is best, it might be hard to wake up to only one after using multiple alarms as your safety net, she added. Roth recommends testing out different alarm clocks, such as one that utilizes light or an alarm that makes you get out of bed to turn it off. Getting 15 to 30 minutes of sunlight in the morning can also help shift the internal body clock and is particularly important for those who are natural night owls, said Peters, author of the new book \u201cThe Sleep Apnea Hypothesis.\u201d It is also important to wake up and go to sleep around the same times each day, Goldstein said. \u201cIf you\u2019re somebody who sleeps really well from 3 a.m. to noon, and that\u2019s how you sleep on the weekends, but on Monday morning, you have to wake up at 6 a.m. to commute,\u201d that will be hard, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s earlier than your biology is prepared to wake up, and it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get up.\u201d Goldstein recommends shifting bedtime 30 minutes earlier every few days, or an hour earlier once a week for those looking to change their biological clocks. Avoiding harsh lights and limiting screen time up to four hours before bed can also help promote the body\u2019s natural melatonin production, she added. If someone finds they have woken up before their alarm goes off, Peters doesn\u2019t recommend checking the time, because doing so could make it difficult to fall back asleep if they start to worry about the sleep time they have left or the day ahead of them. Instead, Peters recommends trying to fall back asleep until it feels as though 15 to 20 minutes have passed. If you\u2019re still awake, then you can check the time and decide if you want to get up for the day, he added. \u201cIf it\u2019s close to your normal wake time, you might start your day a little early. If it\u2019s in the middle of the night, you might go off and do something quiet, like read, and then come back to bed when you\u2019re feeling more drowsy or sleepy.\u201d While some may be able to naturally wake up without using an alarm, it is not a realistic goal for everyone, particularly those who experience sleep inertia, or have naturally later biological clocks, Goldstein said. \u201cWe never want to sleep shame people,\u201d she said. \u201cIn medicine, and in public health we operate on averages a lot of the time, what\u2019s best for the most. But there are these biological differences, and we want to make sure that everybody is optimizing their sleep the best that they can.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/multiple-alarms-wake-up-sleep-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_how-to-do-hammer-curls-wellness", "text": "While there is no magic bullet for gaining strength, variety is key. To that end, although classic bicep curls often take center stage for building arm strength, another arm exercise deserves attention in your workouts: the hammer curl. This powerful movement not only builds impressive arm muscles but also enhances overall body strength, function, stability and resiliency. Hammer curls are a variation of regular bicep curls. Like their traditional counterpart, one of the primary muscles targeted by hammer curls include the biceps brachii, the muscle best known as \u201cthe bicep.\u201d However, hammer curls also emphasize two other arm muscles: the brachialis, a muscle beneath the biceps brachii that helps support the elbow joint, and the brachioradialis, a forearm muscle that enhances grip strength. Aptly named, hammer curls mimic the action of holding and using a hammer. Unlike regular bicep curls, which use a palms-up grip, hammer curls are performed with a neutral grip with palms facing each other. This simple adjustment shifts the muscle focus for more comprehensive strength development. This variation also decreases wrist and elbow strain, reducing the risk of overuse injuries and making it a safer option for those with joint concerns. The everyday functional benefits of hammer curls Despite their somewhat obscure reputation, hammer curls aren\u2019t just for gym enthusiasts. This exercise can benefit anyone wanting to improve their ability to perform the physical tasks of daily living. Here\u2019s a detailed list of benefits: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Because the neutral hand position needed to perform hammer curls boosts forearm and grip strength, it also boosts your ability to hold and lift heavier weights to make greater total-body strength gains in other exercises, as well as enhanced performance in other fitness and sport activities. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Hammer curls build arm and hand muscles needed for daily activities that require lifting, holding, and carrying, such as caring for children and performing household tasks and yard work. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Enhanced grip strength also helps with opening jars, using tools and completing basic household tasks, making hammer curls particularly beneficial for older adults trying to maintain functional independence. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 The controlled motion and neutral grip of hammer curls help strengthen the muscles and tendons around the elbow and wrist joints, reducing the risk of common injuries associated with weaker muscles and improper lifting techniques. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 With less wrist rotation than traditional curls, hammer curls minimize the risk of injury, especially for those people with previous wrist or elbow issues. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Performing hammer curls correctly involves significant core engagement, which improves balance and overall strength. \u2022\u00a0Bonus: For anyone wanting more visibly toned arms, hammer curls build up the brachialis muscle, which underlies the primary biceps brachii muscle and boosts muscle visibility even when your arms are not flexed. How to perform hammer curls To reap the full benefits of hammer curls, it is crucial to perform them with proper form and an appropriate weight for your fitness level. Use a weight that feels challenging but is light enough that you can comfortably perform at least eight repetitions of the exercise with good form. Be sure to mind the cues for how to breathe as you perform this exercise, exhaling as you lift the weights and inhaling as you lower them. Proper breathing mechanics help maintain and strengthen core stability to ensure correct form. 1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells at your sides with your palms facing inward in a neutral grip. Alternatively, you can be seated as long you can sit forward enough on the seat edge for the dumbbells to hang unobstructed at your sides. 2. Exhale as you slowly curl both dumbbells up toward your shoulders, keeping your elbows close to your torso and your core braced to remain stable. Pause slightly at the top of the movement. 3. Inhale as you lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent. Take your time, lowering your arms gradually, as the eccentric (lowering) phase is a crucial part of the exercise. 4. Repeat for 8 to 12 reps with good form. 5. Complete two to three sets of your desired number of repetitions, resting for at least one to two minutes in between sets. Optional variation: If you feel more comfortable lifting one arm at a time rather than both together, you can alternate right and left repetitions within each set to perform a total of 16 to 24 reps (8 to 12 reps on each arm) per set. To maintain proper form and decrease risk of injury, avoid these common mistakes: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swinging the dumbbells to use momentum to lift them rather than bracing through your core and relying on your arm strength \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Losing proper arm position and letting your elbows flare out \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using dumbbells that are too heavy or too light \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neglecting the eccentric (lowering) phase and dropping the weights too quickly \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Forgetting to breathe properly and maintain core stability As you begin feeling stronger in the exercise, you can progress by increasing the weight of your dumbbells or the number of repetitions within the 8 to 12 rep range. You may find that when you initially increase the weight, you need to decrease your reps to maintain good form. That is OK provided you can still perform a minimum of eight reps properly. Getting the most out of this new exercise To maximize the benefits of hammer curls, you need to integrate them into your fitness program a couple times per week. Hammer curls fit well into both arm-specific and full-body workout days. They can be alternated with other bicep and tricep exercises for a comprehensive arm workout or included in a circuit that features a mix of upper and lower body exercises. Remember, hammer curls are more than just an alternative to bicep curls. By incorporating this exercise into your routine, you can significantly enhance not only your arm strength but also your functional abilities essential for daily activities and overall improvement of total-body strength and resiliency for years to come.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/how-to-do-hammer-curls-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added. Other finds at the site, which sits on the slope of a valley, include buildings, pits, ditches and a road that archaeologists dated to the late 5th and early 6th centuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/europe/horses-remains-graves-france-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_voice-box-transplant", "text": "A Massachusetts man has regained his voice after surgeons removed his cancerous larynx and, in a pioneering move, replaced it with a donated one. Transplants of the so-called voice box are extremely rare, and normally aren\u2019t an option for people with active cancer. Marty Kedian is only the third person in the U.S. ever to undergo a total larynx transplant \u2013 the others, years ago, because of injuries \u2013 and one of a handful reported worldwide. Surgeons at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona offered Kedian the transplant as part of a new clinical trial aimed at opening the potentially lifechanging operation to more patients, including some with cancer, the most common way to lose a larynx. \u201cPeople need to keep their voice,\u201d Kedian, 59, told The Associated Press four months after his transplant \u2013 still hoarse but able to keep up an hourlong conversation. \u201cI want people to know this can be done.\u201d He became emotional recalling the first time he phoned his 82-year-old mother after the surgery \u201cand she could hear me. \u2026 That was important to me, to talk to my mother.\u201d The study is small \u2014 just nine more people will be enrolled. But it may teach scientists best practices for these complex transplants so that one day they could be offered to more people who can\u2019t breathe, swallow or speak on their own because of a damaged or surgically removed larynx. \u201cPatients become very reclusive, and very kind of walled off from the rest of the world,\u201d said Dr. David Lott, Mayo\u2019s chair of head and neck surgery in Phoenix. He started the study because \u201cmy patients tell me, \u2018Yeah I may be alive but I\u2019m not really living.\u2019\u201d Lott\u2019s team reported early results of the surgery Tuesday in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. The larynx may be best known as the voice box but it\u2019s also vital for breathing and swallowing. Muscular tissue flaps called vocal cords open to let air into the lungs, close to prevent food or drink from going the wrong way \u2013 and vibrate when air pushes past them to produce speech. The first two U.S. larynx transplant recipients \u2013 at the Cleveland Clinic in 1998 and the University of California, Davis, in 2010 \u2013 had lost their voices to injuries, one from a motorcycle accident and the other damaged by a hospital ventilator. But cancer is the biggest reason. The American Cancer Society estimates more than 12,600 people will be diagnosed with some form of laryngeal cancer this year. While today many undergo voice-preserving treatment, thousands of people have had their larynx completely removed, breathing through what\u2019s called a tracheostomy tube in their neck and struggling to communicate. Although the earlier U.S. recipients achieved near normal speech, doctors haven\u2019t embraced these transplants. Partly that\u2019s because people can survive without a larynx \u2013 while antirejection drugs that suppress the immune system could spark new or recurring tumors. \u201cWe want to be able to push those boundaries but do it as safely and ethically as we can,\u201d Lott said. Head-and-neck specialists say the Mayo trial is key to helping larynx transplants become a viable option. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a \u2018one-off,\u2019\u201d but an opportunity to finally learn from one patient before operating on the next, said Dr. Marshall Strome, who led the 1998 transplant in Cleveland. This first attempt in a cancer patient \u201cis the next important step,\u201d he said. Other options are being studied, noted Dr. Peter Belafsky of UC Davis, who helped perform the 2010 transplant. His patients at high risk of larynx loss record their voice in anticipation of next-generation speech devices that sound like them. But Belafsky said there\u2019s \u201cstill a shot\u201d for larynx transplants to become more common while cautioning it likely will take years more research. One hurdle has been achieving enough nerve regrowth to breathe without a trach tube. Kedian was diagnosed with a rare laryngeal cartilage cancer about a decade ago. The Haverhill, Massachusetts, man underwent more than a dozen surgeries, eventually needing a trach tube to help him breathe and swallow \u2014 and struggled even to muster a raspy whisper through it. He had to retire on disability. Still the once gregarious Kedian, known for long conversations with strangers, wouldn\u2019t let doctors remove his entire larynx to cure the cancer. He desperately wanted to read bedtime stories to his granddaughter, with his own voice rather than what he called robotic-sounding speech devices. Then Kedian\u2019s wife Gina tracked down the Mayo study. Lott decided he was a good candidate because his cancer wasn\u2019t fast-growing and \u2013 especially important \u2013 Kedian already was taking antirejection drugs for an earlier kidney transplant. It took 10 months to find a deceased donor with a healthy enough larynx just the right size. Then on Feb. 29, six surgeons operated for 21 hours. After removing Kedian\u2019s cancerous larynx, they transplanted the donated one plus necessary adjoining tissues \u2013 thyroid and parathyroid glands, the pharynx and upper part of the trachea \u2013 and tiny blood vessels to supply them. Finally, using new microsurgical techniques, they connected nerves critical for Kedian to feel when he needs to swallow and to move the vocal cords. About three weeks later, Kedian said \u201chello.\u201d Soon he\u2019d relearned to swallow, working up from applesauce to macaroni and cheese and hamburgers. He got to say hi to granddaughter Charlotte via video, part of his homework to just keep talking. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Kedian, who moves back to Massachusetts soon. His tracheostomy remains in place at least a few more months but \u201cI\u2019m pushing myself to make it go faster because I want these tubes out of me, to go back to a normal life.\u201d And just as Lott had assured him, Kedian retained his beloved Boston accent.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/voice-box-transplant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_travel_camp-stove-cooking-wellness", "text": "You know what I love doing in the summer? I\u2019ll give you three things: \u2022 Taking road trip vacations\u2022 Eating well on my road trips\u2022 Not going over my food budget while on a road trip That last one is a little tricky to pull off because \u2014 and I admit this might be an obvious statement \u2014 the cost of eating adds up over the course of a vacation. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who loves to fill up on a big, leisurely brunch, finding affordable but memorable options for every meal during a long trip can be challenging. I used to make do with deli sandwiches and brought-from-home snacks, but now I have a secret weapon for quick but satisfying road trip lunches: my Coleman camp stove. Despite my outdoorsy hippie reputation among friends, this was the first time I dove into cooking on an outdoor propane stove before renting a camper van for a cross-country trip with my husband on Route 66. But once we were on the road and figured out the logistics of our travel routine, I realized the stove\u2019s versatility and utility, not to mention the genuine fun of being able to cook lunch on the go. With a two-burner stove and pump sink in the back of our camper van, we could pull over and cook lunch pretty much anywhere during each day\u2019s adventures. I made pesto rotini in the parking lot of Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s historic home in Missouri, flipped grilled cheese sandwiches in a local park in Baxter Springs, Kansas, and slurped up cheesy zoodles outside the Painted Desert Inn in Petrified Forest National Park. Now I\u2019m a seasoned outdoor cook and have invested in a full mini kitchen setup for my camping excursions. I\u2019ve fallen in love with camp stove cooking so much that I now bring it with us on most of our summer road trips \u2014 whether we\u2019re camping or not. Coupled with my trusty 10-inch cast-iron skillet, the camp stove gives me a way to save a few bucks and eat well during the day so we can have a big dinner out. I might get a few stares in hotel parking lots and patio areas, but it\u2019s worth it for the convenience and reassurance of a good meal while sticking to my frugal budget. Hey, I own all these items already \u2014 why not use them? My road-trip stove setup Along with my stove and skillet, I also bring a few basic tools for cooking and cleaning. I keep a crate packed with the following: \u2022 Metal tongs\u2022 Fish spatula (slotted spatula)\u2022 Silicone spoonula\u2022 Silicone trivet\u2022 Olive oil (in a small squeeze bottle)\u2022 Kosher salt\u2022 Bar towels\u2022 Washcloth\u2022 Laundry tub\u2022 Castile soap Because I\u2019m using a propane stove, I only cook in well-ventilated outdoor areas and bring a foldable metal table to make sure there is a safe cooking surface no matter where I\u2019ll be. Keep meals simple with pre-prepped ingredients Simplicity is the key to easy camp stove lunches. When I\u2019m planning these meals, I don\u2019t want to complicate my prep with anything that requires chopping on-site. Remember, all equipment needs to be washed in your hotel bathroom, so this is no time to get fancy. To accomplish this, I turn to pre-prepped ingredients, a departure from my usual higher-maintenance home cooking. However, these items are easy to find in many US grocery stores, so they don\u2019t need to be packed in advance. With these versatile building blocks, I can make a variety of meals. I start with a base of shelf-stable carbs, such as bagged, ready-to-eat pasta, rice or grain blends. Protein comes in the form of beans, whether canned or bagged, frozen mini meatballs or seasoned tofu or seitan from the refrigerated section. The frozen and refrigerated produce sections offer a cornucopia of quick-cooking vegetable choices, including zoodles, cauliflower rice and stir-fry blends, pre-chopped onions and peppers, green beans, snap peas, baby spinach, and broccoli florets. Sauces can be as varied as pesto, marinara, salsa, salad dressings, or simply a bit of butter and salt. I\u2019ve also been known to bring some cheese powder from my pantry to make a macaroni and cheese meal as well. Don\u2019t forget that a one-skillet meal can also be as easy as a quesadilla, nachos, flatbreads or a homemade grilled cheese that beats the pants off a basic cold deli sandwich. Mix and match these ingredients and find the fun in cooking outdoors on your camp stove for your next road trip.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/travel/camp-stove-cooking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness", "text": "More water, please. Millions of Americans are experiencing a record-breaking heat wave that has continued for days on end. We know that keeping hydrated is important to staying healthy in the summer heat, but is water still the best drink during a heat wave? Or should people turn to sports drinks instead? What about soda, coffee and beer \u2014 is it advisable to keep drinking these beverages during extremely hot weather? To help guide us through drinks we should choose \u2014 and avoid \u2014 during hot weather events, I spoke with CNN wellness health expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: How much water should people normally drink, and does that change during extreme hot weather? Dr. Leana Wen: A quick rule of thumb that\u2019s often cited is the \u201c8 x 8 rule,\u201d which is eight 8-ounce glasses of water, or 64 ounces, of water per day for adults. That\u2019s half a gallon. This rule is not set in stone. There are many factors that influence how much water people need, including the type of food they eat, their body size and their physical activity. Other factors include air temperature and humidity, and, specifically, how much time you spend outdoors during hot weather. People working in the heat or otherwise engaging in physical activity should drink an 8-ounce cup of water every 15 to 20 minutes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This would total about 24 to 32 ounces per hour. People should also keep well hydrated before and after their outdoor time in the heat. CNN: Is it possible to drink too much water? Wen: Yes. The CDC guidance is that people should not drink more than 48 ounces (about 1.5 quarts) of water or other fluids in an hour. A large amount of fluid all at once can dilute the concentration of salts in our blood and be unsafe. CNN: When it\u2019s really hot outside, is water still the best fluid, or should people turn to sports drinks?  Wen: Sports drinks are beverages with added electrolytes. Their main purpose is to replenish water and electrolytes that are lost with sweating. These drinks contain electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Some have added sugars like fructose, glucose and sucrose.  Most people do not need drinks other than water. In general, adults engaging in mild to moderate physical activity and kids playing on the playground or doing recreational after-school sports do not need electrolyte replacement. The foods that we eat contain the electrolytes we need. People who could consider sports drinks are athletes who are engaging in vigorous exercise for at least an hour outdoors in hot weather. Again, though, not all these individuals will need electrolyte replacement beyond what they get from eating normally. Whether they do depends on factors such as how much they sweat, how hot and humid the environment is and how intensely they exercise. CNN: What\u2019s better, a sports drink that comes ready-made in a bottle or an electrolyte powder that you can add to make your own drink? Wen: Personally, I prefer the powder. There are also tablets that dissolve in water. These do-it-yourself options are cheaper, and I like to choose the brands that don\u2019t have much added sugar or chemicals. But this is a question of personal preference. Whatever you buy, make sure to look carefully at the ingredients. For instance, if you don\u2019t want added sugar or caffeine, make sure what you\u2019re drinking doesn\u2019t have these ingredients. CNN: What about energy drinks? Are these a good replacement for water? Wen: This is an important question. The short answer is no, energy drinks are not a replacement for water. They should be used with caution in adults, and children should not drink them. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which are meant to help you restore water and electrolytes. Energy drinks are not meant mainly to hydrate you. They often contain large amounts of caffeine and other legal stimulants such as L-carnitine and guarana. While caffeine can boost energy in the short term, it is also a diuretic, meaning that it causes someone to lose water. Too much caffeine also can cause jitteriness, anxiety and irregular heartbeats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against energy drinks for children and adolescents. In some studies, though, as many as 30% to 50% of adolescents report using energy drinks. I urge parents to be careful to distinguish between sports drinks and energy drinks. Neither are needed, but energy drinks, in particular, should be used with caution. CNN: What about other drinks with caffeine, like coffee? Is a cold brew or iced mocha a bad idea in hot weather? Wen: Not necessarily, though people should be aware that these caffeinated drinks may not hydrate you and may even dehydrate you further. This doesn\u2019t mean you should stop all coffee when it\u2019s hot outside. Just be aware of the effect of caffeine and consider drinking extra water while you are enjoying caffeinated beverages. CNN: What about sodas, punches and alcoholic beverages? Wen: Sodas and punches are considered ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to many adverse long-term health consequences, such as increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. Consumption should generally be kept at a minimum, and hot weather is no exception. Again, water is the preferred substance for hydration. Alcohol is best avoided when it\u2019s very hot outside. Be especially careful not to drink large amounts and become inebriated, as this could blunt your body\u2019s response to temperature regulation. You also may miss early signs of heat-related illnesses. Alcohol can be dehydrating as well. If you do choose to drink alcohol, limit your drinks, make sure there are people around you in case you get into trouble medically and be sure to drink plenty of additional nonalcoholic fluids. CNN: What about kids who are in all-day sports camps? Wen: It\u2019s hard to answer this without knowing exactly how the camp is structured. Many sports camps have indoor activities for at least a portion of the day, and even those that are predominantly outdoors should move their activities indoors during extreme heat warnings. When in doubt, it\u2019s advisable to speak with the camp director and ask about how much time will be spent outdoors. If the time is limited, there are regular breaks and much of the activity is low to moderate intensity, it\u2019s probably sufficient to hydrate with water and supplement with nutrient-dense snacks such as watermelon, coconut and avocado. Also focus on hydrating before and after camp. Sports drinks probably aren\u2019t needed, and, again, it\u2019s advisable for children to avoid energy drinks. CNN: What other precautions would you follow during extreme heat? Wen: Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Take extra care of children and the elderly, as well as people with chronic medical conditions that could be exacerbated by the heat. Be careful while exercising and try to move activities indoors or go in the early morning or late evening. And make sure to keep well-hydrated with the best substance for hydration \u2014 water!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_health_lead-service-lines-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "With the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s latest \u2014 and strictest \u2014 plan to minimize the risk of Americans drinking lead-contaminated water on the horizon, the debate over whether the agency\u2019s proposed rules go too far or not nearly far enough is heating up. Although lead was banned from new water service lines in 1986, it\u2019s estimated that\u00a0more than 9 million such lines\u00a0still carry drinking water to homes and businesses throughout the country. Under the EPA\u2019s\u00a0Lead and Copper Rule Improvements\u00a0proposal, water utilities would be required to replace\u00a0all lead-containing lines\u00a0within 10 years. The proposal from the Biden administration differs from rules put out in the waning days of the Trump term that allow up to 30 years for service line replacement, triggered only when lead levels test higher than 15 parts per billion. The new proposal, which would largely supplant\u00a0the Trump rules, calls for stricter monitoring, enhanced public education, and the 10-year pipe replacement mandate regardless of lead levels. An October deadline looms for the new rules to be adopted; otherwise, enforcement of the less-stringent Trump administration rules will begin. And complicating matters more: November\u2019s election results could shake up whose rules the nation must follow. While many cities and states have begun to replace their lead pipes, some utilities and officials say the 10-year\u00a0time frame is unfeasible\u00a0and too expensive. They say it would be difficult for water utilities to follow the rules while also dealing with\u00a0new EPA limits on five PFAS\u00a0contaminants, known as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d and\u00a0failing pipes, among other issues. \u201cNobody will tell you that having lead in contact with water is a great idea,\u201d said Steve Via, director of federal relations for the\u00a0American Water Works Association, the country\u2019s largest nonprofit water utility industry group. \u201cThe question becomes: How urgent a matter is it, and at what pace does it need to be done?\u201d Already,\u00a015 Republican state attorneys general\u00a0have argued that the proposed rules infringe on states\u2019 rights and chase \u201cspeculative\u201d benefits. On the other side,\u00a014 Democratic attorneys general\u00a0said that the EPA should find more ways to ensure pipes are quickly replaced in low-income areas. Cost of replacement v. the health costs of lead To be sure,\u00a0no amount of lead is considered safe\u00a0to consume. Lead is a\u00a0neurotoxin known to cause\u00a0irreversible long-term organ damage, lower IQs, higher risk for miscarriage, asthma, cardiovascular disease, impotence, and elevated blood pressure. Public health advocates say societal costs \u2014 in health care, social services, and lost productivity \u2014 far outweigh the cost of replacement. They say corrosion controls that have limited lead exposure can and do fail, pointing to human and systemic errors that prompted the\u00a0water crisis in Flint, Mich., where thousands of people were exposed to high lead levels in their drinking water. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole thing about lead pipes: They unexpectedly release lead into drinking water,\u201d said\u00a0Roya Alkafaji, who manages an initiative focused on reducing lead exposure from water with the\u00a0Environmental Defense Fund, a national advocacy group. \u201cI don\u2019t think kicking the can down the road is the solution.\u201d A lead water service line from 1927 lays on the ground on a residential street after being removed on June 17, 2021, in Denver. According to a\u00a02023 analysis\u00a0by\u00a0Ronnie Levin, an environmental health researcher at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the benefit of replacing lead pipes outweighs the costs by a 35:1 ratio. The EPA estimated $335 million in annual costs to implement water sampling, corrosion control treatments, inventorying and replacement of lead service lines, and educational outreach for the Trump rules. Using that figure, Levin\u2019s analysis shows that $9 billion in annual health care costs could be avoided. An additional $2 billion in spending \u2014 through upgraded infrastructure and reduced corrosion damage to appliances \u2014 could be saved. The broad spectrum of health-related costs has historically been ignored in analyzing the actual costs of leaving lead service lines in place, said Levin, a former EPA scientist. Estimates of the cost to replace the nation\u2019s lead pipes range from\u00a0$46 billion\u00a0to more than\u00a0$90 billion, far higher than the\u00a0$15 billion\u00a0set aside in the\u00a0Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Biden administration has framed those funds as a down payment,\u00a049% of which will be grants\u00a0or principal forgiveness loans\u00a0allocated on the basis\u00a0of the estimated number of lead pipes per state. Other\u00a0funding programs\u00a0can also be tapped. Replacement costs vary widely by location, with average costs ranging from\u00a0the EPA\u2019s 2019 estimate of $4,700\u00a0per service line to\u00a0$12,500 from Via\u2019s utilities trade group. An unrealistic timeline? Carolyn Berndt, legislative director for sustainability at the National League of Cities, said funding challenges could render the EPA\u2019s 10-year timeline unrealistic. While her organization is encouraging local leaders to secure as much funding as possible, what\u2019s available won\u2019t be enough to cover replacement costs for some localities \u2014 especially low-income areas, which often have older infrastructure and more lead pipes. Some direct costs could fall to property owners, such as replacing the lines connecting their water meters to their homes. And people could face indirect costs if utilities increase customer rates to offset the expense. Still, some communities, such as Olathe, Kan., are finding ways to move forward with a patchwork of funding. Out of 37,000 service lines there, 266 galvanized pipes were found serving downtown properties, where many of the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents live. The coating for\u00a0galvanized pipes typically contains lead. Workers will replace the lines at no cost to property owners in the city of 147,000 people outside Kansas City, said Megan Spence, who is\u00a0overseeing the city project. It is expected to cost around $2.3 million, paid for with\u00a0a loan\u00a0from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and about $1.2 million in federal infrastructure funding. About $500,000 for lawn restoration is included. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking at this as an opportunity and another way to protect public health,\u201d said Spence. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any lead lines in any drinking water distribution systems.\u201d Elsewhere, some Republicans, such as Indiana state Sen.\u00a0Eric Koch, are leading the charge to replace the pipes despite historical pushback in conservative states against federal mandates. He said lawmakers should consider the harm \u2014 and long-term costs \u2014 caused by delaying the cleanup of lead from drinking water. In March, Indiana\u2019s Republican Gov.\u00a0Eric Holcomb\u00a0signed a\u00a0unanimously approved bill, which Koch authored, designed to lower costs for replacing customer-owned lead service lines. Under the law, landlords are required to enroll in a state-approved program to have their lead pipes removed at no cost by their water utility or pay for replacement themselves. Koch said estimates for replacing customer-owned service lines are around $8,000, though the cost could be significantly higher for some properties. But by starting the work now, Koch said, utilities can avoid price inflation and ultimately remove pipes more cost efficiently. Meanwhile, time is running out to publish the Biden administration\u2019s proposed rules in the\u00a0Federal Register. Water utilities will be required to comply with the Trump rules as of Oct. 16 unless the EPA publishes the newer rules before then, said\u00a0Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of the National Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. It remains unknown what the June 28 Supreme Court\u00a0ruling on agency rulemaking, known as the \u201cChevron deference\u201d decision, will mean for either set of rules. A deadline is also looming for the 60-day \u201clook-back\u201d period under the\u00a0Congressional Review Act, during which a regulation can be repealed. If control of Congress or the White House flips with the November election, the Biden administration\u2019s rules could be repealed under an emboldened Congress even before the January swearing in of new officeholders. \u201cDepending on how the election goes, it could become a hot issue,\u201d said\u00a0Tom Neltner, national director of the advocacy organization\u00a0Unleaded Kids.

{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.
