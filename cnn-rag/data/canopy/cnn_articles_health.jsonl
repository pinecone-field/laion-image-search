But her 80 pounds of weight loss while taking Wegovy has not come without challenges of its own, she said. \u201cI still deal with a lot of body dysmorphia,\u201d said Olivares, who lives in Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019ll look in the mirror, and it\u2019s almost like a funhouse mirror where like one minute I\u2019ll look at myself and be like, \u2018OK, yes, like I see myself for how I am.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll look away, and I\u2019ll look back and suddenly my body just looks much larger.\u201d Olivares says she has had a positive experience with the GLP-1 agonist medication, which mimics hormones in the gut involved in insulin regulation and appetite. It is also sold under the brand Zepbound for weight loss. But she warns that losing weight is not a cure for everything that\u2019s not right in your life. Sure, many people approach Olivares differently in a small body, but even those \u201cnice\u201d comments are a double-edged sword, she said. They often make her feel as if she was not acceptable before the weight loss. \u201cI\u2019m the same person. I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019m a designer. I\u2019m a wife. I\u2019m a daughter,\u201d she said. \u201cI do all the same things. It\u2019s just the package in which I come in is smaller now. So why am I being treated differently? \u201cIt definitely reinforces this feeling of \u2018Am I only worth what\u2019s on the outside?\u2019\u201d The experience Olivares had after losing weight isn\u2019t unique. New York City psychologist Alexis Conason warns that people should not expect the work to be limited to decreasing a number you see on a scale. Body image is not always tied to body size If you have a negative voice in the back of your head that picks your body apart, it may not go away when you lose weight, said Conason, who is also a certified eating disorder specialist. \u201cBody image is not a reflection of weight. Body image is about the way that we see and feel about our body internalized,\u201d she said. Many people try to lose weight hoping to feel better about their body, only to find that they still don\u2019t once they have lost the weight, Conason said. And that could lead to a dangerous cycle of continually feeling as if the answer is to get even smaller. Conason recommends separating your efforts to improve your body image from any efforts you might take on to lose weight. \u201cMany people are able to work in therapy to accept their body and improve their body image even without losing weight at all and feel much better about themselves,\u201d she said. It\u2019s crucial that you build a better relationship with your body independent of its appearance because those thoughts aren\u2019t always dependent on your size, said Dr. Genesis Ettienne, a licensed mental health counselor and marriage and family therapist in the Miami metropolitan area. \u201cSelf-confidence is a muscle that you have to flex,\u201d regardless of your weight, she added. The comments don\u2019t stop Since her weight loss, Olivares has found that many of her social interactions begin with a comment about her body. \u201cNoticing the weight loss is one of the first things (people) say to me when they meet me,\u201d she said. While there is a part of her brain influenced by diet culture that\u2019s happy that people see her body is smaller, it also can make her uncomfortable, Olivares said. \u201cPeople tend to see weight loss as an invitation to publicly comment on people\u2019s bodies,\u201d Conason said. \u201cOur bodies are so personal and really should not be objects for conversation.\u201d It\u2019s important not to comment on people\u2019s bodies, she said \u2014 even if it is about losing weight. On one hand, seeing a body doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Perhaps that person lost weight because of an eating disorder, grief or some other distressing event, Conason said. On the other, even if the weight loss is seen as positive, commenting on people\u2019s bodies can make them feel more on display, which can feel overwhelming and intrusive, she added. Ettienne said she hears every day how her clients feel as if their weight loss has become the entirety of their storyline in the minds of the people around them. What you can do about it That is where it is essential to communicate boundaries around whether and how you are comfortable talking about your body with others, she said. Maybe your approach is a direct conversation to say, \u201cI know I lost weight. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Or it can be something lighter to brush off body-centric conversations, she said. Direct conversation can be easier when you are closer with the person, Olivares said, but for others, she tends to try to casually pivot the conversation away from body talk. Olivares also has to work hard to deal with her body dysmorphia, she said. And that can mean avoiding mirrors for a bit. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be able to see yourself in reality, it\u2019s OK to disengage from a harm-reduction perspective,\u201d Olivares said. Usually, she finds that her dysmorphia is connected to other behaviors or feelings, so she encourages people going through similar experiences to dedicate time to sit with it and ask themselves where it is coming from, she added. \u201cEven if you\u2019re physically in a smaller body, if you\u2019re not addressing the mental framing (of) body dysmorphia,\u201d Olivares said. \u201cIt can be really hard no matter how small you get to see reality.\u201d If you are struggling with body image or a cycle of feeling as if you must lose more and more weight, seeking professional help is the best next step, Conason said. \u201cLooking for a licensed mental health provider who specializes in eating disorder care is really the best thing to do,\u201d she added.

{"id": "2024_05_14_health_drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness", "text": "After decades of decline, accidental drowning rates are rising in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. With Americans getting ready to hit swimming pools and beaches on Memorial Day weekend, a new study shows that many lack the skills they need to stay safe in the water. Roughly 15% of US adults \u2013 40 million people \u2013 say they don\u2019t know how to swim.\u00a0More than half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to a new national survey by the CDC. The new data on swimming skills in the US population is included in a Vital Signs report released Tuesday by the CDC. It comes on the heels of an increase in drowning deaths in the US in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Each year, on average, about 4,000 Americans died from accidental drowning, a number that changed little from 2011 to 2020. But that number has been about 10% higher the past few years, adding 500 to 600 more deaths each year to the annual tally.\u00a0It\u2019s the first uptick in drowning rates in the US for at least\u00a0two decades. \u201cWhen I just look at the overall numbers, with over 4,000 people dying \u2013 that\u2019s over 12 people a day \u2013 that\u2019s really one person every two hours. And those are lives, not numbers,\u201d said Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC. The increases in drownings were even more dramatic for certain ages and racial groups. Drowning has long been the leading cause of death for preschool-age children. Drowning rates increased almost 30% in this age group in 2021 and 2022. Although the number of drowning deaths in children ages 4 and younger increased among young children in 2020, the rate increase was not statistically significant that year. Black people also saw drowning rates increase faster than the general population; compared with 2019, they were nearly 30% higher in 2021.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that Black Americans reported spending less recreational time in the water than White and Hispanic people.\u00a0If drowning rates were calculated based on exposure rather than population, the study authors noted, it\u2019s likely that the disparities for Black people would be even more pronounced. Additionally, the CDC\u2019s swimming skills survey found that 1 in 3 Black adults said they couldn\u2019t swim, compared with 1 in 7 adults in the general population, a legacy of segregation and discrimination in access to swimming pools in the US, according to the CDC. Hispanic Americans, a group that doesn\u2019t traditionally have disproportionately higher drowning rates compared with White non-Hispanics, also saw drowning rates increase by nearly 25% in 2022, compared with 2019. American Indian and Alaska Natives continued to have the highest rates of drownings of any racial or ethnic group overall. In 2019, there were about 3 drowning deaths for every 100,000 people among American Indian and Alaska Natives, a rate that has seen little change over the course of the pandemic.\u00a0By comparison, there were 1.2 accidental drowning deaths for every 100,000 among White people in 2019. Houry says it\u2019s hard to say exactly how the pandemic may have played a role in the increases.\u00a0The study can only make associations \u2013 it can\u2019t untangle the causes \u2013 but she notes that it was harder to get into public pools, with many closing or implementing policies that limited access.\u00a0Staffing was also problematic for many swim venues. \u201cThere would have been people, if swimming pools were closed for that year, who didn\u2019t get swim lessons and so might have been behind in getting swim lessons,\u201d Houry said. Berkeley Champlin didn\u2019t know the statistics around drowning deaths in young children until her son, Gordie, tragically became one of them. In July 2020, 3-year-old Gordie slipped unnoticed out of the sliding glass doors in Champlin\u2019s home in Livonia, Michigan, while Champlin was at work. Normally, he would have been in day care, but like many schools, it was shut down at the time. His father, who was home with him, later found him in the family\u2019s pool. He couldn\u2019t be revived. Gordie loved animals and couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night without special stuffed animals: an elephant and a bunny. \u201cI put his elephant and his bunny in his casket with him so that he has them always, because he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Champlin said.\u00a0She has drawings of the stuffies tattooed on her forearm. \u201cI wish he would have had swim lessons,\u201d she said. Every year since Gordie died, Champlin has channeled her grief into raising money for swim lessons for other children. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive.\u00a0It costs $120 a month in some places for a child to take lessons,\u201d said Champlin, who knows that may put them out of reach for some families. Champlin set a goal of paying for three kids to learn to swim each year.\u00a0This year, 42 families reached out to her for help, and she set up a\u00a0GoFundMe account\u00a0to raise money to cover them all. \u201cIf anyone else is ever in that situation, or if you go on vacation, or you\u2019re on the lake or a new pool or something that you don\u2019t have your standard parameters around, swim lessons is the way to prevent accidents from happening,\u201d she said. Houry, from the CDC, agrees. \u201cI think we forget drowning is still a really big problem for our young kids and that we can do something about it by making sure kids know how to swim,\u201d she said. Houry said the CDC is funding programs at the Red Cross and YMCA to help lower the cost of lessons and make sure everyone who needs them can get them \u201cbecause it\u2019s so important to have that equitable access,\u201d she added. Houry said kids should start getting swim lessons between the ages of 1 and 4. \u201cIf you are an adult and you don\u2019t know how to swim, it\u2019s never too late to get that swim lesson. It\u2019s really important,\u201d she said. But Houry\u00a0said that even if kids can swim, adults shouldn\u2019t leave them unattended, drink alcohol or get distracted while watching kids in the pool. In settings like a party, where it\u2019s easy for conversations or phones to divert attention, the CDC says it can be useful to assign an adult specifically to watch kids in the pool.\u00a0When swim time is over, the\u00a0CDC recommends\u00a0shutting and locking doors that give access to water.\u00a0In the event that something does happen, learning CPR can help you save a life before paramedics arrive. Houry says fencing that completely encloses a pool can help make backyard and community pools safer.\u00a0In open water, like lakes, life jackets are important for safety, too.\u00a0 When visiting a lake or ocean beach, it\u2019s a good idea to take stock of the hazards, such as rip currents, before going into the water. As Gordie\u2019s birthday approaches on July 12, Champlin said, she finds herself wondering what kind of a party he\u2019d want at age 6. Would he still love animals and superheroes as much, or would it be some kind of gaming thing like Roblox? Just as in past years, they\u2019ll spend his birthday at the zoo, a place that still holds vivid memories of her son. \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial", "text": "When Cheri Ferguson started taking Ozempic last year, she said, she hoped to lose about 50 pounds she\u2019d gained during the Covid-19 pandemic. Over about three months, she told CNN in June, the medicine \u2013 which is approved for type 2 diabetes and used off-label for weight loss \u2013 helped reduce the constant chatter in her brain urging her to eat, just what she\u2019d hoped it would do. But it had another unexpected effect: Ferguson said her desire to drink alcohol and use her vape pen also drained away. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone\u2019s just come along and switched the light on, and you can see the room for what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of these vapes and cigarettes that you\u2019ve had over the years, they don\u2019t look attractive anymore. It\u2019s very, very strange. Very strange.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling described by thousands of people taking these medicines, which are in a class known as GLP-1 receptor agonists and used by an estimated 15 million Americans, according to a recent poll. And now, Ozempic\u2019s maker, Novo Nordisk, said it intends to study the phenomenon. The company plans to start assessing the effects of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and other medicines on alcohol consumption this month in a newly announced clinical trial in alcohol-related liver disease \u2013 although cutting drinking isn\u2019t the study\u2019s main goal. A focus on liver disease, not addiction The Danish drug giant has been saying since at least last year that it doesn\u2019t plan to study semaglutide \u2013 which is also approved for weight loss as Wegovy \u2013 in areas like alcohol addiction, despite so many anecdotal reports like Ferguson\u2019s, and academic studies that are already underway. Novo Nordisk reiterated that stance Wednesday, noting that the main purpose of its new trial is to assess whether the medicines can improve liver health. Its primary measure is the medicines\u2019 effects on enhanced liver fibrosis, or scarring, over 28 weeks. \u201cSecondary endpoints include safety and tolerability and changes in alcohol consumption,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThere is a significant unmet medical need in alcohol-related liver disease, and the first line of treatment for the condition is lifestyle intervention to refrain from drinking alcohol.\u201d The trial, first reported by Bloomberg News, aims to enroll about 240 participants and is slated to begin May 20, according to a government database. \u201cEven though not all patients in the trial will have alcohol use disorder, it is natural to include alcohol consumption as a secondary endpoint,\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s spokesperson said, noting that the trial is part of the company\u2019s plans to address liver diseases more broadly. Nonetheless, researchers in addiction science cheered the news. A need for more treatments \u201cThose of us doing work in this area see this as a step in the right direction,\u201d Christian Hendershot, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Bowles Center of Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who is running one of the few studies in this area, said by email Wednesday. \u201cAdditional treatment options for this group are really needed.\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s CEO told CNN in August that the company had heard many similar anecdotal reports. \u201cWe\u00a0know\u00a0that\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0benefits\u00a0in\u00a0obesity\u00a0is\u00a0that\u00a0it\u00a0addresses\u00a0this\u00a0craving,\u00a0the\u00a0desire,\u00a0to\u00a0snack\u00a0and eat,\u201d Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. \u201cThat function in the brain, in this craving center, is perhaps also what is benefitting some of the other addictions.\u201d Studies in animals suggest the same thing, National Institutes of Health researcher Dr. Lorenzo Leggio told CNN last year. He published a study in May 2023 showing that semaglutide reduces alcohol drinking in rodents, noting that \u201cat least one of the mechanisms of how these drugs reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol,\u201d like those related to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Jorgensen said Novo Nordisk hadn\u2019t studied that effect and had no plans to do so at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0the\u00a0easiest\u00a0to\u00a0study,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t expect that we would go in and study these addictions widely.\u201d Jorgensen did say there could be \u201can opportunity to collect data when we do large studies,\u201d as well as to use artificial intelligence to mine large databases of experiences with the medicines in the real world for signals of effects on things like alcohol use. A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes tirzepatide-based competitors to Ozempic and Wegovy called Mounjaro and Zepbound, said Wednesday that it too had seen \u201canecdotal commentary in publications about the potential use of GLP-1s for additional indications like addiction.\u201d But while the Indianapolis-based drugmaker continues \u201cto evaluate future development options for tirzepatide,\u201d the spokesperson said the company hadn\u2019t announced any plans to develop its medicines for those uses. An unattractive market for drugmakers Medicines for addiction, and particularly for alcohol use, haven\u2019t been successful financially for the drug industry, leading to less interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing drugs in the space. Research from financial firm TD Cowen found that less than 5% of the 29 million Americans estimated to have alcohol-use disorder receive drug therapy. The firm pointed to issues like doctors not being familiar with medicines to treat alcohol use and compliance with the drugs. Novo Nordisk is looking at multiple medicines in its newly announced trial in alcohol-related liver disease; in addition to semaglutide, the company said it will investigate experimental drugs cagrilintide and one called zalfermin \u2013 listed on the trial posting as NNC0194-0499 \u2013 alone and in combination. Cagrilintide is a medicine that mimics a hormone called amylin that Novo Nordisk is testing in combination with semaglutide \u2013 which mimics another hormone, called GLP-1 \u2013 in large trials in both diabetes and weight loss, calling the combination CagriSema. Zalfermin, the company said, acts like yet another metabolic hormone, FGF21, which is produced mainly in the liver. Though trials in use of semaglutide and similar medicines have been slow to start, so many reports of the drugs\u2019 effects on alcohol use have emerged that Leggio, Hendershot and other researchers warned in a commentary in the journal Nature Medicine that the drugs shouldn\u2019t be prescribed for alcohol-use disorder until their safety and efficacy has been proven in clinical trials. \u201cClinical decisions should follow from controlled studies, triangulated with other clinical and preclinical evidence,\u201d the researchers wrote in the December commentary. \u201cWell-controlled [trials] with scientific rigor are needed before any claim of efficacy for alcohol-use disorder and other substance use disorders can be made.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_abortion-telehealth-shield-laws-wecount-report", "text": "Most abortions in the United States are medication abortions, and telehealth has become an increasingly common way to access abortion pills \u2014 especially since the US Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to an abortion. In the last few months of 2023, nearly 1 in 5 abortions nationwide \u2014 about 17,000 each month \u2014 were medication abortions in which the pills were mailed to a patient after a remote consultation with a clinician, according to a new report from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning. When #WeCount started collecting data from abortion providers in April 2022, about 4% of all abortions were medication abortions provided through telehealth. Medication abortion is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two drugs \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 rather than having a surgical procedure. The US Food and Drug Administration approved the drugs for abortion use more than two decades ago, and the regimen is approved for use up to 10 weeks gestation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA provided regulatory flexibilities that allowed for broader access to medication abortions through telehealth. Earlier models often required patients to visit a clinic for ultrasounds or other in-person tests, but options for fully remote screening and use of mail-order pharmacies became more widely available in 2021. Telehealth abortions have surged in recent months as newer policies offered protection for people in states with abortion bans or severely limited to access care, the new report shows. Over the past year, five states where abortion is legal \u2014 Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Washington and Vermont \u2014 have enacted shield laws that allow providers in those states to prescribe medication abortion drugs via telehealth to people living in states with bans or restrictions. More than 40,000 people accessed telehealth abortions under shield laws in the second half of 2023, according to the new report. And by December, nearly a 10th of all abortions in the US \u2014 about 8,000 a month \u2014 were telehealth abortions provided under shield laws. Research has\u00a0long found\u00a0that medication abortion is safe and effective, and recent studies have shown that to be true even when the patient gets the medicine through a telehealth appointment. In addition to further supporting evidence that medication abortion provided through the mail is highly effective and safe, a study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday found the experience to be timely and broadly acceptable among patients. More than 90% of people who had abortion medication delivered through the mail said they were satisfied with the experience. Nearly all said they maintained their confidentiality through the process, and more than 85% said they received the medication within three days. The medication abortion was reported to be medically successful in about 98% of the cases, and the rare adverse events that did occur \u2014 less than 5% of people sought medical care \u2014 were not related to the mail-order dispensing, the study found. Recent data from Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, shows that there were 1 million abortions in the US in 2023, the highest rate in more than a decade and a 10% jump from 2020. The new #WeCount report supports these findings and shows that abortions are increasing in the US, even when those provided under shield laws are excluded from the trends. \u201cEven as the total national number of abortions nationally has increased, we can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that access to in-person abortion care has virtually disappeared in states where abortion is banned,\u201d Dr. Alison Norris, co-chair of the #WeCount project and professor at The Ohio State University\u2019s College of Public Health, said in a statement. \u201cThe loss of clinic-based care \u2014 which makes up more than 80% of abortion care \u2014 is a devastating loss to access for people across wide swaths of the country.\u201d In the year and a half after the Dobbs decision, there would have been about 145,000 more in-person abortions if it had not been banned in 14 states, according to estimates from the #WeCount report. But medication abortion, including telehealth abortion, has become a more common option than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible how many barriers get removed from the process\u201d with telehealth abortion, said Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, co-chair of the #WeCount project and professor at the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the ease and access, but telehealth is able to deliver abortion at a much lower cost.\u201d It\u2019s filled some of the gaps created by abortion bans, but building broader awareness of and trust in telehealth abortion remains a challenge, she said. But at the end of 2023, nine states where abortion remained legal still had restricted telehealth abortions in some way \u2014 requiring an in-person ultrasound or counseling before the procedure, for example. Telehealth abortion is \u201cespecially important for individuals living outside metropolitan areas, in low-income communities, or where high-quality reproductive and maternity care services are lacking because of legislative restrictions,\u201d a group of family medicine physicians wrote in an editorial that was published in JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday. Primary care physicians are an \u201cuntapped resource\u201d that can help abortion access through clinics or telehealth, they wrote. But legal threats challenge the future potential of telehealth abortion, too. Mail service is managed by the federal government, and a change to the administration could threaten mail-order delivery of abortion pills and patients who receive them, Upadhyay said. And in March, the US Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could severely limit access to mifepristone, the primary drug used for medication abortions. \u201cAccess to medication abortion through telehealth continues to play an ever-increasing role in abortion care nationwide \u2014 even as the Supreme Court weighs the fate of telehealth abortion care,\u201d Upadhyay said in a statement. \u201cThe need for abortion care across the country demands that providers, advocates, and lawmakers continue to come together to innovate new strategies to help people access abortion care.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/abortion-telehealth-shield-laws-wecount-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_health_but-what-will-people-say-book-sahaj-kohli-cec-wellness", "text": "For most South Asians, the phrase \u201cWhat will people say?\u201d\u00a0is all too familiar. What will people say if you wear that revealing outfit? What will people say if you don\u2019t pursue an advanced degree? What will people say if you marry someone outside of your religion? What will people say if you get a divorce? You can swap in any hypothetical scenario that might spur societal judgment \u2014 the variations are endless. Sahaj Kaur Kohli, a licensed therapist and founder of the online mental health community Brown Girl Therapy, knows the weight of that question well. Born to parents with Indian and Sikh roots, Kohli was raised in a predominantly White suburb in Virginia and often found the collectivism of her immigrant parents\u2019 culture at odds with the individualism of the West, she writes in her new book \u201cBut What Will People Say? Navigating Mental Health, Identity, Love, and Family Between Cultures.\u201d The differences between the two cultures became especially clear after a difficult period in college prompted Kohli to move back home. When she told her parents she was battling depression and needed to see a therapist, Kohli says they worried how others might perceive her mental health struggles and tried to manage the situation on their own. It wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t concerned about her, Kohli adds \u2014 they were simply conditioned to think in terms of the family unit and community, believing their daughter\u2019s depression could be seen as a failure on their part. But what will people say? \u201cWe care so much about what other people will think that we forget about the people within the community or within the families who might be hurting,\u201d Kohli said in an interview with CNN. In \u201cBut What Will People Say?,\u201d which published May 7, Kohli explores that fear of judgment, along with other challenges that children of immigrants commonly face: shame, self-sabotaging behaviors and the loss of cultural identity among them\ufeff. Part memoir and part self-help, the book draws on Kohli\u2019s personal experiences and her work as a therapist to help children of immigrants process their emotions, improve their family dynamics and develop a clearer sense of self. Some of Kohli\u2019s reflections and insights might resonate beyond her target audience. In the book, she opens up about her once-strained relationship with her father, the academic troubles she long kept secret and the trauma she endured \u2014 experiences that many people, children of immigrants or not, can relate to. CNN spoke to Kohli about how to deal with guilt, how conversations around mental health in the West miss cultural nuance and how immigrant parents can better understand their children. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. What made you want to write this book? I wanted to write this book because I knew nothing like it existed. It\u2019s something that I so desperately could have used growing up. I\u2019m just so honored to be able to create something in a space that is predominantly White and individualistic by nature, and offer cultural nuance to the conversation of wellness. Your book focuses on your experiences growing up in two cultures: the community-oriented Indian culture of your parents and the individualist culture of the West. What were the biggest tensions between the two? That tension that I felt was every single day. I grew up with diametrically opposing values, norms and expectations. One of those cultural systems was the Western world. At home, I was being raised in a totally different environment that had different expectations of who I was supposed to be: as an Indian daughter, as an Indian woman, as a daughter of immigrants, as a South Asian woman. I started to develop performative behaviors at school, around friends, around dating, around career, around how I showed up in those social environments and how I wanted to be perceived. I developed a second set of performative behaviors when I was at home, when I was going to Gurdwara (Sikh house of worship) on Sundays, when I was going to an Indian cultural event on the weekends or when I was talking to my parents. The ways that we were taught to communicate, stand up for yourself or even start to learn about your own sense of self and your own needs is very different in the Western world than it is in the Eastern world. I didn\u2019t know it then but every single part of my life was at tension with one another based on how I thought I was supposed to behave to be accepted in the environments that I was living in. When did you start to develop the language to process those feelings? Very recently. Through working in media and working on identity-driven content and mental health content, I started to gain a language for wellness, identity and all of these things. But it wasn\u2019t until I went to grad school in 2019, which was the same time that I started Brown Girl Therapy, that my whole world opened up. It was through those experiences \u2014 building a community that didn\u2019t really exist for a population that was underserved and learning Eurocentric techniques and tools in school that all catered to individualism \u2014 that I started to realize how important this work is and how much we need to infuse culture into these conversations. What are some of the disconnects between Western therapy and the experiences of children of immigrants? One of the biggest things is other-care. We talk so much about self-care and the individual to such an extent that it leaves out everything else. What children of immigrants, Asian families, non-Western communities and immigrant communities really center is family and relationships. We are being exposed to all of these ideas that revolve around setting boundaries, cutting people out and thinking about yourself first. How do we learn to stick up for ourselves while also being mindful of the cultural nuances in the families and the systems that we exist in? So many of us feel as much pride and joy and rejuvenation from taking care of others and being in the roles that we play \u2014 whether it\u2019s being a daughter, sister, parent \u2014 as we do as taking care of ourselves. That is something in the self-care narratives in the Western world that we don\u2019t talk about enough. There\u2019s so much research on so many things that we just are not talking about: What\u2019s \u201ctoo close\u201d in a family system? What is considered dysfunctional? What is considered codependency? What is considered enmeshment and not having any boundaries? These things are very binary in the Western world, when in reality, it really does depend. There is this messy middle where things are neither good nor bad \u2014 they just are. How do we live in that messy middle? That\u2019s the ethos to all of my work. You share some very personal experiences in the book, like being sexually assaulted and taking a while to graduate from college \u2014 the kinds of experiences that children of immigrants are often taught to keep quiet. How did you get to a place where you felt comfortable being vulnerable?\u00a0 The process of writing this book was so healing for me. I excavated so many old wounds, stories and my inner child by revisiting parts of my life and owning them for myself. Even in writing about my college career, my editors had to push back a lot and say, \u201cYou still are not being very nice to yourself.\u201d It was a process getting to a point where I was like, \u201cDo I still feel shame about the fact that it took me 12 years to graduate college?\u201d Sometimes. Sometimes I feel really embarrassed \u2014 that it means I\u2019m not smart. Then I have to remind myself that that\u2019s not true. Life just happened in a certain way for me. I didn\u2019t choose to struggle, and it doesn\u2019t mean anything about me that it took me longer. Battling shame through self-compassion by writing this book is the ultimate form of liberation for myself. We all have experiences that we feel so much shame for because we worry what other people are going to think about those experiences. If we just own them, we can dismantle that shame. And that\u2019s what I did. What are some of the most common issues that children of immigrants bring up in therapy?\u00a0 Guilt. The feeling of guilt. Navigating guilt. How guilt motivates us to not do the thing we want. How it motivates us to revert to behavior that might not be good for us. How guilt leads to shame. Guilt for having more access to resources and opportunities than our parents or our family abroad. Guilt for being too American. Guilt for not being American enough. Guilt for not being enough of whatever our cultural identity is. Guilt for setting boundaries. Guilt for not setting boundaries. Guilt for picking the partner that we want to have. Guilt for choosing a different career path. Guilt is the biggest thing I hear and see. How do you advise people to work through that guilt? Remember that guilt is an emotion like any other emotion. So many of us will feel guilt and all of a sudden be like, \u201cI\u2019m doing something wrong. This is too uncomfortable. I need to stop doing the thing I\u2019m doing.\u201d In reality, guilt is just a yellow light. It\u2019s a slow down sign. Guilt tells us we crossed a moral boundary. It\u2019s very important to interrogate that. Is the guilt telling me that I hurt someone else? Is the guilt telling me I need to repair a relationship or repair something that I did that was wrong? Oftentimes, the answer for children of immigrants is: Probably not. But what\u2019s happening is that they are mistaking disappointing someone else for guilt that they are doing something wrong. If you come from two different cultures with different values, you\u2019re going to feel guilt because you\u2019re being fed conflicting definitions of what is good and what is right. Do you feel guilt because your parents are subscribing to a different set of values that don\u2019t align with yours? By choosing a different career, by choosing not to have kids or whatever, do you feel like you\u2019re doing something wrong because they don\u2019t believe in that? Or are you actually crossing your own values? Really getting clear on your values and how it differs or overlaps with people you care about is important. Just because you feel bad doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something bad, and I think it\u2019s really important for people to discern between those two experiences. My biggest piece of advice is to really interrogate (the guilt) and to get clear on your values and whose values you\u2019re crossing when you feel guilt. Then question whether you should change your behavior or if you need to learn to sit in the discomfort. How do we work through these conflicts if our parents don\u2019t have the same language and emotional capacity to deal with them? I often hear, \u201cI\u2019m not the one who needs therapy. They need therapy.\u201d Maybe they do, and maybe they\u2019re not willing to take accountability. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have agency over things that you can do differently. If I were to learn, go to therapy and unpack more about how my relationship with my mom affects me, I might then start to learn tools to manage my emotions when I\u2019m with my mom. Which means that when I\u2019m with my mom, I might get less defensive, which means that our relationship dynamic automatically changes. It\u2019s important for people to realize that doing the work is never about changing other people, but it\u2019s about changing the way you show up. (It\u2019s about learning to) manage your expectations, decide what you are and aren\u2019t willing to tolerate and how you can show up in that space within the relationship. What\u2019s your advice for immigrant parents who want to understand their children better? Curiosity, connection and compassion are key. Parent or not, it\u2019s so easy to make assumptions about what someone else is feeling or thinking. It\u2019s so easy to fill in the gaps in the story ourselves or to reinforce a story about someone else rather than actually ask or get more information. It\u2019s really difficult to show up vulnerably in a relationship and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m learning too. I don\u2019t know, but I want to hear more about what it\u2019s like for you.\u201d If (the children) are really young and you\u2019re still trying to figure out how to help raise them, then really embrace their bicultural identity. A strong and integrated bicultural identity is a protective factor against mental health issues. As a parent, you can embrace that. It doesn\u2019t mean that you are allowing your kid to fully assimilate and forget where they come from, because I know that\u2019s a very big fear. I didn\u2019t have this language growing up, but it\u2019s very obvious to me now that my parents were scared. They were scared immigrants. They moved to a new country. They did the best they could. I loved them dearly, and because they were scared, all they did was want to retain a sense of control. So they tried to keep their kids close. They tried to make decisions for their kids. They tried to control how their kids acted or what choices they made. For a long time, that created a chasm between me and my parents. It was only in my late 20s that I was able to fill that chasm with them and build a new relationship. To any parent, I would really encourage them to self-interrogate how they\u2019re showing up and how their fears might be determining how they have a relationship with their kids or don\u2019t have a relationship with their kids.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/health/but-what-will-people-say-book-sahaj-kohli-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness", "text": "Eating a vegan, vegetarian or lacto-ovo vegetarian diet significantly reduces the overall risk of developing cancer, heart disease and dying early from cardiovascular disease, according to a new \u201cumbrella\u201d analysis of more than 20 years of research. An umbrella review looks at existing metanalyses of large numbers of studies, providing a high-level view of existing research on a topic. In addition to lowering cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, the umbrella analysis found a \u201cprotective effect\u201d for specific cancers, including \u201cliver, colon, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, melanoma, kidney and non-Hodgkin lymphoma,\u201d said lead author Dr. Angelo Capodici, a graduate student in health science, technology and management at Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna in Pisa, Italy. Vegetarians don\u2019t eat any animal flesh, while the lacto-ovo version of vegetarianism allows dairy products and eggs while excluding all meat, poultry and fish. Veganism, the stricter form of vegetarianism, bans any food products made from meat, poultry and seafood as well as any animal by-products such as gelatin. However, the protective nature of the diets could be sabotaged if poor dietary choices were made, the study authors said via email. \u201cDiets that emphasize consumption of unhealthy plant foods, such as fruit juices, refined grains, potato chips, and even sodas\u201d might counter the positives of a plant-based diet for health, said study coauthor Dr. Federica Guaraldi, medical director of the pituitary unit at the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna in Italy. Fruit juices, which are \u201cfull of sugars or sweetener,\u201d Guaraldi said, \u201c(were) recently demonstrated to have detrimental impact on metabolism as much as or even more than white sugar.\u201d Results may be affected by other lifestyle factors Researchers have long known that people who follow plant-based diets often live healthier lives full of exercise and an avoidance of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains, snacks, alcohol and tobacco, the study said. \u201cWhat is attributed to diet here may be in part due to other lifestyle practices,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThat is a minor concern, however,\u201d Katz said in an email. \u201cThe net effect of plant-predominant dietary patterns is clearly favorable to crucial health outcomes even if some of the observed benefit is attributable to other lifestyle practices.\u201d In fact, adopting a plant-based diet, even without additional exercise, could still yield health benefits, according to a November study on twins by Christopher Gardner, one of the coauthors of the umbrella analysis published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. In the 2023 study, healthy twins who ate a vegan diet for eight weeks had lower \u201cbad\u201d\u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, better\u00a0blood sugar levels and\u00a0greater weight loss\u00a0than siblings who ate a diet of meat and vegetables, according to Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in Palo Alto, California. \u201cThere was a 10% to 15% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 25% drop in insulin, and a 3% drop in body weight in just eight weeks, all by eating real food without animal products,\u201d Gardner told CNN at the time. One reason for that may be the nutritional boost that plants provide, including high levels of vitamins, minerals and other substances with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, while also reducing the inflammatory impact of meat and processed food, the authors said. \u201cPlants have more fiber (animal foods have zero), less saturated fat and zero cholesterol (all animal foods have cholesterol),\u201d Gardner said in an email. \u201cAn entirely separate category is phytochemicals (literally, \u2018plant chemicals\u2019) such as antioxidants. By definition there are no phytochemicals in animal foods.\u201d No meat, poultry or seafood, but dairy and eggs are OK The new review analyzed 48 metanalyses that had investigated the impact of eating a vegetarian or vegan diet on the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease and early death. \u201cWe analyzed reviews considering\u00a0vegan and vegetarian diets that completely exclude(ed) meat, poultry and seafood,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Davide Gori, an associate professor of biomedical and neuromotor sciences at the University of Bologna in Italy. \u201cTo be more precise regarding vegetarian diets, lacto-vegetarian (allowing certain dairy products such as yogurt, cheese and milk), ovo-vegetarian (allowing whole eggs, egg whites and egg-containing foods such as mayonnaise, egg noodles and certain baked goods), (and) lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets were included,\u201d Gori said in an email. However, vegetarian diets limiting but not completely excluding certain types of meat and fish, such as pesco- or pollo-vegetarian diets, were excluded, he said. The review found eating these plant-based diets reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and inflammation by affecting risk factors such as body mass index, fasting glucose and other measures of blood sugar control, and the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) measurements of blood pressure. The diets also significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and \u201cC-reactive protein \u2014 an index of inflammation that is typically higher in cardiovascular and metabolic disease,\u201d Gori said. Metabolic disease is a constellation of symptoms such as obesity, high blood pressure and poor control of cholesterol and blood sugars that can all lead to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. However, there was no benefit in eating plants for pregnant women, an \u201cintriguing finding\u201d that needs further research, said Guaraldi of the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences. It\u2019s also possible that the hormones of pregnancy might affect findings, and \u201cwe cannot rule out that participants have taken supplements during the study period that could have altered the impact of diet on the considered parameters.\u201d Special considerations of plant-based diets Because certain vitamin and minerals are more easily found and absorbed from meat, dairy or fish, vegetarians and vegans must take extra precautions to add those into their diets, experts say. Unless the diet is carefully optimized, additional sources of B12, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin D may be needed to avoid a deficiency, according to the Mayo Clinic. \u201cStrictly vegan diets can be deficient in vitamin B12,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThis is easily resolved by consuming foods fortified with (vitamin) B12 \u2014 easy to do because the recommended daily allowance for B12 is lower than any other vitamin or mineral. \u201cIron is another nutrient that is harder to get from a fully vegan diet,\u201d Gardner added. \u201cMany plant foods are relatively high in iron (beans/legumes). Again, supplements can be helpful.\u201d Protein is also a challenge, but good sources in plants include legumes such as lentils, chickpeas and beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains and soy products such as edamame, tempeh and tofu. Processed meat substitutes are options as well, experts say, but due to the processing can be packed with sodium, so read labels carefully.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_world_boeing-starliner-delay-helium-leak-scn", "text": "The world will have to wait at least another week before the highly anticipated first crewed mission of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft. The launch was expected on May 17 after a previous delay, but teams found a small helium leak in the service module of the spacecraft, according to a release from Boeing. Starliner teams traced the leak to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. \u201cThe teams now are targeting a launch date of no earlier than 4:43 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 21, to complete additional testing,\u201d the release said. This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. Both Boeing and NASA are developing tests and solutions for the leak, the release said. Boeing plans to bring the propulsion system to the flight pressurization it would reach just before launch and then allow the helium system to naturally vent. A review of the data from a May 6 launch attempt has not shown any other issues, Boeing said. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, have been in preflight quarantine but returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families during the operations preflight, Boeing said. Williams and Wilmore will fly back to NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the coming days, according to the release. Boeing aims to make history The occasion is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and would join in NASA\u2019s push to collaborate with private industry partners, expanding US options for ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to join on such a mission. A slowed start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. The launch was scheduled for May 6, with Williams and Wilmore already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the new issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket is causing further delay. If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit and begin firing its own engines. The Starliner will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week aboard the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The two will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/world/boeing-starliner-delay-helium-leak-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_health_genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Even if your genetics put you at greater risk for early death, a healthy lifestyle could help you significantly combat it, according to a new study. That risk could be mitigated by about 62% in people with a genetic predisposition, said lead author Dr. Xifeng Wu, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejiang Univeristy School of Medicine in China. Many studies have shown the connection between a healthy lifestyle and longevity and others have underscored the genetic component in lifespan, but the report published Monday in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine explored how the two come together. With data from more than 350,000 people and information on their genetics, education, socioeconomic status and disease history, this study had strong methodology, said Dr. Aladdin Shadyab, associate professor of public health and medicine at University of California San Diego. He was not involved in the research. The sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added. The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan. Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed. And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Wu, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University. Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed. \u201cAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,\u201d Wu said. The factors that made a difference The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan. But researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death. \u201cThe study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors \u2014 no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet \u2014 that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,\u201d Wu said. Adequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults. Moderate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Making lifestyle changes Building a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there. There are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking. A CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Committing to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of \u201cMindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,\u201d said in a previous CNN article. For a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly. When it comes to catching enough z\u2019s, if you can\u2019t seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you can\u2019t sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics. And if you\u2019ve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_health_wegovy-trial-analysis", "text": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use. The analyses \u2013 of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss \u2013 also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used \u2013 and covered by insurers. \u201cThe implications are profound,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. \u201cWe have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.\u201d More than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans. One important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely \u2013 and how long \u2013 they\u2019ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years. Researchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways: Weight loss continued for more than a year The analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau. A previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events. It was sustained for up to four years The results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years. Patients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight. However, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did \u2013 almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug. Results vary for everyone In the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines. No safety surprises out to four years Overall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased. The researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn\u2019t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug\u2019s prescribing information because they\u2019d been seen previously in trials. Benefits beyond weight loss A key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play. That\u2019s because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didn\u2019t lose weight. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefit\u201d with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the new analyses. \u201cThat\u2019s because that\u2019s what GLP-1 does: It\u2019s cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you don\u2019t require weight loss \u2013 it\u2019s not the whole story.\u201d An analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight. \u201cThis suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,\u201d or body fat, the researchers concluded. A separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said. \u201cThese two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.\u201d A benefit from reducing inflammation Drucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,\u201d he said. But based on his lab\u2019s research, he said, \u201cone of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.\u201d Drucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis \u2013 driven by inflammation \u2013 who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive. The results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who don\u2019t have obesity or aren\u2019t overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event \u2013 another thing that would need to be studied. And, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely. \u201cWe probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are going to be helpful in terms of actually improving\u00a0health\u00a0and saving lives and saving\u00a0health\u00a0care dollars in people with obesity and heart disease even without much weight loss,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes and\u00a0death.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/health/wegovy-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_baby-food-heavy-metals-legislation-wellness", "text": "US lawmakers have introduced a bill that aims to limit the amount of heavy metals found in baby food through stronger regulation and enforcement by the US Food and Drug Administration. Heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury can be toxic to everyone, but exposure is especially dangerous for babies and toddlers. The neurotoxins can permanently damage developing brains, potentially causing long-term intellectual and behavioral problems. Multiple reports in recent years have detailed concerning levels of these contaminants in foods manufactured for babies and toddlers. A 2019 report from the advocacy group Healthy Babies Bright Futures said that 95% of baby foods from major manufacturers contained lead and a quarter of the foods contained all four heavy metals. And in 2021, an investigation by the House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy found levels of heavy metals in baby food that were far above the limits set for bottled water. Still, the FDA has set limits for heavy metals in only two baby foods: infant rice cereal and juice. And the standard set for rice cereal in 2020 \u2013\u00a0limiting inorganic arsenic to 100 parts per billion \u2013 was 10 times higher than the standard set for bottled water. The federal agency released draft guidance that would limit the amount of lead allowable in many popular baby foods early last year but hasn\u2019t formally set any additional limits. The Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, introduced on Thursday, would direct the FDA to develop maximum allowable limits for toxic heavy metals found in baby food more broadly. It would set standards for testing of the final food products and allow the FDA to monitor these standards through access to the records of food suppliers and manufacturers. It would also bolster the FDA\u2019s authority to enforce the limits it sets, allowing the agency to mandate that companies recall food products that don\u2019t meet standards, as opposed to the voluntary recalls that have been the standard. \u201cParents want what\u2019s best for their children, and they deserve peace of mind knowing the food they purchase for their babies and toddlers is safe,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said in a statement about the bill she is leading.\u00a0\u201cThis legislation will boost food safety standards and require more complete testing by manufacturers to prevent heavy metals from poisoning our kids.\u201d At a Senate subcommittee hearing Wednesday, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf asked Congress for more authority to oversee food manufacturers using a model that\u2019s similar to how it oversees drug manufacturers \u2013 a request that aligns closely with the newly proposed legislation. \u201cIn most of our regulatory paradigms, the first line of defense is the industry that we regulate,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cLike in the production of medications, we don\u2019t test every lot of medications, but the company that manufactures the drug is required to do it, and they have the records available for us to look at. And we\u2019d like to see the same thing happen not only with infant formula but also with regard to all critical foods, particularly for children.\u201d FDA also seeks new authority to require that manufacturers report contamination that they find in critical foods such as infant formula or medical foods and conduct more frequent monitoring of facilities. In 2021, the same group of lawmakers who sponsored the new bill \u2013 Klobuchar and fellow Democrats Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois and Rep. Tony C\u00e1rdenas of California \u2013 introduced similar legislation to reduce toxic heavy metals in baby food, but it didn\u2019t have enough support to move farther. And in December, as hundreds of children across the country were sickened by applesauce pouches that contained elevated levels of lead and chromium, they called on the FDA to use the authority of the agency\u2019s new Human Foods Program to address the issue. \u201cAll food manufacturers have a responsibility by law to meaningfully minimize or prevent chemical hazards, including through preventive controls to reduce or eliminate the presence of lead in their products,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Califf. \u201cIn light of recent harm caused by certain cinnamon applesauce and fruit puree products, it is clear that the agency must prioritize the work on heavy metal action levels.\u201d The primary way that toxic metals get into the foods we eat is through the soil that the foods are grown in, experts say. \u201cWhen you grow a plant, whether it\u2019s a sweet potato or rice, the plant will take up the metals through its roots into the plant. That\u2019s the bad news,\u201d said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental and consumer advocacy organization. \u201cThe good news is that it is easy to avoid toxic metals by choosing where you plant.\u201d And setting limits works, he said. Arsenic levels in infant cereal were cut in half after the FDA issued recommended limits, according to an analysis of data from the agency\u2019s Total Diet Study. In 2021,\u00a0the FDA launched its\u00a0Closer to Zero\u00a0Initiative, a long-term strategy to reduce childhood exposure to lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury in foods. The initiative aims to keep dietary exposure to environmental contaminants to as low as possible, while maintaining access to nutritious foods. But the need for more substantial regulation is urgent, advocates say. \u201cGovernment actions to protect babies from the toxic heavy metals in their food are long overdue.\u00a0Every day that passes, nearly 10,000 more babies in the U.S. begin eating solid food. The FDA must take swift action to protect the next generation of children,\u201d Paige Whipple Glidden, communications director for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, said in an email. \u201cHeavy metal contamination spans all the food aisles of the grocery store, and FDA\u2019s safety standards should as well.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/baby-food-heavy-metals-legislation-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_world_beethoven-science-newsletter-wt-scn", "text": "Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy\u201d is one of the first songs I learned to play on the violin. I\u2019ll never forget the elation I felt playing the iconic fourth movement of his Ninth Symphony alongside my fellow orchestra members, each note joining in a celebration of togetherness. But every ebullient music moment has a flip side, and Beethoven also poured his feelings of despair into his final symphony. Beethoven began experiencing hearing loss in his 20s and became deaf in his 30s \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop him from composing some of his greatest and most enduring pieces. It was the classical composer\u2019s wish that his health issues would be understood and conveyed to the public. While his doctor\u2019s notes were lost to time, scientists\u00a0sequenced Beethoven\u2019s genome from locks of his hair\u00a0last year. Now, researchers are one step closer to understanding the troubled genius\u2019 mysterious ailments. Explorations A new analysis of Beethoven\u2019s hair has shown the composer experienced lead poisoning toward the end of his life. He died at age 56 in 1827. Tests revealed incredibly elevated levels of lead, as well as arsenic and mercury, in two of his locks, likely from drinking wine that was sweetened with lead. Researchers don\u2019t believe lead poisoning would have been enough to kill him, but it could have contributed to the composer\u2019s well-known gastrointestinal issues and deafness. Unlocking the factors that led to Beethoven\u2019s death due to kidney and liver diseases could also shed light on how the composer transformed his pain into music. \u201cPeople say, \u2018The music is the music, why do we need to know about any of this stuff?\u2019 But in Beethoven\u2019s life, there is a connection between his suffering and the music,\u201d said William Meredith, a Beethoven scholar. Solar update Dazzling auroras could appear in the skies over locations as far south as Alabama this weekend due to a rare spike in solar activity. Scientists at the Space Weather Prediction Center have observed multiple flares and coronal mass ejections. The large clouds of ionized gas, called plasma, and dynamic magnetic fields are erupting from a cluster of sunspots that measures 16 times the diameter of Earth. The forecasted solar storm has the potential to disrupt the power grid and communications on Earth, but experts agree that there is no need for people to take extraordinary measures to prepare for space weather. However, you may want to take photos of the sky with your phone, as your camera may capture the dancing lights of the aurora borealis. We are family Millions of years ago, lava flows on Earth created a network of vast subterranean tunnels called lava tubes, providing a perfect place for our Neolithic ancestors to beat the heat. During the Stone Age, as early as 7,000 years ago, the tunnels sheltered herders and their livestock from the relentless heat and wind of the Arabian Peninsula. Researchers in Saudi Arabia uncovered carvings of images showcasing\u00a0stick-figure humans alongside animals such as dogs and sheep\u00a0on the walls at Umm Jirsan. Artifacts have helped archaeologists piece together the story of the people who sought refuge in the lava tubes as well as how they adapted to such arid environments. Once upon a planet Strange creatures began appearing on Earth more than 500 million years ago \u2014 and scientists now think it\u2019s because Earth\u2019s protective magnetic field nearly collapsed. The first life-forms were single-celled, microscopic organisms. But 591 million years ago, Earth\u2019s magnetic field weakened drastically, potentially allowing for an increase in oxygen in the atmosphere. After this event, animals with\u00a0strikingly odd fan, doughnut and tube shapes\u00a0appeared in the fossil record, representing the first complex animals on the planet. Consequences A rare event is transforming the Great Barrier Reef, as well as reef systems around the world, into\u00a0silent marine graveyards. It\u2019s the fourth mass coral bleaching event, driven by rising ocean temperatures amid the climate crisis, since the late 1990s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Marine heat waves stress corals, causing them to expel algae and drain their colors, and the die-off is occurring at unprecedented levels, experts say. \u201cWhat is happening now in our oceans is like wildfires underwater,\u201d said Kate Quigley, principal research scientist at Australia\u2019s Minderoo Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much warming that we\u2019re going to get to a tipping point, and we won\u2019t be able to come back from that.\u201d Discoveries Take your time exploring these new findings: \u2014 When being attacked by predators, a dice snake fakes its own death as a protective measure \u2014 and it uses\u00a0gory special effects to pull off a convincing theatrical display. \u2014 The Dark Energy Camera captured a dramatic image of the cosmic feature\u00a0\u201cGod\u2019s Hand\u201d that appears to reach for a defenseless galaxy\u00a0\u2014 but it\u2019s really a rarely seen celestial phenomenon. \u2014 The first historic crewed flight test of Boeing\u2019s Starling spacecraft has been rescheduled to no earlier than May 17 after a faulty valve halted a launch attempt on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/world/beethoven-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_health_breast-cancer-screening-mammogram-guidelines-wellness", "text": "An influential group of medical experts, the US Preventive Services Task Force,\u00a0recommended last week\u00a0that most women receive a mammogram starting at age 40. Women should continue\u00a0to\u00a0get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer until age 74, the task force said. This is a marked difference from the task force\u2019s previous guidance, which was to start biennial mammograms\u00a0by\u00a0age 50. Women in their 40s were counseled to make individual decisions together with their health\u00a0care\u00a0provider, but there was no explicit recommendation for them to start until they turned 50. I wanted to learn more about why these changes were made. Who should follow this updated guidance, and are there women who need to receive screening even earlier or more often? What other tests besides\u00a0a mammogram may be needed? And are there preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0How common is breast cancer? Dr. Leana Wen:\u00a0In the United States, breast cancer is\u00a0the second most common cancer\u00a0in women, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death\u00a0in women. According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetimes. About\u00a042,000 women\u00a0die every year from this cancer. It\u2019s crucial that women know their risk factors and receive screening accordingly. Screening, by definition, is done before there are any symptoms. Screening can help detect cancers at an early stage, before it has spread, when there is the best chance for successful treatment. CNN: Why did the US Preventive Task Force make these changes? Wen:\u00a0In recent years, there has been a\u00a0disturbing trend\u00a0of cancer diagnoses increasing among young people. This is the case with colon cancer as well as with breast cancer. In fact, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages\u00a020 to 49. Younger women tend to have more aggressive cancers upon diagnosis compared to older women. This is especially true for Black women. the rate of deaths from breast cancer among Black women in their 40s was 27 per 100,000 person-years, compared to 15 per 100,000 person-years among White women, according to a 2023\u00a0JAMA Network Open\u00a0study. According to a study in the journal\u00a0Lancet Oncology, the mortality from breast cancer could be lowered by starting mammograms earlier, at age 40. The\u00a0US Preventive Task Force\u2019s change\u00a0now makes its recommendations closer to those of other major national organizations. The\u00a0American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for instance, recommends screening every one or two years starting at age 40 and continuing until at least age 75. The\u00a0American Cancer Society\u00a0gives women ages 40 to 44 the option to receive a mammogram every year and recommends those 44 and 55 to get them annually. (Those over 55 can switch to every other year or can continue annual mammograms.) CNN: Who should follow this updated guidance?\u00a0\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0I would encourage woman to be aware of this updated guidance and discuss it with their physicians. The key is that this guidance is for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those at average risk should begin mammograms by age 40. This guidance does not apply to people with higher risk. Everyone needs to evaluate their own risk to see if they may be at elevated risk; if so, they may need additional tests and at greater frequency than these recommendations. The updated guidance also applies to all people assigned female at birth, which includes not only cisgender women but also transgender men and nonbinary people. These individuals should also have discussions with their health\u00a0care providers to evaluate their risk factors and therefore how frequently they should receive screenings. CNN: How should people determine if they need screenings more often or earlier in their lives? Wen:\u00a0The most important factor is personal or family history of breast cancer. If someone had breast cancer themselves, they need to consult their oncologist or primary care provider to figure out what testing they need and at what frequency to monitor for cancer recurrence. The same goes for individuals who had prior radiation to the chest from other cancers. Family history is also a key determinant of risk. A woman who has a sister, mother or other first-degree relative with breast cancer has double the average risk\u00a0of breast cancer. A woman who has two first-degree relatives has five times the risk of developing breast cancer. CNN: What should women expect at their first mammogram? Wen:\u00a0A mammogram is an x-ray of the breasts. Generally, what happens is that a technician will lead to you to a room where you take off your bra and shirt, wipe off deodorant from your armpit area that could interfere with results and change into a gown that will cover you from the waist up (you don\u2019t need to remove your underwear, pants, or shoes). You are then led to a mammogram machine. The technician will position you so that the machine can best capture images of your breasts. The part of the mammogram that may cause some discomfort is when the technician positions your breasts between two plastic imaging plates that apply pressure while the images are being taken. However, the discomfort is generally over within seconds. Those who are concerned about potential discomfort could consider taking Tylenol or ibuprofen an hour before the mammogram. CNN: What other tests besides mammograms may be needed? Wen:\u00a0Someone who has a family history of breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing. They and others at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer may need to start mammograms at an earlier age or may need them at more frequent intervals. Other tests may be used along with the mammogram. These include breast ultrasound, breast MRI, or both. I want to mention that there are experts who advocate for additional testing to be done in women who have average risk but have dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the screening test of choice in these women, but there are instances where they need additional imaging to better look for possible masses. The\u00a0American College of Radiology, for example, recommends a breast MRI in some women at intermediate risk but who have dense breast tissue. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not make this recommendation, which has implications for insurance coverage for imaging. Someone very concerned about breast cancer risk should be sure to discuss this situation with their physician, who can help decide what is best for them based on personal and family medical history and whether it is the worth additional cost they may incur. CNN: What about women over 74? Why are they supposed to stop screening for breast cancer? Wen:\u00a0The US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mammography in women 75 years or older. However, other major medical societies have continued to recommend mammography in people 75 or above, especially if they are in generally good health and have long life expectancies. This, once again, is an issue to be discussed with one\u2019s individual provider, who can take into consideration other aspects of health and the patient\u2019s wishes. CNN: Are there steps younger people can do to reduce their cancer risk? Wen:\u00a0Risk factors for developing breast cancer include smoking and heavy alcohol use, so quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption will help to reduce risk. Studies have shown that\u00a0exercise\u00a0can lower cancer risk in general, as well as eating more whole foods and less\u00a0ultraprocessed\u00a0substances. Women should also seek care if they develop\u00a0any concerning symptoms, such as a new mass or lump in the breast or armpit, redness or flaky skin on the breast, nipple discharge other than breast milk, or pain or swelling anywhere in the breast.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/breast-cancer-screening-mammogram-guidelines-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_cervical-cancer-self-collection", "text": "Instead of a traditional speculum-involved pelvic exam to screen for cervical cancer, the US Food and Drug Administration has given the go-ahead for patients to have the option to collect their own vaginal samples for screening in a health care setting, such as at their doctor\u2019s office, an urgent care or even a mobile clinic. Two health care businesses \u2013 biotechnology company Roche and medical technology firm Becton, Dickson and Company or BD \u2013 announced Wednesday that the FDA approved the use of self-collected samples with their respective HPV tests. Most\u00a0cervical cancers\u00a0are caused by human papillomavirus or HPV, and screening for HPV can help identify women who may be at risk of developing cervical cancer. \u201cAlmost all cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with certain types of HPV,\u201d Dr. Karen E. Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cSelf-collection can expand access to screening and reduces barriers, which will give more people the opportunity to detect, treat, and ultimately survive cancer.\u201d Typically, gynecologists collect samples for HPV testing, a cervical cytology or both. Cervical cytology, also known as a Pap test or Pap smear, involves examining cervical cells for changes to find precancerous or cancerous cells. The\u00a0US Preventive Services Task Force recommends\u00a0screening for cervical cancer with cervical cytology every three years for women ages 21 to 29. For women ages 30 to 65, the USPSTF recommends screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV testing alone, or every five years with high-risk HPV testing in combination with cytology. But for some patients, having a provider collect a sample for those tests can be painful or awkward. \u201cMany patients are uncomfortable with the intimate nature of a pelvic exam,\u201d Dr.\u00a0Jeff Andrews, a board-certified gynecologist and vice president of global medical affairs for diagnostic solutions at BD, said in the company\u2019s announcement Wednesday. \u201cAlso, many people live in areas without a local doctor or clinician trained to obtain a sample with a speculum,\u201d he said. \u201cThe option to self-collect in a clinical setting can help women overcome some of these barriers.\u201d The BD Onclarity HPV Assay is now FDA-approved for HPV testing on self-collected samples without the need for a traditional Pap test, according to the company\u2019s announcement Wednesday. A trial on self-collection for HPV testing, which BD is participating in with the National Cancer Institute, is expected to begin enrolling this summer, the company said, to evaluate accuracy of self-collection for HPV testing in health care and other settings, including at home. Roche announced that HPV self-collection is approved for use with the company\u2019s cobas HPV test, and the company has also collaborated with the National Cancer Institute. Each year in the United States, more than 11,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and about 4,000 women die of the disease, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s estimated that about half of invasive cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in people who have never been screened and about 10% of diagnoses are in people who have not had a Pap test in the five years prior. \u201cDespite the benefits of cervical cancer screening, not all women and people with a cervix get screened regularly,\u201d Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cMost cervical cancers are found in people who have never had a cervical cancer screening test or who have not had one recently. That\u2019s why adding self-collection in a health-care center as a screening method for this potentially deadly disease can make a huge impact,\u201d he added. \u201cWe anticipate self-collection in a health-care setting will play an increasingly prominent role in cervical cancer screening once regulatory and clinical prerequisites are in place and as supporting evidence continues to accumulate.\u201d Next, the FDA could consider greenlighting the self-collection method at home instead of just in a health care setting. Teal Health has developed a home cervical cancer screening device called the Teal Wand that was granted \u201cbreakthrough device\u201d status this month by the FDA, which would allow the agency to review the device on a faster timeline. \u201cFDA\u2019s recognition of the Teal Wand as a Breakthrough device acknowledges the important public health benefit that self-collection for cervical cancer screening can have on those who are rarely screened or who do not participate in clinician-based screening for cervical cancer,\u201d Trena Depel, vice president of clinical and regulatory at Teal Health, said in a news release at the time. Screening for cervical cancer remains important because early cases often may not have signs or symptoms. Advanced cases may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge. Cervical cancer is treated in many ways, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Some of the most important steps women can take to help\u00a0prevent cervical cancer, according to the CDC, are to get vaccinated against HPV, not smoke, use condoms during sex, have regular screening tests and go back to see the doctor if their screening test results are not normal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/cervical-cancer-self-collection/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_health_ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness", "text": "Eating ultraprocessed foods is associated with an early risk of death, according to a 30-year study \u2014 but different foods have different impacts. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. Processed meats and sugary foods and drinks aren\u2019t correlated with the same risks as ultraprocessed whole grains, for example, said lead study author Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. The study analyzed data from more than 100,000 health professionals in the United States with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. From 1986 to 2018, the participants provided information on their health and lifestyle habits every two years. Every four years, they completed a detailed food questionnaire. The group eating the least ultraprocessed food ate about three servings a day on average, while the highest averaged seven servings a day, according to the study published Wednesday in The BMJ journal. Those who ate the most had a 4% higher risk of deaths by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths, the data showed. Song described the correlation as \u201cmoderate,\u201d noting that the connection was not equally strong among all kinds of ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThe positive association is mainly driven by a few subgroups including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d he said. Findings in this study were consistent with hundreds of others in the field, but what makes this one unique is its parsing out of different subgroups within the ultraprocessed food category, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. Do we need to get rid of all ultraprocessed foods? Song wouldn\u2019t necessarily advise a complete rejection of all ultraprocessed foods because it is a diverse category, he said. \u201cCereals, whole grain breads, for example, they are also considered ultraprocessed food, but they contain various beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, I do think people should try to avoid or limit the consumption of certain ultraprocessed foods, such as processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and also potentially artificially sweetened beverages.\u201d There are also more questions that need to be answered when it comes to ultraprocessed foods. First, the recent study is strong because of the length of time covered\ufeff, but it is an observational study. That means that while researchers can observe a correlation, they can\u2019t say that the foods were the cause of the deaths, said Dr. Peter Wilde, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in the United Kingdom. Researchers also need to look more at the components of ultraprocessed foods that might be affecting health \u2014 whether they be food additives, emulsifiers or flavors \u2014 to advise governments and institutions on how to regulate foods, Song said. Overall diet matters most Researchers also found that the most important factor to reducing risk of death is the quality of a person\u2019s overall diet, Song said. \u201cIf people maintain a generally healthy diet, I don\u2019t think they need to be like scared or be freaked out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall dietary pattern is still the predominant factor determining the health outcomes.\u201d A healthy diet is varied, with as many colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains as possible, Wilde said. \u201cIf you are worried about food additives, then choose foods that have low levels of additives,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cJust be mindful of the nutritional content of (the ultraprocessed foods) that you do choose to consume.\u201d It is also important to recognize that foods need to be eaten in balance. Fruit juice contains beneficial vitamins, minerals and antioxidants when consumed in moderation, but too much will have high levels of sugar that may override their benefits, Wilde said. \u201cThis is not black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cA particular food is not either good or bad, it will contain elements of both, and the balance between the two may depend on how much you eat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_04_15_world_cicada-fungus-zombie-scn", "text": "This spring, billions of cicadas will emerge after more than a decade underground, ready to climb into the trees and make a ruckus as they sing to attract mates. But some of these insects won\u2019t succeed in their goal of procreating \u2014 instead, they\u2019ll be controlled like zombies into spreading a strange fungus that hijacks cicadas\u2019 bodies and behavior. The details of the fungus\u2019 attack on the bugs \u2014 destroying the insects\u2019 genitals, replacing their abdomens with a cavity full of fungal spores, manipulating the bugs into hypersexual behavior to spread the fungus further and transforming the cicadas into what some scientists term \u201csaltshakers of death\u201d \u2014 may seem like they belong in a creature feature horror movie. But when it comes to the fungus Massospora cicadina, said Dr. John Cooley, an associate professor in residence of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut, Hartford, \u201cthe truth is actually much stranger than science fiction.\u201d Periodical cicadas lay their eggs in tree branches, and when those eggs hatch, the resulting baby cicadas, or nymphs, drop to the ground and burrow into the soil. Depending on their species, they spend 13 or 17 years underground, drinking sap from tree roots, until it\u2019s time for the nearly grown cicadas to emerge. At some point, the insects are exposed to spores of the fungus Massospora cicadina. It\u2019s not clear to scientists whether it happens when the cicadas enter the soil or when they leave it, or how that exposure happens. How Massospora cicadina controls cicadas The spores make their way into the cicadas\u2019 bodies, and from that point on, the cicadas are at the mercy of the fungal parasite. A mass of fungal spores builds up in the abdomen of each infected cicada. Eventually, the back end of the cicada \u2014 including its genitals \u2014 falls off. In its place, a white fungal plug is exposed, \u201ca clump of spores that are erupting out of where the genitals and abdomen once were,\u201d said Dr. Matt Kasson, an associate professor of mycology and forest pathology at West Virginia University. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s a gumdrop that\u2019s been dropped in chalk dust, glued to the backside of these cicadas.\u201d Despite having a chalky gumdrop of spores instead of genitals, the infected cicadas still attempt to mate, with gusto. The fungus manipulates the cicadas\u2019 behavior, causing what researchers including Kasson refer to as hypersexualization. The infected males keep trying to mate with females, and they also change their behavior to attract their fellow males. Healthy female cicadas will flick their wings to indicate that they\u2019re ready to mate. Both male and female cicadas infected with Massospora flick their wings to draw in amorous, soon-to-be-infected males. But attempting to mate is just one part of how infected cicadas spread the fungus. \u201cPeriodical cicadas have interlocking genitalia. So when they pull apart, guess what happens? Rip. And then there\u2019s a cicada walking around with someone else\u2019s genitals stuck to them,\u201d Cooley said. \u201cAnd now the cicada that\u2019s infected is busted open.\u201d Once the chalky fungal plug is ripped apart, the infected and disemboweled cicada flies around, raining down fluffy, brown spores. \u201cWe call them the saltshakers of death,\u201d Kasson said. The spores dispersed by these flying saltshakers go on to infect the next generation of cicadas that will emerge more than a decade later and begin the cycle again. Zombie cicadas stimulated by an amphetamine? It\u2019s an awful lot of moving around and mating for animals whose bodies have been torn apart. Kasson and his colleagues have found a potential explanation for what keeps these cicadas going. \u201cWe found an amphetamine in those fungal plugs, which provides a plausible explanation as to why the behavioral modification is occurring,\u201d Kasson said. After all, amphetamines are powerful stimulants in humans. Cooley noted that while amphetamines stimulate the central nervous systems of vertebrate animals, insects (which are all invertebrates) such as cicadas have different nervous systems, and it\u2019s not clear if those stimulants would affect them the same way. \u201cWe\u2019re left with this problem, that it\u2019s making a powerful psychoactive chemical, but the powerful psychoactive chemical may not do anything to the insects,\u201d Cooley said. He suggested that the fungus may have a different means of controlling the cicadas\u2019 behavior, and that the amphetamines it produces might instead serve to ward off vertebrate predators of cicadas (and thus, of cicada-dwelling fungi), such as birds. This spring\u2019s periodical cicada emergence is noteworthy because two different broods will emerge simultaneously in neighboring regions \u2014 17-year cicadas concentrated in northern Illinois, and 13-year cicadas throughout much of the Midwest and Southeast. These two broods have not been aboveground at the same time since 1803; however, scientists expect little geographical overlap of the two broods. Kasson said he hopes to study infected insects from the two different broods and see whether there are genetic differences between the M. cicadina infecting the 17-year and 13-year broods. While cicadas are edible, Kasson said people hoping to sample the bugs should be choosy about which ones they eat. If you find adult cicadas near the end of their lives, or already dead, Kasson said, \u201cyou do not want to put those in your mouth,\u201d regardless of whether they\u2019re infected with M. cicadina. If a person, dog or cat were to eat an infected cicada, they wouldn\u2019t be affected by the amphetamines in it \u2014 the dose is too small. And for \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d fans, M. cicadina is only capable of infecting cicadas (and just the 13- and 17-year varieties of these bugs), so humanity is probably safe from zombification. Kasson said that while he understands the trepidation people might have about the upcoming cicada emergence, not to mention the grotesque fungal infection that up to 10% of them might develop, he noted, \u201cIt\u2019s a biological spectacle. And I think we should just appreciate this as one of the natural wonders of the world.\u201d Kate Golembiewski\u00a0is a freelance science writer based in Chicago who\u2019s especially interested in zoology, thermodynamics and death.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/15/world/cicada-fungus-zombie-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_overdose-deaths-decrease-2023", "text": "After a steep rise during the Covid-19 pandemic, preliminary data shows that drug overdose deaths in the United States ticked down in 2023 for the first time in five years. About 107,500 people died from a drug overdose in 2023, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics \u2014 about 3,500 fewer than in 2022. Last year\u2019s decrease is the first since 2018, but the 3% drop is far less substantial than the surges that pushed overdose deaths to record levels in recent years. Overdose deaths\u00a0spiked\u00a030% between 2019 and 2020 and rose another 15% between 2020 and 2021, CDC data shows. Preliminary data is subject to change as death certificates are reviewed and records are assessed, but estimates suggest that, despite the decline, overdose deaths in 2023 were still almost twice as high as they were five years ago, according to the CDC data. \u201cIt is a hopeful trend in some ways,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Keyes, a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health whose research focuses on substance use epidemiology. \u201cWe know that this drug epidemic is dynamic and changes quite quickly, so any time you see a leveling off or a slight decrease, it is promising. It is certainly not a sign that we need to take the foot off the gas of overdose prevention.\u201d The US Department of Health and Human Services launched a coordinated national strategy to prevent overdoses two years ago. \u201cThis progress over the last 12 months should make us want to reinvigorate our efforts knowing that our strategies are making a difference,\u201d CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry\u00a0said in a statement, but \u201cthere are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses at staggering numbers.\u201d \u201cOur thoughts remain with those who have lost loved ones and those who are struggling with addiction or know someone who is.\u00a0Our country is committed to ending this epidemic and preventing unnecessary death and suffering,\u201d she said. Fentanyl has been driving the latest wave of overdose deaths, with synthetic opioids involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths. These highly potent narcotics continue to play an outsized role: they were involved in nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023. However, there were about 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023 than in 2022, the new data shows. Still, the deadly threat of fentanyl \u2014 which is about 50 times more potent than heroin \u2014 remains. In one indicator of its pervasiveness, a study published Monday shows that law enforcement seizures of illicit fentanyl have surged in recent years. More than 115 million pills containing illicit fentanyl were seized by law enforcement in 2023, compared with about 71 million in 2022 and less than 50,000 in 2017. \u201cFentanyl has continued to infiltrate the drug supply in communities across the United States and it is a very dangerous time to use drugs, even just occasionally,\u201d Dr. Nora Volkow, director of National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a statement. She was not directly involved in the new study, but the research was funded by the federal agency. \u201cIllicit pills are made to look identical to real prescription pills, but can actually contain fentanyl. It is urgently important that people know that any pills given to someone by a friend, purchased on social media, or received from any source other than a pharmacy could be potentially deadly \u2014 even after a single ingestion.\u201d The number of deaths due to fentanyl remains \u201calarmingly high,\u201d Keyes said. But the more promising trends reflect significant, multi-pronged efforts from many different sectors, she said, including use of treatments for opioid use disorder, expanded access to naloxone and other harm reduction programs and reducing opioid prescribing. \u201cI think that has been a real success story for public health,\u201d she said. While overdose deaths involving opioids declined, those involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamine increased, according to the preliminary data from the CDC. There were more than 36,000 deaths involving psychostimulants in 2023, a 2% increase from the year before. And deaths involving cocaine rose 5%, to nearly 30,000. About a third of all overdose deaths in 2023 involved psychostimulants, and cocaine was involved in more than a quarter. Much of this increase is likely due to the proliferation of fentanyl throughout the drug supply, Keyes said. \u201cWe know that when stimulants mix with opioids, it\u2019s particularly lethal,\u201d she said. But expanded surveillance can help those who are working to address the overdose crisis understand its rapidly changing epidemiology and adapt their efforts in real-time. Vast disparities in overdose deaths remain, including state-level differences; the latest CDC data shows \u201cnotable\u201d increases in some Western states such as Washington and Oregon, with overdose deaths increasing at least 27% year-over-year. In other states, including Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana and Maine, overdose deaths dropped by at least 15%. \u201cState-to-state differences point to the need for continued expansion of these efforts,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cBut I think the trends you see nationally are indicative of how it can work. We can address the opioid epidemic. This is not inevitable.\u201d For many state and local governments, funds from opioid settlements have been \u201cinstrumental\u201d to overdose prevention efforts and increased access to treatment and recovery support, Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, jurisdictions will continue to prioritize investments in harm reduction, prevention, and addressing the social determinants of health across communities that have been hardest hit by the overdose crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, state and territorial health agencies will continue to coordinate with partners to build a comprehensive response to this complex public health issue. Lastly, jurisdictions will continue to monitor and prepare to respond to changes in overdose rates and emerging threats within the drug supply.\u201d Recent surveys suggest that drug use among teens in the US has been relatively low and trending down. But overdose deaths have been rising in this age group and millions of adults and adolescents have a drug use disorder. \u201cResearch has shown that delaying the start of substance use among young people, even by one year, can decrease substance use for the rest of their lives. We may be seeing this play out in real time,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cThis trend is reassuring. Though, it remains crucial to continue to educate young people about the risks and harms of substance use in an open and honest way, emphasizing that illicit pills and other substances may contain deadly fentanyl.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/overdose-deaths-decrease-2023/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_health_deep-brain-stimulation-ocd-study-wellness", "text": "Five years ago, in a wheelchair, Julia Hum was admitted to a state mental hospital in Massachusetts. After treatment with targeted deep brain stimulation, she hopes to walk out soon and, for the first time in her adult life, live independently, in her own apartment. Hum, 24, has severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, which once caused her to hurt herself and even affected her ability to eat and drink. \u201cMy OCD kind of convinced me food and drinks were contaminated,\u201d Hum said. Her thoughts told her things like that her food had parasites or harmful chemicals. \u201cI was fully aware of how ludicrous these thoughts were, and I desperately wanted to gain weight and eat enough and drink enough and be healthy. But the doubts I had were just so loud,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were screaming, and I couldn\u2019t focus on anything else.\u201d Her heart rate and blood pressure became so erratic, she needed to use a wheelchair to move around.\u00a0Doctors used a tube that led into her stomach through her nose to give her food and gave her fluids intravenously. Now, after treatment, she\u2019s doing much better.\u00a0In August, she got her high-school equivalency diploma and posed for a photo with the certificate with a wide smile on her face. She\u2019s no longer hurting herself, and she can eat and drink normally.\u00a0She says intrusive thoughts are no longer in control. \u201cI feel like my OCD was kind of at the helm of the ship before, and now it\u2019s kind of like a pesky passenger.\u00a0It\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not taking over my life,\u201d Hum said. She and her doctors credit this lifesaving improvement to innovative research that allowed them to more precisely target a dysfunctional circuit with a device called a deep brain stimulator, which acts like a pacemaker for her brain. Deep brain stimulators have been used for two decades for movement disorders like Parkinson\u2019s disease and dystonia. More recently, their uses have been expanded to include mood disorders like depression and other neurological conditions such as Tourette\u2019s syndrome and OCD. The devices have two electrodes that target a pea-size structure deep inside the brain called the subthalamic nucleus. This node, which looks like a contact lens, contains more than half a million nerve cells. It\u2019s a hub for signals passing between the brain\u2019s outer and inner layers.\u00a0It\u2019s like a switchboard, says Dr. Andreas Horn, a neurologist at the Brain Modulation Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. Doctors implant the electrodes close to the subthalamic nucleus and then adjust the settings through a pulse generator that is implanted under the skin of the chest. After waiting about two weeks after surgery to let the body heal, they turn on the electricity and adjust the settings to find something that feels good to the patient. \u201cI\u2019ll suddenly feel lighter, my rituals will slow down, and I\u2019ll sit up straighter and feel more energy,\u201d as an example, Hum said. Refining deep brain stimulation Hum had a deep brain stimulator implanted in 2021. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Darin Dougherty of the Mass General Research Institute, said it didn\u2019t initially give them the results they\u2019d hoped for. \u201cIt was this kind of cycle where we would find settings that felt really good. They would work maybe for a month or two, and then I\u2019d slide backwards again because the initial effects would wear off,\u201d Hum said. Deep brain stimulation can be life-changing, but it doesn\u2019t work equally well for everyone, and researchers say they\u2019re getting closer to understanding why. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, Horn and an international team of researchers took data from more than 530 electrodes implanted in the brains of more than 200 people living with four conditions: Parkinson\u2019s disease, dystonia, Tourette\u2019s syndrome and OCD. They looked at where the devices were stimulating each person\u2019s brain and how much improvement each had.\u00a0Then, they used these records to map the nerve networks that seem to become dysfunctional in each of the four disorders. \u201cThe idea is that by learning from a cohort of patients and contrasting who got better with the ones that unfortunately did not get as much better after treatment, we can pinpoint where the optimal site is and maybe the optimal network to stimulate,\u201d Horn said. The team used their maps to adjust deep brain stimulators for three patients, including Hum. All of them saw substantial improvement in their symptoms. Dr. Sameer Sheth, a professor of neurosurgery at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved in the study, says that the research is encouraging because it uses data from a large number of people but that trying it out in just three people isn\u2019t enough to know whether these brain maps are accurate. \u201cFor the most part, this information has not been tested in the wild in a new set of patients, so that\u2019s what this is setting up,\u201d said Sheth, who also treats people with deep brain stimulation. If the same good results can be repeated in more patients, \u201cthen we should act on it.\u00a0We should implant with this type of profile in mind for this type of patient, let\u2019s say a patient with OCD,\u201d he said. \u2018It gave me my hope back\u2019 Using the maps created by Horn\u2019s team and a special type of magnetic resonance imaging called diffusion imaging, doctors can see the fibers they need to stimulate to have the best chance of getting people well, Dougherty said. Each electrode implanted for the therapy has multiple points of contact that doctors can use to stimulate different brain areas. \u201cWe were then able to see which of those contacts was closest to the fibers that would be most likely to be helpful\u201d for Hum, Dougherty said. They made adjustments to Hum\u2019s settings in August, and she says the difference has been night and day. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to focus,\u201d Hum said. She notices that she can engage in therapy better, and she\u2019s been able to create more distance between her thoughts and her actions. \u201cI was able to more accurately label a thought as OCD and really not me and choose to make the decision not to engage in a ritual,\u201d she said. She can also eat and drink \u201cpretty much everything.\u201d When she got her deep brain stimulator, Hum says, \u201cmy very basic hope was just even to have any sort of life at all, and now it\u2019s much bigger than that.\u201d She wonders if she can go to college, live independently and have a steady job.\u00a0And she wonders about love. \u201cCan I have a solid relationship with maybe a boyfriend and just all the things that I\u2019ve kind of missed out on till this point?\u201d she said. Hum said it\u2019s hard to explain the gratitude she feels to the doctors and researchers who helped her. \u201cHope had really gone. I didn\u2019t see a future for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt kind of re-lit that light and the end of the tunnel. \u201cIt gave me my hope back.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/health/deep-brain-stimulation-ocd-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_preeclampsia-risk-first-trimester-test-wellness", "text": "A new blood test can be performed in a pregnant person\u2019s first trimester to help assess their risk of developing preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening pregnancy complication. It\u2019s the first and only test of its kind available in the United States that can be used between 11 and 14 weeks gestation to determine the risk of preeclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy, its maker, Labcorp, announced Wednesday. The first trimester\u00a0is the period from 0 to 13 weeks of a pregnancy. However, the new test doesn\u2019t change clinical guidance on preeclampsia, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, also known as ACOG. Some doctors question how it will help. \u201cIt is currently unclear how useful the LabCorp test will be in accurately predicting risk for developing preeclampsia and whether it is appropriate for all pregnant patients,\u201d Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOG\u2019s interim CEO and chief of clinical practice and health equity and quality, said in a statement. \u201cBefore a screening test can be successfully employed, there needs to be an evidence-based intervention to either prevent or reduce the impact of the disease. We currently have no data on how to reduce the risk for a pregnant patient predicted to have preeclampsia from a blood test early in pregnancy as opposed to clinical factors,\u201d he added. Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy\u00a0marked by elevated blood pressure and high levels of protein in the urine or other signs of organ damage. The condition typically develops after 20 weeks\u00a0of pregnancy \u2013 in the second trimester \u2013 and if left untreated, it can turn serious or deadly for both mother and baby. There is no cure for preeclampsia, outside of the mother delivering the baby, but some severe cases can be treated with medications like antihypertensive drugs. Some factors that can put a pregnant person at risk of preeclampsia include being older than 35; being pregnant for the first time; having obesity; having a family history of preeclampsia; having diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease or an autoimmune disease; having twins or triplets; or having undergone in vitro fertilization. The new screening test evaluates any patient\u2019s risk of preeclampsia by 34 weeks gestation, which is the third trimester, and provides a comprehensive risk assessment with up to 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity, according to Labcorp. Sensitivity refers to the test\u2019s ability to accurately identify pregnancies at high risk, and specificity refers to its ability to accurately identify pregnancies that are not at high risk. Doctors who think their patients might benefit from this screening can talk to their patients about the option, order the test and get results within a few days. \u201cThis is one more tool in the tool belt for clinicians in the US and beyond to help deliver better maternal outcomes,\u201d said Dr. Brian Caveney, Labcorp\u2019s chief medical and scientific officer. About 1 in 25 pregnancies in the United States\u00a0is affected by preeclampsia, and it is one of the leading causes of maternal death. Options are limited for preeclampsia risk screening. Before the launch of the new test, at-risk patients could screen for their preeclampsia risk only during the second or third trimester of pregnancy if they were both symptomatic and hospitalized, and even that test was just launched last year. The new first-trimester test\u00a0isn\u2019t a diagnostic test\u00a0but a risk assessment tool to determine whether someone is more likely than average to develop preeclampsia during their current pregnancy,\u00a0\u201calong with all the other questions your doctor might ask you during a first-trimester visit,\u201d Caveney said. The screening results can lead to \u201ca whole bunch of slight changes in the prenatal care that you get from your doctor, based on the results of this risk predictor tool early on,\u201d he\u00a0said. Those changes may involve having more doctor visits to monitor your pregnancy, checking your blood pressure at home at least once a week, being mindful to not overexert yourself during exercise or at work or, if recommended by your physician, taking a low-dose aspirin preventively. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends the use of a low-dose aspirin as preventive medication after 12 weeks gestation in people at high risk for preeclampsia, but some people and their providers may not know that they\u2019re at high risk, especially if it is their first pregnancy. \u201cAt least half or more of cases of preeclampsia are potentially preventable,\u201d Caveney said. \u201cIf you identify it earlier in the pregnancy, you\u2019re more likely to be able to do things that lead to a healthier pregnancy and, therefore, hopefully a healthier delivery.\u201d The new screening test is a laboratory-developed test or LDT, so it does not require approval by the US Food and Drug Administration to be performed. Labcorp is in talks with health insurance plans to ensure that the test could be covered, Caveney said, adding that the screening assay has a list price of about $240. How the risk assessment works The risk of preeclampsia also has racial disparities. In the United States, the rate in Black women is about 60% higher than in White women. In general, Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than White women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cPreeclampsia is one of the main reasons why there is such a significant disparity in maternal outcomes,\u201d Caveney said. \u201cWith a focus on health equity, we think that better, more evidence-based preeclampsia screening can hopefully help address that, along with lots of other social services and health services and prenatal care to hopefully improve outcomes for pregnancies in the US and beyond.\u201d The new screening test works by identifying and measuring four biomarkers that are associated with preeclampsia risk. According to Labcorp, those biomarkers are the placental growth factor or PIGF hormone in the blood; pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A or PAPP-A in the blood; a blood pressure measurement of the average arterial pressure in the arteries; and the patient\u2019s uterine artery pulsatility index or UtAPI, which is measured during an ultrasound. Having low levels of PlGF and PAPP-A may suggest that the placenta is developing and functioning poorly, according to Labcorp, while high levels of arterial pressure and UtAPI may indicate elevated blood pressure and decreased blood flow in the uterine artery. One study published in 2018 in the journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology found that the performance of screening \u201cis substantially improved\u201d when the screening method includes maternal factors along with biomarkers, such as measurements of mean arterial pressure, UtAPI, PIGF and PAPP-A. Some doctors raise questions Not all physicians say they would recommend the new screening test for their patients. \u201cThe utility of the test in managing patients has yet to be proven and it is not clear that it helps more than it could possibly hurt.\u00a0It is not clear that the use of this test is any better than the current standards for prenatal care,\u201d Dr. Christian Pettker, chief of obstetrics at Yale-New Haven Hospital and a professor at Yale School of Medicine, wrote in an email. \u201cIt is not clear to me that this is appropriate for all patients who are pregnant in the first trimester.\u00a0Perhaps the most applicable group could be for patients who had preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy, though these patients already have a high risk and are often followed differently in their pregnancy,\u201d Pettker wrote. \u201cWhile the test is modestly good at predicting which patients may develop preeclampsia, it isn\u2019t clear how many patients are improperly told that they will develop preeclampsia,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cI would not underestimate the number of patients affected by a false positive.\u201d ACOG\u2019s Zahn agreed that false assessments come with risks. \u201cWith any new screening tool, it\u2019s always important to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks,\u201d Zahn said. Pettker also had some questions about how the test would be administered to evaluate a patient\u2019s preeclampsia risk, based on biomarkers, and how the ultrasound measurement of uterine artery blood flow \u201cis not a standard test done by ultrasound units or physicians and requires very specific expertise and training.\u201d Labcorp plans to talk with physicians and maternal-fetal specialists about the components of the test, Caveney said, but he added that the screening test could still be ordered using the blood-based biomarkers and regular blood pressure readings. \u201cMore data is better but not necessary, meaning this test performs best statistically if we have all of the pieces of data from the doctor in order to perform it. However, not every ob-gyn office or ultrasound center routinely has the ability to calculate this uterine artery pulsatility index,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t provide it, we will still perform the test and give an indication of risk. It just reduces the sensitivity or the likelihood of us being able to accurately predict the risk of preeclampsia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes it from a sensitivity of around 90% to the high 70s, which is still significantly higher than assessing traditional maternal risk factors alone.\u201d Losing a baby \u2018should not be the screening\u2019 Eleni Tsigas, chief executive officer of the Preeclampsia Foundation, said that a screening tool like the new first-trimester test could have \u201csignificantly\u201d changed her pregnancy experience if it had existed at the time of her first pregnancy in 1998. \u201cMy daughter died, and it was all due to a last-minute emergency,\u201d she said. Tsigas was diagnosed with preeclampsia only 11 weeks before her due date, and due to the complications of preeclampsia, her daughter, Nikonia Evangelia Tsigas, was stillborn. At the time, Tsigas said, she had only one risk factor: Her daughter was her first pregnancy. \u201cBut losing your first baby should not be the screening test that you\u2019re at high risk,\u201d Tsigas said. \u201cSo many people are completely caught off-guard in their first pregnancy when they develop preeclampsia, because they didn\u2019t have any of these risk factors other than it was their first pregnancy.\u201d Tsigas and her husband went on to have two more children after that first pregnancy, their sons Jordan and Jonathan. For those pregnancies, Tsigas said, she and her care team were more aware of her preeclampsia risk, they monitored her health closely, and she took a low-dose aspirin when recommended by her doctor. But something like the newly launched first-trimester screening test, \u201cif it\u2019s done right, it has the potential to eliminate those surprise cases\u201d of preeclampsia, Tsigas said. \u201cThe reason I emphasize \u2018done right\u2019 is because what we don\u2019t want to do is add another tool to the toolbox that\u2019s only accessible by some people. That\u2019s only going to increase disparities,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has issues with payer coverage and education and making sure that all women, no matter their socioeconomic status, are aware that this kind of information should be available to everybody. If it is, it has the potential to reduce the disparities we\u2019re seeing in maternal health outcomes and neonatal health outcomes,\u201d she said. \u201cTests like this absolutely move the bar.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/preeclampsia-risk-first-trimester-test-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_02_20_health_cancer-vaccines-catherine-wu-scn", "text": "Finding a cure for cancer is a motivating force for many an aspiring doctor. Few get anywhere close to pursuing that goal. Among them is Dr. Catherine Wu, an oncologist at Boston\u2019s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who has had cancer in her sights since second grade, when a teacher asked her and her classmates what they wanted to be when they grew up. \u201cThat\u2019s when there was a lot of coverage on the war on cancer,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI think I drew a picture of a cloud, probably a rainbow and drew a picture of (me) like, making a cure for cancer or something like that.\u201d That childhood scribble was prescient. Wu\u2019s research has laid the scientific foundation for the development of cancer vaccines tailored to the genetic makeup of an individual\u2019s tumor. It\u2019s a strategy looking increasingly promising for some hard-to-treat cancers such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer, according to the results of early-stage trials, and may ultimately be widely applicable to many of the 200 or so forms of cancer. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which selects Nobel laureates in chemistry and physics, last week awarded Wu its Sj\u00f6berg Prize in honor of \u201cdecisive contributions\u201d to cancer research. Cancer treatment has \u201cprogressed over the years but there are still sort of a lot of unmet medical (needs)\u00a0out there for many cancer forms,\u201d said Urban Lendahl, professor of genetics at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the secretary of the committee that awarded the prize. Sledgehammer cancer treatments The most common treatments for cancer \u2014 radiation therapy and chemotherapy \u2014 are like sledgehammers, striking all cells and often damaging healthy tissue. Since the 1950s, cancer researchers have been seeking a way to dial up the body\u2019s immune system, which naturally tries to fight cancer but is outsmarted by it, to attack tumor cells. Progress on that front was middling until about 2011 with the arrival of a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which boost the anti-tumor activity of T cells, an important part of the immune system. The work led to\u00a0the 2018 Nobel Prize for medicine for Tasuku Honjo and James Allison, the latter a winner of the 2017 Sj\u00f6berg Prize. These drugs have helped some people with cancer who would have been given months to live survive for decades, but they don\u2019t work for all cancer patients, and researchers continue to look for ways to turbocharge the body\u2019s immune system against cancer. Wu\u2019s fascination with the powers of the immune system arose after witnessing bone marrow transplants as a medical intern and seeing how they rebooted the blood and immune system to fight cancer. \u201cI had had really formative academic experiences that made me quite interested in the power of immunology,\u201d she said. \u201cThere in front of my eyes were people who are being cured of their leukemia because of the mobilization of immune response.\u201d Wu\u2019s research focused on small mutations in cancer tumor cells. These mutations, which occur as the tumor grows, create proteins that are slightly different to those in healthy cells. The altered protein generates what\u2019s called a tumor neoantigen that can be recognized by the immune system\u2019s T cells as foreign, and therefore susceptible to attack. With thousands of potential neoantigen candidates, Wu used \u201ctour de force lab work\u201d to identify the neoantigens that are on the cell surface, making them a potential target for a vaccine, Lendahl said. \u201cIf the immune system is to have a chance to attack the tumor, this difference must be manifested on the surface of the tumor cells. Otherwise, it\u2019s pretty pointless,\u201d Lendahl added. \u2018A fantastic discovery\u2019 The idea of a cancer vaccine has been around for decades. The widely used HPV vaccine targets the virus that is linked to an increased risk of cervical, mouth, anal and penile cancer. However, in many cases, cancer vaccines have failed to live up to their promise \u2014 largely because the right target hasn\u2019t been found. \u201cThe ability to identify neo-specific\u00a0tumor antigens has really developed into a large field of cancer research, as it offers the possibility to generate tumor-specific cancer vaccines,\u201d Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren, a professor of immunology at the Karolinska Institutet, said in a video shared by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. \u201cThis is a fantastic discovery.\u201d By sequencing DNA from healthy and cancer cells, Wu and her team identified a cancer patient\u2019s unique tumor neoantigens. Synthetic copies of these unique neoantigens could be used as a personalized vaccine to activate the immune system to target the cancer cells. \u00a0Wu and her team wanted to test this technology in advanced melanoma patients in a trial. The idea that every patient involved in the trial would get an individualized vaccine was initially hard for the US Food and Drug Administration, which regulates clinical trials, to wrap its collective head around, Wu said. Typically, the FDA would require the vaccines to be tested first in animal experiments. Wu and her team made their case: \u201cThat room was packed. It was the first (trial) of its kind, and there were people from many different offices. Our argument was, \u2018This is personalized, whatever we do in an animal doesn\u2019t really match the human \u2014 so why even go that route?\u2019\u201d Once it had FDA approval, the team vaccinated six patients with advanced melanoma with a seven-shot course of patient-specific neoantigens vaccines. The breakthrough results were published in an\u00a02017 article in Nature. For some patients, this treatment resulted in the immune system\u2019s cells being activated and targeting the tumor cells. The results,\u00a0along with another paper published\u00a0the same year led by the founders of mRNA vaccine company BioNTech, provided \u201cproof of principle\u201d that a vaccine can be targeted to a person\u2019s specific tumor, Lendahl said. A follow-up by Wu\u2019s team\u00a0four years after the patients received the vaccines published in 2021, showed that the immune responses were effective in keeping cancer cells under control. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for all the patients that participated in our trial because they are \u2026 active partners,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to go through treatment, but then to go through treatment that is of unknown benefit, and to be able to be willing to come in for all the extras that we need to do this type of research. There are more tests, there are more blood draws, there are more biopsies.\u201d Since then, Wu\u2019s team, other groups of medical researchers and pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Moderna and BioNTech, have further\u00a0developed this field\u00a0of research, with trials underway for vaccines that\u00a0treat pancreatic\u00a0and\u00a0lung cancer\u00a0as well as melanoma. Unanswered questions All the trials underway are small-scale, typically involving a handful of patients with later-stage disease\u00a0and\u00a0a high tolerance for safety risks. To show that these type of cancer vaccines work, much larger randomized control trials are needed. \u201cThe numbers are small, I mean, for obvious reasons,\u201d Lendahl said. \u201cData (looks) encouraging, but it\u2019s still of course, early days.\u201d Scientists are also figuring out the most effective way to format the vaccines. Wu\u2019s group and others have used vaccines made from peptides or strings of proteins.\u00a0Moderna and BioNtech use mRNA, which the companies pioneered in developing vaccines against Covid-19, to deliver a set of instructions to cells to make the relevant proteins. \u201cMy belief is that there are many roads to Rome. I think there\u2019s many different delivery modalities, but each delivery approach can be optimized with different bells and whistles,\u201d Wu said. \u201cThere has to be investment in and how to make that delivery approach work the best. And right now there\u2019s a huge appetite for mRNA you know, fed by our pandemic.\u201d Cancer vaccines have shown the most promise in what oncologists colloquially term \u201chot tumors\u201d that mutate quickly, su\ufeffch as melanoma that was Wu\u2019s initial focus. \u00a0It\u2019s not clear whether they will be effective against \u201ccold tumors\u201d such as breast cancer, which are more inert. \u201cIt\u2019s easier if there (are) spontaneously more mutations occurring in the tumor because you\u2019ve got a better smorgasbord of potential small molecules to choose from for making your vaccine,\u201d Lendahl said. Another challenge is how to manufacture these vaccines in a more cost-effective and time-sensitive way so they can reach large numbers of cancer patients, Wu said. Right now, it can take weeks, if not months, to make the individualized vaccines at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. An active avenue of research is developing vaccines that target neoantigens that are shared by patients with the same cancer type, raising hope for an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d vaccine, which many people could use without a lengthy personalization process. Another question is whether the vaccines will work best in combination with other treatments to make them a sharper tool and, if so, which ones. The results of a trial\u00a0published late last year found that a vaccine, developed by Merck and Moderna,\u00a0given to patients with advanced melanoma\u00a0along with a type of immunotherapy called Keytruda,\u00a0a drug based on checkpoint inhibitors, led to a lower risk of recurrence or death than those who got the drug alone, the companies said. It\u2019s also not known at what point in the treatment cycle will vaccines be most useful \u2014 treating cancers caught early, helping patients with advanced disease or ensuring patients remain cancer-free. Most trials underway involve patients with late-stage cancer or patients in remission, but Wu said she thinks vaccines may be more effective in early-stage disease. Despite the laundry list of unknowns, for some involved in these early cancer vaccine trials, the results have been life-changing \u201cI am just so grateful to have been allowed to take it,\u201d Barbara Brigham, who received a personalized vaccine for pancreatic cancer being tested by BioNTech,\u00a0told CNN last year. She was able to watch her oldest grandchild graduate from college \u2014 a moment she didn\u2019t think she would live to see. \u201cThe opportunity and timing was so perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helped me, and I hope it helps someone else.\u201d CNN\u2019s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/20/health/cancer-vaccines-catherine-wu-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_02_22_health_oklahoma-narcan-vending-machines", "text": "In his darkest moments, Jason Hall felt worthless. During his childhood and early adulthood, he said, there were times when he would drink too much alcohol, pop pills at nightclubs and, inevitably, do something or say something that would hurt people he loved. Hall, 41, would never have thought that his life journey would take him from those dark experiences to potentially saving lives with his work refilling naloxone vending machines across Oklahoma. Over-the-counter naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, is an inhaled medication used to reverse an opioid overdose while it\u2019s happening. Naloxone vending machines \u2013 which provide the medications for free \u2013 can help people access doses quickly and reduce someone\u2019s risk of dying from an opioid overdose since, ideally, the medication should be given immediately. The vending machines also offer free fentanyl test strips, small strips of paper that can test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that drives most overdose deaths in the United States. From California to New York, vending machines stocked with harm-reduction tools have been placed in areas where high numbers of opioid overdoses have been reported. In Oklahoma, some of the machines are located along turnpikes, in casinos, on university campuses, at a library or outside fire stations. A CNN analysis of state health departments finds that at least 33 states and the District of Columbia have naloxone vending machines. In some states, like Oregon, city or county health departments or local nonprofits might operate the machines without state involvement. Other states, like Delaware, don\u2019t currently have vending machines but plan to launch programs this year. The size of these programs can vary. Oklahoma plans to expand its program this year from 27 machines to 40. Other large programs can be found in places like Michigan, where Wayne County officials announced last month plans to deploy 100 vending machines containing naloxone. When working with the vending machines in Oklahoma, Hall often reflects on his experiences to inform his work. As a senior field representative for harm reduction campaigns at the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, he leads community training sessions on harm reduction as well as helping restock dozens of naloxone vending machines for people to access anonymously. \u201cPeople\u2019s reasons for using substances are as vast and different as there are different types of suffering. I grew up as a queer kid in a small town, and it was not a super cool thing to be in the \u201880s and \u201890s,\u201d said Hall, who is based in Oklahoma City. \u201cYou\u2019re basically told from a very, very young age that this is kind of the worst thing that you can be. You internalize that, and it creates a lot of depression and anxiety.\u201d Hall, who is now sober, said that at a young age, he turned to substances like methamphetamines or opioids to give him the feeling of confidence he craved at the time. In his mid-30s, Hall sought treatment for substance use disorder. \u201cThis followed me my entire life. Then I got to a place where I wasn\u2019t using methamphetamines and opioids, and alcohol was my substance of choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a very cool hipster guy. I was vegan, and I only rode a bicycle around. It\u2019s funny that I was very particular about the foods that I would eat, but as far as substances, I wasn\u2019t so picky.\u201d Hall, who works for the state and occasionally bartends on the side, said he has personally administered naloxone several times to reverse opioid overdoses during his time bartending and while working in shelter and housing programs. Even though he knows that naloxone is accessible through the vending machines, he always keeps some on him too, just in case. \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to need these products. A lot of times, substance use isn\u2019t planned,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, people are out in the community and maybe having a few cocktails and a substance becomes available, and maybe it\u2019s a substance you typically wouldn\u2019t use, but you\u2019ve had a couple drinks, and your inhibitions are lowered.\u201d \u2018People are dying every minute of the day\u2019 More than 111,000 people in the US died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period that ended in September, according to\u00a0provisional data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about overdose death rates, I\u2019ve got any number of friends, I see their face every time I see those numbers or when we talk about the number of overdose reversals that come from kits that are distributed by our community partners,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhen I hear those numbers, I hear the voices of my friends that are currently struggling with substance use disorder,\u201d he said, eyes filling with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s very real to me.\u201d Overall, the number of overdose deaths associated with any drug continues to increase each month in the United States, although the pace appears to be slowing. Deaths reached a record high in May and changed little in the following months, through September. \u201cPeople are dying every minute of the day due to these overdoses, and so the vending machines are an amazing tool to help get the help into the hands of the public,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \u201cThis is a prevention technique, and it\u2019s very, very helpful to have these distribution points in the community that allow people to get what they need quickly without necessarily relying immediately on a first responder when seconds matter to save a life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so these distribution points and these vending access machines are meant to bring\u00a0the solutions closer to the community and put the tools in their hands to save lives.\u201d A study conducted in Cincinnati found that a single vending machine was directly associated with reversing overdoses for at least 78 people in its first year. In Clark County, Nevada, another study found that in the 12 months after the launch of naloxone vending machines, there were 229 opioid-involved overdose deaths. But researchers had previously predicted that there would be about 270 deaths in the county, suggesting that about 41 deaths were averted after the machines were launched. Machines need to be restocked every day Oklahoma\u2019s naloxone vending machine program launched in June. The state placed its first machine at a homeless shelter in Tulsa. The machines have become so popular that they need to be restocked every day, said Heath Hayes, former deputy commissioner for the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. \u201cAll of the vending machines have technology associated with it that ping us when they\u2019re getting low. So if they\u2019re at 50% capacity, we get the staff ready to activate the restockers,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThese vending machines that we have active right now have about 11,000 boxes of naloxone that have been distributed,\u201d he said, and each box contains two doses. The vending machines each hold 100 naloxone kits and 54 fentanyl test strip packages. Both items \u2013 naloxone and the test strips \u2013 are available in the machines free of charge. Typically, an over-the-counter box of two single-dose naloxone sprays can cost around $45. In 2022, before the launch of the vending machine program, about 700 people died of opioid overdose in Oklahoma, according to state health department numbers, up from about 400 deaths in 2021. Hayes said the state will closely watch those numbers to see whether they decline over time, especially as naloxone becomes more easily accessible with the addition of more vending machines. \u201cOur goal is to get naloxone in the hands of every Oklahoman, because we want to normalize that naloxone is something that every person should carry on them,\u201d Hayes said before he left the department. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to have naloxone in 2 million-plus people\u2019s hands that are 18 and older,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are overdosing can\u2019t use this medication on themselves, and for about 40% of the people who overdose, there\u2019s a bystander around. So it\u2019s critical that you have naloxone on you, because you never know when you can save a life.\u201d Aside from providing naloxone and fentanyl test strips at no cost, an appeal of the vending machines is that they offer a sense of anonymity. The machines do not collect any identifiable information, and anyone can walk up and use them. Hayes said there is still a lot of stigma around opioid use and the need for naloxone, but he hopes the vending machines can help reduce it. The machines have large print on the sides that reads \u201cnaloxone saves lives.\u201d \u201cNot often do you see a vending machine that says \u2018Naloxone can save lives\u2019 and it be very mental health- and addiction-focused, at your gas station,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThat\u2019s another piece to this, is that we have a physical symbol of anti-stigma in places that typically aren\u2019t associated with the mental health field.\u201d Some critics question whether the machines enable dangerous behaviors. Naloxone vending machine programs often can face\u00a0opposition from the communities\u00a0where they are placed. But public health advocates champion the machines as a way to reduce the number of lives lost to overdose while reducing stigma. In central Pennsylvania, six naloxone vending machines have been installed in rural communities where stigma can be prevalent but there is a greater need for expanded access to naloxone medication, said Carla Sofronski, executive director and co-founder of the\u00a0Pennsylvania Harm Reduction Network. \u201cHarm reduction is often highly stigmatized, especially in Pennsylvania, with the thought process that it is enabling drug use, when it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. Harm reduction does not condone drug use. It just provides life-saving interventions and tools in a toolbox to keep people alive and minimize risk,\u201d Sofronski said. \u201cWe have to start treating this as an urgent public health crisis, and folks should not be denied access to life-saving interventions due to stigma or because some folks may believe that people have addiction due to moral failure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to cut the stigma to actually get these tools out to people.\u201d \u2018You are not a broken person\u2019 Hall has faced stigma firsthand. He says he has heard some criticisms or \u201cdifficult\u201d questions about the naloxone vending machines and other programs. For instance, people might ask whether the vending machines enable opioid abuse on-site. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to think that somebody\u2019s going to walk into one of these spaces and see that this vending machine has fentanyl test strips and Narcan and think, \u2018oh, this makes it safe for me to use.\u2019 I think if anything, it\u2019s bringing more to the forefront the danger around using these substances,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt really is a shame that, a lot of times, we have to spend our time and energy into humanizing people that use substances or people that might need access to these tools,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some people that have the attitude of \u2018well, if somebody overdoses, then that\u2019s their problem,\u2019 and that\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d Some of these negative biases and attitudes around people with substance use disorders remind Hall of how easily stigma can chip away at someone\u2019s self-worth. If he could speak to his younger self, at the peak of his substance use, he would tell himself that he is worthy of all that life has to offer. \u201cI would tell little baby Jason that everything is going to be OK,\u201d Hall said. \u201cYou are not a broken person, and you are not less than anybody else, and you are not less deserving of everything that life has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these things about yourself that you think make yourself so different and so \u2018othered\u2019 really just make you so much more human.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/22/health/oklahoma-narcan-vending-machines/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_world_first-warm-blooded-dinosaurs-scn", "text": "Were dinosaurs warm-blooded like birds and mammals or cold-blooded like reptiles? It\u2019s one of paleontology\u2019s oldest questions, and gleaning the answer matters because it illuminates how the prehistoric creatures may have lived and behaved. Challenging the prevailing idea that they were all slow, lumbering lizards that basked in the sun to regulate their body temperature, research over the past three decades has revealed that some dinosaurs were likely birdlike, with feathers and perhaps the ability to generate their own body heat. However, it\u2019s hard to find evidence that unquestionably shows what dinosaur metabolisms were like. Clues from dinosaur eggshells and bones have suggested that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and others were not. A new study published in the journal Current Biology on Wednesday suggested that three main dinosaur groups adapted differently to changes in temperature, with the ability to regulate body temperature evolving in the early Jurassic Period about 180 million years ago. Based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, the new study looked at the spread of dinosaurs across different environments on Earth throughout the dinosaur era, which started some 235 million years ago\u00a0and ended 66 million years ago when an asteroid slammed into Earth. Two of the three main groups \u2014 meat-eating therapod dinosaurs, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, whose notable members included Triceratops and Stegosaurus \u2014 spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, the research suggested. These dinosaurs may have evolved endothermy, or the ability to internally generate body heat, according to the study. Two adaptable dinosaur groups Therapods and ornithischians lived in a broad range of thermal landscapes in their respective evolutionary histories and were \u201cremarkably adaptable,\u201d the researchers wrote. Recent fossil discoveries have shown that different species of dinosaurs even thrived in the Arctic, giving birth and living there year-round. \u201cWarm-blooded animals are generally more active, for example, cold-blooded animals usually don\u2019t build nests,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, Royal Society Newton International Fellow at University College London\u2019s department of Earth sciences. By contrast, the towering, plant-eating sauropods kept to warmer, lower-latitude regions of the planet, and the availability of richer foliage in certain habitats wasn\u2019t the only factor why, the study found. Sauropods, which included Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, also appeared to thrive in arid, savannahlike environments and practiced \u201cprolonged climatic conservatism,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIt reconciles well with what we imagine about their ecology,\u201d Chiarenza said. \u201cThey were the biggest terrestrial animals that ever lived. They probably would have overheated if they were hot-blooded.\u201d What\u2019s more, he added, the amount of plant matter they would have needed to consume if they were warm-blooded would have been unsustainable. \u201c(These animals) were living in herds and we know that each one of them was the equivalent of 10 African elephants. (If they were warm-blooded) they would just destroy plant life. It makes more sense, as living animals, for them to be more cold-blooded.\u201d However, Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said that the findings from this study contrasted with her own research, which looked at molecular traces of oxygen intake found in dinosaur fossils. Her 2022 study suggested that ornithischians were more likely cold-blooded and sauropods were warm-blooded. She questioned to what extent the biogeographic range of a dinosaur was determined by its metabolic capacity as opposed to other factors such as behavior, growth strategy, dietary preferences and other ecological interactions. \u201cSome animals with incredibly fast growth rates (i.e., sauropods), and by requirement, fast metabolisms, are here found to be cold-blooded, while other animals with very slow growth rates (i.e., ceratopsians) are recovered as endotherms,\u201d Wiemann said. \u201cThese discrepancies will need to be addressed.\u201d Evolutionary trigger Chiarenza said that the model, developed by researchers at UCL and Universidade de Vigo in Spain, suggested that the earliest dinosaurs were more reptilian and cold-blooded. But a period of global warming resulting from volcanic activity 180 million years ago, known as the Jenkyns Event, may have been a trigger for the evolution of the ability to generate body heat internally. \u201cAt this time, many new dinosaur groups emerged. The adoption of endothermy, perhaps a result of this environmental crisis, may have enabled theropods and ornithischians to thrive in colder environments, allowing them to be highly active and sustain activity over longer periods, to develop and grow faster and produce more offspring,\u201d he said in a news release. As with all research based on models, the study made predictions grounded in existing information. New fossils or climatic information might alter that picture. \u201cOf course, if a sauropod turned up in the Arctic that would change things,\u201d Chiarenza said. Paleontologist Anthony Fiorillo, executive director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science, said the study was \u201cintriguing\u201d and the \u201cfirst real attempt to quantify broad patterns that some of us had thought about previously.\u201d Fiorillo, who is also a senior fellow at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, wasn\u2019t involved with the research. \u201cTheir modeling helps create a robustness to our biogeographical understanding of dinosaurs, and their related physiology,\u201d he said. \u201cThis study provides a platform for us to further test what we think we might know.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/world/first-warm-blooded-dinosaurs-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_sleep-talking-fixes-wellness", "text": "Do you or a loved one talk in your sleep? It\u2019s a common sleep issue for many, experts say. About 50% of children will talk in their sleep \u2014 and typically outgrow it \u2014 while only about 5% of adults are nighttime blabbermouths, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. However, about 60% to 65% of adults will experience at least one episode of nighttime speech during their lifetime, the academy said. Sleep soliloquies can occur at any stage of sleep, not just in rapid eye movement (REM), the\u00a0stage when dreams occur, experts say. These one-sided conversations are typically harmless and can include mumbled whispers, groans and nonsense words as well as vulgar language and outright yelling. At that point, a bed partner may cease to view the chatter as amusing and start looking for ways to protect their own sleep, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThere are some things you, the bed partner, can do to save your sleep,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cBut first make sure there are no hidden issues that might be causing the problem.\u201d Sleep talking, or somniloquy, can be connected to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. Medications to treat depression, and other mental health disorders, high blood pressure, seizures, asthma and, oddly, other sleep disorders can also cause sleep talking, according to the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cIf your partner has never been a sleep talker and suddenly starts sleep talking after the age of 50, and it becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should reach out to your doctor for a neurological evaluation,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIt could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder, such as Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds to two minutes 30 or more times an hour \u2014 can also cause the brain to partially wake and begin to jabber. Bed partners are often the first to notice sleep apnea, observing a total cessation of breathing, followed by a gasp of air. Acid reflux or it\u2019s more serious cousin, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can also create a partial arousal that can trigger the brain into speech, Schenck said. Tips for handling sleep talking A white noise generator or loud fan is a great defense, said Jennifer Mundt, assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \u201cEarplugs or comfortable noise-canceling headphones\u00a0may also help,\u201d she said. Earplugs come in several forms: expandable foam, pre-molded versions and custom molded, which are created to precisely fit the shape and size of the ear canal. \u201cThen try to go to sleep before the person who sleep talks so that you are not easily awakened. That\u2019s where a white noise generator or loud fan can be very, very helpful,\u201d Schenck said. Now, it\u2019s time for some detective work. Work with your bed partner to discover triggers for their sleep talking, such as stress, the use of alcohol, being sleep-deprived, not sticking to a normal sleep schedule or even sleeping in a new environment, experts say. For some people, something as benign as being on vacation or sleeping somewhere new can cause an episode, Mundt said. \u201cAt these times your brain is a little more vigilant because you\u2019re in a new environment, and that means you\u2019re more likely to have this partial awakening, where one part of the brain is awake and the other part is asleep,\u201d Mundt said. In the end, it\u2019s the responsibility of the person who sleep talks to take ownership of their disorder and find solutions to quit disturbing a partner\u2019s sleep, Schenck said. \u201cThe person who is sleep talking has to be very considerate of the partner,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIf sleeping on your back makes it worse, then get a nightshirt where you can put a tennis ball in the back of the shirt so you can\u2019t sleep on your back.\u201d And if drinking alcohol is a trigger, that should be stopped or diminished as well, he said. \u201cCut out alcohol so you can share your consideration for the bed partner who is disturbed by your sleep talking.\u201d What causes sleep talking? Sleep talking is a parasomnia, in the same category as sleep terrors, sleep eating, sleep paralysis and sleep sex. All are disorders of arousal, in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Parasomnias often run in families, and you are more likely to have one if you had one as a child. If more than one first-degree relative has a parasomnia, then it\u2019s much more likely that childhood sleep behaviors will remain or reoccur as an adult, Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to predict that you will develop a parasomnia. Some people who have sleep talking or walking as children do return to the behavior as adults, but many others do not,\u201d he said. Sleep talking often occurs spontaneously \u201cin a rather unpredictable fashion,\u201d Schenck said, although at times it can occur after fevers or emotional stress. However, \u201csleep talking should be differentiated from catathrenia, a sleep-related breathing disorder typically characterized by moaning during sleep.\u201d Many people who talk in their sleep do not need medical treatment, but if the disorder is severe, there are treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy, designed to help identify and reduce stress triggers and negative thoughts about sleep. Good sleep hygiene, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day, avoiding caffeine after 3pm and eliminating light from the bedroom, including screens such as smartphones, laptops and televisions can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/sleep-talking-fixes-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}

But there\u2019s another part of the anatomy that\u2019s often overlooked: the feet. Feet are wired up to nerve fiber tracts from the brain so you can stand, balance and wiggle your toes. They\u2019re also plumbed by blood vessels, which lead all the way from the heart. The appearance and function of our feet then can indicate viral infections, diseases of the cardiovascular system and even neurological disorders. Here are a couple of examples. READ MORE:\u00a0Is the \u2018barefoot-boy summer\u2019 trend bad for your feet? Hand, foot and mouth disease Infectious diseases tend to affect different parts of the body. Measles\u00a0usually starts off on the face, or in the mouth, as little spots that look like grains of sugar.\u00a0Pityriasis versicolor, a type of fungal infection, tends to begin and stay on the torso. The reasons why they tend to affect these areas is not well understood. Hand, foot and mouth disease, or HFM,\u00a0begins in exactly these areas. It\u2019s caused by a virus known as\u00a0coxsackie and tends to produce raised pink-red spots that can blister and weep. The name is a bit of a misnomer \u2014 the rash can also affect the legs and buttocks, too. Noticing a new rash on the feet should prompt a doctor to consider HFM. HFM is a common childhood illness that\u2019s very contagious. Thankfully, it\u2019s also usually short-lived, clearing without treatment after a few days. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with\u00a0foot and mouth\u00a0\u2014 or better, hoof and mouth, however. Foot and mouth is a different virus from HFM that (mainly) affects cloven-hoofed animals, such as cows and sheep. It\u2019s the disease that resulted in a\u00a0UK epidemic in 2001. READ MORE:\u00a0How much time should you spend sitting versus standing? New research reveals the optimal mix Heart, vessels and feet Our circulatory system supplies blood to every part of the body \u2014 from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes. By the time blood vessels reach these extremities, like twigs from a tree, they have branched and got much smaller in size. At some point, we\u2019ve all experienced the discomfort of icy cold feet, especially when going barefoot around the house or during chillier days. It\u2019s normal for feet to feel cool to the touch, but they should not change color from their usual skin color to blue \u2014 nor should they ever get painfully cold. Severe symptoms of discoloration and pain can point toward a phenomenon called\u00a0blue toe syndrome. It can be triggered by tiny little masses called microemboli, made up of blobs of cholesterol. These emboli pass easily through large vessels but will struggle as they become smaller. On reaching the smaller vessels of the feet, they finally become stuck, cutting off the blood supply. The tissues then become starved of oxygen, causing the feet to change color and become painful. In serious cases, blue toe syndrome can lead to tissue death, breakdown and the formation of gangrene, which may require\u00a0amputation\u00a0of toes \u2014 or even the whole foot. This rare condition is sometimes called\u00a0\u201ctrash foot,\u201d because of the way in which the feet become so discolored. What\u2019s the underlying cause of these tiny cholesterol fragments? Most likely aneurysms and atherosclerosis \u2014 vessels that have ballooned or hardened upstream of the feet. When trash foot does occur, it is often following surgical treatment for these conditions, such as\u00a0aortic aneurysm repair. The procedures disrupt the vessel, which can cause emboli to break off. As well as trash foot, there are other signs in the feet that can point toward cardiovascular disease.\u00a0Raised red swellings\u00a0appearing on the feet (as well as the hands) can indicate an infection of the heart called\u00a0bacterial endocarditis. These can be painless \u2014 in which case we call them Janeway lesions \u2014 or sore, which are called Osler\u2019s nodes. READ MORE:\u00a0Are your feet beach ready? The Babinski sign The toes can signal issues with the nervous system, too. If you\u2019ve ever watched \u201cER\u201d or\u00a0\u201dGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d\u00a0and heard one of the characters shout \u201cupgoing plantars!\u201d during a patient examination, you know they\u2019re referring to the Babinski reflex. After finding the upgoing plantar, the doctor may then have creased their brow with worry \u2014 and for good reason. The Babinski sign is a simple test that involves stroking the sole of the foot with a blunt-ended instrument to check the response of the toes. This is the\u00a0plantar reflex\u00a0\u2014 plantar relating to the sole of the foot. Normally, when this reflex is triggered, the toes should curl under or flex downward toward the sole. It the big toe points upward, and the smaller toes fan out, this is an \u201cupgoing plantar\u201d response \u2014 also known as the\u00a0Babinski sign, named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski who first described it. It is\u00a0normal to find this response in babies, whose nervous systems are undergoing development and not capable of all the motor functions of an adult. In\u00a0adults, however, finding the Babinski sign is an altogether different story. Most commonly, it signifies that a stroke is disrupting the normal brain circuitry that controls the feet. Other causes\u00a0include multiple sclerosis and (rarely) drug intoxication. In some otherwise healthy people though, the Babinski sign can be observed during deep sleep. The scope is much wider than just these conditions. Diabetes, kidney failure and even thyroid disorders can affect the feet. They are, therefore, important indicators of our health so regular checks are essential \u2014 and seek medical advice if you notice any pain, discoloration or rashes.

{"id": "2024_05_10_health_super-bowl-parade-survivors-bullets-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "James Lemons, 39, wants the bullet removed from his thigh so he can go back to work. Sarai Holguin, a 71-year-old woman originally from Mexico, has accepted the bullet lodged near her knee as her \u201ccompa\u201d \u2014 a close friend. Mireya Nelson, 15, was hit by a bullet that went through her jaw and broke her shoulder, where fragments remain. She\u2019ll live with them for now, while doctors monitor lead levels in her blood for at least two years. Nearly three months after the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting left at least 24 people injured, recovery from those wounds is intensely personal and includes a surprising gray area in medicine: whether the bullets should be removed. Medical protocol offers no clear answer. A 2016 survey of surgeons found that\u00a0only about 15%\u00a0of respondents worked at medical facilities that had policies on bullet removal. Doctors in the U.S. often leave bullets buried deep in a person\u2019s body, at least at first, so as not to cause further trauma. But as gun violence has emerged as a public health epidemic,\u00a0some researchers wonder\u00a0if that practice is best. Some of the wounded, like James Lemons, are left in a precarious place. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to get it out, and it\u2019s safely taken out, get it out of the person,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cMake that person feel more secure about themselves. And you\u2019re not walking around with that memory in you.\u201d Lemons, Holguin, and Nelson are coping in very different ways. Pain Became a Problem Three days after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Lemons drove the 37 miles from Harrisonville, Missouri, to downtown Kansas City to celebrate the victory. The warehouse worker was carrying his 5-year-old daughter, Kensley, on his shoulders when he felt a bullet enter the back of his right thigh. Gunfire erupted in the area packed with revelers,\u00a0prosecutors later said, after a \u201cverbal confrontation\u201d between two groups. Detectives found \u201cmultiple 9mm and .40 caliber spent shell casings\u201d at the scene. Lemons said he understood immediately what was happening. \u201cI know my city. We\u2019re not shooting off fireworks,\u201d he said. Lemons shielded Kensley\u2019s face as they fell to the ground so she wouldn\u2019t hit the concrete. His first thought was getting his family \u2014 also including his wife, Brandie; 17-year-old daughter, Kallie; and 10-year-old son, Jaxson \u2014 to safety. \u201cI\u2019m hit. But don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Lemons recalled telling Brandie. \u201cWe gotta go.\u201d He carried Kensley on his shoulders as the family walked a mile to their car. His leg bled through his pants at first then stopped, he said. It burned with pain. Brandie insisted on driving him to the hospital but traffic was at a standstill so she put on her hazard lights and drove on the wrong side of the road. \u201cShe\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m getting you to a hospital. I\u2019m tired of people being in my way,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen my wife like that. I\u2019m looking at her like, \u2018That\u2019s kinda sexy.\u2019\u201d Lemons clapped and smiled at his wife, he said, to which she replied, \u201cWhat are you smiling for? You just got shot.\u201d He stayed in quiet admiration until they were stopped by a sheriff, who summoned an ambulance, Lemons said. He was taken to the emergency room at University Health, which\u00a0admitted 12 patients\u00a0from the rally, including eight with gunshot wounds. Imaging showed the bullet barely missed an artery, Lemons said. Doctors cleansed the wound, put his leg in a brace, and told him to come back in a week. The bullet was still in his leg. \u201cI was a little baffled by it, but I was like, \u2018OK, whatever, I\u2019ll get out of here,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. When he returned, doctors removed the brace but explained they often leave bullets and fragments in the body \u2014 unless they grow too painful. \u201cI get it, but I don\u2019t like that,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you take it out if you could?\u201d University Health spokesperson Leslie Carto said the hospital can\u2019t comment on individual patient care because of federal privacy laws. Surgeons typically do remove bullets when they encounter them during surgery or they are in dangerous locations, like in the spinal canal or risking damage to an organ, said\u00a0Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children\u2019s. Campbell also chairs the Injury Prevention and Control Committee of the American College of Surgeons\u2019 Committee on Trauma, which works on firearm injury prevention. LJ Punch, a trauma surgeon by training and the founder of the\u00a0Bullet Related Injury Clinic\u00a0in St. Louis, said the origins of trauma care also help explain why bullets are so often left. \u201cTrauma care is war medicine,\u201d Punch said. \u201cIt is set to be ready at any moment and any time, every day, to save a life. It is not equipped to take care of the healing that needs to come after.\u201d In the survey of surgeons, the most common reasons given for removing a bullet were pain, a palpable bullet lodged near the skin, or an infection. Far less common were lead poisoning and mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. What patients wanted also affected their decisions, the surgeons said. Lemons wanted the bullet out. The pain it caused in his leg radiated up from his thigh, making it difficult to move for more than an hour or two. Working his warehouse job was impossible. \u201cI gotta lift 100 pounds every night,\u201d Lemons recalled telling his doctors. \u201cI gotta lift my child. I can\u2019t work like this.\u201d He has lost his income and his health insurance. Another stroke of bad luck: The family\u2019s landlord sold their rental home soon after the parade, and they had to find a new place to live. This house is smaller, but it was important to keep the kids in the same school district with their friends, Lemons said in an interview in Kensley\u2019s pink bedroom, the quietest spot to talk. They\u2019ve borrowed money and raised\u00a0$6,500 on GoFundMe\u00a0to help with the deposit and car repairs, but the parade shooting has left the family in a deep financial hole. Without insurance, Lemons worried he couldn\u2019t afford to have the bullet removed. Then he learned his surgery would be paid for by donations. He set up an appointment at a hospital north of the city, where a surgeon took measurements on his X-ray and explained the procedure. \u201cI need you to be involved as much as I\u2019m going to be involved,\u201d he remembered being told, \u201cbecause \u2014 guess what \u2014 this ain\u2019t my leg.\u201d The surgery is scheduled for this month. \u2018We Became Friends\u2019 Sarai Holguin isn\u2019t much of a Chiefs fan, but she agreed to go to the rally at Union Station to show her friend the best spot to see the players on stage. It was an unseasonably warm day, and they were standing near an entrance where lots of police were stationed. Parents had babies in strollers, kids were playing football, and she felt safe. A little before 2 p.m., Holguin heard what she thought were fireworks. People started running away from the stage. She turned to leave, trying to find her friend, but felt dizzy. She didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been shot. Three people quickly came to her aid and helped her to the ground, and a stranger took off his shirt and made a tourniquet to put on her left leg. Holguin, a native of Puebla, Mexico, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018, had never seen so much chaos, so many paramedics working under such pressure. They were \u201canonymous heroes,\u201d she said. She saw them working on Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a well-known DJ and 43-year-old mother of two. Lopez-Galvan died at the scene, and was the sole fatality at the parade. Holguin was rushed to University Health, about five minutes from Union Station. There doctors performed surgery, leaving the bullet in her leg. Holguin awoke to more chaos. She had lost her purse, along with her cellphone, so she couldn\u2019t call her husband, Cesar. She had been admitted to the hospital under an alias \u2014 a common practice at medical centers to begin immediate care. Her husband and daughter didn\u2019t find her until about 10 p.m. \u2014 roughly eight hours after she\u2019d been shot. \u201cIt has been a huge trauma for me,\u201d Holguin said through an interpreter. \u201cI was injured and at the hospital without doing anything wrong. [The rally] was a moment to play, to relax, to be together.\u201d Holguin was hospitalized for a week, and two more outpatient surgeries quickly followed, mostly to remove dead tissue around the wound. She wore a wound VAC, or vacuum-assisted closure device, for several weeks and had medical appointments every other day. Campbell, the trauma surgeon, said wound VACs are common when bullets damage tissue that isn\u2019t easily reconstructed in surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical injuries,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cMany times it\u2019s the emotional, psychological injuries, which many of these patients take away as well.\u201d The bullet remains near Holguin\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019m going to have it for the rest of my life,\u201d she said, saying she and the bullet became \u201ccompas,\u201d close friends. \u201cWe became friends so that she doesn\u2019t do any bad to me anymore,\u201d Holguin said with a smile. Punch, of the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis, said some people like Holguin are able to find a way to psychically live with bullets that remain. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to make a story around what that means for that bullet to be in your body, that gives you power; that gives you agency and choice,\u201d Punch said. Holguin\u2019s life changed in an instant: She\u2019s using a walker to get around. Her foot, she said, acts \u201clike it had a stroke\u201d \u2014 it dangles, and it\u2019s difficult to move her toes. The most frustrating consequence is that she cannot travel to see her 102-year-old father, still in Mexico. She has a live camera feed on her phone to see him, but that doesn\u2019t offer much comfort, she said, and thinking about him brings tears. She was told at the hospital that her medical bills would be taken care of, but then lots of them came in the mail. She tried to get victim assistance from the state of Missouri, but all the forms she had were in English, which made them difficult to comprehend. Renting the wound VAC alone cost $800 a month. Finally she heard that the Mexican Consulate in Kansas City could help, and the consul pointed her to the Jackson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, with which she registered as an official victim. Now all of her bills are being paid, she said. Holguin isn\u2019t going to seek mental health treatment, as she believes one must learn to live with a given situation or it will become a burden. \u201cI have processed this new chapter in my life,\u201d Holguin said. \u201cI have never given up and I will move on with God\u2019s help.\u201d \u2018I Saw Blood on My Hands\u2019 Mireya Nelson was late to the parade. Her mother, Erika, told her she should leave early, given traffic and the million people expected to crowd into downtown Kansas City, but she and her teenage friends ignored that advice. The Nelsons live in Belton, Missouri, about a half hour south of the city. Mireya wanted to hold the Super Bowl trophy. When she and her three friends arrived, the parade that had moved through downtown was over and the rally at Union Station had begun. They were stuck in the large crowd and quickly grew bored, Mireya said. Getting ready to leave, Mireya and one of her friends were trying to call the driver of their group, but they couldn\u2019t get cell service in the large crowd. Amid the chaos of people and noise, Mireya suddenly fell. \u201cI saw blood on my hands. So then I knew I got shot. Yeah, and I just crawled to a tree,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know where I got shot at, at first. I just saw blood on my hands.\u201d The bullet grazed Mireya\u2019s chin, shot through her jaw, broke her shoulder, and left through her arm. Bullet fragments remain in her shoulder. Doctors decided to leave them because Mireya had already suffered so much damage. Mireya\u2019s mother supports that decision, for now, noting they were just \u201cfragments.\u201d \u201cI think if it\u2019s not going to harm her the rest of her life,\u201d Erika said, \u201cI don\u2019t want her to keep going back in the hospital and getting surgery. That\u2019s more trauma to her and more recovery time, more physical therapy and stuff like that.\u201d Bullet fragments, particularly ones only skin-deep, often push their way out like splinters, according to Punch, although patients aren\u2019t always told about that. Moreover, Punch said, injuries caused by bullets extend beyond those with damaged tissue to the people around them, like Erika. He called for a holistic approach to recover from all the trauma. \u201cWhen people stay in their trauma, that trauma can change them for a lifetime,\u201d Punch said. Mireya will be tested for\u00a0lead levels in her blood\u00a0for at least the next two years. Her levels are fine now, doctors told the family, but if they get worse she will need surgery to remove the fragments, her mother said. Campbell, the pediatric surgeon, said lead is particularly concerning for young children, whose developing brains make them especially vulnerable to\u00a0its harmful effects.\u00a0Even a tiny amount\u00a0of lead \u2014 3.5 micrograms per deciliter \u2014 is enough to report to state health officials, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mireya talks about cute teenage boys\u2019 being \u201cfine\u201d but also still wears Cookie Monster pajamas. She appears confused by the shootings, by all the attention at home, at school, from reporters. Asked how she feels about the fragments in her arm, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care for them.\u201d Mireya was on antibiotics for 10 days after her hospital stay because doctors feared there was bacteria in the wound. She has had physical therapy, but it\u2019s painful to do the exercises. She has a scar on her chin. \u201cA dent,\u201d she said, that\u2019s \u201cbumpy.\u201d \u201cThey said she was lucky because if she wouldn\u2019t have turned her head in a certain way, she could be gone,\u201d Erika said. Mireya faces a psychiatric evaluation and therapy appointments, though she doesn\u2019t like to talk about her feelings. So far, Erika\u2019s insurance is paying the medical bills, though she hopes to get some help from the United Way\u2019s\u00a0#KCStrong fund, which raised nearly $1.9 million, or a faith-based organization called\u00a0Unite KC. Erika doesn\u2019t want a handout. She has a job in health care and just got a promotion. The bullet has changed the family\u2019s life in big ways. It is part of their conversation now. They talk about how they wish they knew what kind of ammunition it was, or what it looked like. \u201cLike, I wanted to keep the bullet that went through my arm,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI want to know what kind of bullet it was.\u201d That brought a sigh from her mom, who said her daughter had watched too many episodes of \u201cForensic Files.\u201d Erika beats herself up about the wound, because she couldn\u2019t protect her daughter at the parade. \u201cIt hits me hard because I feel bad because she begged me to get off work and I didn\u2019t go there because when you have a new position, you can\u2019t just take off work,\u201d Erika said. \u201cBecause I would have took the bullet. Because I would do anything.

{"id": "2024_05_10_health_bird-flu-government-farm-incentives", "text": "Newly announced financial incentives to farms to help stem the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle drew mixed reviews Friday, as some farmers said they were grateful for money to help buffer the economic impact but advocates for farm workers questioned whether the money paid to workers would be enough to encourage more testing for the H5N1 virus. As part of the plan, announced Friday by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, the government will pay up to $28,000 per farm over the next four months to support specific steps to prevent the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle.\u00a0About $98 million will be funneled to the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to fund the program. The USDA confirmed the first bird flu infection in cows in late March.\u00a0Since then, more than 40 herds have tested positive in nine states. Right now, health officials say, the virus doesn\u2019t transmit efficiently from person to person, making the risk to humans low.\u00a0But scientists have said that having the infection spreading in domesticated animals like cattle is risky because it puts the virus in closer proximity to people, where it could adapt and evolve to become a fully human pathogen.\u00a0If that happens, researchers say, it could spark another pandemic. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our top priority at USDA, given our mission, is to contain this as an animal health event,\u201d Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said Friday. \u201cUltimately, we want to eliminate the virus in the industry and develop over time a vaccine to prevent another emergency of H5N1 in cattle.\u201d The USDA has acknowledged that some dairy producers have been wary of letting the government come onto their farms to test livestock. Farm workers with symptoms have also reportedly been reluctant to be tested for H5N1 influenza, since most are not compensated if they need to take time off for illness. As part of the plan announced Friday, the USDA will\u00a0provide financial support \u2014 up to $2,000 per affected farm per month \u2014 for producers who supply personal protective equipment to their workers or help them wash their uniforms.\u00a0Financial support is also available to farmers who allow their workers to participate in\u00a0a study through the USDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Workers who participate in the CDC study would also be compensated for their time. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said workers would get $75 for participating in an interview as well as providing a nasal swab and a blood sample, although he said they didn\u2019t have to do all three. Advocates for farm workers said they were skeptical that the $75 payment would be enough to encourage more testing. \u201cThere are some really significant resources that are being allocated to the owners of the cattle. But far less is being advocated to the workers who are in close contact and at high risk working in those milking parlors,\u201d said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers. \u201c$75 is not going to seem like a good gamble to someone who may be looking at much longer off of work. And $75 isn\u2019t going to feed their families,\u201d she said. Strater estimates that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 dairy workers in the US. \u201cThis is not a huge amount of people. But if you think about how important to protecting the public health that would be, you would think that we will be putting all of our resources into a protective ring around these folks,\u201d she said. Strater says there\u2019s a real reluctance on the part of farm workers to be tested, even when they have symptoms, because a positive test could mean time off work. \u201cThe testing situation is really challenging,\u201d said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health programs for the National Center for Farmworker Health. The way we now find out about human cases of H5N1 is \u201ca very passive system,\u201d she said. Alcauter says public health officials assume that if someone has influenza symptoms, they\u2019ll go to a doctor, who will take an occupational health history, and if the worker tests positive for the flu, the doctor will send that person\u2019s swab to a state public health lab to be tested for H5N1. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a very realistic scenario,\u201d she said, noting that only a few dozen people had been tested for the H5N1 virus after exposure to cattle. Besides payments to help assist farms in protecting their workers, payments of up to $1,500 per farm will be available to aid in the development of biosecurity plans.\u00a0The USDA will offer dairy farms $100 to purchase a piece of equipment called an in-line sampler so their milk can be tested as it travels between cows and holding tanks. Another $2,000 will be available to farms that heat treat their wasted milk before it is disposed. The USDA will also cover up to $10,000 of veterinary costs at farms where cattle have tested positive for H5N1 and will cover the cost of shipping samples to testing labs in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The government says it will also compensate farmers for lost milk production if their cows get sick. The National Milk Producers Federation said it was pleased by the announcement of additional financial help to dairy farmers. \u201cWe look forward to continued collaboration and consultation with USDA and other federal agencies as we monitor, understand, and contain this outbreak, and we will do what we can to help dairy farmers understand and benefit from these initiatives as swift implementation is put into motion,\u201d the group said in a statement. In addition, HHS is going to send an additional $101 million in funding to the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration to help fund their H5N1 response efforts. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified 93 million to be used by CDC to expand our monitoring of people exposed to infected animals, to scale up our testing and analysis capabilities, to determine whether candidate vaccines are effective and to manufacture, store, and distribute additional influenza diagnostic kits,\u201d HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said. Another $8 million will be given to the FDA to support to the agency\u2019s ability to conduct surveillance at different points in the milk production system, Becerra said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/bird-flu-government-farm-incentives/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_health_alternatives-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness", "text": "Many people love their ultraprocessed foods. Sodas, chips, ice cream, lunch meat and other prepared foods are staples of the American diet. They are hard to avoid, too. More than\u00a070% of the US food supply\u00a0is made of ultraprocessed food. But a diet heavy in ultraprocessed food isn\u2019t good for us, science has shown. Eating\u00a0ultraprocessed foods\u00a0raises the risk of developing or dying from dozens of health conditions, according to a February review covering nearly 10 million people. Science has also shown that when you eat Mediterranean meals, which focus on vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and fish, you can reduce the risk of some\u00a0cancers,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0heart disease, high cholesterol\u00a0and stroke. Adopting this approach to eating can\u00a0also improve brain health, strengthen bones and ward off depression and dementia. Hot dogs and cookies are delicious, though. So, what to do? Spot the troublesome ingredients Many ultraprocessed foods have very long lists of ingredients and include additives, according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. If you can\u2019t pronounce the names in your food\u2019s ingredient list, that\u2019s a warning sign. The list may include preservatives designed to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing. All are signs that the food is ultraprocessed. Skip eating out when you can\u2019t tell what ingredients are in your food, and note that many items on fast-food restaurant menus can be ultraprocessed (such as hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets and fries). Start with breakfast Breakfast may be the easiest meal to change. Instead of sugar-fortified cereal or toaster waffles,\u00a0have some warm and filling ancient grains such as quinoa, sorghum or wheat berries cooked with milk, honey, nuts and fruits. No time in the morning to prepare breakfast? Prep these overnight oats the night before. Or have a simple small bowl of plain Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of sliced nuts to go. How processed is your lunch? Instead of a loaded deli sandwich or slices of pizza every day, try to bring your own plant-based lunch once or twice per week. I love adding roast chicken leftovers to this kale ricotta salad (sub in feta if you can\u2019t find the ricotta). Or make this dish by registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, founder of\u00a0Olive Tree Nutrition. She created her Warm Farro Grain Salad With Pomegranate for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better newsletter. Need more ideas? Check out CNN contributor Casey Barber\u2019s ideas for school lunch. Try our interactive to help you buy the least ultraprocessed lunch you can. Is it time for a snack? Snacks can be tricky. The no-fly list of ultraprocessed food is loaded with store-bought chips, sugar-packed yogurts and candy-filled trail mix. Instead, think about apples, oranges, bananas, carrot sticks, and other fruits and veggies. Protein-packed nuts and seeds are filling while also providing a brain boost and heart-healthy fats. If you want to get fancy, Al Bochi created this\u00a0roasted almond snack for CNN that features the Mediterranean spice blend za\u2019atar. Suzy Karadsheh\u2019s avocado salsa dip is also amazing for movie nights, the big game and parties (whichever one you choose). Dinner during the week With dinner a rushed affair for many overscheduled families, it can be impossible to cook during the week. Try to avoid fast-food burgers and chicken nuggets when you can.  Instead, consider grilling chicken or cooking ground turkey on the weekend for easy-assemble Tuesday taco night. Karadsheh also has a Mediterranean twist on tuna salad that will convert even the most anti-tuna eaters (which once included me). May I have dessert, please? Baked goods and ice cream are fine for special occasions, but for an everyday dessert that\u2019s not highly processed,\u00a0Al Bochi\u2019s recipe for Strawberry Ricotta Granola Parfaits is next level. For something grown-up, try poaching pears with\u00a0pomegranate juice\u00a0or port and serve them over yogurt or bake pears and other fruits in parchment. Does this still sound too hard? Ultraprocessed foods are designed to be fun and taste good. Reducing your reliance on them can be hard. Try one suggestion at a time, for a week at a time.

{"id": "2023_01_11_health_short-attention-span-wellness", "text": "I\u2019ve been working steadily for hours but feel as if I haven\u2019t even started. My attention is being pulled from my assigned task \u2014 writing this story \u2014 by a myriad of what I believe are necessary work interruptions. (OK, a couple were from my cat, who also firmly believes in their necessity.)   My kids and I call days like this \u201csquirrel days\u201d in honor of Dug, the talking dog in (squirrel !!) the 2009 Pixar movie \u201cUp,\u201d who (squirrel !!) was constantly distracted by well, just about (squirrel !!) \u2026 Unfortunately, all too many of us are having \u201csquirrel\u201d days, according to Dr. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who studies how digital media affects our lives. In her book \u201cAttention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity,\u201d Mark explains how decades of research have tracked the decline of the ability to focus. \u201cIn 2004, we measured the average attention on a screen to be 2\u00bd minutes,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSome years later, we found attention spans to be about 75 seconds. Now we find people can only pay attention to one screen for an average of 47 seconds.\u201d Not only do people concentrate for less than a minute on any one screen, Mark said, but when attention is diverted from an active work project, they take about 25 minutes to refocus on that task. (Wait, what??) \u201cIn fact, our research shows it takes 25 minutes, 26 seconds, before we go back to the original working sphere or project,\u201d Mark said. Why you have a short attention span How can that be? \u201cIf we look at work in terms of switching projects, as opposed to the micro view of switching screens, we find people spend about 10\u00bd  minutes in any work project before being interrupted \u2014 internally or by someone else \u2014 and then switch to another work project,\u201d Mark said. Yes, but then we go back to the original work, right? Wrong, Mark said. Instead, when we are interrupted on project two, we switch yet again to a different task \u2014 call it project three. Unbelievably, her research has shown we are also interrupted on project three and move on to project four.   \u201cAnd then you go back and pick up the original interrupted project,\u201d Mark said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019re interrupted and you do nothing. For over 25 minutes, you\u2019re actually working on other things.\u201d  (At least I can tell my boss that when I miss my deadline.) \u201cHowever, there\u2019s also a switch cost,\u201d Mark added. \u201cA switch cost is the time it takes you to reorient back to your work: \u2018Where was I? What was I thinking of?\u2019 That additional effort can also lead to errors and stress.\u201d How to focus Why is all of this a problem? After all, it\u2019s called multitasking, thought by many to be a highly prized skill for coping with the demands of the information age.  \u201cWith the exception of a few rare individuals, there is no such thing as multitasking,\u201d Mark said. \u201cUnless one of the tasks is automatic, like chewing gum or walking, you cannot do two effortful things at the same time.\u201d For example, she said, you can\u2019t read email and be in a video meeting. When you focus on one thing, you lose the other. \u201cYou\u2019re actually switching your attention very quickly between the two,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd when you switch your attention fast, it\u2019s correlated with stress.\u201d  Blood pressure rises. Heart rate speeds up. Psychological measures of stress also show negative outcomes, she said, such as more fatigue and mistakes and less productivity: \u201cThe more people multitask, the more errors they make.\u201d  Who did this to us? We did, of course, with the help of tech culprits such as social media, tablets and television. But Mark blames email the most.    \u201cTo me, email is probably the worst because it\u2019s become a symbol of work,\u201d she said, adding that her research has found a direct correlation between email and more stress. \u201cWe cut off email for some workers in an organization for one workweek,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing heart rate monitors, we found that they became significantly less stressed and were able to focus significantly longer.\u201d  (I find myself pausing to look up flights to Bora Bora. Oh, right. They have email there, too.) \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a person can just completely cut off from technology and work in today\u2019s world,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSo let\u2019s learn how to live with it in a way that maintains our positive well-being.\u201d How to increase your attention span Regaining your focus requires you to be mindful of how you are using technology, Mark said, a daunting task if you consider the average American spends at least 10 hours a day on screens. Paradoxically, you can use technology to help, she said. Schedule rote work for the first part of the day when you\u2019re not fully alert, then use technology to block distractions when you\u2019re at your mental best. At night, offload tasks from your brain by writing them down and then put the list away. Distracted by social media sites? Hide them, Mark said: \u201cTake the icons off your desktop and bury the apps on your phone inside folders, where it takes an extra effort to find them. Leave your phone in another room or put it in a drawer and lock it.\u201d    It\u2019s also important to learn when to take a break. \u201cIf you have to read something more than once or if the words are just not registering, it\u2019s time to stop and replenish,\u201d she said. The best break is a walk in nature: \u201cJust a 20-minute walk in nature can help significantly relax people,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd we found it can help people produce significantly more ideas \u2014 it\u2019s called divergent thinking.\u201d Too cold to walk outside? Do something engaging that takes no mental effort. \u201cI have a friend who is an MIT professor, and his favorite activity is matching socks,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnother friend likes to iron. Ideas can incubate and then we come back to the hard work, and we see it with fresh eyes.\u201d  ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/01/11/health/short-attention-span-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_health_pig-kidney-recipient-transplant-death", "text": "A 62-year-old man has died months after becoming the world\u2019s first living recipient of a genetically edited pig kidney transplant, hailed as a medical milestone. Rick Slayman received the kidney at Massachusetts General in March after he had been diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year. The hospital emphasized there is no indication his death was a result of the transplant. After undergoing the four-hour surgery at the recommendation of his doctors, Slayman, a manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, was discharged from the hospital\u00a0in April. After the surgery, doctors said they believed the new kidney could last years, but acknowledged there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. \u201cMr. Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation,\u201d Massachusetts General said in a statement. \u201cWe offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Slayman\u2019s family and loved ones as they remember an extraordinary person whose generosity and kindness touched all who knew him.\u201d Slayman\u2019s family described him as a kind man who was fiercely dedicated to the people in his life. \u201cOur family is deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick but take great comfort knowing he inspired so many,\u201d a family statement said. \u201cMillions of people worldwide have come to know Rick\u2019s story. We felt \u2013 and still feel \u2013 comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant.\u201d Slayman had been a patient in the hospital\u2019s transplant program for 11 years, he previously said in a statement. He received a kidney from a human donor in 2018, after living with diabetes and high blood pressure for many years. The kidney began to show signs of failure five years later, and he resumed dialysis in 2023. \u201cI saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,\u201d Slayman wrote in the statement. Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, director of the Legorreta Center for Clinical Transplant Tolerance, performed the groundbreaking operation in March to a round of applause in the operating room. The need for organs far exceeds the number available in the US. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are more than 100,000 people currently waiting for an organ donation. Experts have long been researching how to safely and successfully transplant animal organs into people, which they say could help solve the organ shortage. Before Slayman\u2019s transplant, just two transplants using pig organs had been completed \u2013\u00a0both heart transplants performed under compassionate use. Both patients died weeks after receiving the hearts. EGenesis, the biotech company providing the genetically edited pig kidney, called Slayman \u201ca true pioneer\u201d in a statement late Saturday night. \u201cWe are profoundly grateful to Mr. Slayman and his family and we will honor his legacy and invaluable contribution to science and medicine by continuing our efforts to advance xenotransplantation for the millions of patients globally in need of lifesaving organs,\u201d the company added. Slayman\u2019s family also thanked his care team at across Massachusetts General in a statement. \u201cAfter his transplant, Rick said that one of the reasons he underwent this procedure was to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive. Rick accomplished that goal and his hope and optimism will endure forever. His legacy will be one that inspires patients, researchers, and health care professionals everywhere,\u201d his family said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/health/pig-kidney-recipient-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "health"}}

The dead giveaway? It\u2019s the yummy, spicy, cheesy, neon-orange dust that coats each morsel and gets all over your fingers. Ditto for a frozen pizza and chicken nuggets. But what about a granola bar? An applesauce pouch? String cheese? Flavored yogurt? Surely these foods \u2014 snacks that millions of children and adults eat every day \u2014 are not bad, right? Well, it turns out that many fall under the category of ultraprocessed foods \u2014 depending on their exact ingredients. This type of food has been studied a lot lately, and the results aren\u2019t great. Ultraprocessed foods represent a relatively new way of categorizing foods. Proposed in 2009 by researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, the system, called NOVA, is based not on what kind of food it is \u2014 meat, grains, vegetables, etc. \u2014 but rather on how processed it is. NOVA separates foods into four groups, starting with natural and minimally processed foods in the first category to ultraprocessed foods, which use industrial formulations and manufacturing techniques, in the fourth. \u201cMy operating definition for ultraprocessed (foods) is you can\u2019t make it in your home kitchen because you don\u2019t have the machinery and you don\u2019t have the ingredients,\u201d food policy expert Dr. Marion Nestle told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell on the Chasing Life podcast recently. Nestle is the Paulette Goddard Professor of nutrition, food studies and public health, emerita, at New York University. Listen to more of the conversation between Nestle and Tirrell here. Ultraprocessed foods contain additives such as flavor enhancers, colors and thickeners \u2014 basically ingredients you wouldn\u2019t usually use in your cooking.\u00a0It makes them shelf-stable, easy to prepare (just heat and serve) and in many cases hard to resist. (The food industry pushes back on the NOVA system, saying there is no agreed-upon scientific consensus on the definition of ultraprocessed.) Due to a confluence of historical, regulatory and economic factors, Nestle said, food companies in the 1980s \u201cdid a lot of work on trying to figure out what flavor and texture and color combinations would be most attractive to people and started producing foods that would make them lots of money.\u201d She said tens of thousands of new products have hit store shelves since then. \u201cMost of them fail, but the ones that win, win big,\u201d Nestle said. Before you reach for that can of soda, bag of chips or frozen dinner, why not learn more about what you\u2019re eating? Here are five things to know about ultraprocessed foods: Ultraprocessed foods are linked to bad health outcomes Eating a lot of ultraprocessed foods isn\u2019t healthy. \u201cNow there have been more than 1,500 observational studies \u2014 all of them demonstrating a consistent finding, which is that eating ultraprocessed foods is linked to obesity,\u00a0type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, bad outcome from Covid-19, overall mortality,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cAny bad health problem you can think of that\u2019s related to diet is related specifically to ultraprocessed foods.\u201d The most recent study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, analyzed more than 30 years\u2019 worth of data and found that eating ultraprocessed foods was associated with a 4% higher risk of death by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths. Other studies have linked ultraprocessed foods to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Nestle pointed out that these studies have been observational and not designed to prove causation \u2014 that ultraprocessed foods caused these bad health outcomes. \u201cYou can do that when you have a controlled clinical trial,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd guess what? We have one.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods cause weight gain That one randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that ultraprocessed foods actually caused people to gain weight. These types of studies are not easy or cheap to undertake, which is why they are not done more often. To conduct this one, Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, had 20 volunteers spend four weeks living at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. For two weeks, they ate a diet made up of 80% healthy ultraprocessed foods (think yogurt and whole wheat bread, not chips and soda). For the other two weeks, they ate a diet that contained no ultraprocessed foods. The diets were matched, among other things, for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients. Participants did not know what exactly the study was measuring. \u201cWe basically just asked people, you know, just eat as much or as little of the food that you\u2019d like,\u201d Hall told Tirrell. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be trying to change your weight, (you) shouldn\u2019t be trying to gain weight or lose weight.\u00a0Just eat to the same level of appetite as you normally would.\u201d Researchers found that when the participants were on the ultraprocessed diet, they ate about 500 calories more per day than when they were on the minimally processed one. This difference in calories translated quickly to the scale. Participants gained on average 2 pounds during the two weeks on the ultraprocessed diet and lost 2 pounds on the minimally processed one. And their blood work showed lower markers of inflammation when they were on the latter. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with nutrition research, you have no idea what an important finding this is,\u201d said Nestle, who was not involved in the study. \u201cFive hundred calories is huge.\u201d Hall said it\u2019s unclear what drives people to consume more calories when they are on an ultraprocessed diet. \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re really interested in now,\u201d he said, \u201cis to figure out what the mechanisms were.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods are hard to avoid Ultraprocessed foods are everywhere, and most of us consume them without even realizing it \u2014 even when you think you are eating something relatively healthy, such as baked potato chips or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, researchers found that ultraprocessed foods make up more than half of American adults\u2019 diets. For US children, that percentage is even higher, at 67%. Ultraprocessed foods are cheap and convenient Yup, that\u2019s right: Truly eating \u201cclean\u201d costs more. \u201cTo actually create the minimally processed menu, it was about 40% more expensive than the ultraprocessed menu,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even account for the time that it takes to make the foods, right? So, all those factors probably play a huge role in \u2026 the foods that we choose to eat in the real world.\u201d Not all ultraprocessed foods are bad Some ultraprocessed foods can provide important nutrients, such as whole wheat bread and yogurt. And others, in Hall\u2019s study, were shown not to increase caloric intake. \u201cThe snacks were neutral in terms of how many calories (the participants) ate,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhich goes to show that not all ultraprocessed foods necessarily drive this effect.\u201d Hall\u2019s team is conducting a new study to tease out which ultraprocessed foods are harmful and which are neutral, or even healthy. Americans may soon get more help sorting through the health effects of ultraprocessed foods. The US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration will soon issue new Dietary Guidelines, which are updated every five years. Nestle said that the scientific advisory committee guiding this process has been asked to consider the connection between ultraprocessed foods and poor health outcomes. We hope these five things help you understand ultraprocessed foods a bit more.
