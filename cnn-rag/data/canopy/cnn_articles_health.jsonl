{"id": "2024_07_01_health_worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness", "text": "Eating higher levels of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespans by more than 10%, according to a new, unpublished study of over 500,000 people whom researchers followed for nearly three decades. The risk went up to 15% for men and 14% for women once the data was adjusted, said study lead author Erikka Loftfield, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Asked about their consumption of 124 foods, people in the top 90th percentile of ultraprocessed food consumption said overly processed drinks topped their list. \u201cDiet soft drinks were the key contributor to ultraprocessed food consumption. The second one was sugary soft drinks,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cBeverages are a very important component of the diet and the contribution to ultraprocessed food.\u201d Refined grains such as ultraprocessed breads and baked goods ranked next in popularity, the study found. \u201cThis is one more large, long-duration cohort study confirming the association between UPF (ultraprocessed food) intake and all-cause mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Carlos Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health at Brazil\u2019s University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in an email. Monteiro coined the term ultraprocessed food and created the NOVA food classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made. Monteiro was not involved in the study, but several members of the NOVA classification system were coauthors. The NOVA classification system sorts foods from unprocessed or minimally processed \u2014 whole foods such as fruits and vegetables \u2014 to ultraprocessed foods such as deli meat and sausage. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food appetizing. Health risks linked to processed meats and soft drinks The preliminary study, presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago, analyzed dietary data gathered in 1995 from nearly 541,000 Americans ages 50 to 71 who were participating in the US National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. Researchers linked the dietary data to death rates over the next 20 to 30 years. Compared with those in the bottom 10% of ultraprocessed food consumption, people who ate the most overly processed food were more likely to die from heart disease or diabetes, according to the study. Unlike other studies, however, researchers found no rise in cancer-related death. Some ultraprocessed foods carried more of a risk than others, Loftfield said: \u201cHighly processed meat and soft drinks were a couple of the subgroups of ultraprocessed food most strongly associated with mortality risk.\u201d Diet drinks are considered ultraprocessed food because they contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium and stevia, and additional additives not found in whole foods. Diet beverages have been linked to a higher risk of dying early from cardiovascular disease as well as the onset of dementia,\u00a0type 2 diabetes,\u00a0obesity, stroke and\u00a0metabolic syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes. The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans already recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to premature death and the development of chronic disease. A March 2019 study found women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages\u00a0\u2014 defined as a standard glass, bottle or can \u2014 had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared with women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk. Processed meats such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, ham, corned beef, jerky and deli meats are also not recommended; studies have linked red and processed meats to bowel and stomach cancers, heart disease, diabetes and early death from any cause. \u201cThe evidence from this new study indicates that processed meat may be one of the most unhealthy foods, but people do not tend to view ham or chicken nuggets as UPF (ultraprocessed food),\u201d said Rosie Green,\u00a0a professor of environment, food and health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in a statement. She was not involved in the study. The study found that people who consumed the most ultraprocessed food were younger and heavier, and had an overall poorer quality of diet than those who ate fewer ultraprocessed foods. However, the increased health risk could not be explained by these differences, because even people with normal weight and better diets were also at some risk for early death from ultraprocessed foods, the study found. \u201cStudies which utilize food classification systems such as NOVA, which focus on the degree of processing, as opposed to the nutritional composition should be considered with caution,\u201d said Carla Saunders, president of the \u200eCalorie Control Council, an industry association, in an email. \u201cSuggesting the elimination of dietary tools like no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages, with proven benefits in the management of comorbidities like obesity and diabetes, is harmful and irresponsible,\u201d Saunders said. Results may underestimate risk One key limitation of the study was that the dietary data was gathered only once some 30 years ago, Green said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how dietary habits might have changed between then and now.\u201d Ultraprocessed food manufacturing has exploded since the mid-1990s, however, with estimates that as nearly 60% of the average American\u2019s daily calories come from ultraprocessed foods. That\u2019s not surprising, considering as much as 70% of the food in any grocery store may be ultraprocessed. \u201cIf anything, we are probably underestimating ultraprocessed food consumption in our study because we\u2019re being very conservative,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cThe intake is likely to have only grown over the years.\u201d In fact, a study published in May that found similar results \u2014 a higher risk of premature death and death from cardiovascular disease in over 100,000 health professionals who ate ultraprocessed foods \u2014 accessed ultraprocessed food intake every four years and found consumption doubled between the mid-1980s and 2018. \u201cFor example, the daily intake of packaged savory snacks and dairy-based desserts, such as ice cream, has essentially doubled since the \u201890s,\u201d said the lead author of the May study, Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIn our study, just as in this new one, the positive association was mainly driven by a few subgroups, including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d Song said. \u201cHowever, all categories of ultraprocessed food were associated with increased risk.\u201d Choosing more minimally processed foods is a one way to limit ultraprocessed foods in one\u2019s diet, Loftfield said. \u201cWe should really be focusing on eating diets that are rich in whole foods,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if the food is ultraprocessed, then look to see the levels of sodium and added sugars and try to make the best decision possible using the nutrition facts label.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

Pisano\u00a0received the transplant on April 12, but the organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed May 29. Her case was the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the animal\u2019s thymus gland. Pisano\u00a0was brave and altruistic, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute,\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday. She had said\u00a0during a news conference after the procedure that even if the organ transplant didn\u2019t work for her, it might for the next person. \u201cAt least somebody is going to benefit from it,\u201d she said. Montgomery said Tuesday that \u201cLisa\u2019s contributions to medicine, surgery, and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. \u2026 Lisa helped bring us closer to realizing a future where someone does not have to die for another person to live.\u201d Every eight minutes, another person is added to the transplant waiting list, and 17 people from this list die each day waiting for an organ, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Xenotransplantation, which involves using organs from other species, is a potential solution to the shortage of available donor organs, experts say. Doctors in the US perform xenotransplants in rare cases, with permission from the US Food and Drug Administration. For Pisano, the permission came through the agency\u2019s expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policy, which allows terminally ill patients who have no other treatment options to access experimental medical products. Due to Pisano\u2019s heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, she couldn\u2019t have a standard transplant, NYU Langone said in a news release. Before the xenotransplant, Pisano\u00a0said,\u00a0she had \u201ctried everything else\u201d and, with the surgery, was hoping to spend time with her grandkids and play with them. The pig kidney she received was genetically altered to evade human antibodies, which typically detect and attack foreign organs. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed beneath the pig kidney\u2019s cover to further help Pisano\u2019s body accept the organ. However, the kidney was removed in May after it was determined that it was \u201cno longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen,\u201d Montgomery said at the time. Pisano\u2019s \u201cbravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs,\u201d he said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cHer legacy as a pioneer will live on and she will forever be remembered for her courage and good nature.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk", "text": "GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy may help lower the risk of certain cancers, a new study suggests. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting 13 types of cancer, and the risk increases the longer a person is overweight and the more excess weight they gain. About 40% of new cancer diagnoses are associated with excess weight, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, there were about 170 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people, CDC data shows. But a study published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with a class of GLP-1 drugs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with 10 of the 13 obesity-associated cancers than those who were taking insulin. The risk was cut by more than half for gallbladder cancer, meningioma, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, a kind of liver cancer. It was also significantly reduced for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and kidney cancer. Excess weight can cause changes in the body such as long-lasting inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones that can cause cancer, according to the CDC. And GLP-1 medications interact with systems related to insulin production. The new findings that link GLP-1 treatment to reduced risk of some cancers \u201ccompare favorably\u201d with similar effects linked to intensive lifestyle intervention and metabolic-bariatric surgery that have been found in other trials, the study authors wrote. However, the research found that GLP-1 treatment was not associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, which CDC data shows is the most common type of cancer associated with obesity. Risk was also not reduced for stomach cancer or thyroid cancer. In fact, other research has found that GLP-1s may interact with the body\u2019s insulin production in ways that negatively affect the thyroid, and the study authors note that patients should be aware of potential thyroid-related risks that are included on the medication\u2019s packaging. The new study also found that the risk of cancer diagnosis for people with type 2 diabetes was not different among those who were treated with GLP-1s compared with those where were being treated with metformin. In fact, the risk of diagnosis with kidney cancer was higher among those using GLP-1s than those on metformin. For this study, researchers from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and the MetroHealth System analyzed more than a decade of medical records for nearly 1.7 million people with type 2 diabetes. More information is needed about how reduced cancer risk may relate to the scale of weight loss, but the findings provide \u201cpreliminary evidence of the potential benefit of GLP-1RAs for cancer prevention in high-risk populations and support further preclinical and clinical studies,\u201d the study authors wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_health_cardiac-arrest-anxiety-depression-women-wellness", "text": "The care that comes after a cardiac arrest should include supporting mental health \u2014 especially for women, new research has found. In the five years that followed an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or OHCA, in which the heart suddenly stops beating, women were more likely than men to receive medication to treat anxiety or depression, according to a report published Monday in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. \u201cWe recommend monitoring of social and mental well being in individuals who survived an OHCA, not just directly after the event but also in the long-term,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author, Dr. Robin Smits, in an email. \u201cThis seems particularly relevant in women but will likely also benefit men.\u201d Researchers analyzed data from 259 women and 996 men in the Netherlands who survived at least 30 days after a cardiac arrest that took place outside a hospital between 2009 and 2015. The team compared the data on patients\u2019 socioeconomic status and mental health with those in the general population, according to the study. The amount of women taking anxiety or depression medications after cardiac arrest was also greater than in women in the general population, said Smits, a postdoctoral researcher at Amsterdam University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \u201cFurther investigation may shed light into which interventions are necessary for physicians to be able to help individuals thrive after OHCA,\u201d Smits said. Researchers have been learning more and more about how closely connected mental and cardiac health are, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. One in five people hospitalized for heart attack (a blockage of blood flow to the heart) or chest pain develop major depression \u2014 about four times the rate in the general population, according to the\u00a0American Heart Association. One in three\u00a0stroke survivors become depressed, along with\u00a0up to half\u00a0of those who undergo heart bypass surgery, past studies found. \u201cMental health and stress make cardiac events worse and more frequent, and we know that cardiac events make mental health worse,\u201d he said. Just the start delving into mental and cardiac health This new study investigates an important topic but it\u2019s just the beginning, Freeman said. While the authors did account for factors that might skew the results, there are a lot of them, he said. For example, the research was only able to look at the number of people prescribed medication \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they were the only people experiencing anxiety or depression, Smits said. \u201cThe results may also in part reflect that men may less often seek care for mental health and are perhaps less frequently assessed and prescribed medication,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cMoreover, the data do not fully reflect lived experience, such as forced changes in job responsibilities or effect in other areas of life.\u201d But this study highlights an important concept: that men and women often experience the world differently, and providers need to be conscious of that to give everyone their best care,\u00a0 Freeman said. Checking in on emotional well-being The biggest lesson of this latest research is for loved ones and health care providers to check in on people who have experienced cardiac arrest, Freeman said. \u201cIs there a strategy that we should be taking that\u2019s more proactive after people have a cardiac arrest, to sort of make sure that they\u2019re back on their feet, that they understand that they are amazing survivors in many cases?\u201d he said. Even if the doctor you are following up with isn\u2019t a psychiatrist, it is important to keep an open line of communication about your well-being \u2014 and then you may be referred to a mental health professional, he said. Fortunately, there are a lot of strategies to improve mental health. Past studies have shown cognitive behavioral therapy, regular exercise and proper sleep to be effective tools for managing emotional welfare. \u201cAs a physician, how do we help people avoid or treat these problems as they arise? Or even before they arise?\u201d Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/health/cardiac-arrest-anxiety-depression-women-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

Despite carrying the food back to her bed to devour night after night, she didn\u2019t have a clue about what she had done until the next morning. \u201cI would wake up with these containers or wrappers from an entire box of crackers or cookies on my bed or by the side of my bed,\u201d said Jill, now 62, who lives an hour away from Minneapolis. Due to stigma and misunderstanding about sleep eating, CNN\u00a0agreed not to use her last name. \u201cA lot of people think this condition is, \u2018Oh, you get up and you have a snack and then you go back to bed.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not what this is. This is a whole other animal,\u201d Jill said of her unconscious nocturnal behaviors. \u201cI don\u2019t just get up once and take a bite of this or that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can eat a whole package of cookies, then get up again and have four bowls of cereal, then get up again and have an entire box of graham crackers. And it is always junky junk food, never, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have an apple.\u2019\u201d Over time, nights of poor nutrition and dysfunctional sleep can take a toll, Jill said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how sick you feel,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten up countless times during the night, so you\u2019re not rested, and you\u2019ve consumed enormous amounts of garbage food. Then you wake up and boom, you have to function the rest of the day. And that\u2019s what I did for years and years and years.\u201d Jill is living with sleep-related eating disorder, also known as sleep eating \u2014 an arousal condition in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Sleep eating is a parasomnia, an abnormal or unusual behavior during sleep, similar to sleepwalking, sleep talking, sleep terrors, and sleep sex, or sexsomnia. \u201cOf all the parasomnias, sleep-related eating disorder has the worst impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThese people have disinhibited eating almost every night. They gain weight. They feel miserable in the morning. It affects their whole life and is just horrendous,\u201d said Schenck, who specializes in treating parasomnias. While it may seem as if people are acting out their dreams, parasomnias most often occur during the slowest, deepest stage of sleep called delta sleep, he said. \u201cSomething triggers an alarm in the central nervous system, and your body is activated while your cognition is deeply asleep,\u201d he said. No control or restraint In the mixed state of sleep and wakefulness that is sleep eating, the ancient brain takes over, searching out foods that might satisfy the body\u2019s need for gratification. Ultraprocessed foods such as candy, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, chips and crackers are preferred choices during sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any control, you don\u2019t have any restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can consume foods they\u2019re allergic to and then have an allergic reaction. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. \u201cAnd because they choose foods like peanut butter, chocolate, leftover banana cream pie or pasta \u2014 fattening, overly processed comfort foods \u2014 they can develop or aggravate their diabetes or hypertension.\u201d Of all the parasomnias, sleep eating is the most challenging to treat, with a success rate of only two-thirds, Schenck said. In comparison, treatment success is more than 75% for patients with sexsomnia, sleepwalking or night terrors. \u201cYou can have someone who\u2019s been a sleepwalker for many years, but once they start eating during the night, before long, eating becomes the only sleepwalking behavior,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s something irresistible about consuming food during the night and sleepwalking \u2014 who wants to rearrange the furniture or just wander around the house when you can go eat?\u201d \u2018The doctors didn\u2019t understand it\u2019 Married in her early 20s, Jill continued to eat in bed at night alongside her new husband. Thankfully, she said, he was a heavy sleeper. \u201cHe would wake up in the morning to a bed full of crumbs and wrappers and say, \u2018What is wrong with you?\u2019 He thought I was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand. And I didn\u2019t understand because I wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose.\u201d Jill\u2019s health suffered. Not only did she gain weight from all the extra calories, but the quality of her diet dropped dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m a healthy eater, but I often felt so sick throughout the day, the last thing I wanted was food, even healthy food,\u201d Jill said. \u201cWho would when you ate the equivalent of six Thanksgiving dinners back-to-back every night?\u201d Embarrassed by her behavior, Jill kept her sleep habits to herself for decades. It wasn\u2019t until her son developed a disorder called idiopathic hypersomnolence, in which he would sleep for 18 or more hours at a time, that she began asking doctors about her own condition. Unfortunately, she said, broaching the topic didn\u2019t go well. \u201cMany doctors I spoke to had no idea what was wrong with me, or they just didn\u2019t get it. One doctor said, \u2018Well, maybe have a piece of bread before you go to bed.\u2019 Oh, right, that\u2019s sure to solve it,\u201d Jill said disdainfully. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this disorder or aren\u2019t living with it, you\u2019re not going to have a full understanding, but I really thought that doctors would know more,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the problem was then I felt alone, believing something was wrong with me \u2014 because the doctors didn\u2019t understand it, it must be my fault.\u201d Causes of sleep eating After years of disappointing doctor visits, Jill discovered Schenck\u2019s treatment center in Minneapolis. For the first time, she underwent a lab sleep study, which showed that she had restless legs syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes unpleasant sensations in the legs along with an irresistible urge to move them.\u00a0The sensations often begin in the evenings and can last throughout the night. \u201cIt\u2019s now become restless body syndrome,\u201d Jill said. \u201cIt\u2019s a twitching, almost like a bug is crawling inside that travels through my whole body.\u201d To ease the constant twitching during the evenings before sleep, Jill may walk around the house, flailing her arms and legs in a desperate bid to stop the sensation. \u201cYou just become so miserable, so uncomfortable, that you\u2019re swinging your body parts, kind of trying to tire them out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some nights that the twitching is just, oh, I can\u2019t even tell you, I\u2019m in tears it\u2019s so bad.\u201d Restless legs syndrome is one of four potential causes of sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou can develop sleep eating from sleepwalking, from sleep apnea, from certain insomnia medications, or like Jill, from restless legs syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those can be the ultimate causes of sleep-related eating disorder, and that\u2019s why in medicine, we call that a final common pathway disorder. All roads lead to Rome basically.\u201d Jill, however, was sleep eating long before restless legs syndrome became a key complaint. Research has shown sleep eating may occur first, Schenck said. \u201cWe studied a group of sleep-related eating patients in the lab, and they had periodic limb movements along with the sleep eating,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, lo and behold, five or 10 years later they developed classic restless legs syndrome. So sleep-related eating can be the first indicator of future restless legs syndrome.\u201d Other risk factors for sleep eating include a family history of eating disorders of any kind as well as the person\u2019s sex, Schenck said. \u201cSleep-related eating is like 70% female predominant, while sexsomnia, for example, is 80% male predominant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that society\u2019s emphasis on dieting may contribute; if someone restricts their eating during the daytime and doesn\u2019t get enough calories, that may drive more sleep-related eating.\u201d Jill\u2019s mother was always on a diet, she recalls, and wonders if that factor might have contributed to her behavior. \u201cYou know, the big thing was you had to be thin, and I wonder if as a kid I was picking up on it. But I really don\u2019t know,\u201d Jill said. Families may try to help their loved ones by waking them while they are sleep eating, Schenck said. At times, however, doing so can backfire. \u201cThe person may get irritable and angry and say, \u2018Don\u2019t stop me from doing what I have to do.\u2019 I once treated a single mother with three teenage kids who paid her three children to sleep in sleeping bags in the kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she would come into the kitchen during the night, her children would say, \u2018Stop, you paid us to have you stop!\u2019 Guess what happened? She got so frustrated she paid her children more money to go back to their own beds and let her eat in peace.\u201d \u2018Just don\u2019t give up\u2019 It has been more than 20 years since Jill first visited Schenck\u2019s clinic. Today, her restless legs syndrome and sleep-related eating disorder are mostly under control, she said, thanks to a cocktail of three medications Schenck prescribed. \u201cI take them early at night because it takes awhile for the meds to work \u2014 even Dr. Schenck was surprised I take them as early as I do to get my system to calm down by bedtime. \u201cThe medications work 95% of the time, but then I will have the occasional bad day and night,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t work, it\u2019s just exhausting.\u201d She does her best to keep overly processed trigger foods out of her home, a desire that is at times sabotaged by the treats she has on hand when her grandchildren visit. But life is enormously better than before she began treatment. \u201cI\u2019m very, very, very grateful that I finally found someone who understands what I am going through,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI know there are thousands of people out there suffering just like me, and my heart goes out to them. It is a tough journey to go through.\u201d Her advice to others? Be your own best advocate, she said. Do research and read what you can about the disorder so you know the right questions to ask the doctor. And above all, she said, request a prescription for a sleep study to find out what is triggering the behavior. \u201cDon\u2019t let doctors put you down, blow you off or make you feel bad,\u201d she said. \u201cOne doctor might not want to do a sleep study, so find another doctor that will. \u201cJust keep fighting until you get the right doctor. Get a second opinion, even a third opinion if you think you need to. Just don\u2019t give up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/sleep-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_health_biden-debate-cognitive-tests", "text": "President Joe Biden said Friday that his poor performance in last week\u2019s debate was a bad night but not evidence of a serious condition. \u201cI have medical doctors traveling everywhere. Every president does, as you know. Medical doctors from the best of the world travel with me everywhere I go,\u201d Biden told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos. \u201cI have an ongoing assessment of what I\u2019m doing. They don\u2019t hesitate to tell me if they think there\u2019s something else wrong.\u201d Biden said he spoke with his doctor after the debate and was told, \u201cyou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d Being president, he said, means \u201cI get a full neurological test every day.\u201d But doctors who work with aging patients say there\u2019s no single moment or test that determines a person\u2019s mental fitness or ability to function. In-depth evaluations can provide more answers, including ruling out potential problems. Such tests might start with short questionnaires, then expand to physical exams, blood tests, brain imaging, lengthy interviews with the individual and conversations with family members and friends. In an analysis published Friday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta urged the president to undergo detailed cognitive and neurological tests and to make those results public. Such testing \u201ccan help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning,\u201d Gupta wrote. When asked on Friday whether he\u2019s had cognitive tests and an exam by a neurologist, Biden said no. \u201cNo one said I had to. \u2026 They said I\u2019m good,\u201d the president said. Biden gave no indication he would be willing to have such tests conducted in the aftermath of his debate performance. Effects of typical aging Most people who are aging normally will experience some cognitive changes, but when and how much varies from person to person. Slow, age-related cognitive decline starts around age 27, studies show, even for healthy and well-educated people. A person\u2019s reasoning and problem-solving skills, along with their ability to maintain the thread of a conversation, can get tougher with age, but not so much that it impairs what doctors consider normal functioning. \u201cEvery aging researcher will tell you, though, that not everything declines as you get older, and not everything declines at an equal rate,\u201d said Dr. Charan Ranganath, a professor of psychology and neuroscience and the director of the Dynamic Memory Lab at the University of California, Davis. For example, the ability to remember facts \u2014 an essential skill for a president \u2014 doesn\u2019t disappear with age, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re slower to pull it up, and you\u2019re more likely to struggle to pull up the facts when you need it,\u201d Ranganath said. And it\u2019s not just memory that changes with age, said Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University. \u201cIt\u2019s reasoning and sociability and attention and orientation, and emotional stability and judgment and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cSome get impaired with age, and some actually get better with age, such as vocabulary.\u201d A person\u2019s moral\u00a0reasoning and judgment or their capacity for compassion and empathy will not necessarily decline, Ranganath added. Unless there is some kind of cognitive impairment, those aspects of personality can improve in some people with normal aging. \u201cSo, again, pretty important for a job like president,\u201d Ranganath added. Cognitive impairment \u2014 a loss of memory and other mental abilities that affect daily life \u2014 is different and is not considered normal or inevitable with aging. It occurs in 12% to 18% of people older than 65 and is more prevalent with advancing age, Rowe said. By age 80, more than 25% of people may have some mild cognitive impairment. They may start to lose things and miss appointments, \u201coccurrences that could be characterized as impairing your function,\u201d Rowe said. A minority in this group will go on to develop dementia each year, he said. And some may adapt, maybe seeming to have improved function. \u201cThey always put the key in the same place. They write down all their appointments,\u201d Rowe said. Screening for cognitive impairment To screen for cognitive impairment, a person\u2019s primary care physician will often start with the Mini Mental State Exam, known as the MMSE, or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, also called the MoCA. The MMSE is a 5- to 10-minute 11-question assessment that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. Former President Donald Trump, who has faced questions about his cognitive function, has repeatedly said he \u201caced\u201d the MoCA \u2014 a 30-point test that takes about 10 minutes. It evaluates the ability to concentrate and tests executive function, memory, language, conceptual thinking and orientation, the ability to do calculations and the ability to organize and manipulate spatial information to create a design. Both ask for simple information, like what the date is and where the participant is, and ask to count backward from 100 using a particular number. Both tests ask a person to draw. The MMSE asks the participant to identify particular objects in the room and to take a piece of paper in their right hand, fold it in half and put it on the floor. For the MoCA, the person will be told five words and then asked to repeat them in five minutes. The tests are not in-depth. Ranganath describes the MMSE as a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d: Unless someone has established language problems, he said, \u201cbasically, you have to be seriously cognitively impaired\u201d to do poorly, \u201cespecially for somebody who is functioning at a high level, like a high-level politician.\u201d The MoCA, he said, is good at detecting when someone has mild cognitive impairment. It\u2019s a test for \u201cwhen people can really tell there\u2019s a memory problem, and that\u2019s often when they\u2019ll be talking to a doctor about it,\u201d Ranganath said \u2014 and perhaps seeking more detailed results. More detailed cognitive tests If a doctor or family member suspects more serious cognitive problems, a person may be referred to specialists who can do further tests that may take one or two days to complete. Usually, the person will be referred to a behavioral neurologist who specializes in aging and dementia and non-dementia diagnosis, as well as a neuropsychologist and possibly a social worker who will meet with them and their family, according to Dr. Emily Rogalski, a professor of neurology who runs the University of Chicago\u2019s Health Aging & Alzheimer\u2019s Research Care Center. \u201cPart of those evaluations will look at the overall health of the individual, from neurologic health to also cognitive health,\u201d she said. Cognitive health includes how a person can learn, think and remember. Neurological health involves the nervous system. Neurological disorders like Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s, or even a headache, can affect cognitive functions. But other conditions can have an impact too, such as an infection or tumor. \u201cThe neuropsychologist is able to do an in-depth evaluation of the strengths and challenges that an individual may be experiencing and start to understand the interactions between those strengths and challenges,\u201d Rogalski said. Testing could also include blood tests or imaging that may tell doctors what\u2019s going on in the brain itself. There will also be a physical examination. If a person has a history of congestive heart failure, a doctor may do a cardiac exam to check for deterioration that could contribute to cognitive issues, said Dr. Brad Dickerson, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and an associate neurologist who sees patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cYou have to take all that into consideration when you\u2019re trying to figure out why their cognitive functioning may be different than it was,\u201d he said. At this level of testing, part of the evaluation will also include a report from people close to the patient. \u201cThat sometimes is a spouse or a close family member who can comment on whether the individual is experiencing significant change from their previous level of function and whether that change is interfering with what we call activities of daily living,\u201d Rogalski said. Who should get tested \u2014\u00a0and when Dickerson said patients will often ask him when they should get tested. His answer: It depends. If, for example, an 80-year-old tells him that they keep forgetting the name of an actor in a movie they\u2019ve just seen or that they go into another part of the house to get three things and remember only two, and if the problem has gotten more annoying but over time isn\u2019t too disruptive, they could get a baseline cognitive and neurological assessment in the office. He said he would not be worried that this was a sign of a progressive disorder that needs to be diagnosed and treated. \u201cThere are elements of the history that would raise a doctor\u2019s concerns about a significant problem or would reduce the doctor\u2019s concerns about a significant problem,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cSometimes, you can\u2019t be sure of that until you sit down in the office and interview people.\u201d Rowe said he tells concerned family members and patients that the time to get tested is when they start asking whether they should. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in getting tested,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have a baseline so that you can get tested again in a year or two if you think things are getting worse.\u201d Testing, he said, should be able to tell them if they have issues that impair their function. But people shouldn\u2019t worry if they can\u2019t remember someone\u2019s name. Rowe, who served as chairman and CEO of the insurance company Aetna and was president and CEO of Mount Sinai NYU Health, believes that testing should be the default for people in several roles: presidential candidates, regardless of age; US Supreme Court justices; airline pilots. He says the public shouldn\u2019t get \u201ccarried away\u201d with scores: If one candidate\u2019s score is higher than the others, that doesn\u2019t mean that one is more qualified to be president, he said. \u201cBut if somebody fails a test,\u201d Rowe said, \u201cI think that it\u2019s something that people should know.\u201d Testing doesn\u2019t always lead to a dementia diagnosis. Addressing other health problems, such as a sleep disorder or medications interacting with each other, may lead to improvement. Patients may see symptoms reduced through lifestyle changes. If someone is found to have early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s, new treatments can slow the progression of disease. Distinguishing between cognitive impairment and typical age-related cognitive decline \u201care not trivial questions,\u201d and it\u2019s not something a family doctor can typically do, Ranganath said. Even in-depth testing may not give a clear indication of what a person is capable of now or in the near future. \u201cThere is also a bit of an art in figuring out how to translate someone\u2019s test results into a statement about real world functioning (i.e., whether a person is fit to drive, live independently, do a demanding job, etc.),\u201d Ranganath wrote in an email. \u201cMany times, the recommendation is obvious, but on occasion, it can be hard to tell and there are no clear cut answers. And if someone seems relatively competent at the moment, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they will be doing so well 2-4 years later.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang and John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/health/biden-debate-cognitive-tests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_science_strawberry-full-moon-june-scn", "text": "Despite its name, June\u2019s full moon will not look like a strawberry. But the bright orb could still turn heads Friday night with an appearance that is bigger and more colorful than the average moon. The full moon \u2014 which will reach the crest of its fullness\u00a0at 9:08\u00a0p.m. ET Friday\u00a0\u2014 comes one day after the\u00a0summer solstice, the day of the year when the sun appears the highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. Since a full moon is opposite the sun, this strawberry moon will shine lower in the sky than usual, according to\u00a0NASA. Because of this \u201clower than average path across the sky,\u201d the full moon could have an \u201corange- or amber-colored appearance, for the same reason sunsets appear orange or reddish,\u201d said Preston Dyches, a science communicator with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. Dyches said the effect is the result of the moon\u2019s reflected light having to travel a longer distance throughout Earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering away most blue wavelengths (which are shorter than red wavelengths). Native American tribes across North America gave the strawberry moon its name to mark the in-season ripeness of strawberries, according to\u00a0The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The moon\u2019s low placement in the sky could also cause the orb to appear bigger than usual, according to\u00a0NASA,\u00a0due to an effect dubbed the moon illusion. Scientists don\u2019t really know why this optical illusion happens, but it\u2019s believed to be a combination of how our brain processes visual information and the moon\u2019s size in comparison with smaller objects near the horizon, such as trees or the roofs of houses. For optimal viewing, Dyches recommends looking when the moon is rising or setting to see the effects of the moon illusion. No equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features, according to\u00a0NASA\u2019s Moon Viewing Guide. \u201cWhenever something beautiful about the natural world can be experienced from your doorstep, it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time,\u201d Dyches said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to marvel at the sight of another giant world. \u2026 I like to gaze up and think of it as a place people will live and work someday.\u201d How to see the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019 in the night sky Because the moon appears full for three days a month surrounding its peak, the strawberry moon will be visible to almost everyone worldwide. However, it will be more difficult to observe for those farther north, such as in Alaska or Denmark, where the low-traversing moon will only briefly rise above the horizon, Dyches said. Besides the full moon, those in the Northern Hemisphere can spot the \u201cSummer Triangle,\u201d an arrangement of three bright stars whose presence in the sky symbolizes summertime in the north, said Dyches, who also produces the space agency\u2019s monthly sky-watching highlights video called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up.\u201d To find the triangular pattern, it is easiest to look for the brightest of the three stars, Vega, which will be near the east in the sky, according to EarthSky. The second brightest, Altair, will be to the lower right, and the star Deneb, to the lower left of Vega, will finish off the sides of the triangle. Those away from bright city lights can spot the center of the Milky Way as a \u201chazy band of dim clouds arching across the sky,\u201d and the constellation Scorpius can be seen as it \u201cpoints the way to the galaxy\u2019s core,\u201d Dyches added. Remaining moons of 2024 There are six more full moons set to shine bright in the sky this year,\u00a0according to EarthSky. Here are the remaining full moons of 2024 and their peak dates: July 21: Buck moon August 19: Sturgeon moon September 17: Harvest moon October 17: Hunter\u2019s moon November 15: Beaver moon December 15: Cold moon", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/science/strawberry-full-moon-june-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_travel_van-life-travel-cec-wellness", "text": "Home is where you are. Home is where you make it. Home on the range. Home is \u2026 in a camper van? Absolutely! When I tried camper van life for the first time, I went all in. For three weeks, my husband and I drove a kitted-out, circa 2012 Ford Econoline van across North America, traveling from northern New Jersey to Los Angeles as we wound our way along the length of Route 66 in November 2019. It was a bold move, but I knew it was the most cost-efficient and efficient-efficient way to see as much of \u201cthe Mother Road\u201d as we could. My hope was that by renting a camper van, we\u2019d save money on purchased meals and hotel rooms and also feel more immersed in the journey and deeply connected to each town we visited. Our first night in the Bloomington, Illinois, Walmart parking lot was a little nerve-racking. I lay in my sleeping bag, listening to the activity beyond the van and wondering if we could handle this adventure. But after the first successful sleepover, we quickly settled into a routine. We\u2019d wake up each morning for a quick bathroom run and even shower at some of the surprisingly luxurious recreational vehicle parks we patronized. Then we\u2019d cook breakfast on our camp stove at the rear of the van and hit the road by 8:30 or 9 a.m. After a day covering roughly 130 miles and experiencing the historic sites, local museums, former filling stations and proudly kitschy roadside attractions along Route 66, we\u2019d make sure to arrive at our nightly destination by 4:30 p.m. \u2014 sundown in November comes early. By the time we dropped off the van near Los Angeles International Airport in late November, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a new but dear friend on the last day of summer camp. We\u2019d unwind, explore the sights of the town, treat ourselves to dinner away from the van, then bunk down in our sleeping bags and do it all again the next day. (We spent two-thirds of the trip sleeping in the van and the other third in historic lodgings along the route, such as Boots Court in Carthage, Missouri, and the El Rancho in Gallup, New Mexico.) The benefits of camper van travel Now, I\u2019m not saying you must spend weeks on an epic road trip to fully experience the joy of a camper van. And I\u2019m certainly not saying you need to sell all your possessions and become a full-time van lifer \u2014 I\u2019m grateful to return to my house and my cats after every trip. But even a few days of traveling and living in a camper van can give you a whole new perspective on yourself and the world around you. When you\u2019re in a camper van, everything you need is within reach \u2014 to an extent. I loved the challenge of condensing our lives into approximately 75 square feet and finding creative ways to live comfortably but efficiently. The morning coffee? It\u2019s right there. Your outfit for the day? Just reach behind you. If you need to change your shoes into hiking boots, grab a raincoat for an unexpected downpour, refuel with a quick snack or recharge with a 20-minute power nap, you don\u2019t need to go far. And you don\u2019t have to repack your bags to leave a hotel every morning. After the first night, I embraced the security and sanctuary of the van, knowing that whatever we had was around us. If we couldn\u2019t find it right away, it wasn\u2019t lost. We had exactly everything we needed \u2014 everything except, well, a bathroom, which brings me to the next life-changing aspect of a camper van. Camper van life makes you brave and gets you out there, interacting with others and connecting with the world. You\u2019re always in the environment, not separated by hotel corridors and lobbies. You\u2019re discovering creative places to stay for the night, looking forward to chatting with bartenders during the nightly dinner at a local restaurant or just fielding questions from strangers about the van and your trip. During our Route 66 adventure, our van prompted exchanges and allowed us to have moments we would likely have missed in a rental car. In Arcadia, Oklahoma, we stopped by Pops 66 Soda Ranch and struck up a conversation with a woman admiring our brightly painted camper van. She told us about one of the chairs at the nearby Oklahoma City National Memorial representing a boy named Zackary who loved collecting pennies. The next morning, we found Zackary\u2019s chair and placed a penny on it for him. Because the van functioned as a full campsite rig, we didn\u2019t have to figure out the logistics of bringing or renting equipment to camp in Joshua Tree National Park in California. We spent two nights in wonder among the granite boulders, with Cassiopeia shining brightly above, and two mornings waking up with the sun and the scent of high desert air. Tips for trying the van life Ready to try camper van travel? Companies rent vans that come fully equipped with mini kitchens and bedding, so it\u2019s almost as easy as booking an Airbnb. Some even come with toilets and showers, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a deal-breaker.

{"id": "2024_07_11_health_summer-body-image-wellness", "text": "Did you sculpt your \u201cbikini body\u201d? Is your skin soft and tan and free of body hair? Are you ready for your summer vacation? The pressures around how people\u2019s bodies look can feel particularly high in summer, and it can come from everywhere: advertisements, celebrities, influencers, your friends on social media and even that voice in your head when looking in the mirror. \u201cI see it impact people \u2026 whether it\u2019s a mom who doesn\u2019t let herself go in the pool with her kids because she\u2019s afraid of how she looks in a swimsuit, or people with eating disorders who will choose to not go out with friends because they\u2019re struggling particularly hard that day,\u201d said Rebecca Moravec, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Denver. \u201cThe way we\u2019re in relationship with our bodies directly impacts how we participate in our day-to-day life.\u201d Body image is the way you think and feel about your body, but it isn\u2019t influenced just by what you see in the mirror, said Bri Campos, a body image coach in Paramus, New Jersey. Messages from the culture around you and even your broader mental health can affect your relationship with your body, she said. In the thick of summer, here are the things that might be affecting your relationship with your body and what you can do about them \u2014 so you can enjoy the season with less stress. Comfort and connection In addition to all the messages about what people should look like, the physical sensations of summer often bring increased attention to people\u2019s bodies, Campos said. \u201cYou\u2019re being forced to feel your body when you\u2019re forced to feel that sweat, to feel that heat \u2014 it can be really uncomfortable,\u201d she said. But instead of acknowledging that heat, sweating, sticking and chafing are just part of the experience of summer, people often attribute it to a problem with themselves, Campos said. \u201cWhen we experience discomfort, our brain is automatically going to try to find whose fault is it. And for most of us, we\u2019re going to blame our body,\u201d she added. For a better relationship with your body this summer, Campos recommends finding ways to connect with yourself in more enjoyable ways. Wearing ill-fitting clothing \u2014 whether too large or too small \u2014 will make you feel uncomfortable and angry at your body all day, she said. Instead, put something on that feels good. And look for ways to connect with your body that aren\u2019t uncomfortable \u2014 such as focusing your attention on how it feels to dunk in a cool pool, take that first sip of coffee in the morning, cuddle with a pet or hug someone you love, she said. \u201cThat is a connected moment where I can say, \u2018This feels good in my body,\u2019\u201d Campos said. Instagram vs. reality Summer can look glamorous on social media \u2014 perfectly posed bathing suit pictures, luxurious vacations and radiant sunshine. It can feel as though everyone is having a better and more beautiful time than you, Moravec said. And many people think if they don\u2019t fit that image, everyone will notice, said Dr. Whitney Trotter, a doctor of nursing practice, psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner and registered dietitian in Austin, Texas. Campos\u2019 clients often share that they feel worried about going to cookouts and get-togethers over the summer because they think others will be eyeing the choices they make around food. \u201cMost people are worried about their own bodies, and they\u2019re worried about their own food choices, but yet the pressure is still there,\u201d she said. One helpful practice can be to go out into the world \u2014 parties, the beach, the pool or restaurants \u2014 and simply observe who is out there participating, Moravec said. It isn\u2019t just the curated images of social media. Instead you\u2019ll find people of all shapes, sizes and backgrounds who are getting together and having fun. \u201cThe reality is that life is happening with or without (the image management),\u201d she said. \u201cIf you were to focus on simply connecting with other people connecting with yourself, what would life look like?\u201d Looking for belonging Often, behind the efforts to achieve the socially ideal body are notions that you will have access to the more important things once you get it. \u201cWe all carry an underlying story about what we need or who we need to be to get love or belonging or safety,\u201d Moravec said. And bodies are an easy target. If only you looked different, then maybe you would also be staring at a sunset with someone you love, splashing in the waves happily with your kids or enjoying a vacation with a group of close friends, right? \u201cOur work is to really challenge that,\u201d Moravec said. \u201cWhen I think about the friends that I have the deepest friendships with, I\u2019m not thinking about how tan their skin is. I\u2019m not thinking about how they look in a bathing suit.\u201d The idea that a different image may help foster a sense of belonging in a season of vacationing may feel present for people of color, Trotter said. \u201cFor African Americans, (vacationing in popular locations) was not always available,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is kind of this pressure now \u2026 \u2018How do I vacation the right way?\u2019 \u201cAnd oftentimes, that leads to dieting and weight loss, because they want to have a thin body, or a body that appears more accessible,\u201d Trotter said. Moravec recommends shifting the focus away from how your body looks and striving toward those things you desire in your life. \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s having a hard body image day \u2026 I want them to check in about what else is going on,\u201d she said. \u201cAre they feeling lonely? Are they feeling disconnected? Are they not feeling good enough?\u201d Rarely, if ever, do we love people just because of how they look, so there are better ways than changing your body to get the connection you are looking for, Moravec said. Can you spend more quality time with your loved ones? Can you be more present by playing in the pool without worrying about what you look like? Be aware that changing your body doesn\u2019t always mean problems of connection and belonging will be fixed, Campos said. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a haircut after a breakup,\u201d she added. \u201cYou might feel better, but it doesn\u2019t actually change anything in your body. It is just in the temporary relief from a bigger, more systemic issue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/summer-body-image-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_nip-and-tuck-eye-surgery-pets-wellness", "text": "Hamilton was in such pain he refused to open his eyes. When the 4-year-old English bulldog tried, his misshapen eyelids would roll inward, causing his eyelashes to scrape against his cornea. \u201cHave you ever had something scratch your cornea? It is profoundly painful,\u201d said Dr. Dana Varble, chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community, a nonprofit organization that provides learning opportunities for veterinarians. \u201cFor these poor animals, every blink is excruciating,\u201d Varble added. \u201cThey often squint in order to see, and that can make the eyelids turn in even more.\u201d After Hamilton had plastic surgery on his eyes \u2014 what humans would call a nip and tuck \u2014 he was able to see and interact with his owners with no pain. \u201cThese nip and tucks are not cosmetic; they are critical to the health of the animal,\u201d Varble said. \u201cWhen the eyelids roll in and the lashes rub the cornea, eventually the cornea gets scarred and (this) causes visual problems, or even blindness.\u201d Some canine breeds are genetically more likely to develop eyelid problems, such as dogs with shortened muzzles and flattened faces \u2014 think boxers, Boston terriers, French bulldogs, Pekingese, pugs and shih tzus, to name a few. In Hamilton\u2019s case, his vision worsened after he gained weight, with his beefy cheeks forcing the eyelids to fold inward. However, symptoms of the painful condition can show up in puppyhood, often disguised as behavioral problems, Varble said. \u201cWe see these 6-month-old puppies who are cranky, they\u2019re not training well, they\u2019re still not housebroken or getting over that puppy nipping stage,\u201d she said. \u201cYou take a closer look, and they are constantly in pain every time they blink their eyes \u2014 no wonder they\u2019re not paying attention to training.\u201d Cats can suffer, too Large cat breeds with flat faces, such as Persians and Himalayans, or round, puffy cheeks such as Siberians, Ragdolls and Maine coons, can also have issues with malformed eyelids, although it\u2019s not as common as in dogs. A 6-month-old Maine coon named Jinxy frequently kept his painful eyes shut until his owner took him to a specialist in Athens, Georgia, trained to perform complex eyelid surgery. \u201cThese eyelid diseases happen in people as well, and I like to tell my clients we practice them on humans first to make sure they are safe before we do the surgery on their dog or cat,\u201d said Dr. Kate Myrna, an associate professor of veterinary ophthalmology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia in Athens. After his surgery, Jinxy was able to open his eyes and purr at his owner without pain, Myrna said. \u201cThese are necessary surgeries. If a pet is born with too much eyelid, it\u2019s not going to get better on its own,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile surgery sounds serious, it creates almost instant pain relief, and the eye is one of the fastest healing organs in the body.\u201d However, cats can be a bit more difficult to treat \u201cbecause when you try to get in close with that bright light, they usually have big feelings about it,\u201d Myrna said. \u201cSo don\u2019t be surprised if your vet needs to wrap your cat into a \u2018kitty burrito\u2019 to conduct the exam,\u201d she said, referring to putting a towel around a cat for safe handling. A lack of trained specialists When Denali, a mastiff mix, was rescued at 4 months old by Varble, she had bulging red glands in the corner of each eye. \u201cWe call it cherry eye, because it looks like a small cherry in the corner of their eye, but it\u2019s actually the tear glands behind the third eyelid rolling outward, instead of being tucked in as they should,\u201d Varble said. While not always painful, the condition can be irritating for dogs and puts them at risk of injury or infection from pawing at the eye. Left untreated, the condition can lead to dry eye and the potential for blindness, experts say. While all breeds are susceptible to cherry eye, it\u2019s most common among basset hounds, beagles, cocker spaniels, Great Danes, rottweilers, and dogs with flat faces such as boxers, bulldogs and Pekingese. Surgery to correct cherry eye can be relatively simple for an experienced veterinary surgeon, but some circumstances can be more challenging and require the skill of a vet trained in ophthalmology. \u201cDenali had a very severe case,\u201d Varble said. \u201cThankfully, the specialist was able to save the gland in her eye. That\u2019s important because if we have to remove the gland it increases the incidence of dry eye in those dogs after surgery.\u201d Unfortunately, there are only 500 veterinary ophthalmologists in the United States, making it difficult at times for pet owners and general vets to get the quick treatment needed, according to Varble. To overcome that obstacle, the North American Veterinary Community holds periodic trainings so a general vet can become more comfortable treating simple injuries and eye abnormalities. \u201cIf our general practice veterinarians can handle more than just first aid for eyes, they can free up the specialists for serious cases and significant emergencies,\u201d Varble said. \u201cIt just makes everybody more efficient and is better for the pets and their owners as well.\u201d Droopy eyes and signs of injury There are other eye problems that require plastic surgery as well. Mastiffs and bloodhounds are often born with \u201cbig droopy eyelids\u201d that refuse to close completely, Varble said. \u201cTheir lower lids can be so far down that the eyelids literally don\u2019t shut all the way when the upper lid comes down,\u201d Varble said. \u201cThat can create dry spots, and the dogs are more prone to get dust and other things stuck in their eyes.\u201d Unfortunately, a healthy eye can turn into a vision-threatening emergency rapidly, making it important that pet owners act as soon as they notice any significant irritation, Myrna said. \u201cIf your pet has morning sleep or goo in the corner of their eyes, or a bit of a discharge that is common with some cat and dog breeds, that\u2019s probably not a reason to go rushing into your vet,\u201d Myrna said. Signs of significant injury include redness in one or both eyes, excessive squinting or twitching of an eyelid, or an eye that remains closed or is unable to open, Myrna said. Another sign is a blue haze over the entire eye that lasts more than two hours. \u201cIt\u2019s different than cataracts, which are a white or blue color in the pupil,\u201d Myrna said. \u201cWhen the whole surface of the eye looks hazy blue, that\u2019s usually because it\u2019s waterlogged, and that\u2019s a sign of a problem that we need to look at right away. \u201cRemember, a scratched eye can easily become infected and can go from a superficial, easy to treat injury to needing surgery or the pet will lose the eye and lose vision \u2014 and that can happen overnight.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/nip-and-tuck-eye-surgery-pets-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_ecigarettes-nicotine-exposure-children-wellness", "text": "Children who live in homes where adults use e-cigarettes are exposed to significantly less nicotine through secondhand aerosols than children in homes where adults use traditional cigarettes, a new study shows. But vaping still exposes kids to nicotine and may present other risks, too. To keep children completely nicotine-free, according to the researchers, people shouldn\u2019t smoke or vape around kids at all. The researchers said they did the study in part because of the perception that e-cigarettes were safer than traditional cigarettes and because people are using them more than regular cigarettes inside the home. The study published Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Vaping has been promoted to adults as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes and as a potential smoking cessation device, although experts say more research is needed. One reason some doctors prefer that their patients use e-cigarettes is because they expose users to fewer toxic chemicals such as tobacco and the dozens of other carcinogens found in cigarettes, like N-nitrosamines and aldehydes, that can cause cancer and other serious health problems. But what the new study shows, experts say, is that harm reduction for the user is not necessarily the same as harm removal for everyone around them \u2014 and this could be a significant issue for children, whose lungs are still developing. The study looked at the lives of 1,777 children who were were part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a racially diverse government study designed to continuously assess US child and adult health and nutrition. Tobacco use in the home was reported by parents or guardians. More than 270 of the kids were exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke at home, 45 were exposed to secondhand e-cigarette vapor only, and 1,476 had neither kind of user in their home. Scientists included children between the ages of 3 and 11 because they were less likely than older kids to use nicotine products. The researchers determined children\u2019s nicotine levels using blood samples taken between 2017 and 2020. Although new vaping devices have been introduced to the US since that time and exposure levels may be different depending on device, the authors say their study can provide a good general understanding of nicotine exposure in the home. Exposure levels in the study are generally considered an undercount, they said. The children in the study who had the most nicotine exposure by far were those who lived with people who smoked traditional tobacco products like cigarettes. With these products, kids have two chances to be exposed to nicotine: when the user exhales and in between puffs, when a lit cigarette or cigar sits in an ashtray. E-cigarette users are believed to absorb 99% of the nicotine they inhale, but some of it gets released when they exhale after taking a drag on their device. The children in the study with the lowest nicotine levels were those who had no exposure to secondhand aerosols of any kind at home. Kids who were exposed to e-cigarettes had some nicotine in their bodies, but they had absorbed 84% less than those who lived in homes with people who smoked only tobacco. The takeaway from the research, the authors said, is that people need to stop any kind of vaping or smoking\u00a0at home. \u201cVaping inside the home around children should be avoided given that, even though nicotine itself has a limited risk profile, the increased absorption of nicotine from secondhand vapor suggests that the children were also exposed to other potentially harmful excipients from e-cigarettes,\u201d the study says. Earlier studies have found similar nicotine exposure among children in homes with cigarette and e-cigarette users. Dr. Terry Gordon, a professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU\u2019s Langone Health who has done nicotine exposure research, said he was surprised that nicotine levels weren\u2019t higher in households with e-cigarette users. Some of his research has shown much higher nicotine levels in e-cigarette households than in the new study. Either way, he said, all of these studies should be a good reminder to vape users that they need to be careful around others, especially kids. \u201cMost of us toxicologists, we believe e-cigs are safer, but no one is ready to say they are safe because of the primary users of the devices as well as those who are exposed to secondary aerosols,\u201d said Gordon, who was not involved in the latest study. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how harmful secondhand vape aerosols can be. It took years to understand this with cigarettes, said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonologist and volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association. Secondhand smoke from cigarettes has done real damage, said Galiatsatos, who was not involved in the new study. He said he has treated an entire generation of people who have developed cancer and other lung problems not because they smoked but because they grew up around adults who did. In 2020, Galiatsatos published what is believed to be the first study to document significant injury in an adult with secondhand e-cigarette exposure. He says adults shouldn\u2019t take a chance with a child\u2019s health by vaping around them. \u201cA child who is growing, their lungs are so vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t completely know the effect it\u2019s going to have on the next generation, just like we didn\u2019t know what secondhand smoke did, but why even put your child in a position of becoming a future patient?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/ecigarettes-nicotine-exposure-children-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_immunization-rates-report", "text": "Although the Covid-19 pandemic saw\u00a0unprecedented\u00a0speed in the development and distribution of coronavirus vaccines, experts say it was also marked by a significant and concerning drop in the rate of routine vaccinations. New data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund shows the world has yet to recover. The pandemic signified a \u201chistoric backslide,\u201d according to Dr. Katherine O\u2019Brien, director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biological at WHO. Now, she says, the race is on to reach children who missed shots during the pandemic and to restore and strengthen immunization services beyond pre-pandemic levels. WHO and UNICEF\u2019s 2023 immunization coverage report, released Sunday, is the world\u2019s largest dataset on immunization trends for vaccinations against 14 diseases. It analyzed estimates from 185 countries and used a third dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine \u2014 which is recommended for 1-year-olds \u2014 as the global marker for immunization coverage. The data revealed that\u00a0previous progress\u00a0in reaching pre-pandemic immunization levels has stalled. Worldwide DTP3 coverage was 84% in 2023, the same as in 2022 but below 86% recorded in 2019. The report\u2019s authors say this is a derailment on the trajectory toward the Immunization Agenda 2030\u00a0goal\u00a0of 90% coverage for essential childhood and adolescent vaccines. This stagnation reflects ongoing challenges with disruptions in health-care services, logistical challenges, vaccine hesitancy and inequities in access to services, the organizations said in a news release. The new report also showed that the number of children who had not received a single dose of DTP3 increased by 600,000 from 2022 to 2023, leaving 2.7 million more children un- and under-immunized than before the pandemic. \u201cToday\u2019s release highlights that we are off track and need to accelerate efforts to meet this challenge,\u201d said Dr. Ephrem T. Lemango, associate director for health and global chief of immunization at UNICEF. Bright spots around the globe Amid the overall challenge, however, \u201cthere are places where there are positive signs,\u201d Lemango told CNN. The data showed that the African region made the most progress last year in overall coverage, and countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria made notable strides in recovering post-pandemic, according to O\u2019Brien and Lemango. \u201cLow-income countries \u2026 where the health systems were hit the hardest by the pandemic \u2026 are starting to see some improvement compared with 2022,\u201d O\u2019Brien said at a news briefing. In Africa, vaccine coverage in the first year of life increased despite a rising number of births, which required more vaccinations to maintain the same coverage level, according to O\u2019Brien. The 2023 report also found HPV vaccine coverage in girls increased 7%, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Studies\u00a0have shown that the vaccine can reduce cervical cancer rates in women by 87%. However, current coverage remains well below the 90% target to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, reaching only 56% of adolescent girls in high-income countries and 23% in low- and middle-income countries, according to the news release. All eyes on measles WHO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that global immunization efforts have saved 154 million lives \u2014 6 lives every minute \u2014 over the past 50 years. About 60% of that can be attributed to the measles vaccine, the organization says, projecting it to be the \u201ctop contributor to preventing deaths in the future.\u201d But the 2023 data revealed that measles coverage in countries with large or disruptive outbreaks after the pandemic is too low to control further outbreaks. Nearly 35 million children were left with no or only partial protection, a decline the report called \u201cconcerning,\u201d even for countries that have not had outbreaks in the past five years. Low vaccination coverage was a major factor in outbreaks in 103 countries \u2013 accounting for roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s infant population \u2013 in the past five years, said the report. Cases of the highly contagious virus have also reemerged in the United States. In 2023, the 92% of US children that have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2 fell below the federal target of 95%, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that year. \u201cMeasles outbreaks continue to rise as measles vaccination coverage stalls,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cThe world saw over 300,000 confirmed measles cases in 2023, which is an almost threefold increase compared to what we had in 2022.\u201d According to the organizations, there is hope that the introduction of new and underutilized vaccines, through partnerships such as\u00a0Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will expand protection against infectious diseases like measles. \u201cThis progress is crucial in reducing the burden of diseases that have long plagued communities,\u201d Lemango added. Immunizations in conflict zones Over half of unvaccinated children in 2023 lived in countries experiencing fragility, conflict and vulnerability, the data shows, even though these places account for only 28% of new births worldwide. Many of these countries have had \u201cworrying declines in performance since 2019,\u201d the report says. Of children who did not receive any vaccines in 2023, 59% were in only 10 countries. Places such as Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan are new to this list, the report says. \u201cThe protection of children in any conflict setting is of critical importance,\u201d WHO\u2019s O\u2019Brien said. \u201c[Conflict] creates an environment where infectious diseases have a big risk of causing large and impactful outbreaks.\u201d Some countries that experienced conflict, such as Ukraine, had initial dips in immunization coverage but did not see an overall drop in vaccinations. But in other areas, such as Sudan and parts of the Middle East, that wasn\u2019t the case. There was a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in vaccine coverage in Gaza in 2023, one not seen to the same extent in Israel, according to O\u2019Brien. Data in the report from Gaza was submitted for only January through September, and it \u201cdoesn\u2019t cover what is happening in 2024,\u201d Lemango noted. Analyzing immunization coverage in other areas of conflict is \u201ca mixed picture,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019ll give the example, however, of Ukraine, which has had an improvement in coverage. Not all conflict areas result in a reduction in coverage,\u201d she said, referencing resilient programs, the nature of conflict and the safety of health workers. According to Lemango, there is a \u201cclear pattern\u201d in Ukraine where service availability typically decreases at the beginning of a conflict and resumes once assistance and resources flow in. The issue, he said, is how to maintain this improved state. Global reach of local vaccines Vaccine coverage in the United States ranges between 95% and 98%, an indication of good availability of health services, according to Lemango. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Americans are entirely protected. \u201cUntil everyone or every country has the ability and the reach for every child to be vaccinated, the vulnerability to have outbreaks, epidemics and potentially pandemics is always imminent,\u201d he said. In April 2023, WHO and UNICEF partnered with organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to launch The Big Catch Up initiative in response to declining levels of vaccine coverage after the pandemic. The effort aims to boost childhood immunizations and fill gaps between pre- and post-pandemic work, according to the partnership. Achieving these goals and aiming for those outlined in Immunization Agenda 2030 will require collaboration and investment in innovation, according to the IA2030 Partnership Council. \u201cThe future is likely to be a future where we\u2019ll have many vaccines that are able to prevent preventable diseases,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cImmunization stands as one of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/immunization-rates-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_sex-gender-child-brain", "text": "Sex and gender are often conflated or equated in everyday conversations, and most American adults believe a person\u2019s gender is determined by sex assigned at birth. But a new study of nearly 5,000 9- and 10-year-olds found that sex and gender map onto largely distinct parts of the brain. The research gives a first insight into how sex and gender may have \u201cmeasurable and unique influences\u201d on the brain, study authors said, just as other experiences have been shown to shape the brain. \u201cMoving forward, we really need to consider both sexes and genders separately if we better want to understand the brain,\u201d said Dr. Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and the Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, California, and a co-author of the study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances. The researchers on the new study defined sex as what was assigned to the child at birth. In the US, clinicians make this assignment based on genitalia. Most people are assigned either female or male, according to the research; the rest are intersex, a person whose sexual or reproductive anatomy doesn\u2019t fit this male/female binary. The researchers defined gender as an individual\u2019s attitude, feelings and behaviors, as well as socially constructed roles. They noted specifically that gender is not binary, meaning not all people identify as either female or male. Both sex and gender are a core part of human experience. They\u2019re key to how people perceive others and how they understand themselves. Both can influence behavior as well as health, the study authors say. The researchers looked at brain imaging data from 4,757 children in the United States, 2,315 assigned female at birth and 2,442 assigned male at birth, who were ages 9 and 10 and were a subset of the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. Over a period of 10 years, the children in the ABCD study underwent comprehensive neuroimaging, behavioral, developmental and psychiatric assessments. Beyond tests such as MRIs, the scientists did surveys of the children and their parents that were focused on gender, both at the beginning of the research and then a year later. The children were asked about how they expressed their gender and how they felt about it. The parents were asked about a child\u2019s sex-typed behavior during play and whether the child had any gender dysphoria, a term that mental health professionals use to describe clinically significant distress felt because a person\u2019s sense of their gender does not match their sex the assigned at birth. Parents were a key part of the study, said study co-author Dr. Dani S. Bassett, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania with appointments in the Departments of Bioengineering, Electrical & Systems Engineering, Physics & Astronomy, Neurology, and Psychiatry. \u201cWhen kids have a particular kind of gender behavior or gender expression, that will influence how their parents and also other caregivers and friends and family \u2026 et cetera interact with them,\u201d Bassett said. Information about a parent\u2019s perception of a child\u2019s gender gives researchers a better sense of the child\u2019s social environment and how it may affect their brain development. The authors used a kind of artificial intelligence called machine learning that built a model that could predict a child\u2019s sex and reported gender from their brain scan.  When the researchers looked the children\u2019s brain scans, the results seemed to show that sex influenced different regions of the brain that are involved in visual processing, sensory processing and motor control and some regions involved in executive function, which lets an individual organize and integrate information across time. Gender seems to influence some of the more sensory-specific networks that are associated with sex, but it also seems to have a broader influence and can be detected on different brain networks involved in executive function, including things like attention, social cognition and emotional processing. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re able to capture how gender maps onto the brain basically just tells us that gender is influencing our brain,\u201d Dhamala said. The structure of the human brain can be shaped by expertise and experiences. Research on London taxi drivers \u2014 who must take extensive tests to show that they can navigate the city\u2019s streets without maps or GPS \u2014 seems to show that they have significantly larger posterior hippocampi, the part of the brain related to spatial memory and navigation, than in people who aren\u2019t taxi drivers. \u201cSimilarly, as individuals and as humans, we are experts about ourselves and our genders. So it makes sense that gender will also be mapped within our brains,\u201d Dhamala said. What the new study cannot do is predict what gender a person may identify with beyond one limited snapshot in time captured by the scans and surveys. Gender, the authors note, is not something that is necessarily static, and a person\u2019s understanding of their gender can change throughout their lifetime. The study also can\u2019t determine what things in someone\u2019s environment will influence their brain function in terms of sex or gender, nor can it identify what a person\u2019s sexual orientation might be. \u201cSexual orientation is independent from gender and from sex,\u201d Bassett said, and it may be differently mapped in the brain. The researchers say they hope to someday learn more about how sex and gender interact in a person\u2019s life and how they influence one another and the brain throughout a lifetime. They also hope to see how different cultures affect a person\u2019s gender and their brain development. A 2022 poll showed that most American adults \u2014 and the vast majority of conservatives \u2014 believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. The distinction is key to gender-affirming care, medical treatment for people who identify as a gender that is different from the one they were assigned at birth. Conservative politicians have pushed for a record number of bans on such care, and nearly half of US states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care for minors. The study did not look at whether sex or gender were congruent or incongruent in any study participant. Rather, it looked at the child\u2019s binary sex and gender across self- and parent-reported measures. The study couldn\u2019t provide any specific findings if sex and gender were incongruent. \u201cGoing forward, the hope is that we can motivate other scientists to consider science and gender in their analyses in the data collections in their programs and research,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Avram Holmes, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers University. The field of neuroscience has only just begun to acknowledge and address the presence of biases and barriers to inclusivity within research, Holmes said. A fuller understanding of the way the brain works in terms of sex and gender could also have practical implications and potentially help scientists find better ways to treat people with brain-related illnesses. For instance, the study pointed to how people assigned male at birth are more likely to be diagnosed with substance use and attention deficit disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that sex and gender necessarily drive illness rates, but the cultures people are embedded in can also influence the likelihood they may or may not develop a particular illness,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cSo the types of environmental pressures a child undergoes across development could increase or decrease their risk for experiencing illness, independent of their initial brain biology.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/sex-gender-child-brain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_human-plague-case-colorado", "text": "A case of plague has been confirmed in a person in Pueblo County, Colorado, officials said Tuesday. The case was flagged Friday from preliminary test results, and the potential source of the infection is still under investigation, the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment said in a\u00a0news release. The plague is an infectious disease caused by bacterium, Yersinia pestis, transmitted by fleas. Although it is best known for \u201cThe Black Death,\u201d an outbreak that killed millions of Europeans during the Middle Ages, the bacteria circulates naturally among wild rodents and\u00a0rarely\u00a0infects humans today, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Plague is transmitted to humans through bites from infected fleas, contact with infected animals or inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. Anyone who develops symptoms of plague should get medical attention immediately, the CDC says. Typical symptoms include sudden fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and, commonly, swollen lymph nodes with pain. \u201cPlague can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but an infected person must be treated promptly to avoid serious complications or death,\u201d said Alicia Solis, program manager of the Office of Communicable Disease and Emergency Preparedness at the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment, in the news release. \u201cWe advise all individuals to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\u201d the department says. One way to avoid infection is to eliminate places where wild rodents can exist around humans such as brush, rock piles, trash and piles of lumber around homes, garages, sheds and recreation areas, according to the department. Taking precautions around pets can also reduce risk of transmission. The department suggests treating dogs and cats for fleas, keeping pet food in rodent-proof containers and not letting pets roam in rodent areas or sleep in bed with you. From 1970 to 2022, there were 67 reported cases of plague in Colorado, according to the CDC. Worldwide, 3,248 human plague cases were reported from 2010 to 2015, most commonly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Peru, the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0found. \u201cA plague vaccine is no longer available in the United States,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cNew plague vaccines are in development but are not expected to be commercially available in the immediate future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/human-plague-case-colorado/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

The products have been\u00a0associated with\u00a048 illnesses in 24 states, the FDA said Tuesday. All but two of the people sought medical care, and 27 were hospitalized. Prophet Premium Blends issued a\u00a0recall\u00a0of Diamond Shruumz products last week, citing muscimol, a chemical from Amanita mushrooms, as the possible cause of the reported symptoms. The FDA is reviewing this information, and according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the cause of the reported illnesses is not known. The company says in a notice on the Diamond Shruumz website, \u201cAt Prophet Premium Blends, we prioritize the health and safety of our consumers above all else. Recently, we have been\u00a0made aware of reported incidents involving our product,\u00a0Diamond Shruumz. Due to consumers becoming ill after consuming the entire chocolate bar and some products containing higher levels of\u00a0Muscimol\u00a0than normal, it is crucial that all of our consumers refrain from ingesting this product while we, alongside the FDA,\u00a0continue our investigation as to what is the cause of the serious\u00a0adverse effects.\u201d The company has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for further comment. Reported symptoms have included\u00a0seizures, involuntary muscle contractions, loss of consciousness, confusion, vomiting and abnormal heart rates, according to the FDA. The FDA and the CDC are collaborating with partners including America\u2019s Poison Centers to assess the illnesses. The FDA is testing samples of Diamond Shruumz\u2019s products and said it noted the presence of synthetic psychedelic substances in the brand\u2019s Dark Chocolate Bar and Birthday Cake Chocolate Bar, including the hallucinogen psilacetin. The compound is structurally similar to psilocybin, psilocin, dimethyltryptamine and lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD, according to the CDC. Psilocybin and psilocin are the primary hallucinogenic compounds in magic mushrooms, according to the\u00a0European Union Drugs Agency. \u201cIndividuals who use these substances can experience hallucinations, visual illusions, and other sensory changes,\u201d the CDC said. \u201cSome patients may have adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, fast heart rate, anxiety, agitation, lightheadedness, or tremor.\u201d Additional testing on a wider range of Diamond Shruumz products and interpretations of the results and their health implications are underway, the FDA said.

{"id": "2024_07_11_health_cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness", "text": "About 40% of new cancer cases among adults ages 30 and older in the United States \u2014 and nearly half of deaths \u2014\u00a0could be attributed to preventable risk factors, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society. \u201cThese are things that people can practically change how they live every single day to reduce their risk of cancer,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Arif\u00a0Kamal, chief patient officer with the American Cancer Society. Smoking was the leading risk factor by far, the study found, contributing to nearly 1 in 5 cancer cases and nearly a third of cancer deaths. Other key risk factors included excess body weight, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, diet and infections such as HPV. Overall, researchers analyzed 18 modifiable risk factors across 30 types of cancer. In 2019, these lifestyle factors were linked to more than 700,000 new cancer cases and more than 262,000 deaths, the study found. Cancer grows because of DNA damage or because it has a fuel source, Kamal said. Other things \u2014 such as genetics or environmental factors \u2014 can also create these biological conditions, but modifiable risks explain a significantly larger share of cancer cases and deaths than any other known factors. Exposure to sunlight can damage DNA and lead to skin cancer, for example, while fat cells produce hormones that can feed certain cancers. \u201cWith cancer, it oftentimes feels like you have no control,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cPeople think about bad luck or bad genetics, but people need to feel a sense of control and agency.\u201d Certain cancers are more preventable than others, the new study suggests. But modifiable risk factors contributed to more than half of new cases for 19 of the 30 types of cancer evaluated. There were 10 types of cancer where modifiable risk factors could be attributed to at least 80% of new cases, including more than 90% of melanoma cases linked to ultraviolet radiation and nearly all cases of cervical cancer linked to HPV infection, which can be prevented with a vaccine. Lung cancer had the largest number of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors \u2014 more than 104,000 cases among men and 97,000 among women \u2014 and the vast majority were linked to smoking. After smoking, excess body weight was the second largest contributor to cancer cases, linked to about 5% of new cases in men and nearly 11% of cases in women. It was associated with more than\u00a0a third of deaths from cancer\u00a0of the endometrium, gallbladder, esophagus, liver and kidney, the new study found. Another recent study found that the risk for certain cancers was significantly reduced for people taking popular weight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy. \u201cObesity is emerging, in some ways, as just as potent of a risk for people as smoking is,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. He was not involved in the new study, but has prior experience working on cancer prevention initiatives. Intervening on a set of \u201ccore behavioral risk factors\u201d \u2014 quitting smoking, eating well and exercising, for example \u2014 can make a \u201cdramatic difference in the rates and outcomes of chronic diseases,\u201d Plescia said. And cancer is one of those chronic diseases, just like heart disease or diabetes. Policymakers and health officials should work to \u201ccreate environments where it\u2019s easier for people, where the healthy choice is the easy choice,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s particularly important for people who are living in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods, where it might not be safe to exercise or easy to get to a store with healthy food. As rates of early-onset cancer rise in the US, it\u2019s especially important to create healthy habits early, experts say. It\u2019s harder to quit smoking once you\u2019ve started or lose weight that you\u2019ve gained. But \u201cit\u2019s never too late to make these changes,\u201d Plescia said. \u201cTurning (health behaviors) around later in life can make a profound difference.\u201d And making lifestyle changes to minimize exposure to certain factors can reduce cancer risk relatively quickly, experts say. \u201cCancer is something your body fights every single day as your cells divide,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that you face every day, and that also means that the reduction of the risks can benefit you every day as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_health_lead-service-lines-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "With the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s latest \u2014 and strictest \u2014 plan to minimize the risk of Americans drinking lead-contaminated water on the horizon, the debate over whether the agency\u2019s proposed rules go too far or not nearly far enough is heating up. Although lead was banned from new water service lines in 1986, it\u2019s estimated that\u00a0more than 9 million such lines\u00a0still carry drinking water to homes and businesses throughout the country. Under the EPA\u2019s\u00a0Lead and Copper Rule Improvements\u00a0proposal, water utilities would be required to replace\u00a0all lead-containing lines\u00a0within 10 years. The proposal from the Biden administration differs from rules put out in the waning days of the Trump term that allow up to 30 years for service line replacement, triggered only when lead levels test higher than 15 parts per billion. The new proposal, which would largely supplant\u00a0the Trump rules, calls for stricter monitoring, enhanced public education, and the 10-year pipe replacement mandate regardless of lead levels. An October deadline looms for the new rules to be adopted; otherwise, enforcement of the less-stringent Trump administration rules will begin. And complicating matters more: November\u2019s election results could shake up whose rules the nation must follow. While many cities and states have begun to replace their lead pipes, some utilities and officials say the 10-year\u00a0time frame is unfeasible\u00a0and too expensive. They say it would be difficult for water utilities to follow the rules while also dealing with\u00a0new EPA limits on five PFAS\u00a0contaminants, known as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d and\u00a0failing pipes, among other issues. \u201cNobody will tell you that having lead in contact with water is a great idea,\u201d said Steve Via, director of federal relations for the\u00a0American Water Works Association, the country\u2019s largest nonprofit water utility industry group. \u201cThe question becomes: How urgent a matter is it, and at what pace does it need to be done?\u201d Already,\u00a015 Republican state attorneys general\u00a0have argued that the proposed rules infringe on states\u2019 rights and chase \u201cspeculative\u201d benefits. On the other side,\u00a014 Democratic attorneys general\u00a0said that the EPA should find more ways to ensure pipes are quickly replaced in low-income areas. Cost of replacement v. the health costs of lead To be sure,\u00a0no amount of lead is considered safe\u00a0to consume. Lead is a\u00a0neurotoxin known to cause\u00a0irreversible long-term organ damage, lower IQs, higher risk for miscarriage, asthma, cardiovascular disease, impotence, and elevated blood pressure. Public health advocates say societal costs \u2014 in health care, social services, and lost productivity \u2014 far outweigh the cost of replacement. They say corrosion controls that have limited lead exposure can and do fail, pointing to human and systemic errors that prompted the\u00a0water crisis in Flint, Mich., where thousands of people were exposed to high lead levels in their drinking water. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole thing about lead pipes: They unexpectedly release lead into drinking water,\u201d said\u00a0Roya Alkafaji, who manages an initiative focused on reducing lead exposure from water with the\u00a0Environmental Defense Fund, a national advocacy group. \u201cI don\u2019t think kicking the can down the road is the solution.\u201d A lead water service line from 1927 lays on the ground on a residential street after being removed on June 17, 2021, in Denver. According to a\u00a02023 analysis\u00a0by\u00a0Ronnie Levin, an environmental health researcher at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the benefit of replacing lead pipes outweighs the costs by a 35:1 ratio. The EPA estimated $335 million in annual costs to implement water sampling, corrosion control treatments, inventorying and replacement of lead service lines, and educational outreach for the Trump rules. Using that figure, Levin\u2019s analysis shows that $9 billion in annual health care costs could be avoided. An additional $2 billion in spending \u2014 through upgraded infrastructure and reduced corrosion damage to appliances \u2014 could be saved. The broad spectrum of health-related costs has historically been ignored in analyzing the actual costs of leaving lead service lines in place, said Levin, a former EPA scientist. Estimates of the cost to replace the nation\u2019s lead pipes range from\u00a0$46 billion\u00a0to more than\u00a0$90 billion, far higher than the\u00a0$15 billion\u00a0set aside in the\u00a0Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Biden administration has framed those funds as a down payment,\u00a049% of which will be grants\u00a0or principal forgiveness loans\u00a0allocated on the basis\u00a0of the estimated number of lead pipes per state. Other\u00a0funding programs\u00a0can also be tapped. Replacement costs vary widely by location, with average costs ranging from\u00a0the EPA\u2019s 2019 estimate of $4,700\u00a0per service line to\u00a0$12,500 from Via\u2019s utilities trade group. An unrealistic timeline? Carolyn Berndt, legislative director for sustainability at the National League of Cities, said funding challenges could render the EPA\u2019s 10-year timeline unrealistic. While her organization is encouraging local leaders to secure as much funding as possible, what\u2019s available won\u2019t be enough to cover replacement costs for some localities \u2014 especially low-income areas, which often have older infrastructure and more lead pipes. Some direct costs could fall to property owners, such as replacing the lines connecting their water meters to their homes. And people could face indirect costs if utilities increase customer rates to offset the expense. Still, some communities, such as Olathe, Kan., are finding ways to move forward with a patchwork of funding. Out of 37,000 service lines there, 266 galvanized pipes were found serving downtown properties, where many of the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents live. The coating for\u00a0galvanized pipes typically contains lead. Workers will replace the lines at no cost to property owners in the city of 147,000 people outside Kansas City, said Megan Spence, who is\u00a0overseeing the city project. It is expected to cost around $2.3 million, paid for with\u00a0a loan\u00a0from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and about $1.2 million in federal infrastructure funding. About $500,000 for lawn restoration is included. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking at this as an opportunity and another way to protect public health,\u201d said Spence. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any lead lines in any drinking water distribution systems.\u201d Elsewhere, some Republicans, such as Indiana state Sen.\u00a0Eric Koch, are leading the charge to replace the pipes despite historical pushback in conservative states against federal mandates. He said lawmakers should consider the harm \u2014 and long-term costs \u2014 caused by delaying the cleanup of lead from drinking water. In March, Indiana\u2019s Republican Gov.\u00a0Eric Holcomb\u00a0signed a\u00a0unanimously approved bill, which Koch authored, designed to lower costs for replacing customer-owned lead service lines. Under the law, landlords are required to enroll in a state-approved program to have their lead pipes removed at no cost by their water utility or pay for replacement themselves. Koch said estimates for replacing customer-owned service lines are around $8,000, though the cost could be significantly higher for some properties. But by starting the work now, Koch said, utilities can avoid price inflation and ultimately remove pipes more cost efficiently. Meanwhile, time is running out to publish the Biden administration\u2019s proposed rules in the\u00a0Federal Register. Water utilities will be required to comply with the Trump rules as of Oct. 16 unless the EPA publishes the newer rules before then, said\u00a0Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of the National Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. It remains unknown what the June 28 Supreme Court\u00a0ruling on agency rulemaking, known as the \u201cChevron deference\u201d decision, will mean for either set of rules. A deadline is also looming for the 60-day \u201clook-back\u201d period under the\u00a0Congressional Review Act, during which a regulation can be repealed. If control of Congress or the White House flips with the November election, the Biden administration\u2019s rules could be repealed under an emboldened Congress even before the January swearing in of new officeholders. \u201cDepending on how the election goes, it could become a hot issue,\u201d said\u00a0Tom Neltner, national director of the advocacy organization\u00a0Unleaded Kids.

{"id": "2024_07_05_health_gupta-biden-cognitive-testing-analysis", "text": "When the 46th President of the United States took the debate stage a week ago, it became apparent, even from his first answer, that this would not be the performance he hoped for. For me as a brain specialist, it was concerning to watch President Joe Biden, and it quickly became clear that I was not alone in my reaction. Over the past week, I received more than a dozen calls, texts and emails from medical colleagues who, like me, specialize in the brain. It wasn\u2019t that what we noticed was necessarily new but that it was particularly pronounced, and right from the start of the debate. From a neurological standpoint, we were concerned with his confused rambling; sudden loss of concentration in the middle of a sentence; halting speech and absence of facial animation, resulting at times in a flat, open-mouthed expression. To be clear, these are only observations, not in any way diagnostic of something deeper, and none of these doctors wished to suggest that was the case. The consensus from the doctors reaching out to me, however, was that the president should be encouraged to undergo detailed cognitive and movement disorder testing, and those results should be made available to the public. Over the past five years, I have reported extensively on the advances in the world of treating and reducing risk of dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia. For the documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I even went through extensive cognitive testing to demonstrate what it entailed and determine whether I had problems with executive functioning, judgment or memory lapses, as well as blood tests to determine things like the level of abnormal proteins that may be present in my brain and my B12 levels. My sense of smell and my genetic risk factors were checked. This type of testing is not necessary for most people as a matter of routine, but every one of the brain doctors I spoke to recommended that level of examination for Biden. Biden\u2019s health history The last official report in February was a health summary which concluded that the president was \u201cfit for duty.\u201d The White House said a team of 20 doctors, including a neurologist, participated in completing his physical. An \u201cextremely detailed\u201d neurologic exam found nothing consistent with neurological disorders, the summary said. It also found no evidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease that might explain his stiff gait and decreased expression in his face. Although Parkinson\u2019s disease is the most common cause of parkinsonism - a set of movement symptoms such as stiffness and tremor \u2013 there are other causes as well, and it was not clear in the medical report that those had been investigated. They did find evidence of neuropathy and arthritis\u00a0in his feet, which can cause numbness, weakness and pain. There was no mention of any sort of cognitive testing. Biden was examined by his physician after the debate to check on a cold, the White House said, but it was a \u201cbrief check\u201d and not a physical.\u00a0When White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked this week whether Biden should receive and release the results of any kind of cognitive test, she replied that his medical team has said it\u2019s \u201cnot necessary.\u201d It\u2019s true that the trajectory of aging varies from person to person. Biden is 81, and former President Donald Trump is 78. Both have already lived longer than the average American male lifespan of 74.8 years. This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, as both men have access to high-quality health care, and they don\u2019t drink or smoke. Biden\u2019s medical team has previously disclosed that he had two separate brain operations for aneurysms, including one that ruptured on the left side of his brain, in 1988, and there is some evidence that this type of hemorrhage may increase the risk of delayed cognitive problems later in life. Trump\u2019s father died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 93. Neither man has any other known risk factors for cognitive decline. Trump does at times display some of these same signs as Biden, including nonsensical rants as well as confusing names and current events. He said he\u2019d undergone the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, known as MoCA, in the past. According to his medical team, he received a perfect score when he took the test in 2018. Trump said he took a second cognitive test for his last physical exam at the end of 2023 and \u201caced it.\u201d In a note at the end of last year, Dr. Bruce Aronwald wrote that Trump\u2019s cognitive exams \u201cwere exceptional.\u201d Trump has not released his actual medical records, and memos about his health that were previously released have at times used hyperbolic language, unusual for medical documentation. The MoCA isn\u2019t the same level of cognitive testing the medical experts I spoke to would like to see Biden do, but it could serve as an initial screening tool for cognitive decline. For Trump, this might be considered either a screening test or a baseline to understand how his cognition might be changing. It\u2019s not clear that Biden has ever had such a baseline examination for comparison. An \u2018episode\u2019 or a \u2018condition\u2019? To be clear, there are aspects of aging that can be beneficial to the job of the presidency. Older people may \u201chave something called crystalized intelligence, which is the accumulated wisdom associated with the passage of time,\u201d according to Jay Olshansky, professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois-Chicago. This is our knowledge that comes from learning and experiences. On the other hand, there are definitely aspects of cognition that decline as we age \u2014 especially fluid abilities like processing speed, attention span and memory. This is normal and expected and doesn\u2019t necessarily stand in the way of someone\u2019s ability to do their job. But for a minority of us, that decline is steeper and can lead to dementia. Think of this as the difference between forgetting where you put your keys and not understanding what your keys are for. Still, determining a diagnosis of dementia is not as straightforward as many believe, and there are many other things that could account for the clinical observations I described above. A poor night\u2019s sleep or low blood sugar can have an impact. A viral illness or the medications used to treat those symptoms can result in temporary brain fog. Biden and his aides have said it was a \u201cbad night.\u201d The White House press team said Biden had a cold but did not take any medications to treat symptoms. After the debate, Jean-Pierre added that he had jet lag following overseas travel earlier in the month and worked late doing his presidential duties as well as preparing for the debate.\u00a0According to three sources briefed on these comments, Biden told Democratic governors during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he will stop scheduling events after 8 p.m. so he can get more sleep. The debate started at 9 p.m. Eastern. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question\u201d whether Biden\u2019s debate performance was an \u201cepisode\u201d or a \u201ccondition,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during an MSNBC interview Tuesday. That is precisely why detailed testing is important. It can help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning. As a doctor, I would want to understand the possibility of underlying dementia because, over the past several years, we have learned that there are medical treatments and lifestyle changes that can delay and, in some cases, even reverse the symptoms of the disease. These are hopeful days when it comes to dementia, and early diagnosis and treatment is better than it has ever been. Seeking answers With an election looming in November, we don\u2019t have answers about Biden. The White House has rejected requests from the press to release more medical records and question Biden\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor. Biden\u2019s press secretary said O\u2019Connor watched the debate and had no concerns afterward. Elected officials, like anyone else, are entitled to some level of privacy, and under federal health-care laws, there is no ability for someone to obtain personal medical information on an individual unless authorized, even the president. There is also no requirement for the president or candidates to disclose that information. Most do not. In fact, in the 23 years I have been reporting on these topics, only Sen. John McCain \u2014 one of the oldest presidential candidates in US history \u2014 shared all of his records with me and the American public. We often hear that observing a candidate on the campaign trail is the best assessment of the individual\u2019s physical and cognitive health. Back in 2020, Biden said he was \u201cconstantly tested\u201d by the work of running for president. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is watch me,\u201d he said then. The country is watching now, and that assessment gives cause for concern \u2014 and a need for transparent testing.

{"id": "2024_07_11_science_fossil-chromosomes-woolly-mammoth-skin-discovery", "text": "A piece of woolly mammoth skin excavated from the Siberian permafrost has been found to contain fossil chromosomes in a first-of-its-kind discovery, according to a new study. Researchers unearthed the 52,000-year-old remains in 2018 near the village of Belaya Gora in northeastern Siberia, where freezing temperatures helped preserve the structure of the chromosomes \u2014 tiny threadlike structures that carry genetic material, or DNA \u2014 in fine detail. While ancient DNA samples have been found many times before, they are typically highly fragmented and contain only hundreds of letters of genetic code. The fossil chromosomes contain millions, offering a far more complete picture of an animal\u2019s genetic code. \u201cFossil chromosomes have never been found before,\u201d said Erez Lieberman Aiden, a professor of molecular and human genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine and co-corresponding author of the study published Thursday in the journal Cell. In prior findings, the fragments were also lacking an organized structure, Lieberman Aiden added. \u201cHere, the fragments are clearly arranged in 3D \u2014 essentially as they were in the original chromosomes in the living mammoth.\u201d The chromosomes, which the researchers point out are \u201cnon-mineralized fossils, or subfossils,\u201d are in a state of preservation good enough to assemble the genome, or the sum of all the genetic material, of an extinct species, according to Olga Dudchenko, an assistant professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor College of Medicine and co-first author of the study. \u201cWe strongly believe that this is not going to apply to just the mammoth or this particular mammoth,\u201d said Dudchenko, who is also a senior investigator at the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics at Rice University, \u201cbut is basically opening up a new field that has tremendous potential.\u201d DNA diffusion DNA within different cell types is laid out in distinct and specific 3D structures that give insight into the particular properties or traits of that cell type, said Kevin Campbell, a professor of environmental and evolutionary physiology at the University of Manitoba in Canada, who was not involved in the study. Upon death, body cells quickly degrade, and this 3D structure is lost within a few days or less, he added. In Arctic animals such as the woolly mammoth, the degradation is slower due to freezing temperatures, but the DNA still becomes damaged, and over long periods it is expected to lose the structure and the attributes that make up the species\u2019 biology. \u201cHowever, this study is the first to demonstrate that this is not necessarily always the case,\u201d Campbell said in an email. \u201cDNA is a very, very long molecule, and once it sits there after an animal dies, it starts to degrade and gets chopped into shorter pieces,\u201d Dudchenko said. \u201cWhat you normally expect is that all of these pieces will start shifting in respect to each other and just kind of float away, losing any organization that was there,\u201d Dudchenko said. \u201cBut clearly, in this particular sample, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d This loss of structure is called diffusion, and how to prevent it is well-known to food scientists \u2014 and not dissimilar from the making of beef jerky, she added. \u201cArresting diffusion is key to preserving foods, so if you want to have something that is shelf stable for a long time, you basically need a combination of dehydration and cooling,\u201d she said. \u201cAny shelf stable food that\u2019s not canned is probably in a state of arrest of diffusion.\u201d When the mammoth the skin sample came from died, conditions might have been just right to kick-start this process naturally. \u201c(The carcass) could have spontaneously undergone the same procedure that right now we use commercially all the time,\u201d Dudchenko said, \u201cremoving substantial amounts of water, arresting diffusion inside and locking those pieces of chromosomes in place, allowing us to read them off 52,000 years after the fact.\u201d But even though it was well preserved, the DNA was not completely intact. \u201cEach chromosome, originally one DNA molecule, has fragmented into millions of DNA molecules,\u201d Aiden said in an email. \u201cBut the molecules have otherwise not moved terribly much, even at the nanometer scale, which is why we call it a fossil chromosome.\u201d If this sample were a book, Lieberman Aiden said, the binding would be gone, leaving a large number of unbound pages, or DNA fragments. Diffusion is like the wind blowing the pages away, making it impossible to put them back in order. But in this sample, the pages never got blown away; they remained in a neat pile, just as they were before the binding was lost. Shooting beef jerky The researchers confirmed this theory of preservation by running some experiments on beef jerky to see how badly they could mistreat the meat snack before the chromosomes inside it lost their structure. \u201cWe decided to test how far this beautiful molecule can resist stress and harm by having one of the pitchers from the Houston Astros throw a fastball at it and firing a shotgun at it,\u201d said Dr. Cynthia P\u00e9rez Estrada, co-first author of the study and a researcher at the Center for Genome Architecture at Baylor and at Rice\u2019s Center for Theoretical Biological Physics. \u201cThe beef jerky was breaking more and more, but the DNA structure was still there, telling us that DNA is extremely resistant and even more so in this type of glass-like state (like in the sample), where the molecules are basically frozen and behaving like a crystal,\u201d P\u00e9rez Estrada added. With the newly discovered genetic information found in the skin samples, the researchers were able to determine for the first time that the woolly mammoth had 28 pairs of chromosomes, just like modern elephants. But the structure allowed them to go one step further and see which individual genes were active in the animal. \u201cEverybody wants to know what exactly made it woolly,\u201d Dudchenko said, \u201cand we have some ideas thanks to the way that these chromosomes were preserved.\u201d Mammoth dreams The researchers were able to compare individual genes from the mammoth sample with the equivalent ones in modern elephants, noting differences in the activity of genes that regulate hair follicles. But the DNA from elephants was also needed to assemble the mammoth genome. \u201cOur dream and hope was to assemble the mammoth genome completely, but right now, this is not quite where we are \u2014 we still used some information from its closest relatives to help, because the amount of data that we were able to get from the mammoth was lower than what you typically need,\u201d Dudchenko said. \u201cBut the fundamentals tell us that, as we continue working towards this, we will be able to do it (without the help of elephant DNA).\u201d Could fossil chromosomes make the dream of resurrecting the woolly mammoth a reality? \u201cThe fundamental biology that we learn from this is going to be useful, there is no question about it,\u201d Dudchenko said. \u201cAre we closer? One step closer, but there\u2019s still quite a few steps ahead and all sorts of other considerations that are beyond fundamental science.\u201d The researchers also hope that the same methodology used on the mammoth sample can be applied to samples from other species. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to find chromosome structures in museum specimens,\u201d said Marcela Sandoval-Velasco, a guest researcher at the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and co-first author of the study. \u201cNot only permafrost specimens, because that narrows it a lot, but also samples from museum collections. There\u2019s an enormous potential there,\u201d she added, citing the woolly rhino, extinct lions and the passenger pigeon as some of the extinct species that scientists might find out more about this way. That potential opens the door to further discoveries, according to P\u00e9rez Estrada. \u201cIt will take an immense effort to find suitable samples, so there will be a lot of work ahead \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we then discovered something new and completely different from what we have right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is also a really exciting open question: What else and what other physical attributes (of DNA) can be preserved?\u201d Exciting findings Researchers who were not involved with the study expressed enthusiasm about the findings. This study is the first to reconstruct the structure, or architecture, of a genome from an extinct species that lived during the last ice age, said Peter Heintzman, a paleogeneticist at Stockholm University in Sweden. \u201cThis structural information provides insights into functions of the woolly mammoth genome that were invisible using previous genomic methods,\u201d Heintzman said in an email. \u201cThis advance therefore helps to unlock a new and exciting frontier in paleogenomics, the study of ancient genomes, and will likely provide further insight into how extinct species evolved, lived, and died out.\u201d Because of how substantially degraded and fragmented DNA from ancient samples usually is, it was surprising to see the high-quality, chromosome-level reconstruction of the mammoth genome reported by this study, said Dmitry Filatov, a professor of biology at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. \u201cIt is even more surprising that the researchers managed to infer which genes were active and which were switched off in the mammoth sample and compare this with gene expression in elephants,\u201d Filatov said in an email. \u201cThis will certainly stimulate further paleo-genomic research in other species.\u201d Hendrik Poinar, director of the Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University in Ontario, called the paper \u201csuper exciting.\u201d Normally with fossil remains researchers can\u2019t do anything remotely close to assembling a genome, Poinar said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many tissue samples will have this level of preservation,\u201d he added in an email, \u201cbut I do think the method will make us think about novel ways to get DNA out of tissues in ways other than what we are used to.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/science/fossil-chromosomes-woolly-mammoth-skin-discovery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_how-to-do-hammer-curls-wellness", "text": "While there is no magic bullet for gaining strength, variety is key. To that end, although classic bicep curls often take center stage for building arm strength, another arm exercise deserves attention in your workouts: the hammer curl. This powerful movement not only builds impressive arm muscles but also enhances overall body strength, function, stability and resiliency. Hammer curls are a variation of regular bicep curls. Like their traditional counterpart, one of the primary muscles targeted by hammer curls include the biceps brachii, the muscle best known as \u201cthe bicep.\u201d However, hammer curls also emphasize two other arm muscles: the brachialis, a muscle beneath the biceps brachii that helps support the elbow joint, and the brachioradialis, a forearm muscle that enhances grip strength. Aptly named, hammer curls mimic the action of holding and using a hammer. Unlike regular bicep curls, which use a palms-up grip, hammer curls are performed with a neutral grip with palms facing each other. This simple adjustment shifts the muscle focus for more comprehensive strength development. This variation also decreases wrist and elbow strain, reducing the risk of overuse injuries and making it a safer option for those with joint concerns. The everyday functional benefits of hammer curls Despite their somewhat obscure reputation, hammer curls aren\u2019t just for gym enthusiasts. This exercise can benefit anyone wanting to improve their ability to perform the physical tasks of daily living. Here\u2019s a detailed list of benefits: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Because the neutral hand position needed to perform hammer curls boosts forearm and grip strength, it also boosts your ability to hold and lift heavier weights to make greater total-body strength gains in other exercises, as well as enhanced performance in other fitness and sport activities. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Hammer curls build arm and hand muscles needed for daily activities that require lifting, holding, and carrying, such as caring for children and performing household tasks and yard work. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Enhanced grip strength also helps with opening jars, using tools and completing basic household tasks, making hammer curls particularly beneficial for older adults trying to maintain functional independence. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 The controlled motion and neutral grip of hammer curls help strengthen the muscles and tendons around the elbow and wrist joints, reducing the risk of common injuries associated with weaker muscles and improper lifting techniques. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 With less wrist rotation than traditional curls, hammer curls minimize the risk of injury, especially for those people with previous wrist or elbow issues. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Performing hammer curls correctly involves significant core engagement, which improves balance and overall strength. \u2022\u00a0Bonus: For anyone wanting more visibly toned arms, hammer curls build up the brachialis muscle, which underlies the primary biceps brachii muscle and boosts muscle visibility even when your arms are not flexed. How to perform hammer curls To reap the full benefits of hammer curls, it is crucial to perform them with proper form and an appropriate weight for your fitness level. Use a weight that feels challenging but is light enough that you can comfortably perform at least eight repetitions of the exercise with good form. Be sure to mind the cues for how to breathe as you perform this exercise, exhaling as you lift the weights and inhaling as you lower them. Proper breathing mechanics help maintain and strengthen core stability to ensure correct form. 1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells at your sides with your palms facing inward in a neutral grip. Alternatively, you can be seated as long you can sit forward enough on the seat edge for the dumbbells to hang unobstructed at your sides. 2. Exhale as you slowly curl both dumbbells up toward your shoulders, keeping your elbows close to your torso and your core braced to remain stable. Pause slightly at the top of the movement. 3. Inhale as you lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent. Take your time, lowering your arms gradually, as the eccentric (lowering) phase is a crucial part of the exercise. 4. Repeat for 8 to 12 reps with good form. 5. Complete two to three sets of your desired number of repetitions, resting for at least one to two minutes in between sets. Optional variation: If you feel more comfortable lifting one arm at a time rather than both together, you can alternate right and left repetitions within each set to perform a total of 16 to 24 reps (8 to 12 reps on each arm) per set. To maintain proper form and decrease risk of injury, avoid these common mistakes: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swinging the dumbbells to use momentum to lift them rather than bracing through your core and relying on your arm strength \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Losing proper arm position and letting your elbows flare out \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using dumbbells that are too heavy or too light \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neglecting the eccentric (lowering) phase and dropping the weights too quickly \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Forgetting to breathe properly and maintain core stability As you begin feeling stronger in the exercise, you can progress by increasing the weight of your dumbbells or the number of repetitions within the 8 to 12 rep range. You may find that when you initially increase the weight, you need to decrease your reps to maintain good form. That is OK provided you can still perform a minimum of eight reps properly. Getting the most out of this new exercise To maximize the benefits of hammer curls, you need to integrate them into your fitness program a couple times per week. Hammer curls fit well into both arm-specific and full-body workout days. They can be alternated with other bicep and tricep exercises for a comprehensive arm workout or included in a circuit that features a mix of upper and lower body exercises. Remember, hammer curls are more than just an alternative to bicep curls. By incorporating this exercise into your routine, you can significantly enhance not only your arm strength but also your functional abilities essential for daily activities and overall improvement of total-body strength and resiliency for years to come.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/how-to-do-hammer-curls-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness", "text": "Vegetables are great not only\u00a0for their versatility\u00a0\u2014 they can be eaten raw or cooked, whole or chopped \u2014 but also for their health benefits. However, those looking to incorporate more veggies into their diet may be overlooking one in particular. Eating three servings of baby carrots a week can give a significant boost of important nutrients found in the\u00a0orange root vegetables, according to a new unpublished study presented June 30 in Chicago at\u00a0Nutrition 2024,\u00a0the annual meeting of the\u00a0American Society for Nutrition. Surveys found separately in 2015 and 2019 that only\u00a0about 1 in 10 American adults ate the recommended 2 to 3 cups of vegetables daily, according to a 2022 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0report\u00a0on fruit and vegetable intake. That statistic inspired lead study author Mary Harper Simmons and her colleagues to investigate a simple solution that could increase a person\u2019s weekly vegetable intake. \u201c(Baby carrots) are grab and go, great with things like ranch, hummus \u2014 I\u2019ve even seen people dip them in peanut butter \u2014 some people like them plain,\u201d said Simmons, a graduate student in nutrition at Samford University in Alabama. \u201cI would really like to show people that improving your health can be (done) with small simple changes. \u2026 It does not have to be one drastic change overnight.\u201d For the study, one serving of baby carrots \u2014 chopped into smaller pieces and commonly sold at grocery stores \u2014 was around eight to 12 carrots, the equivalent of 100 grams or half a cup, Simmons added. The unpublished study looked at 60 young adults who were either assigned to eat the servings of carrots three times a week, eat no carrots and instead take a multivitamin supplement, consume a combination of the carrots and the multivitamin, or consume neither the carrots or supplement as a control group. After four weeks, the researchers found those who ate the carrots had a 10.8% increase in carotenoids in their skin, natural antioxidants found to have\u00a0health benefits, such as preventing inflammation and promoting heart health, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Additionally, the researchers found those who only took the multivitamin (containing the same carotenoid found in carrots) did not see any changes in carotenoid levels. But those who consumed the carrots and the supplement saw the most benefits and increased their skin carotenoids by 21.6%. \u201cPeople might think, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m getting a multivitamin supplement, (that should be enough),\u2019 but that alone did not increase the carotenoid accumulation. It was a combination that seemed to increase it,\u201d said Dr. Suresh Mathews, the principal investigator for the new study and a professor and chair of Samford\u2019s department of nutrition and dietetics. \u201cThe \u2018food first\u2019\u00a0philosophy always works. But for populations that may be unable to just do only foods or are limited, the combination of the food and the supplements seems to have an even bigger effect in this case,\u201d he added. The benefits of eating carrots and other vegetables \u201cHigh vegetable intake is associated with all kinds of positive health effects \u2014 the risk of all kinds of chronic diseases are lowered with increased fruit and vegetable consumption,\u201d said Dr. Sander Kersten, the director of the division of nutritional sciences and Schleifer Family Professor\u00a0at Cornell University, who was not involved in the new study. Eating vegetables can protect against heart disease, some cancers, diabetes and obesity,\u00a0according to the CDC. But carrots and other orange and red-toned vegetables such as squash and sweet potatoes are unique in that they\u2019re high in beta-carotene, the carotenoid that the body converts into vitamin A, Kersten said. Dark leafy greens, such as spinach and kale, are also high in beta-carotene, he added. Vitamin A is important for keeping your heart, lungs and other organs healthy and also for supporting various bodily functions, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health. Vitamin A deficiency is not common in the United States,\u00a0but people should still look to eat fruits and vegetables to reap the benefits of the natural low-calorie, high-in-fiber foods, Kersten said. Young adults eating vegetables While a reminder to include vegetables in a healthy diet is good for everyone, Simmons said the message is particularly important when it comes to young adults. According to the\u00a02022 CDC report, around 7% of adults\u00a0ages 18 to 30 eat the recommended amount of vegetables, while a 2023\u00a0National College Health Assessment\u00a0from the American College Health Association found that about 1 in 4 college students surveyed said they ate three or more servings of vegetables per day. \u201cYou hear the thing we tell kids, \u2018Eat the rainbow,\u2019 and I feel like for any age that really does stand,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt is good to have a variety of colors on your plate, and if not every single time you eat, just having a variety throughout your day and throughout your week is definitely very beneficial to getting all those key nutrients that our body needs to function.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_travel_camp-stove-cooking-wellness", "text": "You know what I love doing in the summer? I\u2019ll give you three things: \u2022 Taking road trip vacations\u2022 Eating well on my road trips\u2022 Not going over my food budget while on a road trip That last one is a little tricky to pull off because \u2014 and I admit this might be an obvious statement \u2014 the cost of eating adds up over the course of a vacation. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who loves to fill up on a big, leisurely brunch, finding affordable but memorable options for every meal during a long trip can be challenging. I used to make do with deli sandwiches and brought-from-home snacks, but now I have a secret weapon for quick but satisfying road trip lunches: my Coleman camp stove. Despite my outdoorsy hippie reputation among friends, this was the first time I dove into cooking on an outdoor propane stove before renting a camper van for a cross-country trip with my husband on Route 66. But once we were on the road and figured out the logistics of our travel routine, I realized the stove\u2019s versatility and utility, not to mention the genuine fun of being able to cook lunch on the go. With a two-burner stove and pump sink in the back of our camper van, we could pull over and cook lunch pretty much anywhere during each day\u2019s adventures. I made pesto rotini in the parking lot of Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s historic home in Missouri, flipped grilled cheese sandwiches in a local park in Baxter Springs, Kansas, and slurped up cheesy zoodles outside the Painted Desert Inn in Petrified Forest National Park. Now I\u2019m a seasoned outdoor cook and have invested in a full mini kitchen setup for my camping excursions. I\u2019ve fallen in love with camp stove cooking so much that I now bring it with us on most of our summer road trips \u2014 whether we\u2019re camping or not. Coupled with my trusty 10-inch cast-iron skillet, the camp stove gives me a way to save a few bucks and eat well during the day so we can have a big dinner out. I might get a few stares in hotel parking lots and patio areas, but it\u2019s worth it for the convenience and reassurance of a good meal while sticking to my frugal budget. Hey, I own all these items already \u2014 why not use them? My road-trip stove setup Along with my stove and skillet, I also bring a few basic tools for cooking and cleaning. I keep a crate packed with the following: \u2022 Metal tongs\u2022 Fish spatula (slotted spatula)\u2022 Silicone spoonula\u2022 Silicone trivet\u2022 Olive oil (in a small squeeze bottle)\u2022 Kosher salt\u2022 Bar towels\u2022 Washcloth\u2022 Laundry tub\u2022 Castile soap Because I\u2019m using a propane stove, I only cook in well-ventilated outdoor areas and bring a foldable metal table to make sure there is a safe cooking surface no matter where I\u2019ll be. Keep meals simple with pre-prepped ingredients Simplicity is the key to easy camp stove lunches. When I\u2019m planning these meals, I don\u2019t want to complicate my prep with anything that requires chopping on-site. Remember, all equipment needs to be washed in your hotel bathroom, so this is no time to get fancy. To accomplish this, I turn to pre-prepped ingredients, a departure from my usual higher-maintenance home cooking. However, these items are easy to find in many US grocery stores, so they don\u2019t need to be packed in advance. With these versatile building blocks, I can make a variety of meals. I start with a base of shelf-stable carbs, such as bagged, ready-to-eat pasta, rice or grain blends. Protein comes in the form of beans, whether canned or bagged, frozen mini meatballs or seasoned tofu or seitan from the refrigerated section. The frozen and refrigerated produce sections offer a cornucopia of quick-cooking vegetable choices, including zoodles, cauliflower rice and stir-fry blends, pre-chopped onions and peppers, green beans, snap peas, baby spinach, and broccoli florets. Sauces can be as varied as pesto, marinara, salsa, salad dressings, or simply a bit of butter and salt. I\u2019ve also been known to bring some cheese powder from my pantry to make a macaroni and cheese meal as well. Don\u2019t forget that a one-skillet meal can also be as easy as a quesadilla, nachos, flatbreads or a homemade grilled cheese that beats the pants off a basic cold deli sandwich. Mix and match these ingredients and find the fun in cooking outdoors on your camp stove for your next road trip.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/travel/camp-stove-cooking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_health_summer-food-safety-wellness", "text": "This Independence Day holiday takes place as\u00a0record-breaking heat waves\u00a0have spread across many parts of the US and the world, and the temperatures could be deadly. There\u2019s potential for record-breaking heat and extreme heat risk for portions of the South and Southwest. California is likely to be especially hard hit, with highs passing 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) in many areas. At the same time, the avian influenza outbreak has spread to cows, raising questions about whether certain foods like milk, eggs and hamburgers remain safe. As I drank lots of water and perspired through high temperatures and humidity at an outdoor concert this week, I thought about safely celebrating the Fourth of July holiday. What about all the grilled meat, burgers and potato salad sitting outside in the heat?\u00a0How can we stay cool while attending picnics and barbecues during this holiday weekend? Are there additional food safety precautions we should take, given the predicted high temperatures? And are there other health factors to consider this holiday, such as keeping cool and well-hydrated? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: Can you remind us why food safety is important? Dr. Leana Wen: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are around 9 million episodes of foodborne illness annually. These illnesses primarily occur when people ingest food or drink that has been contaminated with bacteria, viruses or parasites. Most episodes are mild, though even mild illnesses are unpleasant\u2014they are generally characterized by nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Some people can become very sick and require hospitalization, and unfortunately, some can die. Those at highest risk for severe illness include older individuals, children under 5, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems. CNN: What food precautions should people take for barbecues and other outdoor gatherings? Wen: Undercooked meat contains a lot of infectious organisms. The best way to make sure meat is cooked thoroughly is to use an internal thermometer. I recommend this US government food safety website to check the internal temperature that different types of meat should be cooked to. For instance, chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit, and ground beef should be cooked to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the meat is cooked, keep it at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or above until serving to prevent germs from developing. Prior to cooking, refrigerate raw meat rather than keeping it at room temperature. It should be removed just before being placed on a barbeque. CNN: Given how hot the weather might be this week, are there other specific factors to consider? Wen: Yes. Under normal weather circumstances, the advice from the US Department of Agriculture is that perishable food can be unrefrigerated for up to two hours. However, if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, that\u2019s reduced to one hour. That applies to cooked meat like hamburgers as well as perishable salads like potato salad and cole slaw. In hot weather, these items should be eaten right away; if not, they should be refrigerated within an hour. CNN: What about people who are having barbecues at parks or other places without refrigerators? Wen: They should have a well-insulated cooler with lots of ice. Raw, uncooked meat should be kept at 40-degrees Fahrenheit or lower until it is ready to go on the grill. I also recommend keeping uncooked meat in tightly sealed bags so that it does not contaminate other items that are served raw, like veggies and fruit. Another precaution for barbeques is to keep an eye on what utensils and plates you use for raw meat versus other food. Label the utensils, plates and containers that come into contact with raw meat. Keep them separate from plates that contain salad items, fruit, chips, buns and other items. CNN: And make sure to wash your hands after touching raw meat? Wen: Yes, absolutely. You don\u2019t want to go right from handling raw hamburger meat to making a salad. Make sure to wash your hands well with soap and water each time after handling raw meat. CNN: Let\u2019s talk about bird flu for a moment. Has the avian flu outbreak affected how we should think about eating products like hamburgers and chicken wings? Is it still safe to eat eggs and drink milk? Wen: According to federal health officials, it is safe to continue eating these products as long as meat and eggs are cooked to the recommended temperatures. It is also safe to keep drinking milk, though it\u2019s crucial to emphasize that the milk needs to be pasteurized. Raw milk is not safe to drink. Not only can raw milk harbor bacteria, but it is also possible that raw milk can transmit the bird flu. It wasn\u2019t advisable for people to drink raw milk or consume products made from raw milk prior to the bird flu outbreak, and it certainly is not advisable now. CNN: We\u2019ve talked a lot about food safety. What are other health issues to consider this Fourth of July? Wen: If you will be in hot weather, be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Watch out for those who are most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, specifically children, older adults and people with chronic medical conditions. Watch out for your pets as well. They can get overheated, too. Never leave pets or children unattended and in a car by themselves; the inside of the car overheats rapidly and these high temperatures can be fatal. Everyone should try to stay in the shade when possible. Keep well-hydrated. Water is the best form of hydration, and be aware that excessive caffeine and alcohol can be dangerous during heat waves. Wear clothing that protects you from the sun, and make sure to apply and re-apply sunscreen often.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/health/summer-food-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2017_09_18_health_opioid-crisis-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at the opioid crisis.  Experts say the United States is in the throes of an opioid epidemic. An estimated 8.9 million Americans aged 12 and older misused opioids in 2022, including 8.5 million prescription pain reliever abusers and 1 million heroin users. Opioids are drugs formulated to replicate the pain-reducing properties of opium. Prescription painkillers like morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone are opioids. Illegal drugs like heroin and illicitly made fentanyl are also opioids. The word \u201copioid\u201d is derived from the word \u201copium.\u201d  Overdose deaths have been on the rise for years in the United States, but surged amid the Covid-19 pandemic: Annual deaths were nearly 50% higher in 2021 than in 2019, CDC data shows. Data on overdose deaths. Prescription opioid volumes peaked in 2011, with the equivalent of 240 billion milligrams of morphine prescribed, according to the market research firm, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee had the highest opioid dispensing rates in 2020. Common Opioids Opioids such as morphine and codeine are naturally derived from opium poppy plants more commonly grown in Asia, Central America and South America. Heroin is an illegal drug synthesized from morphine.  Hydrocodone and oxycodone are semi-synthetic opioids, manufactured in labs with natural and synthetic ingredients.  Fentanyl is a fully synthetic opioid, originally developed as a powerful anesthetic for surgery.  It is also administered to alleviate severe pain associated with terminal illnesses like cancer. The drug is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. Just a small dose can be deadly. Illicitly produced fentanyl has been a driving factor in the number of overdose deaths in recent years.  Methadone is another fully synthetic opioid. It is commonly dispensed to recovering heroin addicts to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.     Opioids bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting pain signals. They also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a \u201chigh.\u201d Addiction Opioid use disorder is the clinical term for opioid addiction or abuse. People who become dependent on opioids may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the medication. Dependence is often coupled with tolerance, meaning that users need to take increasingly larger doses for the same effect.  A drug called naloxone, available as an injection or a nasal spray, is used as a treatment for overdoses. It blocks or reverses the effects of opioids and is often carried by first responders.  Regulation and Funding The 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, allocated $1 billion over two years in opioid crisis grants to states, providing funding for expanded treatment and prevention programs. In April 2017, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price announced the distribution of the first round of $485 million in grants to all 50 states and US territories. In August 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the launch of an Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit within the Department of Justice. The unit\u2019s mission is to prosecute individuals who commit opioid-related health care fraud. The DOJ is also appointing US attorneys who will specialize in opioid health care fraud cases as part of a three-year pilot program in 12 jurisdictions nationwide.  On October 24, 2018, President Donald Trump signed opioid legislation into law. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes provisions aimed at promoting research to find new drugs for pain management that will not be addictive. It also expands access to treatment for substance use disorders for Medicaid patients. State legislatures have also introduced measures to regulate pain clinics and limit the quantity of opioids that doctors can dispense.  Timeline 1861-1865 - During the Civil War, medics use morphine as a battlefield anesthetic. Many soldiers become dependent on the drug.  1898 - Heroin is first produced commercially by the Bayer Company. At the time, heroin is believed to be less habit-forming than morphine, so it is dispensed to individuals who are addicted to morphine. 1914 - Congress passes the Harrison Narcotics Act, which requires that doctors write prescriptions for narcotic drugs like opioids and cocaine. Importers, manufacturers and distributors of narcotics must register with the Treasury Department and pay taxes on products   1924 - The Anti-Heroin Act bans the production and sale of heroin in the United States.  1970 - The Controlled Substances Act becomes law. It creates groupings (or schedules) of drugs based on the potential for abuse. Heroin is a Schedule I drug while morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone (Percocet) and methadone are Schedule II. Hydrocodone (Vicodin) is originally a Schedule III medication. It is later recategorized as a Schedule II drug.  January 10, 1980 - A letter titled \u201cAddiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics\u201d is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It looks at incidences of painkiller addiction in a very specific population of hospitalized patients who were closely monitored. It becomes widely cited as proof that narcotics are a safe treatment for chronic pain.  1995 - OxyContin, a long-acting version of oxycodone that slowly releases the drug over 12 hours, is introduced and aggressively marketed as a safer pain pill by manufacturer, Purdue Pharma.  May 10, 2007 - Purdue Pharma pleads guilty for misleadingly advertising OxyContin as safer and less addictive than other opioids. The company and three executives are charged with \u201cmisleading and defrauding physicians and consumers.\u201d Purdue and the executives agree to pay $634.5 million in criminal and civil fines.  2010 - FDA approves an \u201cabuse-deterrent\u201d formulation of OxyContin, to help curb abuse. However, people still find ways to abuse it.  May 20, 2015 - The DEA announces that it has arrested 280 people, including 22 doctors and pharmacists, after a 15-month sting operation centered on health care providers who dispense large amounts of opioids. The sting, dubbed Operation Pilluted, is the largest prescription drug bust in the history of the DEA.     March 18, 2016 - The CDC publishes guidelines for prescribing opioids for patients with chronic pain. Recommendations include prescribing over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen in lieu of opioids. Doctors are encouraged to promote exercise and behavioral treatments to help patients cope with pain.    March 29, 2017 - Trump signs an executive order calling for the establishment of the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is selected as the chairman of the group, with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an adviser. July 31, 2017 - After a delay, the White House panel examining the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic releases its interim report, asking Trump to declare a national public health emergency to combat the ongoing crisis    September 22, 2017 - The pharmacy chain CVS announces that it will implement new restrictions on filling prescriptions for opioids, dispensing a limited seven-day supply to patients who are new to pain therapy.  November 1, 2017 - The opioid commission releases its final report. Its 56 recommendations include a proposal to establish nationwide drug courts that would place opioid addicts in treatment facilities rather than prison.  February 9, 2018 - A budget agreement signed by Trump authorizes $6 billion for opioid programs, with $3 billion allocated for 2018 and $3 billion allocated for 2019.  February 27, 2018 - Sessions announces a new opioid initiative: The Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force. The mission of the task force is to support local jurisdictions that have filed lawsuits against prescription drugmakers and distributors. March 19, 2018 - The Trump administration outlines an initiative to stop opioid abuse. The three areas of concentration are law enforcement and interdiction; prevention and education via an ad campaign; and job-seeking assistance for individuals fighting addiction. April 9, 2018 - The US surgeon general issues an advisory recommending that Americans carry the opioid overdose-reversing drug, naloxone. A surgeon general advisory is a rarely used tool to convey an urgent message. The last advisory issued by the surgeon general, more than a decade ago, focused on drinking during pregnancy. May 1, 2018 - The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a study that finds synthetic opioids like fentanyl caused about 46% of opioid deaths in 2016. That\u2019s a three-fold increase compared with 2010, when synthetic opioids were involved in about 14% of opioid overdose deaths. It\u2019s the first time that synthetic opioids surpassed prescription opioids and heroin as the primary cause of overdose fatalities.   May 30, 2018 - The journal Medical Care publishes a study that estimates the cost of medical care and substance abuse treatment for opioid addiction was $78.5 billion in 2013.   June 7, 2018 - The White House announces a new multimillion dollar public awareness advertising campaign to combat opioid addiction. The first four ads of the campaign are all based on true stories illustrating the extreme lengths young adults have gone to obtain the powerful drugs. December 12, 2018 - According to the National Center for Health Statistics, fentanyl is now the most commonly used drug involved in drug overdoses. The rate of drug overdoses involving the synthetic opioid skyrocketed by about 113% each year from 2013 through 2016. January 14, 2019 - The National Safety Council finds that, for the first time on record, the odds of dying from an opioid overdose in the United States are now greater than those of dying in a vehicle crash. March 26, 2019 - Purdue Pharma agrees to pay a $270 million settlement to settle a historic lawsuit brought by the Oklahoma attorney general. The settlement will be used to fund addiction research and help cities and counties with the opioid crisis. July 17, 2019 - The CDC releases preliminary data showing a 5.1% decline in drug overdoses during 2018. If the preliminary number is accurate, it would mark the first annual drop in overdose deaths in more than two decades. August 26, 2019 - Oklahoma wins its case against Johnson & Johnson in the first major opioid lawsuit trial to be held in the United States. Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman orders Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million for its role in the state\u2019s opioid crisis. The penalty is later reduced to $465 million, due to a mathematical error made when calculating the judgment. In November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reverses the decision. September 15, 2019 - Purdue files for bankruptcy as part of a $10 billion agreement to settle opioid lawsuits. According to a statement from the chair of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, the money will be allocated to communities nationwide struggling to address the crisis. September 30, 2019 - The FDA and DEA announce that they sent warnings to four online networks, operating a total of 10 websites, which the agencies said are illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded versions of opioid medicines, including tramadol. February 25, 2020 - Mallinckrodt, a large opioid manufacturer, reaches a settlement agreement in principle worth $1.6 billion. Mallinckrodt says the proposed deal will resolve all opioid-related claims against the company and its subsidiaries if it moves forward. Plaintiffs would receive payments over an eight-year period to cover the costs of opioid-addition treatments and other needs. October 21, 2020 - The Justice Department announces that Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has agreed to plead guilty to three federal criminal charges for its role in creating the nation\u2019s opioid crisis. They agree to pay more than $8 billion and close down the company. The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. The Justice Department also reached a separate $225 million civil settlement with the former owners of Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family. In November 2020, Purdue Pharma board chairman Steve Miller formally pleads guilty on behalf of the company. March 15, 2021 - According to court documents, Purdue files a restructuring plan to dissolve itself and establish a new company dedicated to programs designed to combat the opioid crisis. As part of the proposed plan, the Sackler family agrees to pay an additional $4.2 billion over the next nine years to resolve various civil claims. September 1, 2021 - In federal bankruptcy court, Judge Robert Drain rules that Purdue Pharma will be dissolved. The settlement agreement resolves all civil litigation against the Sackler family members, Purdue Pharma and other related parties and entities, and awards them broad legal protection against future civil litigation. The Sacklers will relinquish control of family foundations with over $175 million in assets to the trustees of a National Opioid Abatement Trust. On December 16, 2021, a federal judge overturns the settlement.  February 25, 2022 - Johnson & Johnson and the three largest US drug distributors \u2013 McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and AmerisourceBergen Corp \u2013 finalize a $26 billion nationwide opioid settlement.  March 3, 2022 - The Sackler families reaches a settlement with a group of states the first week of March, according to court filings.

{"id": "2024_07_14_health_confidence-success-anxiety-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Everyone has encountered them: people who always appear to know what they are doing. They gladly take control of a situation, express their opinions as if they were established facts or plunge into a project believing they are going to succeed \u2014 with or without the required experience. What magic dust was sprinkled on their breakfast cereal to give them this superpower? \u201cConfidence \u2014 it is probably the most important resource in human well-being and human performance, I believe,\u201d neuroscientist and psychologist Ian Robertson told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast Chasing Life. Robertson is a professor emeritus of psychology and the codirector of the Global Brain Health Institute at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and the T. Boone Pickens Distinguished Chair\u00a0at the Center for BrainHealth at the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cConfidence is a belief with two strands to it,\u201d said Robertson, the author of \u201cHow Confidence Works: The New Science of Self-Belief.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the belief you can do something, and it\u2019s the belief that if you do that thing, you will get a reward or get an outcome you desire.\u201d When you feel confident, you are more likely to succeed because confidence activates brain circuits that produce an elevated mood, lower anxiety and sharper thinking \u2014 all of which raise the odds of success, Robertson said. These are the same brain circuits that get activated when you do succeed. So whether you have confidence or succeed, even at a small task, it leads to success and then even more confidence. \u201cThe greatest source of success is success,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd success, like confidence, acts like compound interest: It\u2019s exponential. A little bit grows steadily.\u201d You can listen to the full episode here. If confidence is on one end of the spectrum, anxiety is at the other, Robertson said. \u201cIf you lack confidence, if you don\u2019t think you can do that thing, then that will generate anxiety because of the prospect of failure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe greatest source of anxiety is the fear of the negative evaluation of other people, and almost all anxiety has to do with other people.\u201d Additionally, anxiety activates circuits that disrupt \u201cthe fluid synchronization of different brain regions that are critical for elite or top performance,\u201d he noted. Research shows\u00a0that people who are chronically anxious do less of everything, Robertson said. \u201cThey do less \u2026 socially, they do less in work, they do less in hobbies and interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because their brains are primed into a threat mindset, where they\u2019re anticipating and focusing their attention on potential negative outcomes and threat. And that inhibits those systems of the brain that do the opposite with confidence.\u201d For example, Robertson said, take two 5-year-old girls: They are equally intelligent and capable, but one has slightly more confidence than the other. \u201cThat slight difference in confidence will mean that that little girl is more likely to try something new. A tiny thing: Ask a question, (be) less frightened to make a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that will result more likely in a small success. That means she\u2019s then more likely to do the next step. And by the time these two girls are 25, there\u2019s a yawning gap in their achievement and their well-being because of the exponential nature of the mathematics of confidence.\u201d All is not lost if you were not born brimming with confidence. Robertson has five tips for building up confidence, even under daunting circumstances. Take action Taking steps to do something and then doing it (no matter how shaky you feel) will result in a burst of confidence. \u201cConfidence is linked to the action systems of the brain,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cThe great Persian poet Rumi said the road only appears with the first step. And people who lack confidence and have anxiety tend to hold back from taking action because they see \u2018threat.\u2019\u201d Taking action, in spite of feeling anxious, is very important for building confidence, Roberston said. \u00a0 Choose your focus carefully What you pay attention to determines your emotional state, so pick wisely, Robertson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re giving a talk to a group of people and there\u2019s a couple of people on their phones or frowning, your attention will lock on to them because \u2026 that\u2019s what we do when we feel under threat,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHowever, if you deliberately choose to pay attention to the majority of people, or to one person who is looking interested in the front row, who is smiling \u2026 you will feed your brain with positive thoughts and images that will help you remember past successes rather than past failures.\u201d He said that being intentional in this way will not only reduce your anxiety and decrease the effort you have to put into the task, it\u00a0will also build up your confidence. Adopt a growth mindset Your attitude toward yourself and your abilities can make a difference. \u201cYou have to believe that change is possible,\u201d Robertson said. People with a \u201cgrowth\u201d mindset believe that with effort you can learn abilities and cultivate talents; conversely, those with a \u201cfixed\u201d mindset believe talents and abilities are innate \u2014 you either have them or you don\u2019t. \u201cIf you have a fixed mindset \u2014 that is, you believe that your abilities or your emotions are determined by genetics or inheritance \u2014 then you\u2019re not going to engage in \u2026 the slow ups and downs that learning entails,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cYou can learn to be more confident \u2014 but not if you cripple yourself with a fixed mindset.\u201d Fixed theories about yourself are \u201calways wrong\u201d because the human brain is enormously plastic at all ages, he explained. Deal with your anxiety Anxiety is corrosive to confidence, so reframe anxiety as excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to control anxiety by not becoming frightened of it and not treating it as some alien force coming, but rather seeing it as a form of energy that you can harness,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIn fact, the bodily and brain symptoms of anxiety are identical to those of excitement.\u201d Robertson recommends that if faced with a situation that makes you feel anxious, such as a difficult conversation or an interview, adopt a \u201cchallenge\u201d mindset. \u201cYou can actually change your frame of mind to one of \u2018Oh, can I perform here?\u2019 versus \u2018Oh, terrible things are going to happen,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can help yourself do that by the words you say to yourself: \u2018I am excited.\u2019\u201d Robertson said that doing so doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to feel nervous, but by using language, you are harnessing a form of energy. Affirm your values Define yourself and what you stand for, he said. \u201cBecause who you are as a person is grounded in what you stand for and what\u2019s important to you, what your values are,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd if you can just take a few seconds to even write down what your values are and why they\u2019re important to you and what they mean to you, the evidence shows that your brain will be then more resilient and protected against the fear of criticism, of humiliation, of failure.\u201d In other words, Robertson said, you will be protected from the destructive anxiety that eats away at confidence.
