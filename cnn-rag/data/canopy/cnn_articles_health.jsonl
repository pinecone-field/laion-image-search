The US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local partners are investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Africana that has led to 162 illnesses in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Among those cases, 54 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Out of 65 people interviewed for the investigation, 47 reported eating cucumbers, the FDA said Wednesday, and testing by state partners had identified salmonella in a cucumber sample. More testing is underway. The agencies are also investigating an outbreak of Salmonella\u00a0Braenderup to determine whether it\u2019s related to the\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0Africana outbreak. The\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0Braenderup outbreak has led to 158 illnesses in 23 states. \u201cThe two outbreaks share several similarities, including where and when illnesses occurred and the demographics of ill people,\u201d the FDA said Wednesday. Late last month, Florida-based Fresh Start Produce recalled fresh cucumbers shipped distribution centers, wholesalers and food service distributors in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Sellers may have shipped to more states or repackaged cucumbers for stores, the CDC said. Mini cucumbers and English cucumbers are not included in the recall. Symptoms of a salmonella infection\u00a0include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that can start within hours or days of consuming the bacteria. Most people will recover without treatment but should seek immediate attention from a health-care provider if they have severe symptoms, symptoms that don\u2019t improve after a few days or signs of dehydration. Children, elderly people and those with weakened immune systems are more likely to become severely ill. The CDC says people should not eat recalled cucumbers, and they should wash items and surfaces that may have touched the cucumbers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/cucumber-recall-salmonella-fda-cdc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and they went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products. The February 2023 erythritol in study found the risk of heart attack and stroke nearly doubled within three years when people had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood. For the new study on xylitol, the results were basically the same \u2014 people with the highest levels of xylitol compared to those with the lowest levels had nearly twice the risk of heart attack, stroke and death, Hazen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a receptor on our platelets, which we as yet don\u2019t understand, that is recognizing this molecule and signaling to the platelet to be more prone to clot,\u201d he said. \u201cOur tastebuds can\u2019t tell the difference in the structures between sugar and these other sweeteners, but clearly our platelets can.\u201d The World Health Organization warned consumers in 2023 to avoid artificial sweeteners for weight loss, and has called for additional research on the long-term toxicity of low- and no-calorie sweeteners, the study said. \u201cThrough their work, the investigators have shined a light on the safety of sugar substitutes. There is more to learn,\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s Tomey said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is worth remembering that sugar substitutes are no substitute for a sincere commitment to the several elements of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}

There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called \u201cInfluenza A (H5N1),\u201d or the \u201cH5N1 virus.\u201d Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces.  Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia.   The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu.

{"id": "2024_06_05_health_laser-hair-removal-devices-wellness", "text": "With hotter weather often comes more skin showing\u2014and for many that means increased sense of pressure to get rid of body hair. Diet culture already makes summer a tricky time, with advertisements and headlines about celebrities emphasizing the importance of a \u201cbikini body.\u201d Adding a social expectation to remove hair from legs, underarms and bikini area can make it the season of body consciousness. If you want that hair gone, there are a lot of options to address the hair: laser, at home devices, waxing, creams and shaving, said Dr. Deirdre Hooper, cofounder of Audubon Dermatology in New Orleans. While they are all generally safe, she noted that there are some things to consider if you choose to use one of these methods. Laser hair removal The most effective way to get rid of hair in an area long-term is to get laser hair removal procedures in a practitioner\u2019s office, said Dr. Suzanne Kilmer, the founder and director of the Laser & Skin Surgery Center of Northern California and clinical professor at the University of California, Davis Medical Center in Davis, California. \u201cA laser is the most effective way to remove hair because it uses a particular wavelength of light that\u2019s going to perfectly target your hair based on your hair color and your skin color,\u201d Hooper said. Laser hair removal treatments are offered both at dermatologists\u2019 offices and places like medical spas. The safest bet is to have the procedure one in the office \u2013 especially for darker skin tones, Hopper said. \u201cThe darker your skin type, the more you really need to vet who is doing the treatments,\u201d Kilmer said. Only certain wavelengths can be used on darker skin types, and a cooling system is important to get effective hair removal without burn, she added. \u201cIf you have dark skin, don\u2019t even try going to (an inexpensive medical spa) because I get all the burns from those places,\u201d Kilmer said. At home devices You might have seen advertisements all over your social media pop up for devices marketed to be like at home laser hair removal. These tools aren\u2019t new however, Hooper said. They have been around for more than a decade, and they aren\u2019t really laser treatment, she said. Whereas lasers are a targeted beam, at home devices use an intense pulsed light (IPL) of a wide range of wavelengths to work on different hair types and skin types, Hooper added. At home devices are much less expensive than office treatments, generally safe and usually do reduce the hair in that area, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get good results with an at home IPL \u2013 probably 60% to 75% of what you could get with an in-office laser procedure \u2013 and it\u2019s done at your convenience at a lower cost,\u201d she said. However, you may be spending your money on the device only to realize that you want a more effective treatment, Kilmer said. \u201cThey may get temporary hair removal, but it\u2019s very difficult to get good permanent hair removal,\u201d she said. There is also a big safety caveat, Hooper added. The IPL devices target pigment, not hair necessarily. If you have darker toned skin or have a tan, you are at a greater risk for the device burning your skin, she added. \u201cI have treated three of these (burns) this spring already in my office,\u201d Hooper said. Hooper suggests consulting with your dermatologist about if your skin is a good candidate for IPL devices, using them when you haven\u2019t had recent sun exposure, testing on small areas first, and keeping in mind that different parts of your body will have different levels of pigment. Waxing, creams and shaving Waxing and shaving are time honored methods of hair removal, Hooper said. The thing to keep in mind if you go the waxing route with your hair removal is that as hair grows back and tries to pop through the skin, those with coarser and curlier hair are more likely to get in grown hairs, she added. Using a cream dissolves the hair, leaving it less stubby and not quite as noticeable, Kilmer said. But they can be irritating for the skin. Like waxing and creams, shaving isn\u2019t going to stop your hair from growing back \u2013 but contrary to a popular myth, it doesn\u2019t make you grow more hair either, Hooper said. It is common for skin to get more irritated in the summer if you are shaving more frequently, she added. No matter what body parts you are shaving, Hooper recommends doing it at the end of your shower or bath when the hair and skin have had some time to be exposed to water. And a razor with few blades is better, because there is less of a chance of micro nicks in your skin. \u201cActually, some of the less snazzy razors that only have two or three blades are less irritating,\u201d she said. Immediately after, you can use lotion to moisturize the skin. Just be sure it doesn\u2019t have fragrance, which can be irritating, Hooper said. If you do get irritation when the hair starts to come back, use aloe vera for redness and over the counter cortisol cream to calm the irritation, she said. But if you are looking for less hair, less ingrown hair and less maintenance, your best bet is going to be laser hair removal first with the at home devices as a runner up, Hooper said. \u201cTry to find a way to see someone who can do a laser on you who is safe and knows about the risks associated with laser \u2013 ideally a board-certified dermatologist,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/laser-hair-removal-devices-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Two teams of scientists have discovered a theoretically habitable planet, smaller than Earth but bigger than Venus, orbiting a small star about 40 light-years away. The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said. But though the exoplanet could potentially be habitable for humans and is relatively \u201cnear\u201d our solar system in astronomical terms, it is unlikely that anyone will visit there soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not reachable, it\u2019s 12 parsecs away,\u201d said Palethorpe, adding that it would take about 225,000 years to reach Gliese 12b with the fastest spacecraft that currently exist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}

In Boulder, Frasier staff and residents heard about the planned outage from news reports. A Frasier official called the utility to confirm and was initially told the home\u2019s power would not be affected. The utility then called back to say the home\u2019s power would be cut, after all, said Tomas Mendez, Frasier\u2019s vice president of operations. The home had just 75 minutes before Xcel Energy shut off the lights on April 6. Staff rushed to prepare the 20-acre campus home to nearly 500 residents. Generators kept running the oxygen machines, most refrigerators and freezers, hallway lights, and Wi-Fi for phones and computers. But the heating system and some lights stayed off as the overnight temperature dipped into the 30s. Power was restored to Frasier after 28 hours. During the shut-off, staff tended to nursing home and assisted living residents, many with dementia, Mendez said. \u201cThese are the folks that depend on us for everything: meals, care, and medications,\u201d he said. Not knowing when power would be restored, even 24 hours into the crisis, was stressful and expensive, including the next-day cost of refilling fuel for two generators, Mendez said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky we didn\u2019t have any injuries or anything major, but it is likely these could happen when there are power outages \u2014 expected or unexpected. And that puts everyone at risk,\u201d Mendez said. As preemptive power cuts become more widespread, nursing homes are being forced to evaluate their preparedness. But it shouldn\u2019t be up to the facilities alone, according to industry officials and academics: Better communication between utilities and nursing homes, and including the facilities in regional disaster preparedness plans, is critical to keep residents safe. \u201cWe need to prioritize these folks so that when the power does go out, they get to the front of the line to restore their power accordingly,\u201d said David Dosa, chief of geriatrics and professor of medicine at UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts, of nursing home residents. Restoring power to hospitals and nursing homes was a priority throughout the windstorm, wrote Xcel Energy spokesperson Tyler Bryant in an email. But, he acknowledged, public safety power shut-offs can improve, and the utility will work with community partners and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to help health facilities prepare for extended power outages in the future. When the forecast called for wind gusts of up to 100 mph on April 6, Xcel Energy implemented a public safety power shut-off. Nearly 275,000 customers were without power from the windstorm. Officials had adapted after the Marshall Fire killed two people and destroyed or damaged more than 1,000 homes in Boulder and the neighboring communities of Louisville and Superior two and a half years ago. Two fires converged to form that blaze, and electricity from an Xcel Energy power line that detached from its pole in hurricane-force winds \u201cwas the most probable cause\u201d of one of them. \u201cA preemptive shutdown is scary because you don\u2019t really have an end in mind. They don\u2019t tell you the duration,\u201d said Jenny Albertson, director of quality and regulatory affairs for the Colorado Health Care Association and Center for Assisted Living. More than half of nursing homes in the West are within 3.1 miles of an area with elevated wildfire risk, according to a\u00a0study published last year. Yet, nursing homes with the greatest risk of fire danger in the Mountain West and Pacific Northwest had poorer compliance with federal emergency preparedness standards than their lower-risk counterparts. Under federal guidelines, nursing homes must have disaster response plans that include\u00a0emergency power\u00a0or building evacuation. Those plans don\u2019t necessarily include contingencies for public safety power shut-offs,\u00a0which have increased\u00a0in the past five years but are still relatively new. And nursing homes in the West are rushing to catch up. In California, a more stringent law to bring emergency power in nursing homes up to code is expected by the California Association of Health Facilities to\u00a0cost over $1 billion. But the state has not allocated any funding for these facilities to comply, said Corey Egel, the association\u2019s director of public affairs. The association is asking state officials to delay implementation of the law for five years, to Jan. 1, 2029. Most nursing homes operate on a razor\u2019s edge in terms of federal reimbursement, Dosa said, and it\u2019s incredibly expensive to retrofit an old building to keep up with new regulations. Frasier\u2019s three buildings for its 300 residents in independent living apartments each have their own generators, in addition to two generators for assisted living and skilled nursing, but none is hooked up to emergency air conditioning or heat because those systems require too much energy. Keeping residents warm during a minus-10-degree night or cool during two 90-degree days in Boulder \u201care the kinds of things we need to think about as we consider a future with preemptive power outages,\u201d Mendez said. Federal audits of emergency preparedness at nursing homes in\u00a0California\u00a0and\u00a0Colorado\u00a0found facilities lacking. In Colorado, eight of 20 nursing homes had deficiencies related to emergency supplies and power, according to the report. These included three nursing homes without plans for alternate energy sources like generators and four nursing homes without documentation showing generators had been properly tested, maintained, and inspected. For Debra Saliba, director of UCLA\u2019s Anna and Harry Borun Center for Gerontological Research, making sure nursing homes are part of emergency response plans could help them respond effectively to any kind of power outage. Her\u00a0study of nursing homes\u00a0after a magnitude 6.7 earthquake that shook the Los Angeles area in 1994 motivated LA County to integrate nursing homes into community disaster plans and drills. Too often, nursing homes are forgotten during emergencies because they are not seen by government agencies or utilities as health care facilities, like hospitals or dialysis centers, Saliba added. Albertson said she is working with hospitals and community emergency response coalitions in Colorado on disaster preparedness plans that include nursing homes. But understanding Xcel Energy\u2019s prioritization plan for power restoration would also help her prepare, she said. Bryant said Xcel Energy\u2019s prioritization plan for health facilities specifies not whether their electricity will be turned off during a public safety power shut-off \u2014 but how quickly it will be restored. Julie Soltis, Frasier\u2019s director of communications, said the home had plenty of blankets, flashlights, and batteries during the outage. But Frasier plans to invest in headlamps for caregivers, and during a town hall meeting, independent living residents were encouraged to purchase their own backup power for mobile phones and other electronics, she said. Soltis hopes her facility is spared during the next public safety power shut-off or at least given more time to respond. \u201cWith weather and climate change, this is definitely not the last time this will happen,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_06_04_health_internet-addiction-teen-brain-activity-wellness", "text": "Teens who spend lots of time on social media have complained of feeling like they can\u2019t pay attention to more important things like homework or time with loved ones. A new study has possibly captured that objectively, finding that for teens diagnosed with internet addiction, signaling between brain regions important for controlling attention, working memory and more was disrupted. The findings are from a review, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Mental Health, of 12 neuroimaging studies of a few hundred adolescents ages 10 to 19 between 2013 and 2022. \u201cThe behavioural addiction brought on by excessive internet use has become a rising source of concern since the last decade,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. The criteria for clinical diagnosis of internet addiction in the included studies were \u201cone\u2019s persistent preoccupation with the internet, withdrawal symptoms when away from the internet, and sacrificing relationships (for) time to spend on the internet over an extended period of time (e.g., 12 months),\u201d said Max Chang, first author of the study and outreach case manager at the nonprofit Peninsula Family Service in San Francisco, via email. \u201cThe pattern of behaviour results in significant impairment or distress in the individual\u2019s life.\u201d Given the changing state of adolescent brains compared with adults, the authors felt understanding the impacts of internet addiction on the teenage participants\u2019 brains was vital. When participants clinically diagnosed with internet addiction engaged in activities governed by the brain\u2019s executive function network \u2014 behaviors requiring attention, planning, decision-making and impulse control \u2014 those brain regions showed substantial disruption in their ability to work together, compared to those in peers without internet addiction. The authors think such signaling changes could suggest these behaviors can become more difficult to perform, potentially influencing development and well-being. \u201cWhile this paper presents a straightforward systematic review suggesting that there are associations between functional connectivity in the brain and internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 there are a number of fundamental limitations to be aware of that are critical to any interpretation,\u201d Dr. David Ellis, a behavioral scientist at the University of Bath\u2019s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour, said in a news release. \u201cCause and effect cannot be drawn from these studies,\u201d said Ellis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cSecond, the focus on functional connectivity comes at the expense of any critique about the key measure of interest. Specifically, internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 which was initially conjured up by (psychiatrist) Ivan K. Goldberg in 1995 as a joke. \u201cToday, the conceptualisation and measurement of internet \u2018addiction\u2019 is neither universally accepted and certainly not diagnosable using the survey instruments used in the studies included as part of the review,\u201d Ellis added. \u201cSimilarly, the enormity of activities that the internet allows for immediately makes this definition somewhat redundant.\u201d In the United States, internet addiction isn\u2019t included in the DSM-V \u2014 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the US. It does, however, list internet gaming disorder. All the studies the authors reviewed were all conducted in Asia and consisted of mostly male participants. China was the first country to declare internet addiction a \u201cpublic health crisis.\u201d \u201cSuch definitions, despite being widely critiqued, also have a tendency to move the focus away from genuine online harm and towards a conclusion that suggests the removal of technology from people\u2019s lives will be helpful,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSolid evidence to suggest that removing the internet brings any tangible benefits has not been forthcoming.\u201d Additionally, all studies were conducted at one point in time, said Dr. Eva Telzer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cGiven that there are no longitudinal data,\u201d Telzer said, \u201cit is very possible that adolescents who have underlying differences in brain connectivity patterns are more vulnerable to developing internet addiction.\u201d Overcoming internet addiction If internet addiction is what caused the disruption in participants\u2019 brain signaling, the reason why may have to do with neural pathways related to addiction, said Dr. Smita Das, an addiction psychiatrist and clinical associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine in California. Das wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The functional connectivity patterns in participants\u2019 brains are, in fact, in line with those observed in people with substance addictions, said Dr. Caglar Yildirim, an associate teaching professor of computer science at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston. Yildirim wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cOverall, the mechanisms underlying internet addiction are more like an emerging pattern than a finished picture,\u201d Chang said. \u201cA lot of causality between what happens in the brain and what is displayed through behavior is still being understood. As of now, observation using biomarkers such as functional connectivity helps bridge that gap.\u201d\u00a0 If you\u2019re wondering if your teen struggles with internet addiction, behaviors such as withdrawing from relationships are a telltale sign, Chang said. \u201cSimilar to substance and gambling disorders, internet addiction rewires the brain, making it harder to resist internet related stimuli,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, unlike gambling or substance usage, the internet is an important part of our lives. Balancing the usefulness and dangers of the internet is a field that is very crucial going forward in adolescent development.\u201d Find what keeps your teen off the internet and help them do more of it, Yildirim suggested. You can also talk with your child\u2019s doctor to see if behavioral strategies can work, Das suggested. Therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness and motivational interviewing are helpful. The latter, which originated in the field of addiction treatment, is a counseling method that aims to increase a patient\u2019s motivation for, and commitment to, behavioral change by eliciting and exploring the patient\u2019s own reasons for wanting change. In severe cases, a psychiatrist may suggest medication to treat certain types of technology addiction, she added.

{"id": "2024_06_07_health_alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Looking back, Tammy Maida, 67, said things started to change in her late 50s. At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}

As the co-founder of Wild Instincts animal rescue in Wisconsin\u2019s Northwoods, Naniot and his team spent the season sweating in gloves, gowns, smocks and masks and going through what felt like endless rounds of disinfection as they moved between the cages of the sick and injured animals they cared for. The precautions were necessary for a trio of infectious diseases occurring with some frequency in wild animals that summer: Covid-19 was still making life difficult, and a devastating contagion called chronic wasting disease was showing up in deer in the area. Then, there was H5N1 bird flu to contend with.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s highly, highly transmissible,\u201d said Naniot, who has been involved in animal rescue for 35 years. Since it was first discovered in birds in 1996, H5N1 has shown itself to be a Swiss Army Knife of a virus, evolving the necessary tools to break into the cells of a growing list of species.\u00a0So far, it has infected and killed millions of wild and farmed birds.\u00a0It\u2019s also been found in at least 26 different kinds of mammals, including, most recently in the United States \u2014 cows, cats and house mice. The voraciousness of the virus prompted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization in April to call it \u201ca global zoonotic animal pandemic.\u201d Along the way, people have been a kind of collateral damage. Humans can be infected, but we aren\u2019t really the intended targets. That could all change quickly, however. \u201cInfluenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors don\u2019t always work in favor of the virus.\u00a0Most of the time, viruses with errors won\u2019t work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive.\u00a0But every once in a while, a random error can result in a change to the virus that give it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow. If humans happen to be that environment, and H5N1 changes at the right place at the right time, suddenly the animal pandemic could become a major problem for people, too. Naniot had seen wild birds come into Wild Instincts rescue with H5N1 \u2014 bald eagles, hawks and owls \u2014 but nothing had prepared him for the red fox kits. The baby foxes were brought in stumbling and uncoordinated, making him think they might have gotten into some kind of poison. Then the seizures started. \u201cThey would have these severe, severe seizures,\u201d Naniot said. \u201cScreaming very loud, whole-body tremors.\u201d The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. \u201cAnd then it would get longer and longer and longer,\u201d he said. Naniot hadn\u2019t known his young patients could get bird flu. Further research clued him in to the fact that foxes had recently joined a growing list of species that could succumb, usually after eating the flesh of infected dead birds. \u201cThe severity of the seizures is something I really hadn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Naniot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad thing to see, the progression of the disease.\u201d Risks to humans Though H5N1 is known to have infected nearly 900 people in the past 30 years, these infections have been sporadic and usually self-limiting. The virus can still be deadly, however: More than 50% of people who are known to have been infected with H5N1 have died. Still, the virus isn\u2019t particularly good at infecting humans. Even when virus manages to get into a person and cause symptoms, it rarely gets passed to someone else. \u201cWe call these dead-end infections,\u201d said Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinarian and expert in zoonotic infections, at the University of Guelph in Canada. The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in.\u00a0 But it is not a virus that\u2019s well-adapted to humans, so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions \u2014 the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs \u2014 which would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath. There have been at least three of these have apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who worked closely with infected milk cows.\u00a0Two of the workers developed conjunctivitis, or eye infections.  In one case, the worker reported getting splashed with raw milk in their eyes. A third developed respiratory symptoms after close contact with cows.\u00a0All were successfully treated with an antiviral medication.\u00a0None developed severe symptoms or infected others. Using a strain of H5N1 from the recent cattle outbreak, scientists recently confirmed that this version of the virus is unlikely to transmit through the air. In experiments with ferrets, which are considered the gold standard for studying how viruses transmit in people, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew a sample of the same H5N1 virus taken from a farmworker with the flu in Texas to experimentally infect six of the animals.\u00a0Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals.\u00a0These animals could touch, nose and lick the sick animals, and all of them became ill. Next, the CDC tested airborne transmission by putting three healthy ferrets into an enclosure where they could breathe the same air as sick animals but couldn\u2019t touch them.\u00a0 Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. So far, that seems to be what\u2019s happening in the real world, too.\u00a0 Though more than 80 dairy herds have tested positive across at least 12 states, the number of human infections has apparently been low, though there\u2019s been little testing to confirm that. These early ferret experiments are good news, the CDC noted, because it means the virus would need to change to become an infection spread person-to-person through the airborne droplets. The agency said it plans to repeat the tests. As Covid has shown, all of this could change in the the rub of an eye or a small cough. The more opportunity the virus has to spread, the more opportunity it has to change in ways that will help it pry its way into human cells. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand everything we know today is a snapshot of today, and these viruses can change very quickly,\u201d said Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and former director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the Chasing Life podcast. \u201cThey can adapt, and they can spread very easily when they do change,\u201d said Bright, who is now CEO of Bright Global Health.  Dr. Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says that while humans have been exposed to seasonal strains of the flu, and flu vaccines help build immunity H1 and H3 flu strains, H5N1 would look pretty different to our bodies. \u201cOur existing immunity to H3 and H1 is not necessarily going to protect us against exposure to an H5 virus,\u201d she said. The CDC\u2019s ferret study also had some sobering findings.\u00a0 In contrast to seasonal flu, which makes ferrets sick, but doesn\u2019t kill them, H5N1 killed all the ferrets that were infected. \u201cWhile the three cases of A(H5N1) in the United States have been mild, it is possible that there will be serious illnesses among people,\u201d the CDC wrote in its conclusions on the study. In the more than two dozen human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide since 2022, with the most recent iteration of the virus, there\u2019s been a wide spectrum of severity.\u00a0Fourteen illnesses were severe or critical, seven were fatal, six were mild and eight didn\u2019t have any symptoms at all, according to the CDC. Dr. Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist and immunologist at Emory University who specializes in the flu, thinks the difference in symptom severity may be due to previous exposure to seasonal viruses. Her experiments in ferrets suggest that our bodies wouldn\u2019t necessarily be totally defenseless.\u00a0 In her lab, ferrets with previous exposures to seasonal flu strains didn\u2019t get as sick when exposed to new flu viruses compared to those with no prior exposure to seasonal strains.\u00a0 She says she hasn\u2019t tested this with any of the strains involved in the cattle outbreak, however. So while we probably don\u2019t have any antibodies\u00a0\u2014 the immune system\u2019s front-line soldiers \u2014 at the ready to fight off an H5 infection, there are memory cells in our tissues that might recognize parts of a new flu virus and respond. How much help we might get from past exposures to flu viruses is difficult to predict, however, which is why vaccination would still be important to tune up our immunity. Plans to stop the virus from spreading The US has vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, and last month, government officials said 4.8 million doses are being\u00a0\u201cfilled and finished\u201d so they would be ready for use, though there\u2019s no plan to give them to anyone yet. Finland has already ordered 20,000 doses of a different H5 strain \u2014 H5N8 \u2014 which, will be used as soon as they\u2019re available to protect workers who might be vulnerable to the virus, such as scientists and those in direct contact with infected animals\u00a0on mink farms, local\u00a0officials told\u00a0health and science news outlet,\u00a0STAT News. For now, the CDC maintains its assessment that the risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, though people who work with infected animals have a higher risk and should wear protective clothing and take additional precautions to avoid getting sick. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, has made that protective equipment available to states for use on farms, and the USDA has made additional funding available to farms to support efforts to safeguard their livestock from disease. But so far, wearing this equipment is voluntary, and there are concerns that it might be difficult for farm workers to wear the full recommended kit, which includes coveralls, an apron, a mask, eye protection, a head covering, gloves and boots during the summer, which is again expected to break heat records. The government has also said it is working on the development of a rapid test for H5N1. Bright thinks severity of symptoms may depend on how much virus a person is exposed to when they are infected. Touching contaminated milk or the body of a dead bird and then\u00a0rubbing your eyes or nose might deliver a smaller dose of the virus, and ultimately result in milder symptoms. Whereas ingesting large amount of virus \u2014 as some animals do when they scavenge for food or as humans in some countries do when consuming dishes made with duck blood \u2014 could lead to severe disease. \u201cThe virus is able to infect a number of internal organs. So it doesn\u2019t just locate, say, in the lungs, as we would think most influenza viruses would,\u201d Bright said. It\u2019s also been found in \u201cthe brains and then the spleens, the intestines, and the heart and throughout the body of those animals.\u201d Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the WHO\u2019s Collaborating Centre on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s at the top of the list in terms of bad guy viruses,\u201d he said, noting that the virus is nerve-loving, or neurotropic. \u201cSo it goes to the brain and causes very, very severe disease.\u201d Infected animals often behave strangely or aggressively.\u00a0Ducks waddle in circles, twisting their necks, writhing on the ground. \u201cI would hate to see it in humans,\u201d Webby said. So far, the virus hasn\u2019t made the changes that would enable it to become a fully human pathogen, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear whether it ever will. \u201cI\u2019ve been a student of this virus. And I surely have been amazed at how it\u2019s changed over the course of the last 20-some years, but at the same time, you know, I\u2019m looking for evidence that it is likely to become a virus infecting humans and then transmitted by humans to other humans. And we just haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d he added. Naniot at the Wisconsin animal rescue said they tried to save about seven infected fox kits in the summer of 2022, but all of them died. Other rescue organizations in their network had a few foxes infected with H5N1 that survived, but they ultimately went blind. While all the precautions they took to safely work with the animals were arduous, Naniot said he\u2019s grateful they were effective. They never spread the virus to any of the other animals in the facility \u2014 including themselves. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s kind of like when Covid went through, you know, it first started someplace,\u201d he said. Naniot says he hasn\u2019t encountered any infected animals since 2022, but he\u2019s watching the news closely in case any cow herds become infected in Wisconsin, knowing that he could easily see H5N1 again. \u201cIt spread kind of like wildfire, and it\u2019s a highly, highly contagious disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/bird-flu-animals-humans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_health_senate-hearing-fda-flavored-vapes", "text": "Republicans and Democrats on the US Senate Judiciary Committee showed rare agreement Wednesday as they took to task the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Justice for what they described as inaction on the country\u2019s youth vaping epidemic. Nearly three years ago, a federal court ruled that the FDA was violating the Tobacco Control Act by allowing e-cigarette products that did not have FDA pre-authorization to stay on the market. An FDA official testified Wednesday that the topic was a \u201ctop priority,\u201d but the agency has missed the September 2021 deadline that the court set to for the agency to complete its review of e-cigarette makers\u2019 applications to sell their products. Since that time, one study found, an estimated 2.1 million children have used e-cigarettes regularly, and the majority use flavored products. \u201cAfter the court-ordered deadline passed on September 9, 2021, the FDA could have ordered every single unauthorized e-cigarette off the market, and that\u2019s what it should have done,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, told Dr. Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cInstead, thousands of unauthorized e-cigarettes flooded the market.\u201d In fact, Durbin said, his staffers found vapes in flavors like Red Bull, strawberry, dragonfruit and watermelon bubble gum at a shop just a mile from FDA headquarters. \u201cNot a single one of these products has been authorized by the FDA. None of them. These illegal products, clearly designed for kids by their flavors, are being sold\u201d even in the shadow of FDA headquarters, he said. Placing one of the products in front of him, Durbin asked how the FDA could let such sales happen. \u201cThe volume of those applications and the volume of the market requires us to prioritize our enforcement efforts,\u201d King testified. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, also told the representatives from the FDA and the Department of Justice that she was displeased. \u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing to hear you kind of talk in circles about what you are planning to do, but you haven\u2019t established a plan, and you\u2019re not certain what your way forward is going to be,\u201d she said. King said the FDA has received 27 million applications for e-cigarette products. But unlike with companies that make drugs and medical devices, which pay user fees that fund the agency\u2019s work, the FDA is not allowed to\u00a0collect fees from e-cigarette makers. King asked the Senate committee for the authority to fund this increased workload. \u201cThe rapidly evolving tobacco product landscape presents an unprecedented time and resource challenge that no other center at FDA has ever faced,\u201d King said. Since June, the FDA has authorized only 23 e-cigarette products \u2013 none of them flavored \u2013 and has denied many more. Hundreds of thousands of additional applications are still pending. From 2020 to 2023, there was a 1,500% increase in flavored tobacco products sold in the US, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. He also brought in flavored vape products that his staffers bought, including watermelon bubble gum, apple melon berry and one called Tyson Heavyweight. \u201cDr. King, those are clearly designed for consumption by children, correct?\u201d Cornyn asked. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the intent of the manufacturer, but I can say that flavors do appeal to kids. Ninety percent of youth who use e-cigarettes use flavored varieties,\u201d King testified. About 10% of high school-age adolescents and nearly 5% of middle school students use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, King said. But when they do vape, teens and young adults are much more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. \u201cMore work is definitely needed,\u201d he testified. Enforcement of the law is the other challenge, the FDA and DOJ said at the hearing. The FDA has conducted thousands of inspections of e-cigarette manufacturers and distributors resulting in nearly 900 warning letters, King said. More than 500 warning letters have gone to retail stores, King said, but if the letters are ignored that\u2019s as far as the FDA can go, so it must rely on the DOJ and other agencies. It was only this week that the FDA and several law enforcement agencies announced that they were creating a task force that will use the criminal and civil tools available to fight the illegal sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. \u201cWhat in the hell have you been waiting for?\u201d Durbin asked Arun Rao, deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch in the Department of Justice. \u201cSenator, we have been acting on a number of fronts,\u201d Rao replied. He said the Justice Department has been working with the US Marshals Service and the FDA on seizures of illegal products, but he admitted that \u201cmany manufactures have exploited the premarket authorization process.\u201d Rao testified that many manufacturers whose products have been denied FDA authorization make minimal alterations and resubmit for approval. Some overseas e-cigarette makers will also misrepresent shipments in an effort to slip past regulators, and some stores make their own products. \u201cTaken together, these factors have made illegal e-cigarettes all too accessible,\u201d Rao said. Many products come from China, but that country has banned flavored e-cigarettes, and the products are not sold in Chinese stores \u2013 a point that wasn\u2019t lost on the committee. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell them in China, but you can sell them in the United States and essentially victimize and addict our children to these nicotine delivery devices,\u201d Cornyn said. Nicotine is highly addictive and hurts kids, testified Dr. Susan Walley, immediate past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Section on Nicotine and Tobacco Prevention and Treatment. Nicotine can permanently hurt a teen\u2019s developing brain, studies show, impairing working memory and attention. Flavored products are too tempting and easy to access, said Walley, who brought with her a flavored e-cigarette product called OMG Blow Pop that she said she purchased within walking distance of a school. \u201cSimply put, this is unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need the federal government to get these illegal products off the market.\u201d Even representatives of the vaping industry testified that they were unhappy with the FDA\u2019s authorization process. \u201cThis is a hot mess right now,\u201d said Tony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association. He complained that there was no clear pathway through the approval process and said that without one, \u201cwe are going to persist in having an illicit market.\u201d A high school senior, Josie Shapiro of Seattle, told the committee that vaping products are too easy to access. She said she started vaping after several friends did. \u201cThey thought vapes were harmless because of the fun flavors and colorful packaging,\u201d Shapiro testified. Shapiro said she has tried to quit several times, but vaping has taken over her and her friends\u2019 lives. \u201cI\u2019ve felt completely out of control, helpless and alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t spend quality time with my friends without thinking about when we were going to get our next hit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/health/senate-hearing-fda-flavored-vapes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}

We recommend bright and contrasting colors such as neon yellow, orange, pink, and bright red,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cThese colors are highly visible both underwater and on the surface. Swimsuit colors are not talked about enough in public safety, said Wyatt Werneth, a coastal lifeguard in Florida and spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association. \u201cThe bright clothes are something that we\u2019ve identified as being a game-changer. If you have the same colors of the water or the environment, you\u2019re going to blend in,\u201d Werneth said while patrolling Cocoa Beach. \u201cWe consider this also with missing children. Not only the fact that the bright colors are going to help us locate them in a pool environment or the beach, but one of the things that lifeguards do more than anything else \u2013 you think we go out and wrestle with sharks and save people from rip currents \u2013 but we also look for missing children at the beach,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re wearing a bright color, and if you take a picture of those children before, then we\u2019ll have a picture and know what to look for. So, you can help us \u2013 not only can drowning be prevented, missing persons\u2019 [cases] can be prevented as well.\u201d Swimsuit color test A company called Alive Solutions, which specializes in water safety, has found in two separate experiments that certain swimsuit colors are easier to spot in a swimming pool or open water, such as a lake. In tests, the company\u2019s water safety experts placed swimsuits of various colors in swimming pools and lakes to determine how visible they may be. The tests were conducted independently and not published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cIn our main testing we did 14 different colors,\u201d Natalie Livingston, co-founder and owner of Alive Solutions, said in an email. \u201cWater is not like looking through air.\u00a0Even the tiniest bit of surface agitation, glare, or movement in the water can cause objects and people to become distorted,\u201d she said. \u201cVisibility in water can be increased or decreased depending on the color of a swimsuit or clothing.\u201d Livingston, who has been a lifeguard for more than 25 years, remembers watching her children at the pool one afternoon with other parents and that\u2019s when she realized that some children wearing either dark- or pastel-colored swimsuits seemed to visibly disappear in the water. Her colleagues and she later decided to conduct the tests from 2019 through last year. In a swimming pool, with a light-colored bottom, the company\u2019s tests showed that neon pink and neon orange appeared to be the most visible. Darker colors showed up against the light pool bottom, but could often be dismissed for shadows, leaves or dirt. White and light blue swimsuits were not as visible and seemed to disappear completely in the pool. \u201cLight colors or blues tend to look like glare spots or cloud reflections, or completely blend in with the environment,\u201d Livingston said in the email. In 18 inches of lake water, the tests showed that bright neon colors \u2013 including neon orange, yellow and green \u2013 were most visible against the lake bottom, but neon pink did not perform well. White swimsuits appeared more due to reflecting light, but not as much as the bright neon colors. All other colors were not very visible. Overall, Livingston said, neons won for visibility in all environments. \u201cWe have heard from so many parents that said they had their kid in a bright-colored swimsuit and the color caught their attention out of the corner of their eye and they responded to prevent a drowning event,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cOf course, the color of the suit doesn\u2019t matter if no one is supervising effectively, but it can and does help in partnership with effective supervision and other layers of water safety prevention.\u201d Layers of water safety It certainly makes sense that bright swimsuit colors can play a role in making a child more visible in the water in case of an emergency, but there isn\u2019t \u201creal-world evidence\u201d that having a child in a neon bathing suit leads to better outcomes in a drowning event, said Dr. Maneesha Agarwal, an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Emory University School of Medicine. \u201cThe goal is that you never have to even rely on your child\u2019s bathing suit color to find them in a drowning event at all,\u201d Agarwal said, adding that appropriate water safety includes various layers of protection. \u201cOther important layers include making sure your child is water-competent \u2013 so that means swim lessons. Making sure your child has good supervision whenever they are in the water, which means that the parents or a designated adult is watching the child in the water,\u201d she said, adding that it is important to look out for signs of drowning. Unlike how drowning is portrayed in the movies \u2013 with loud splashing and screams for help \u2013 drowning events in the real world occur silently and quickly, Agarwal said. \u201cThe child that\u2019s drowning, they\u2019re not going to be yelling for help. They are typically going to be struggling to keep their face above water level, so you might see their face kind of going up and down above the water level. And it really can only take 30 to 60 seconds before they\u2019re completely submerged,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cYou also want to make sure that you are doing everything you can to prevent your child from getting into the water unsupervised. That means if you have a pool, wherever you live or wherever you are visiting, making sure there\u2019s appropriate four-sided pool fencing that keeps children from accessing the pool,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then if the unthinkable happens, making sure that you are prepared \u2013 you know how to perform CPR, and you are able to rapidly call 911, and if you happen to be near an open body of water in particular, life jackets are imperative.\u201d The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data last month showing that accidental drowning rates are on the rise in the United States. The new numbers show that more than 4,500 people drowned each year between 2020 and 2022, which is about 500 more\u00a0drowning\u00a0deaths each year compared with the previous year in 2019. Children especially are at high risk, as drowning\u00a0is the number-one cause of death for children 1-4 years old in the United States. But some studies have shown that participating in formal swimming lessons is associated with an 88% reduced risk of drowning in young children, said Chris DeJong, founder and president of Big Blue Swim School, which offers swimming lessons to children. He added that wearing bright-colored swimsuits is just one tool in a toolbox of many steps children can take to be safer while in or around a swimming pool. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends swim lessons as a layer of protection against drowning and says they can start for many children as early as 1. \u201cStarting at that very early age can help make them more comfortable as we start to get into more advanced lessons when they\u2019re older \u2013 so they\u2019re not starting from scratch and having to overcome a fear of something brand new, which can be challenging with swim lessons,\u201d DeJong said. \u201cSwim lessons are the most important tool to help kids save themselves and know what to do in an emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd know your risk factors. Younger children, typically under the age of 10, are most commonly drowning victims in residential pools, whereas drowning victims over the age of 14 are typically in natural bodies of water.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/swimsuit-color-pool-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_antidepressant-discontinuation-withdrawal-symptoms-wellness", "text": "Antidepressants can do wonders for persistent mental health problems. But some people may be reluctant to take the medications, fearing what could happen if they want to stop taking them one day. That risk has now been quantified, thanks to a new review of 79 studies \u2014 known as a meta-analysis \u2014 totaling 21,002 adult participants age 45 on average. Roughly 15% of participants who discontinued antidepressants experienced withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, insomnia and irritability, according to the review published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry. One in 35 participants experienced severe symptoms once they stopped taking antidepressants. The review is the first publication of a larger project on antidepressant withdrawal symptoms, the authors said. \u201cThere is strong evidence that antidepressants can be effective for many people who are experiencing a depressive disorder, either alone, or alongside other treatments such as psychotherapy,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Henssler, senior author of the study and senior physician in the department of psychiatry and neurosciences at Charit\u00e9 \u2014 University Medicine in Berlin, in a news release. \u201cHowever, they do not work for everyone, and some patients may experience unpleasant side effects. In patients who have recovered with the help of antidepressants, the decision from doctors and patients may be to stop taking them in time,\u201d Henssler added. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s important both doctors and patients have an accurate, evidence-based picture of what might happen.\u201d The occurrence of withdrawal symptoms was reported or described as early as 1959, but researchers neglected those reports until the late 1990s, according to the review.\u00a0 Until now, \u201cthere has been a lot of \u2018debate\u2019 about the important problem of antidepressant withdrawal in the last few years, which has appeared within print and social media, with very high estimates of withdrawal being pronounced at around 50% and half (considered) as severe,\u201d said Dr. Sameer Jauhar, senior clinical lecturer in affective disorders and psychosis at King\u2019s College London, in a news release. Jauhar wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis was based on a very unconventional review,\u201d Jauhar added, \u201cwhich included data from online surveys, which are notoriously difficult to interpret (ask anyone involved in election polling).\u201d To determine the risk of withdrawal more accurately, the authors reviewed data from 44 randomized controlled trials and 35 observational studies published between 1961 and 2019. These studies investigated abrupt cessation or tapering of an established antidepressant or placebo. More than half of these studies focused on mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, and more than a fourth concentrated on anxiety disorders. \u00a0 The authors also discovered the medications most often linked with withdrawal symptoms were desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, imipramine and escitalopram. Those with the lowest rate of discontinuation symptoms were fluoxetine and sertraline. Pharmaceutical companies funded 45 of the studies, but this backing didn\u2019t appear to influence the overall results, according to the review. The rate of withdrawal symptoms in pharma-funded studies was about the same as trials not funded by pharmaceutical companies. \u201cThis work is a salutary lesson, as some people may have been dissuaded from taking a potentially effective treatment, based on poor quality evidence,\u201d Jauhar said. \u201cScience does correct itself, and the authors are to be congratulated on this work.\u201d The findings are also an important first step to helping patients responsibly discontinue taking antidepressants, said Dr. Christiaan Vinkers, a psychiatrist and full professor in the department of psychiatry at Amsterdam University Medical Center, in a news release. What these findings mean for patients Another weakness of the review was that many of the included studies weren\u2019t primarily focused on antidepressant discontinuation, but rather the efficacy of antidepressants versus placebos, Dr. Tony Kendrick, professor of primary care at the University of Southampton in England, said in a news release. These studies \u201calso happened to observe patients in the wash-out period coming off the drugs at the end of the trials. Consequently, the period of taking the antidepressant was 12 weeks or less in 36 out of the 79 included studies,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cSevere discontinuation symptoms would not usually be expected to arise after only a few weeks of antidepressant use.\u201d Some of the other included studies had much longer treatment periods \u2014 some up to a year or longer. Regarding why antidepressant discontinuation sometimes leads to withdrawal symptoms, it\u2019s important to note these medications aren\u2019t addictive, Henssler said. The effects could be due to the suddenly lower amount of neurotransmitters in your brain, according to the Cleveland Clinic. In the review, there was no difference between studies on tapered or abrupt discontinuation. But the authors cautioned that finding isn\u2019t a firm conclusion due to variation in study designs. And other research still indicates tapering can be helpful for reducing the chances and severity of symptoms, they said. Though the rates of withdrawal aren\u2019t nearly as high as previously reported, when it comes to patients wanting to quit their antidepressants, doctors should still have conversations about what doing so would mean for the patient and how to do it safely, Jauhar said. \u201cThe doctor should help them to do so slowly and in a controlled manner that limits the impact of any potential withdrawal symptoms \u2026 at a pace that suits them and their individual needs,\u201d said Dr. Oliver Howes, chair of the psychopharmacology committee at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom, said in a news release. Howes wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Carefully strategizing is important also because of the risk of relapsing into the condition being treated, depending on a person\u2019s mental health history, Dr. Paul Keedwell, a consultant psychiatrist and member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said in a news release. The study didn\u2019t provide information on the duration of withdrawal symptoms, but other research suggests they can last for up to two weeks in most cases, Keedwell said. Discontinuation is more difficult for people who have been on their medications for a year or more, he added \u2014 in that case withdrawal symptoms can last for months but rarely up to a year. However, \u201cit is important to say that withdrawal symptoms are not dangerous, and the risk of experiencing them at some future date should not be a reason for refusing antidepressant treatment,\u201d Keedwell said. \u201cThe pros and cons of treatment should always be discussed with your doctor.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/antidepressant-discontinuation-withdrawal-symptoms-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_health_violent-dreams-parkinsons-dementia-wellness", "text": "Donald Dorff could hear the crowd roaring as he snatched the quarterback\u2019s pitch from the air and sprinted toward the goal line. \u201cThere was a 280-pound tackle waiting for me, so I decided to give him my shoulder,\u201d the 67-year-old told National Geographic magazine in 1987. \u201cWhen I came to, I was on the floor in my bedroom,\u201d Dorff said. \u201cI had smashed into the dresser and knocked everything off it and broke the mirror and just made one heck of a mess. It was 1:30 a.m.\u201d How did a dream from a retired grocery manufacturer from Golden Valley, Minnesota, become worthy of a profile in a well-known national magazine? Five years earlier, Dorff had become the first patient diagnosed with an unusual disease called rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, or RBD. There\u2019s more. Dorff\u2019s case also launched researchers on a journey that uncovered one of the earliest signs of two devastating diseases: Parkinson\u2019s and a unique form of dementia called Lewy body. Symptoms include screaming, kicking and throwing punches The discovery of RBD was made in 1982 when Dorff, after years of experiencing \u201cviolent moving nightmares,\u201d became a patient of psychiatrist and sleep specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck,\u00a0then working at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis. \u201cDuring rapid eye movement or REM sleep, the brain basically paralyzes the body so that we cannot act out our dreams,\u201d Schenck, now a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota, told CNN recently. \u201cBut Dorff was able to get up and hurt himself while dreaming, a very odd behavior. We were scratching our heads about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we put him in a sleep lab, and lo and behold, all his physical behaviors came out of REM sleep, which had never been reported before.\u201d More patients with the unusual disorder were identified, many exhibiting a disturbing set of violent symptoms, Schenck said. \u201cThey start kicking in bed, throwing punches at their bed partners, talking or screaming loudly, things like \u2018Get the hell out of here!\u2019 Then the wife has to scream really loudly to stop the episode,\u201d he said. \u201cLimb jerking, twitching, throwing out your arm, throwing punches, kicking, sitting up, standing, jumping out of bed and running. Those behaviors are very typical with RBD,\u201d he added. One 70-year-old patient, described by his wife as having a gentle nature during the day, would punch and kick her as many as five times a night, Schenck said. On one occasion, he tried to strangle his wife while dreaming of fighting off a mauling bear. Another patient, also 70, dreamed he had just taken down a deer and was going to break its neck. In reality it was his wife\u2019s neck, which he discovered when he woke up. (She quit sleeping in the same bed.) By 1986, Schenck and his team had published their first paper on the newly discovered sleep disorder. As he followed patients over the years, however, Schenck discovered something more disturbing \u2014 the behavior could be a \u201ccanary in the mine\u201d for later neurodegeneration. \u201cLosing the paralysis of REM sleep that is the basis of RBD is the earliest and strongest predictor of a later diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy body,\u201d Schenck said. RBD can affect women, too Lewy body dementia can refer to two different types of dementia:\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which both affect cognition. Parkinson\u2019s disease, however, is a slowly progressive disorder that inhibits muscle control, balance and movement \u2014 although about 4 in 5 people with Parkinson\u2019s ultimately develop dementia, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. In both Parkinson\u2019s and the two dementias, cells in and around the stalk-like stem at the bottom of the brain begin to die. In addition to breathing, swallowing, heart rate and eye and facial movements, the brain stem also controls the sleep-wake cycle. Early damage to the brain stem caused by Parkinson\u2019s can interfere with the body\u2019s innate ability to freeze the muscles while dreaming, thus allowing the body to sit up, scream, flail or otherwise act out a dream. Hallucinations, which are common in Parkinson\u2019s, can also occur, according to case studies. A 67-year-old man would see faceless, hooded or cloaked figures or animals while awake during the night. The images vanished when the man turned on a light or got up to investigate. Such nighttime behaviors can often be controlled with medication, including high doses of melatonin or the drug clonazepam, which stops seizures and relaxes tense muscles, Schenck said. \u201cEither one alone or both in combination works 80% to 90% of the time, and there are a long list of alternative treatments,\u201d said Schenck, who first published the connection between RBD and Parkinson\u2019s in February 1996. \u201cWe know the mechanism for RBD very well, and we know how to treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next step is to slow down or halt the progression to Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.\u201d At first, researchers believed RBD only affected men but then realized that women are equally impacted. \u201cJust as many women have this problem, but because it\u2019s much milder and doesn\u2019t cause injury as often, they frequently don\u2019t come in to seek help,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cYet they have lost that muscle paralysis in REM sleep, and they\u2019re just as much at risk for future Parkinson\u2019s disease as the men.\u201d A clinical trial is underway at nine medical centers in the United States, Schenck said. Called the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy Consortium, the research hopes to identify potential treatments for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and slow its progression into Parkinson\u2019s and dementia. Seek medical treatment if violent dreams begin As a child, Donald Dorff shared a room with three brothers and never had any signs of a sleep disorder. On his wedding night, however, he scared his new bride with loud talking, groaning, teeth grinding and minor movements, according to Schenck\u2019s case study. About 41 years later, however, he began to have vivid, violent dreams that he would act out. In one dream, he was riding a motorcycle when another motorcyclist tried to ram him. \u201cI decided I\u2019m going to kick his motorcycle away and at that point my wife woke me up and said, \u2018What in heavens are you doing to me?\u2019 because I was kicking the hell out of her,\u201d Dorff told Schenck during treatment. In another dream Dorff was under attack by a man with a rifle and preparing to shoot back when he suddenly woke up. \u201cI was kneeling alongside the bed with my arms extended like 1 was holding the rifle up and ready to shoot.\u201d One night Dorff dived into a bedside dresser and cut himself, Schenck said. It was then that he found Schenck\u2019s clinic and went there for treatment. While some people with RBD develop full-blown Parkinson\u2019s rather quickly, Dorff was not one of them. He died of prostate cancer, Schenck said, and was able to control his violent nighttime behavior until his death as long as he remained on medication. Dorff\u2019s case helped physicians discover an early key to two devastating disorders, allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never been a sleepwalker or sleep talker throughout your life and suddenly, after the age of 50, you start and the talking becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should be evaluated by your primary care doctor,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cYour doctor should consider neurological evaluation because that could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/health/violent-dreams-parkinsons-dementia-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_07_05_health_stem-cells-fast-facts", "text": "Here is some background information about stem cells. Scientists believe that stem cell research can be used to treat medical conditions including Parkinson\u2019s disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  About Stem Cells Sources: National Institutes of Health, Mayo Clinic Stem cell research focuses on embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.  Stem cells have two characteristics that differentiate them from other types of cells: - They are unspecialized cells that can replicate themselves through cell division over long periods of time. - Stem cells can be manipulated, under certain conditions, to become mature cells with special functions, such as the beating cells of the heart muscle or insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. There are many different types of stem cells, including: pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells.- Pluripotent stem cells (ex: embryonic stem cells) can give rise to any type of cell in the body. These cells are like blank slates, and they have the potential to turn into any type of cell.- Adult stem cells can give rise to multiple types of cells, but are more limited compared with embryonic stem cells. They are more likely to generate within a particular tissue, organ or physiological system. (Ex: blood-forming stem cells/bone marrow cells, sometimes referred to as multipotent stem cells) Embryonic stem cells are harvested from four to six-day-old embryos. These embryos are either leftover embryos in fertility clinics or embryos created specifically for harvesting stem cells by therapeutic cloning. Only South Korean scientists claim to have successfully created human embryos via therapeutic cloning and have harvested stem cells from them. Adult stem cells are already designated for a certain organ or tissue. Some adult stem cells can be coaxed into or be reprogrammed into turning into a different type of specialized cell within the tissue type - for example, a heart stem cell can give rise to a functional heart muscle cell, but it is still unclear whether they can give rise to all different cell types of the body. The primary role of adult stem cells is to maintain and repair the tissue in which they are found. Uses of Stem Cell Research Regenerative medicine uses cell-based therapies to treat disease. Scientists who research stem cells are trying to identify how undifferentiated stem cells become differentiated as serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are due to abnormal cell division and differentiation. Scientists believe stem cells can be used to generate cells and tissues that could be used for cell-based therapies as the need for donated organs and tissues outweighs the supply. Stem cells, directed to differentiate into specific cell types, offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s diseases. Policy Debate Cloning human embryos for stem cells is very controversial. The goal of therapeutic cloning research is not to make babies, but to make embryonic stem cells, which can be harvested and used for cell-based therapies. Using fertilized eggs left over at fertility clinics is also controversial because removing the stem cells destroys them. Questions of ethics arise because embryos are destroyed as the cells are extracted, such as: When does human life begin? What is the moral status of the human embryo? Timeline 1998 - President Bill Clinton requests a National Bioethics Advisory Commission to study the question of stem cell research. 1999 - The National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommends that the government allow federal funds to be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells. 2000 - During his campaign, George W. Bush says he opposes any research that involves the destruction of embryos. 2000 - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) issues guidelines for the use of embryonic stem cells in research, specifying that scientists receiving federal funds can use only extra embryos that would otherwise be discarded. President Clinton approves federal funding for stem cell research but Congress does not fund it. August 9, 2001 - President Bush announces he will allow federal funding for about 60 existing stem cell lines created before this date. January 18, 2002 - A panel of experts at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommends a complete ban on human reproductive cloning, but supports so-called therapeutic cloning for medical purposes. February 27, 2002 - For the second time in two years, the House passes a ban on all cloning of human embryos. July 11, 2002 - The President\u2019s Council on Bioethics recommends a four-year ban on cloning for medical research to allow time for debate. February 2005 - South Korean scientist Hwang Woo Suk publishes a study in Science announcing he has successfully created stem cell lines using therapeutic cloning. December 2005 - Experts from Seoul National University accuse Hwang of faking some of his research. Hwang asks to have his paper withdrawn while his work is being investigated and resigns his post. January 10, 2006 - An investigative panel from Seoul National University accuses Hwang of faking his research. July 18, 2006 - The Senate votes 63-37 to loosen President Bush\u2019s limits on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research. July 19, 2006 - President Bush vetoes the embryonic stem-cell research bill passed by the Senate (the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005), his first veto since taking office.  June 20, 2007 - President Bush vetoes the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. January 23, 2009 - The FDA approves a request from Geron Corp. to test embryonic stem cells on eight to 10 patients with severe spinal cord injuries. This will be the world\u2019s first test in humans of a therapy derived from human embryonic stem cells. The tests will use stem cells cultured from embryos left over in fertility clinics.  March 9, 2009 - President Barack Obama signs an executive order overturning an order signed by President Bush in August 2001 that barred the NIH from funding research on embryonic stem cells beyond using 60 cell lines that existed at that time.

September 9, 2010 - A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit grants a request from the Justice Department to lift a temporary injunction that blocked federal funding of stem cell research. September 28, 2010 - The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit lifts an injunction imposed by a federal judge, thereby allowing federally funded embryonic stem-cell research to continue while the Obama Administration appeals the judge\u2019s original ruling against use of public funds in such research. October 8, 2010 - The first human is injected with cells from human embryonic stem cells in a clinical trial sponsored by Geron Corp. November 22, 2010 - William Caldwell, CEO of Advanced Cell Technology, tells CNN that the FDA has granted approval for his company to start a clinical trial using cells grown from human embryonic stem cells. The treatment will be for an inherited degenerative eye disease. April 29, 2011 - The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia lifts an injunction, imposed last year, banning the Obama administration from funding embryonic stem-cell research.

The US Food and Drug Administration and Justice Department announced Monday that they are creating a task force to target the issue. The task force will include people from the US Marshals Service, US Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies to identify and target illegal sales and distribution of e-cigarettes. \u201cUnauthorized e-cigarettes and vaping products continue to jeopardize the health of Americans \u2013 particularly children and adolescents \u2013 across the country,\u201d Benjamin Mizer, the acting associate attorney general with the Justice Department, said in a news release Monday. \u201cThis interagency Task Force is dedicated to protecting Americans by combatting the unlawful sale and distribution of these products,\u201d Mizer said. \u201cAnd the establishment of this Task Force makes clear that vigorous enforcement of the tobacco laws is a government-wide priority.\u201d While the FDA has authorized the sale of 23 specific tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices to date, several unauthorized e-cigarettes have emerged illegally on the market, some of which appeal to minors. More than 1 in 10 young adults in the United States regularly use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey found that about 2.1 million youth reported currently using e-cigarettes. Under current regulations, new tobacco products must receive marketing authorization from the FDA before they can be sold; pre-existing e-cigarette products have been allowed to remain on the market, but the agency has asked\u00a0manufacturers to submit applications to keep them there. The new federal task force will hone in on several issues, \u201cincluding investigating and prosecuting new criminal, civil, seizure and forfeiture actions,\u201d according to the news release, and violations \u201ccan result in felony convictions and significant criminal fines and civil monetary penalties,\u201d as well as the seizures of unauthorized products. \u201cEnforcement against illegal e-cigarettes is a multi-pronged issue that necessitates a multi-pronged response,\u201d Dr. Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in the news release. \u201cThis \u2018All Government\u2019 approach \u2013 including the creation of this new Task Force - will bring the collective resources and experience of the federal government to bear on this pressing public health issue.\u201d The creation of this new task force comes after the FDA has issued more than 1,100 warning letters to several distributors, manufacturers, importers and retailers for illegally selling or distributing unauthorized tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. In December, the FDA announced seizing about 1.4 million units of unauthorized e-cigarette products. \u201cThe U.S. Marshals Service Asset Forfeiture Division stands ready to work with our Task Force partners in the seizure of unauthorized e-cigarettes from domestic distributors seeking to sell them unlawfully,\u201d Ronald Davis, director of the US Marshals Service, said in Monday\u2019s news release. Meanwhile, the American Lung Association has announced that it applauds the launch of the new federal task force. \u201cFor too long, manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers have acted without regard for the law or public health. The Lung Association has urged enhanced law enforcement actions be taken to hold manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors accountable for selling illegal tobacco products and to protect the public health, especially children\u2019s health,\u201d Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement Monday. He added that youth vaping is a \u201cserious\u201d public health concern. \u201cMany of the illegal e-cigarettes currently on the market are flavored products, which attract youth,\u201d Wimmer said in part. \u201cThe American Lung Association commends the DOJ, FDA and other agencies involved in this task force.

{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_health_sedentary-tv-aging-wellness", "text": "Swapping out time in front of the TV for physical activity might not sound like the most fun trade, but it is associated with significantly better chances of healthy aging, according to a new study. \u201cOur take-home message is that replacing TV time with light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sleep (for participants with inadequate sleep) is beneficial to healthy aging,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Molin Wang, associate professor of medicine in the department of epidemiology at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The results are not surprising, as many studies show that sedentary behaviors have significant impacts on health, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Freeman was not involved in this study. For this study, researchers analyzed data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study of more than 45,000 people age 50 or older in 1992 who were also free of chronic disease, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Researchers followed up for 20 years for information on people\u2019s time sitting at work, home and watching television and their hours standing or walking at home and work. That data was analyzed with data on their aging. Healthy aging was defined as living to at least 70 years old and maintaining at least four healthy domains \u2014 such as no major chronic disease and no impairment in subjective memory, physical health and mental health, the study said. Each additional two hours of sitting to watch TV was associated with a 12% decrease in the chances of aging in a healthy way, the study showed. On the other hand, adding two hours of light physical activity at work added a 6% increase in the odds of healthy aging. Replacing one hour of sitting to watch TV with light physical activity at home or work was associated with better chances of healthy aging, the study showed. \u201cVegging out in front of the television, seems to always be associated with worse outcomes,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cOf course, it makes physiologic sense that human beings were never meant to sit in front of a screen all day long.\u201d \u201cThe more we sit, the more problems we get, particularly as we get older,\u201d he added. Why is sitting so bad? A 2017 study showed a relationship between time spent sitting and early death from any cause. And sedentary time as a kid may increase the risk of heart disease later in life, according to 2023 research. The problem is particularly bad when eating a very large amount of salt, which is typical in an American diet, without getting enough movement to circulate fluid, he added. These often unhealthy habits go together. \u201cWhen people sit in front of TV, it usually brings all these other comorbid activities, like eating junk food, TV dinners, failing to connect with others, and it even can interrupt sleep,\u201d Freeman said. Time spent seated at a desk or on the living room couch also takes away opportunities to get out and be active. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on all that physical activity, which is truly an unbelievable way to reduce cardiovascular risk and blood pressure,\u201d Freeman said. How to kick out the sedentary behavior If you work eight, 10 or even 12 hours a day in an office, it might feel difficult to get more movement into your day. \u201cMy very strong suggestion is you should consider at work getting a standing desk if you can, or even a treadmill desk if you\u2019re able and you have the space,\u201d Freeman said. If that is not a possibility, things like getting up often or having walking meetings can help, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting down for more than 30 minutes at a time, in my book, that\u2019s probably too long, and you really want to try to move a little bit,\u201d Freeman added. You don\u2019t have to outlaw sitting or watching TV, however. Maybe try pairing TV with healthy behaviors such as watching while moving or eating a nutritious snack, he said. Or better yet, set limits for yourself. \u201cThere are all these great tools and apps available \u2026 and a lot of people see those as tools for kids, but the truth is, they\u2019re just as good as for adults,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIt lets you keep track of how much screen time you have and then how much activity you have all on the same device, which is kind of neat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/sedentary-tv-aging-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}

The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other. Doing so should allow the satellites to collect data about phenomena that take place on a short time scale and require frequent measurements \u2014 such as how the amount of cloud cover affects the temperature on Earth beneath it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/world/nasa-prefire-mission-launch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}

You grab your neck pillow, eye mask and a glass of wine to make sure you are well-rested on the other side. That tactic isn\u2019t such a good idea, according to new research. Airplane cabins are pressurized to maintain the equivalent of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) of elevation, meaning the air pressure and oxygen levels are lower than what most people experience on Earth. Combine that with alcohol consumption and sleep, and it\u2019s more likely a person will experience an intensified drop in oxygen saturation in their blood, according to a study published Monday in the journal Thorax. \u201cPlease don\u2019t drink alcohol on board of airplanes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Eva-Maria Elmenhorst, deputy of the department of sleep and human factors and leader of the Working Group on Performance and Sleep at the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne, Germany, in an email. To investigate, researchers created an atmospheric environment similar to an airplane cabin in flight. Over two nights, 48 healthy adults slept for four hours in two different environments \u2014 once without alcohol and once after drinking the equivalent of two glasses of wine or cans of beer, according to the study. On the nights with alcohol, researchers saw a lowered amount of oxygen and an increased heart rate, the study showed. \u201cThe combination of alcohol intake with sleeping under hypobaric conditions poses a considerable strain on the cardiac system and might lead to exacerbation of symptoms in patients with cardiac or pulmonary diseases,\u201d the researchers said. The study is small, but it provides a starting point from which researchers should keep investigating the relationship between sleep, flight and alcohol, said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. Many people may be drinking onboard to help them get to sleep in an often uncomfortable cabin \u2014 but doing so negatively impacts both long-term health and the immediate goal of getting some rest, experts said. Alcohol gets you sleep \u2014 but not good sleep The study authors didn\u2019t just collect data on heart strain. They also took a closer look at the participants\u2019 quality of sleep. It wasn\u2019t great. Time in REM sleep \u2014 the rapid-eye movement stage that may be important to memory consolidation and brain recuperation \u2014 was shorter for people in the airplane conditions who had alcohol, the study showed. The finding isn\u2019t a surprise, Freeman said. Alcohol may help you get to sleep, but the quality isn\u2019t as good as sleep while sober, he said. \u201cMany people have witnessed when people drink heavily, their snoring and the sleep apnea is much more severe,\u201d Freeman said. The quantity of sleep under the influence also tends to be different, said Dr. Shalini Paruthi, adjunct professor at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. People tend to get more fragmented sleep after drinking, meaning they wake up more in the night and tend not to sleep as long, said Paruthi, an American Academy of Sleep Medicine spokesperson. She was not involved in the research. \u2018Sometimes people will just think about the immediate effect of \u2018ooh it will make me fall asleep faster\u2019 but they forget about all the other effects of the alcohol,\u201d she said. Be especially careful not to mix sleep aids with alcohol, because both are depressants and intensify their sedative effects when taken together, Freeman said. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen \u2026 people taking sleeping pills combined with alcohol, which is a major issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, there\u2019s oftentimes a medical emergency.\u201d How to rest before your destination If possible, try to keep to your natural body cycles when flying, Freeman said \u2014 although that might not always be possible. That can look like choosing a flight that lines up with your sleep patterns so you can either land and just finish sleeping or land and start your day, he said. Avoid creating those sleep and wake cycles with too many stimulants such as coffee or energy drinks and depressants like alcohol, he added. Next, stay hydrated, because flying typically involves a dry environment and people don\u2019t always hydrate properly, Freeman said. The best thing to drink is water, he said. Foods served at airports and airplanes can lean salty, greasy and heavily processed, so Freeman recommends either packing your own or finding airport options that are lighter and largely plant-based. Exercise can also help you sleep better, so he advises avoiding the elevators and moving sidewalks to get some steps in instead. If you are on a long flight, try to get up and get some movement as well, Freeman said. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019ll point out is there\u2019s lots of evidence that suggests that the blue lights that are emitted from screens and all that interfere with our sleep patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are trying to sleep on a plane, consider getting a noise-canceling headphone and maybe not use your screens, especially while you\u2019re waiting for the flight to take off.\u201d It may be harder to keep up your healthy habits on days when you fly, but making efforts to do so can help you arrive feeling good and ready for an adventure, Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/health/alcohol-planes-heart-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_earwax-eye-discharge-wellness-partner", "text": "Dry scalp? Blocked ears? Crusted eyes? Our bodies produce many different unusual, sometimes repellent secretions, and their function doesn\u2019t always seem entirely clear. But each has their own important role, which often goes unappreciated. Flaky or dry scalp is an extremely common condition, but in severe cases it certainly doesn\u2019t feel trivial. Put aside notions that it\u2019s a factor of poor hygiene \u2014 the underlying cause is not completely clear, but it may be exacerbated by hair care regimes that dry or irritate the scalp. What is known is that flakes of dandruff are made up of cell complexes, arising from sloughed off skin. The outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is composed in part of dead cells that act as an\u00a0essential protective barrier. Dead cells shed more easily and will be replaced with new ones as skin constantly regenerates and grows. If this happens at too great a rate, the result is dandruff. The first measure is to try an over-the-counter, anti-dandruff shampoo. These contain antifungal and anti-inflammatory compounds both understood to have dandruff-healing properties since fungi and inflammation are believed to be potential factors in the development of a crusty scalp. These compounds \u2014 selenium and coal tar for instance \u2014 can also help relieve the symptoms of itch that may often prove worse than the flaking. It\u2019s worthwhile trying a different formula if the first doesn\u2019t work. Certain conditions such as\u00a0psoriasis\u00a0and eczema can also be the underlying cause and may require alternative treatment. Scabs may be unsightly \u2014 but they function beautifully Scabs are the body\u2019s natural response to being wounded. Cuts, punctures or breaks in the skin open up blood vessels to the atmosphere around us. In response, the bloodstream recruits its clotting agents \u2014 the platelets \u2014 to help plug the gap. Platelets bring blood cells together to form a clot, creating a bung to stop bleeding and prevent bacteria shifting from the skin into the circulation, where they can do more damage. When the clot dries out, a scab is formed. Scabs can look horrible, but don\u2019t worry \u2013\u2014 they\u2019re meant to. Sometimes pus forms, which can give scabs a yellow rather than reddish-brown color and might suggest that an infection is brewing.\u00a0Redness of the uninjured skin\u00a0around and tracking away from the scab is another telltale sign of possible infection, too. Resist the temptation to pick off a scab from the skin, no matter how tempting it may seem. Scabs may be unsightly, or itchy, but they\u2019re performing the job they\u2019re supposed to \u2014 keeping out bugs and allowing wounds to heal. Take good care of them instead, by keeping them untouched and clean, and wait for them to shed themselves. READ MORE: Is hot yoga good for you? Exploring the science behind the sweat The eyes have it Sleep sand. Eye bogies. Doze dust. The debris we find in the corners of our eyes each morning goes by many different names. Few of us know exactly what it is, why it\u2019s there, or its scientific name, rheum. Tears lubricate the exposed surface of the eyes, stopping them from getting dry and sore. They also hose away grit and dust and have\u00a0natural antibacterial properties\u00a0to fight infections. But our eyes make more than just tears. The lids have many little glands that discharge\u00a0natural oily substances\u00a0allowing tears to spread evenly across the eye and prevent them evaporating away. In addition,\u00a0mucus-secreting glands, much like those in the nose that make snot, make a thin mucus that also helps to trap and eliminate rogue particles. In large amounts, oil and mucus can irritate the eyes but normally get swept away by tears and blinking during the day. By night, our eyes remain shut, and rheum builds up. Whether they take on the appearance of sticky bogies or crusts depends on how dry they get overnight, and may be proportional to how long you sleep. READ MORE: Why do my armpits smell? (Ear) waxing lyrical Earwax is a largely invisible entity \u2014 more often felt than seen. Notice a feeling of blocked or congested ears, or a smothered sense of hearing, and the wax in your ears might be becoming problematic. It also has a clinical name \u2014 cerumen. In part,\u00a0it\u2019s made of oils and sweat\u00a0from glands lining the ear canal. The majority of earwax though is keratin, the natural protein that toughens skin, hair and nails. This is because the\u00a0ear canal is lined with skin, all the way up to the eardrum. In mixing with the secretions, shed skin produces a waxy substance ranging in colors across the brown spectrum. Fresh, healthy earwax tends to be yellow to honey-brown in color, whereas older, thicker earwax becomes darker brown, sometimes even black. Notice red or green staining? Then blood or bacteria may be mixing with the wax. Among other diagnoses, this raises the possibility of an ear infection, especially if there\u2019s also a runny or foul-smelling discharge. Like many of the other bodily secretions, cerumen also traps debris and other nasties (even insects) that could irritate or damage the delicate eardrum. But problems arise if the wax builds up or hardens too much, blocking conduction of sound to the drum, and dampening your hearing. Nothing smaller than an index finger (with well-trimmed nails) should ever go in your ear canal. Stop cleaning with cotton buds, too. All this does is compress cerumen into little impacted cakes. Instead, medicinal olive oil from the pharmacy can help soften it down,\u00a0making it easier for the ear to clear it naturally. Blood, sweat and tears \u2014 and wax, skin and mucus \u2014 can cause many commonplace issues. But look beyond these minor ailments and be grateful that they\u2019re there.

If we don\u2019t take care of our health today, we won\u2019t enjoy a healthy sex life tomorrow. It\u2019s crucial to think about your sexual health to avoid regrets in the future. Future-proofing yourself is key. Sexual health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Chronic stress, poor diet, lack of exercise and other lifestyle factors can significantly affect your sexual health. If you\u2019re experiencing persistent problems, don\u2019t hesitate to speak with a doctor. Early intervention can prevent minor issues from becoming significant obstacles. Seeking help is a sign of strength, and a health care professional can provide the guidance and treatment options you need for a lifetime of good sexual function. The effects of high stress Whether as a result of personal problems or trouble at work, chronic stress is a major contributor to reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. With stress, the body produces elevated levels of cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production. Studies\u00a0have shown that men with emotional problems or stress are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction in the form of either premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction and/or low sexual desire. It\u2019s crucial to incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine: regular exercise, meditation, proper sleep and hobbies that you enjoy. Seeking professional help from a therapist can also provide effective coping strategies. What you eat Poor eating habits can lead to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular issues, all of which can adversely affect sexual function. Research indicates that men with a waist circumference over 40 inches are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome, which is linked to erectile dysfunction. Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains can make a substantial difference. Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding ultraprocessed foods can further enhance your sexual health. (To put it simply, the more fast food you eat, the faster you will lose your sex life.) How you move Lack of physical activity is detrimental to heart health, which is crucial for maintaining sexual function. Regular exercise helps improve blood flow, which is essential for achieving and maintaining an erection. Studies suggest that men who exercise regularly report improved erectile function compared with inactive men. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, along with strength training exercises, to keep your body in top shape. The more you exercise at the gym, the more exercise you will get in the bedroom. If you smoke Smoking is a leading cause of erectile dysfunction due to its negative impact on blood vessels and blood flow. The toxins in cigarettes can damage the lining of blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the penis. Research shows that men who smoke are about twice\u00a0as likely to develop erectile dysfunction as nonsmokers. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your sexual health. Consider resources such as nicotine replacement therapy, support groups and counseling to help you quit. How you sleep Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, can severely affect testosterone levels and lead to sexual dysfunction. A study found that men with severe sleep apnea had significantly lower testosterone levels compared with those without the condition. Prioritizing good sleep hygiene is essential. If you suspect a sleep disorder, consult a health care provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, which may include lifestyle changes or medical interventions. Mental health issues Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety can have a profound impact on sexual desire and performance. About 20% of patients with anxiety and up to 40% of men with depression report experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction. Mental health conditions can lead to a decrease in libido and difficulties in achieving or maintaining an erection. Seeking help from mental health professionals can be highly beneficial. Therapy and medication can significantly improve both mental health and sexual function. Hormonal imbalances Hormonal imbalances, particularly low testosterone, can negatively affect sexual health. Testosterone levels naturally decline with age, but conditions such as hypogonadism can accelerate this process. Studies suggest that about 20% of men over the age of 60 have low testosterone levels. Regular checkups with a health care provider can help monitor hormone levels. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications or hormone replacement therapy to restore balance. Side effects of certain medications Certain medications, including those for hypertension and depression, can cause sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Beta-blockers, for example, can decrease libido and lead to erectile issues. It\u2019s important to discuss potential side effects with your doctor. They may adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication that has fewer effects on sexual health. Chronic illness Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease can significantly affect sexual function. Diabetic men, for instance, are three times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction compared with nondiabetic men. Managing chronic illnesses effectively with the help of a health care provider is crucial. Doing so includes following prescribed treatments, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and monitoring yourself regularly to keep conditions under control. Relationship issues Problems within a relationship can cause stress and decreased sexual desire. Communication breakdowns, unresolved conflicts and lack of intimacy can all contribute to sexual dysfunction. Open communication with your partner is key to addressing these issues. Consider couples counseling to help resolve underlying problems and improve your relationship and sexual health. Conclusion Guys, taking care of your sexual health isn\u2019t just about avoiding problems today; it\u2019s about ensuring you\u2019re ready for action tomorrow and beyond. Think about it \u2014 how many times have you stressed over performance but ignored the basics that keep you in the game? It\u2019s time to make a change. Managing stress, eating right, staying active and kicking bad habits such as smoking are the foundation of a healthy sex life. These aren\u2019t just empty words \u2014 they\u2019re steps you can take now to ensure you\u2019re not sidelined later. And if you\u2019re dealing with persistent issues, don\u2019t tough it out alone. Talking to a doctor isn\u2019t admitting defeat; it\u2019s making a smart play. There\u2019s no better time to focus on your well-being than during National Men\u2019s Health Month in June. It\u2019s dedicated to encouraging men to take control of their health and make the necessary changes to improve their lives. Use this opportunity to schedule that checkup you\u2019ve been putting off, start a new exercise routine or seek help for any health issues you\u2019ve been ignoring. You\u2019ve got one body and one life \u2014 make sure both are in peak condition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/health/men-sexual-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_health_heat-stroke-sun-exhaustion-health-xpn-wellness", "text": "It\u2019s only June, and Americans across parts of the US South and West have already experienced record heat waves. Extreme heat weather events are expected to affect more than 60 million people across the US this summer. This comes as last summer was officially deemed the hottest recorded. The rate of emergency department visits related to extreme heat increased significantly in 2023 compared to the previous five years, with nearly 120,000 visits due to heat-related issues, according to a recent study published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Reports. With summer temperatures on the rise, what should people know about the dangerous condition of heat stroke? What are the symptoms, and how can others recognize if someone needs help? What are other types of illnesses associated with extreme heat? Especially those most susceptible to the ill effects of high temperatures? To find out how to handle the heat, I spoke with CNN wellness analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What should people know about heat stroke? What is it, and what are its symptoms? Dr. Leana Wen: Heat stroke is a medical emergency. It must be treated immediately because it can quickly become fatal. The body normally has the capacity to control and regulate its temperature. Heat stroke occurs when this mechanism is overwhelmed. The body\u2019s temperature rises rapidly, and the person can\u2019t cool down. Your internal temperature can rise rapidly to 106 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in 10 to 15 minutes. If that happens, a person may become confused and dizzy, and feel faint. They could have slurred speech and lose consciousness. They may even start to have seizures and abnormal heart rates. If someone around you is having these symptoms, they need to go to the hospital right away. Bystanders should not hesitate to call 911. CNN: Is there anything else bystanders can do to help that person while help is on the way? Wen: Move the person into a shaded, cool area. Place cold, wet cloths or ice packs on the neck, armpits and groin, and soak clothing with cold water. Make sure to stay with that person until emergency service workers arrive. CNN: Are there less severe forms of heat-related illnesses? Wen: Yes. Before someone reaches the point of having heat stroke, they may have heat exhaustion. Symptoms include nausea, tiredness, dizziness, headache, heavy sweating and cool, clammy skin. It\u2019s crucial to move to a cool place right away. Loosen your clothes and take a cool bath if possible; if not, put wet cloths on your body. Watch for worsening symptoms, such as feeling faint and throwing up, and seek help if these occur or if you are no better in an hour. People engaging in physical activity also may have heat cramps, where they have painful muscle spasms in hot weather. They should stop exercising and drink water or an electrolyte solution. CNN: Are there other types of illnesses associated with extreme heat? Wen: Yes. There are actually two major effects of extreme heat. The first is what we\u2019ve spoken about, which is the high temperatures directly impacting the body and causing it to overheat. The second is caused by high temperatures exacerbating an underlying medical condition. Extreme heat puts strain on organs, including the heart, lungs and kidneys. Researchers estimate that the interaction between heat and cardiovascular disease was either a direct or contributory cause of 1 in 4 heat-related deaths. And heat extremes can worsen health risks from chronic conditions, including diabetes and some mental health diagnoses. CNN: Who are the most susceptible to ill effects of high temperatures? Wen: Extreme heat can affect everyone, but there are three groups of people who are the most susceptible to its ill effects. The first are the very young and the elderly. Both groups have less physiological reserve and may have more problems regulating their body temperatures. Young children also may not be able to report how they are feeling. Both groups are also at higher risk of dehydration. The second group includes those people with chronic medical conditions. Certain medications may interfere with the body\u2019s ability to adapt to changes in temperature. Extreme heat puts pressure on organ systems, thereby exacerbating underlying conditions. The third category encompasses those people who have occupational exposure or socioeconomic constraints that increase their exposure to heat. This category includes people who must work outdoors and those experiencing homelessness or otherwise do not have access to cool spaces in their residence. CNN: What steps should people in these vulnerable groups take if high temperatures are forecasted? Wen: Everyone should take additional precautions when heat advisories are issued. Even before temperatures reach the point of triggering these advisories, those who are elderly, very young and who have underlying medical conditions should try to limit their time outdoors during the hottest times of day. Try to exercise early in the mornings or in evenings. If you have to be out during the day, find shade when possible. Make sure to stay hydrated. Those around vulnerable individuals can help them to stay safe by monitoring the amount of time they are spending outdoors when it\u2019s hot outside and watching for any concerning symptoms. And never, ever leave children, older adults or pets unattended in a car; the temperature inside the car heats up extremely rapidly and can be fatal. People who have jobs where they must work outdoors should use caution. They should keep well-hydrated, use good sun protection, try to seek shade and cool off in air-conditioned spaces when they are not working if possible. Those experiencing homelessness or who otherwise do not have access to air-conditioned spaces should seek out local resources such as cooling centers and temporary shelters during heat waves. Extreme weather events are a time when we all need to watch out for people around us. Keep a close eye on children and be sure to check up on elderly neighbors and others in our communities who may need assistance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/heat-stroke-sun-exhaustion-health-xpn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_health_anxiety-positive-energy-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014  Tossing and turning in the wee hours. A low but constant buzzing in the brain that thwarts concentration. A feeling of tense restlessness. Most have experienced this sort of anxiety \u2014 not clinical anxiety, which might result in a full-on panic attack, but the run-of-the-mill kind that leaves you feeling uncomfortable. \u201cAnxiety is this simple definition: that feeling of fear or worry that comes in situations of uncertainty,\u201d neuroscientist Dr. Wendy Suzuki\u00a0recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life. \u201cThat\u2019s my simplistic definition of everyday anxiety.\u201d That experience is not pleasant. \u201cThe general feeling is, \u2018I just want to get rid of it,\u2019\u201d said Suzuki, a professor of neural science and psychology at New York University as well as dean of the school\u2019s College of Arts and Science. She is also the author of \u201cGood Anxiety: Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion.\u201d \u201cThe misunderstanding is that it is valuable,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning system that we all need. It is a tool that helps us figure out what we hold dear. If we don\u2019t have that, I think something important will be taken away from our lives.\u201d You can listen more on how anxiety can be good here. Suzuki explained how anxiety evolved to protect us. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that in this day and age,\u201d she said. But 2.5 million years ago, \u201can ancestor with a little baby (was) walking around trying to find food, and there\u2019s a crack of a twig and that could either be \u2026 a big animal coming to eat her or it could be the crack of a twig.\u00a0She better be ready, or we\u2019re not going to have any ancestors after her.\u201d The crack of the twig left her anxious but alert to danger. \u201cAnd then her body is (in) the fight-or-flight response,\u201d she said. \u201cThat same response, including all of the fight-or-flight (reaction), gets activated when we look at the news, when we look at social media, at what\u2019s going on today,\u201d she said. \u201cOur heart rates are going up, our respiration rates are going off \u2014 that is not good physiologically for us. And so \u2026\u00a0that is your No. 1 reason to learn how to modulate that stress response.\u201d The first step toward getting to \u201cgood\u201d anxiety, Suzuki said, is learning how to lower your level of everyday anxiety. So, what can you do to ratchet it down? Here are Suzuki\u2019s top five tips: Take a deep breath Practice breath meditation. \u201cBreath meditation is the oldest form of meditation and can be so effective in really calming ourselves down \u2014 and immediately,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cThat\u2019s my No. 1 go-to for people who say, \u2018I just need something right now.\u2019\u201d One calming pattern is box breathing. To do it, inhale deeply for four counts, hold for four counts, exhale for four counts and hold again for four counts. \u201cRepeat to calm your mind and body,\u201d she said. Get moving Go for a short walk, Suzuki recommended. \u201cDid you know that just 10 minutes of walking can significantly reduce anxiety and depression levels in people? You don\u2019t even have to change your clothes to get that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat that\u2019s doing is stimulating the release of neurotransmitters that don\u2019t necessarily decrease your anxiety, but they increase your feelings of reward and happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cThose neurotransmitters that go up include dopamine and serotonin and noradrenaline and endorphins.\u00a0Every single time you move your body, it\u2019s like giving your brain a wonderful bubble bath of neurochemicals, and it works immediately.\u201d Reframe your anxiety Turn anxiety-inducing situations into personal challenges to foster growth and resilience \u2014 and enjoy the newness of uncertain circumstances. Paraphrasing Deepak Chopra, Suzuki recommended embracing uncertainty because it can make life interesting to live. \u201cIn my life, the uncertainty can be something that brings excitement, can bring joy. Not all the time, but maybe you can take part of that and embrace it as something useful,\u201d she said. For example, she said, \u201cIf the same thing happened every single time I went on vacation, that would not be a fun vacation. I like the newness; I like learning new things and being exposed to new things. And I can\u2019t control that by definition.\u201d Spin straw into gold Turn your worry into action. To enhance productivity and reduce worry, transform your anxious what-if list into a productive to-do list, Suzuki advised. \u201cI like to say that there are gifts that come with your anxiety,\u201d she said, citing what often happens to her right before she goes to sleep. \u201cI have this worry list that hits me right before I\u2019m going to go to sleep. And so what do I do? I turn that what-if list into a to-do list,\u201d she said. \u201cI just say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to remember these things, so Wendy, you can go to sleep now.\u2019 But the next morning I go and take all those things that made me not sleep the night before, and I go do something about them. \u2026 In that way, I make myself more productive. And I use my anxiety as the tool that it\u2019s supposed to (be).\u201d Practice compassion Support others, Suzuki said, letting them know they are not alone. \u201cReach out with a kind word to someone experiencing similar anxiety,\u201d she said, noting that some people feel shame about being anxious over a certain situation. \u201cThis simple act can release dopamine and improve your own mood.\u201d We hope these five tips help you turn your anxiety into something more productive. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week on the Chasing Life podcast when we delve into therapy and learn what it can and can\u2019t do to increase your happiness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/health/anxiety-positive-energy-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_fda-committee-recommends-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-donanemab", "text": "On Monday, a panel of independent advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted to endorse Eli Lilly\u2019s drug donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease, agreeing that it was safe and effective. One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, killing more people than prostate and breast cancer combined. Donanemab works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildups in the brain  that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These plaques are harmful deposits that can form in the brain as people age. Removing the plaque seems to slow down the brain changes that seem to happen with Alzheimer\u2019s. As the drug enters the brain it binds to the amyloid plaques and its presence catches the attention of the immune system that facilitates the plaque removal. There is no cure and there is still no drug to prevent the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, but donanemab and Leqembi, another drug that is already on the market made by Eisai and Biogen, has been shown to slow the progression of the disease in its early stages. Lilly told the FDA\u2019s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee that its data from late-stage clinical research showed \u201chighly meaningful results\u201d for patients who took donanemab, with a 37% lower risk of progression of the disease over a year and a half compared to patients who got the placebo. Serious adverse events were \u201cgenerally comparable\u201d among all the groups in the trials, and were infrequent, Lilly told the committee, occurring in only 2% of patients. The patients on donanemab had a slightly higher mortality rate \u2014 2%, compared with 1.7% in the placebo arm of the trial. Three people died while taking the drug after developing ARIA, or micro-hemorrhages known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. In trials of Leqembi, the drug that\u2019s already on the market, some patients experienced ARIA, but it was at a lower rate than seen in the donanemab trial. Leqembi has also been tied to patient deaths. Since most donanemab patients who experienced problems with ARIA did so in the first six weeks of the trial, Lilly told the committee that it added another MRI to the trial to look for the problem before giving the patient a second infusion. The aim would be to detect patients with asymptomatic ARIA. If it was detected, providers would pause treatment so it could resolve and not become more serious or symptomatic. Looking at these results from the late-stage clinical trials, the FDA committee voted on\u00a0two specific questions and discussed three other main topics. The committee voted an unanimous \u201cyes\u201d to the questions of whether the data showed that the drug is effective for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and whether the benefits of the drug outweighed the risks in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s in the population enrolled in the clinical trials. The FDA will take the committee\u2019s advice into consideration as it decides whether to greenlight the drug. Committee member\u00a0Dr. Dean Follmann, assistant director for Biostatistics at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he voted yes because the evidence \u201cwas strong and consistent across subgroups.\u201d In voting yes, Sarah Dolan, the acting consumer representative on the committee and a consultant with the Critical Path Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said she was pleased with the outcome of\u00a0the research. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge unmet medical need here that hopefully can be addressed,\u201d Dolan said. Committee member Dr. Kathleen Poston, the director of Stanford Movement Disorders Center, said she voted yes believing there was a benefit to the drug, \u201cas long as the risks are being monitored.\u201d The trials only included patients that had low-medium levels of tau, a protein that can become abnormal and contribute to the disease. Lilly excluded patients that had no or very low tau because the study wouldn\u2019t follow the patients long enough to see if the drug made a difference. They also excluded people with high amounts of tau. The committee had some concern about extrapolating the results to a subset of patients with other levels of tau; they wanted to see more data. The majority of the committee also wasn\u2019t comfortable with the FDA requiring a tau PET test to determine if a patient was eligible to take the drug\u00a0since the test is not widely available and would make it difficult for some people to get the drug. The\u00a0FDA also asked the committee to consider additional factors about ongoing research and factors related to the possible administration of the drug. Lilly suggests patients may be able to stop the drug if they show enough progress on it. The committee suggested research would have to show what would be the appropriate criteria to stop or restart the drug if symptoms came back. The committee also noted that there was little diversity in the trial, most participants were White, and said future research will need to include more people of color to understand how the drug works in diverse populations. The committee also noted that if the drug is approved, doctors will have to educate their patients about the benefit versus the risk of taking this medication. Initially, when the FDA said that it was going to hold this meeting, it came as a\u00a0surprise announcement\u00a0since many experts had thought the drug would have been approved by the FDA\u00a0last year. Before the votes, Dr. Reisa Sperling, a professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School told the committee that without treatments, the growing number of people with Alzheimer\u2019s could become a serious threat to the country. \u201cWe\u2019re doing such a good job at keeping people alive longer, we are creating a public health emergency if we don\u2019t find a way to stave off this disease,\u201d Sperling said. In the meantime, Lilly said it is working on additional Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cRecognizing the enormous burden this disease carries, we take the responsibility of bringing a well characterized disease modifying therapy to patients very seriously,\u201d Dr. David Hyman, chief medical officer with Eli Lilly and Company told the committee. Lilly views donanemab as \u201can important but ultimately incremental\u201d step in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Ultimately, Hyman said Lilly would like to develop a drug that would treat the disease before someone even starts to show symptoms and are working on such a drug. \u201cPatients deserve more, and we continue to work on additional approaches to address this disease,\u201d Hyman said. After the meeting, Lilly said it was happy with the committee\u2019s positive vote. \u201cWe are pleased with the committee\u2019s unanimous recognition of donanemab\u2019s positive benefit-risk profile,\u201d said Mark Mintun, Eli Lilly\u2019s group vice president of neuroscience research and development in a news release. \u201cWe look forward to bringing this treatment option to patients.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Association had urged the committee to recommend approval of donanemab, welcomed the committee\u2019s unanimous vote in favor of the drug. \u201cA future with more approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatments is a tremendous advancement for people eligible for these drugs,\u201d said Dr. Joanne Pike, Alzheimer\u2019s Association President and CEO. \u201cProgress with treatment is happening.\u201d USAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s, a national nonprofit, that testified in favor of the drug during the public comment period in the meeting said that there is an urgency and a \u201cmassive unmet need\u201d for Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cIf approved by the FDA, donanemab would be the second drug on the market to help people in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s live a better quality of life for a longer period of time, while providing patients and their doctors with another option for their treatment plans,\u201d said chair and co-founder George Vradenburg. \u201cWe are grateful to the advisory committee for its endorsement of this promising treatment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/fda-committee-recommends-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-donanemab/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_moderna-covid-flu-combination-vaccine-positive-results", "text": "There could be a combined Covid-19 and flu shot in our future, although it won\u2019t be ready for this year\u2019s flu season. On Monday, vaccine maker Moderna announced positive late-stage trial results for its Covid-flu combination vaccine it calls mRNA-1083. Calling the outcome of the late-stage trial \u201cbreakthrough results,\u201d Moderna\u2019s Chief Medical Affairs Officer Francesca Ceddia told CNN that people in the trial who got mRNA-1083 showed an improved immune response compared with those who got the standalone flu and Covid vaccines that are available now. The results were true even for people in the trial who were 65 years and older. Generally, older people don\u2019t mount as robust a response to vaccines as younger people do. \u201cWhen we think about the combination vaccine, we often only think about the element of convenience, one shot instead of two, but what is really, really breakthrough is the fact that you not only offer that advantage, you also offer the proof of clinical benefit. I think this is the most important message,\u201d Ceddia said. Other companies have been testing a combined Covid-flu vaccine, but Moderna is the first to announce positive late-stage trial results. Public health leaders say the world could use more ways to protect people from both viruses. Millions of people get sick with the flu and now Covid every year. For the last flu season, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 35 to 64 million people got sick with the flu in the United States. Between 390,000 and 810,000 people were so sick they were hospitalized and up to 71,000 people died. Just for last fall and winter,\u00a0Covid sent more than a half-million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000, according to data presented last week to the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s independent vaccine advisers, who were discussing how to update Covid vaccines for the fall. Moderna\u2019s Phase 3 trial was a randomized, observer-blind, active control study, meaning that even the clinicians giving the shots didn\u2019t know who got which vaccines.\u00a0The trial studied the vaccine in two different age groups with about 4,000 adults in each age category. For one part of the study, Moderna compared the immune reaction of adults 65 and older who got mRNA-1083 and another group with the same age range who got a co-administered Covid-19 vaccine, Moderna\u2019s Spikevax, and an enhanced flu vaccine, Fluzone HD. Doctors recommend seniors get more powerful flu vaccines due to their inhibited immune systems. For the other part of the trial, researchers compared how slightly younger adults, ages 50 to 64, did when they got the mRNA-1083 vaccine to another group within the same age range who got Spikevax and a standard dose flu vaccine called Fluarix. Study results showed that in both age groups, the experimental combination vaccine elicited a statistically significant higher immune response against three strains of the flu and against Covid-19, compared with the co-administered shots. \u201cThe titers are significantly higher,\u201d Ceddia said. \u201cThis is better actually.\u201d A titer is a lab test that measures the number of antibodies in the blood and it can be used to prove how immune someone is to the disease. In terms of safety, the combined vaccine was well-tolerated, Moderna said, and the adverse reactions were similar to what people experienced with the co-administered vaccines. The most common complaints were pain at the injection site, tiredness, muscle pain and headaches. The study isn\u2019t peer-reviewed yet, but Moderna said it plans to present data from this late-stage trial at an upcoming medical conference and it will also submit the trial for publication. Moderna also said it will talk to the FDA about possible next steps. \u201cWe need to engage with regulators but our aspiration is to have it approved for fall 2025,\u201d Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel told CNN. Sue Peschin, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Aging Research, a nonprofit dedicated to improving aging and health that encourages more equitable access to vaccines, said a combined shot could be a significant help to public health. In addition to intensifying vaccine hesitancy in the US, people have developed a kind of vaccine fatigue  after the pandemic, Peschin said. Peschin pointed to the drop in the uptake in standard vaccines such as the MMR vaccine, as well as in seasonal vaccines. Few people got the latest Covid shot, studies show. Only about 25% of the eligible population has received the latest Covid-19 vaccine, according to a presentation to the FDA last week. Many more adults got the flu shot with nearly half of the adult population getting one last season, according to the CDC, a number that was slightly higher than the year before. \u201cWe want to see that go up and if there\u2019s a way to do that by combining the vaccines, then that\u2019s better for everyone because it helps protect everyone in the community,\u201d Peschin said. \u201cWe would love to see the combination vaccines come to market if the FDA deems them safe and effective.\u201d CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/moderna-covid-flu-combination-vaccine-positive-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_eye-exercises-debunk-conversation-partner-wellness", "text": "You may have seen advertisements claiming to eliminate the need for eyeglasses through vision therapy or vision training \u2014 basically, eye exercises. These exercises include putting pressure on or palming the eye; eye movement exercises; or straining to read by using the wrong prescription glasses to \u201ctrain\u201d the eyes. As a professor of ophthalmology \u2014 and as an eye doctor who has seen thousands of patients \u2014 I can tell you that no study to date shows strong evidence that these exercises eliminate the need for glasses or offer any long-term significant benefits. The science simply isn\u2019t there. READ MORE: Nearsightedness is at epidemic levels \u2014 and the problem begins in childhood What the science says The lack of evidence holds true for virtually all eye conditions and diseases, including common afflictions such as myopia, or nearsightedness, which refers to when closer objects are clear, but distant objects are blurry. It\u2019s also true for farsightedness \u2014 also called hyperopia \u2014 which happens when objects are clear in the distance but blurry up close. Nor do these eye exercises help with presbyopia, or the need for reading glasses, which generally begins at around age 40. With presbyopia, the patient is neither nearsighted nor farsighted and requires no glasses for distance vision. Yet as the lens of the eye becomes stiffer over time, the eye struggles to focus on fine print and smaller text. This decline will continue with age \u2014 and, with it, the need for stronger reading glasses will increase. Although some methods claim to alleviate the need for reading glasses, there is limited if any evidence to suggest benefit. That said, here are some things everyone can do to maintain healthy eyes: READ MORE: Why so many animals have a third eyelid, including our pets Vision development in children All children should have a baseline eye exam during infancy  and then again between 6 and 12 months of age. They should have a third  exam between ages 1 to 3, and then a more formal exam between ages 3 to  5 to check for eye misalignment, ocular health and the potential need  for glasses. Failing to address eye misalignment, or to provide glasses for a child who needs them, may lead to abnormal visual development or amblyopia, which is a weak, lazy eye. Progression of nearsightedness in children can be slowed by taking breaks and avoiding hour after hour on the phone or computer. Limiting up-close reading time outside of school \u2014 screen time or otherwise \u2014 may help slow the progression of nearsightedness in children. Prolonged screen time can cause eye strain and dryness. I suggest following the 20-20-20 rule: Take 20-second breaks every 20 minutes to look 20 feet away from your device. Focus on relaxing the eyes and blinking. The occasional use of artificial tears, which can be bought over the counter at drugstores, may help with dry eye. Spending more time outdoors is good for your eyes. It has been correlated with a reduced incidence of nearsightedness in childhood. One caution: Staring directly into the sun, even briefly, is dangerous and can cause permanent retinal damage. READ MORE: Bacteria live on our eyeballs Blue light blockers and supplements Ads for blue-light-blocking glasses claim they prevent headaches and  eye strain and improve sleep. But some studies, including a large,  randomized control trial, found that blue-blocking lenses did not alter symptoms of eye strain. Additionally, there is only limited evidence to show that these glasses improve circadian rhythm. Be wary of supplements or natural remedies that claim to be a  cure-all for any eye condition. These assertions are not backed by  rigorous scientific evidence, and there is no proof they improve vision,  reduce eye floaters or eliminate the need for glasses. The same is true for claims that essential oils or other topical substances may improve vision. While omega-3s have been previously touted for dry eye symptoms, there is no strong evidence that they help, although this does not discount their many other health benefits. One study did demonstrate that progression of intermediate age-related macular degeneration  slowed in some patients after using over-the-counter vitamins;  specifically, the AREDS2 formula. However, these vitamins were not  beneficial in patients with early or no signs of the disease. READ MORE: Cataract surgery: What you need to know about What does work There are some ocular conditions where vision therapy may be  recommended, including issues such as misalignment of the eyes and  trouble converging on objects up close, which can result in symptoms  such as diplopia, or \u201cdouble vision.\u201d  Ultimately, these conditions are best addressed by your eye doctor and  are unrelated to the need for reading or distance glasses. For overall eye health, a diet rich in vegetables and other healthy foods may help reduce the incidence of some eye diseases. Some studies also show that exercise is associated with a reduction in risk for developing glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration. Cigarette smoking is associated with several eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, so quitting or avoiding smoking is critical. Finally, don\u2019t rub your eyes; it can lead to increased irritation. Removing makeup at nighttime helps minimize eyelid irritation.

{"id": "2024_06_09_health_therapy-benefits-happiness-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Therapy often gets a bad rap. In old movies, it\u2019s often depicted with a patient lying on a couch, talking to a stony-faced, note-taking analyst who never speaks. Critics sometimes derisively describe it as navel-gazing. Therapists are offhandedly called \u201cshrinks,\u201d a throwback to the ancient practice \u00a0of shrinking the head of a conquered enemy. And let\u2019s face it, the practice still carries a stigma for many; acknowledging you see a therapist is akin to admitting you are weak or \u201ccrazy,\u201d especially in some professions. When it comes to physical health, most of us don\u2019t hesitate too long to get help for injuries such as a broken bone or a burn. But when it comes to emotional health, there often is a delay, possibly resulting in a bigger mental health crisis. \u201cPeople don\u2019t come to therapy until they\u2019re having the equivalent of an emotional heart attack,\u201d psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently. Gottlieb is the author of \u201cMaybe You Should Talk to Someone,\u201d a cohost of the \u201cDear Therapists\u201d podcast\u00a0and the writer of the weekly \u201cDear Therapist\u201d advice column for The Atlantic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this hierarchy of pain with our physical health. We don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I fell down and broke my wrist, but I don\u2019t have stage 4 cancer, so I\u2019m just going to let my wrist hang out there and I\u2019m not going to get a cast.\u2019 And we have a very different attitude about emotional health,\u201d she said. Hesitancy over therapy may be due to its stigma, a skepticism about its worth, the cost in time and money, or just the uncertainty about how it works \u2014 and this reluctance to discuss mental health is pretty widespread. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center released in May, 31% of respondents said they would only be somewhat comfortable talking to a therapist about their mental health, while 18% said they\u2019d be either not too or not at all comfortable doing so. \u201cThere are so many misconceptions about therapy, and I think that often prevents people from going,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c(One) is that you\u2019re going to go in, you\u2019re going to download the problem of the week, and you\u2019re going to leave, and you\u2019re basically just complaining and getting validated for your complaints. \u201cAnd that is not what therapy is. We like to say that insight is the booby prize of therapy, that you can have all the insight in the world, but if you don\u2019t make changes out in the world, the insight is useless,\u201d she said, noting that most therapy takes place in the week between sessions \u201cwhere you are actually taking what you\u2019ve learned and doing something different.\u201d Taking action not only rewires your brain, but it can ultimately result in a happier you. \u201cDo they experience joy more? Yes. Are they generally more content in their lives? Do they feel less stressed, less sad, more able to manage when things don\u2019t go well, less reactive when they\u2019re in a situation that maybe is relationally difficult for them, more able to find sort of inner peace? Yes,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. I think that when people say, \u2018Oh, I just want to be happy.\u2019 All of the things that I just described bring you happiness.\u201d You can listen to the full episode here. How can therapy improve your happiness? Here are Gottlieb\u2019s top five reasons. 1. Therapy offers perspective Ideally, therapy is impartial. \u201cTherapy is like getting a really good second opinion on your life, from someone who\u2019s not already in your life,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWhen we try to get advice or guidance from people who are close to us, it\u2019s hard for them to separate out the relationship they have with us and to be able to see the issue objectively.\u201d Our friends, she said, give us \u201cidiot compassion\u201d \u2014 they loyally validate our feelings often without pointing out our own role in any conflicts. Therapists are trained to give us \u201cwise compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hold up a mirror to you, and we help you to see something about what is getting you stuck, that maybe you haven\u2019t been willing or able to see. We help you to see something that you can actively change,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAnd I think that there\u2019s something so empowering about that, and it\u2019s so translatable to many different relationships.\u201d 2. Therapy is a safe space In therapy, you can explore seemingly frivolous subjects. \u201cTherapy can make you happier because it helps you to really be intentional about what you want in your life. And I don\u2019t think we have a lot of spaces to talk about that,\u201d Gottlieb said, referring to concepts such as life satisfaction. \u201cSometimes people think, \u2018Well, I have a roof over my head and food on the table. So this whole thing about meaning and fulfillment \u2014 I can\u2019t really talk about that,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIn therapy, you have a space where you can really ask those hard questions, and nobody\u2019s judging you and nobody\u2019s trying to tell you, \u2018Well, you have enough already.\u2019\u201d 3. Therapy helps to connect with others Modern times have created an epidemic of loneliness; the pandemic only made it worse. Therapy can be a bridge. \u201cWe do have this epidemic of loneliness. And I think a lot of people want deeper connections, and they want more meaningful connections, but they don\u2019t know how to go about it,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think that we all grew up with certain ideas about what relationships look like, what friendships look like. (But) we aren\u2019t always aware of the ways in which we may be preventing ourselves from having more meaningful relationships.\u201d For example, many people avoid conflict or seek it out, while others have social anxiety or never learned the necessary social skills. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know how to reach out even if we want to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think in therapy, you learn how to create connection in your life, which is one of the most influential factors when it comes to happiness.\u201d 4. Therapy helps us see the big picture Therapy helps people see that they are part of larger forces, and not simply individuals who formed with no external influences. \u201cWe sometimes feel that the problems are sort of \u2018out there\u2019 \u2014 we don\u2019t really know that we are part of that dynamic, part of that dance,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c(Therapy) helps you to process that unfinished business.\u201d She pointed out that our parents were human and often did what they learned from their parents. \u201cAnd (therapy is) a place where you can say, \u2018What is some of this old stuff that I\u2019m carrying around with me that I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m carrying around?\u2019\u201d she said, noting that once you understand how your history influences how you navigate through the world, you can change patterns. \u201cIt makes you happier because you\u2019re not carrying around the burden of something that happened a long time ago,\u201d she said. 5. Therapy helps us control our story Our life is a narrative, and therapy can help us make sense of it. \u201cWhen you think about our lives \u2026 they\u2019re really stories. (Therapy) helps you clarify your story and take authorship of your story,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt helps you to take authorship of your own life. \u2026 If I\u2019m creating this one limited time that I have here \u2014 this one life that I have here \u2014 why am I letting all these other people write my story for me, and how can I really take ownership of my story?\u201d We hope these five tips help you understand the benefits of therapy.
