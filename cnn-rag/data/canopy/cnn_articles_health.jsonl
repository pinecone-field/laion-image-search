The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said. But though the exoplanet could potentially be habitable for humans and is relatively \u201cnear\u201d our solar system in astronomical terms, it is unlikely that anyone will visit there soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not reachable, it\u2019s 12 parsecs away,\u201d said Palethorpe, adding that it would take about 225,000 years to reach Gliese 12b with the fastest spacecraft that currently exist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

The government has instructed health officials to take all necessary actions, including applying prevention and control measures and identifying funds to manage the outbreak. The Honduran health ministry has reported 23,037 suspected cases of dengue in the first 20 weeks of the year. That\u2019s one of the highest totals in the Americas, according to data collected by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The entire region has already reported more than 8.65 million cases in the first five months of 2024 \u2013 almost twice as many as the more than 4.5 million cases reported in all of 2023, which was a record at the time. The southern cone of the Americas has accounted for most of the cases in the first half of 2024, with Brazil registering 7.2 million alone. But now, the southern region is seeing a significant decrease in infections, while Central America and the Caribbean are starting to enter their peak dengue seasons, according to PAHO. \u201cHonduras has entered the epidemic zone due to the increase in cases in all departments of the country, as well as the number of patient admissions in all hospitals in the country due to this disease,\u201d the Honduran health ministry said Friday. Honduras has reported the second-most cases in the Central American Isthmus and Mexico Subregion this year, trailing only Mexico, which has counted more than 69,000. PAHO and the World Health Organization recommend that countries in those areas \u201cadopt the necessary measures to prepare the response to the increase in dengue, including the organization of health services to ensure adequate clinical management, prevention of complications, and avoid saturation of specialized care services.\u201d Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is spread mainly through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

{"id": "2024_05_31_health_art-live-longer-wellness", "text": "Most people don\u2019t pick up a coloring book, paintbrush, poetry collection or museum membership for the health benefits \u2014 but maybe it\u2019s time to start. Research shows that art experiences, whether as a maker or a beholder, transform our biology by rewiring our brains and triggering the release of neurochemicals, hormones and endorphins. In response to a growing body of evidence that art can radically improve both physical and mental health in effective and measurable ways, more health care practitioners are prescribing arts engagement as part of treating a wide array of conditions, including: obesity, heart disease, chronic pain, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, loneliness and depression. The power of diverse arts practices to promote healing, well-being and even longevity provides benefits that rank right up there with exercise, nutrition and sleep, argued Susan Magsamen in her bestseller, \u201cYour Brain on Art: How the Arts Transform Us,\u201d coauthored with Ivy Ross. Could this be why the arts have evolved over millennia to become central to human experience? \u201cI always thought of art as a luxury,\u201d conceded Bianca Bosker in her new book, \u201cGet the Picture: A Mind-Bending Journey among the Inspired Artists and Obsessive Art Fiends Who Taught Me How to See.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t feed you, house you or be used to kill predators.\u201d But she discovered that many scientists consider art a basic human need. \u201cArt is one of our oldest creations (humans invented paint long before the wheel), one of the earliest means of communication (we drew long, long, long,\u00a0long\u00a0before we could write), and one of our most universal urges,\u201d she wrote. Both Bosker and Magsamen recommend that everyone make art a daily practice, based on evidence and experience. Here\u2019s why they see art as anything but a luxury. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: You both argue that art is fundamental to human existence. How do you explain that to skeptics? Susan Magsamen: We are literally physiologically wired for the arts. Input from our senses builds connections among our brains\u2019 86 billion neurons. Engaging with art, whether as a spectator or creator, actually brings information into our bodies and profoundly impacts our biological circuitry. Art\u2019s simultaneous activation of multiple neurological and physiological systems \u2014 a unique evolutionary phenomenon \u2014 involves the entire brain, body and spirit. The next time you feel moved by your favorite song, consider that an artist\u2019s choices are changing you on a cellular level. Bianca Bosker: Many experts agree that art is both an innate human impulse and a biological predisposition that has helped our species survive. It\u2019s only a modern-day misconception that looking at art is purely philosophical or intellectual. At its core, art is a physical experience \u2014 and that applies not only to music \u2014 with its thrumming bass that you can feel \u2014 but also to painting and visual arts as well. For the past 100 years or so, society has focused on the ideas behind artwork \u2014 that the thought trumps the thing. But when you watch artists making art, it is a physical experience. It\u2019s practically athletic. Engaging with artwork in person, as two bodies in space, is crucial. Research shows that factors like an artwork\u2019s size, or how we move around it, can change how we value art. \u00a0You can think about connecting with art the way you do with people. Just as a virtual meeting with someone is different from sitting across the dinner table, it\u2019s very different to look at a tiny image of an artwork on Instagram than it is to be body to body with, for example, a huge Mark Rothko painting. There\u2019s fascinating anecdotal evidence of how artworks can act on people at a physical level. The term \u201cStendhal syndrome\u201d describes people going to pieces \u2014 struck with dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, fainting spells or crying \u2014 in front of pieces of art. Stories like how a woman in a museum in Houston stripped naked in front of a Cy Twombly\u00a0\u00a0 painting suggest that, on a physical level, art can move us to do some incredible things. Magsamen: Not all artworks are positive, of course. It\u2019s critical to consider the kinds of sensorial experiences you bring into your life because of their power to make you feel, change your mood and affect your body. CNN: Bianca, you discuss finding value in some art experiences that might be considered unpleasant. What are the benefits of work that confuses us or makes us uncomfortable? Bosker: The fact that art isn\u2019t always pleasant is often part of its power. Scientists have puzzled over this question of why, over the last many thousands of years, humans have continued to keep engaging with art, even when, as they put it, it can \u201churt our sense of beauty.\u201d One compelling explanation is that we\u2019re drawn to uncomfortable, confounding images and experiences because our brains love the prediction errors they offer, aka surprises. Some researchers think art helps us fight the reducing tendencies of our minds. Contrary to common assumptions, we do not see the world like a video camera, dispassionately recording what\u2019s around us. Instead, our brains evolved to compress reality, acting like trash compactors, and for good reason. Oversimplifying our view of the world enabled us to spot the lion jumping out to eat us. But that ability also comes with risks. As some scientists put it, vision is a hallucination. What we\u2019re seeing is a construction based on our own individual filters of expectation that preemptively sort, dismiss and prioritize all the raw data coming in, even before we get the full picture. Looking at art can yank off those filters, surprising us and knocking our brains off their well-worn pathways. The glitch that art introduces is a gift that opens us to experiencing more nuance and beauty in the world around us. Magsamen: Art that pushes us beyond our limits helps form new neural pathways that might not otherwise develop in our day-to-day. Exercising these through art can help build resilience to get us through the suffering and uncertainties of life. When you\u2019re in despair, entering a church or other grand building can evoke awe, wonder and the sense of something bigger than you. Similarly, art, music and design\u00a0\u00a0 can alter our moods, taking us outside of ourselves. Building that capacity is an evolutionary imperative. CNN: What physiological benefits do the arts bring? Magsamen: Pinning down a definition of art can make some of the research tricky, but what we know suggests that artworks have very real effects on our mental and physical well-being. Physicians around the world prescribe visits to museums, engagement with arts and encounters with beauty. Different art forms affect the brain and body in different ways. Just as when we are prescribed medications, (it\u2019s true that) types, doses and durations of art work differently for different people. Doctors, social workers and public health practitioners are beginning to understand enough to collaborate with their clients to personalize their recommendations of particular artistic endeavors in specific frequencies and amounts to effect beneficial outcomes. Like exercise and good nutrition, engaging in the arts routinely will support your health. CNN: How can people develop an art practice to get those benefits? Bosker: Everything you need to have a meaningful experience with art is right in front of you. You don\u2019t need to have studied art history or spent years going to art fairs. You need attention and curiosity. An artist gave me great advice on how to engage with a work\u2014just try to notice five things about a piece, either in the work or in how it makes you feel.\u00a0Like,\u00a0\u201cThis pink makes me want to lick it\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201cThis green won\u2019t let me look away.\u201d The other foundational advice I give is to slow down. Many museum\u00a0visitors spend more time reading the description of the art than looking at the art itself, with the median time we spend with a work of art, both the piece and the label, being\u00a0just 21 seconds. Try \u201cslow looking.\u201d And pay attention to the physical form. Examining the artist\u2019s decisions offers you a pathway into the piece and a way to engage with art on your own terms. I used to take a scorched-earth approach to visiting museums with the attitude that seeing every single thing was how I\u2019d get my money\u2019s worth. That\u2019s the visual equivalent of binging at an all-you-can-eat buffet and then wondering why you feel ill. Instead of racing between masterpieces, spend more time with art that surprises you. And look for art everywhere, observing the everyday with an art mindset to counteract the reductionist tendencies of our brains. CNN: Do we have to be \u201cgood\u201d at art to reap its benefits? Magsamen: No. The art you\u2019re making doesn\u2019t have to be good for it to be valuable for you. One study showed that doing just 45 minutes of any kind of art lowered the stress hormone cortisol by as much as 25%.\u00a0\u00a0 Other research suggests artmaking builds skills in executive function, decision-making and, if you\u2019re working with others, collaboration. Playing music builds cognitive skills and enhances learning. And just one art experience per month can extend your life by 10 years. The process, not the product, is what\u2019s important. Bosker: You do not need any sort of license to engage with art. Art is a choice. It\u2019s a decision to fight against complacency and forge a life that\u2019s richer, more uncomfortable, more mind-blowing, more uncertain and ultimately, more beautiful.

The US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local partners are investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Africana that has led to 162 illnesses in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Among those cases, 54 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Out of 65 people interviewed for the investigation, 47 reported eating cucumbers, the FDA said Wednesday, and testing by state partners had identified salmonella in a cucumber sample.

Symptoms of a salmonella infection\u00a0include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that can start within hours or days of consuming the bacteria. Most people will recover without treatment but should seek immediate attention from a health-care provider if they have severe symptoms, symptoms that don\u2019t improve after a few days or signs of dehydration.

{"id": "2024_05_30_health_marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness", "text": "It\u2019s a true blessing to have great friends who frequently get together. At times, however, those blessings may overflow, according to \u201cB,\u201d a 43-year-old Atlantan who CNN is not identifying for privacy reasons. \u201cI love Champagne bubbles and having Champagne on a patio on Sunday with friends \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0it\u2019s an ideal day,\u201d B said. \u201cBut my friends hang out all the time, and even on a weeknight, it would end up being bottles of wine. I felt like I should have invested in box wine, especially during the pandemic.\u201d Today, B has given up alcohol, turning instead to marijuana gummies when she wants a buzz. The use of weed to replace alcohol is a growing trend in the United States. In fact, a recent study found \u2014 for the first time ever \u2014 the daily use of cannabis of any kind among Americans surpassed the daily use of alcohol. In sheer numbers, of course, many more people still drink alcohol on occasion than use marijuana, which is now legal for recreational use in\u00a024 states and Washington, DC, and for medical use in\u00a038 states\u00a0and DC. Still, nearly 18 million people age 12 and older reported using marijuana daily or near daily in 2022, compared with about 15 million who said they used alcohol with the same frequency, according to the study\u2019s analysis of the most recent data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual government survey. \u2018My heart was racing\u2019 For B, giving up alcohol was a necessity. Her periodic binge drinking with friends was taking a toll. Hangovers and an increasing sense of anxiety on the mornings after affected her work performance and her ability to exercise, an enjoyable part of her life. \u201cI\u2019m really healthy, I eat clean and work out all the time, and I just was not feeling good anymore,\u201d B said. \u201cThen one day I was laying on my couch, and my heart was racing like it was coming out of my chest.\u201d Both alcoholism and heart disease ran in B\u2019s family: \u201cI\u2019ve had relatives that have dropped dead of a heart attack in their driveway.\u201d Simply drinking less wasn\u2019t an option for her. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to moderate in the past, but it\u2019s hard to do that when you\u2019re around people who are drinking,\u201d B said. \u201cSo I decided to quit alcohol completely. My friends were really supportive, and it was easier than I thought it would be.\u201d After a few months of total sobriety, however, B began to experiment with cannabis gummies and found them easy to incorporate with a nonalcoholic drink or two. \u201cI don\u2019t like getting super high,\u201d B said. \u201cI\u2019ll just cut off a fourth of a gummy to take the edge off after a long day at work. If I\u2019m with friends at a party where I know I\u2019ll be there awhile, I might take a half or even a whole one.\u201d Weed or alcohol: Which is better? Is replacing alcohol with weed a healthier option? It depends, experts say. \u201cQuestioning one\u2019s relationship with alcohol is a very healthy trend,\u201d said Carol Boyd, founding director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was not involved in the analysis. \u201cWe know that moderate alcohol consumption has health risks, and risk increases as alcohol consumption increases,\u201d Boyd said in an email. Just one drink a day can raise blood pressure, trigger a dangerous irregular heartbeat or even shrink your brain, studies have found. Those are just a few of the many pitfalls of alcohol use, including the risk of cancer. Binge drinking, defined as consuming four or more drinks in two hours for women (five or more for men) was on the rise during the pandemic. Binging was higher in women, sending twice as many to the emergency room during the pandemic than before. In fact, the alcohol-induced death rate for both sexes jumped 26% between 2019 and 2020, the first year of the pandemic. At first glance, the harms of marijuana appear equally worrisome. By using cannabis before the age of 25, young people can permanently damage their brains, wreaking havoc with their ability to learn, remember, solve problems and pay attention, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Daily marijuana use\u00a0raises the risk of stroke by 42%\u00a0and heart attack by 25%, even if there is no prior history of heart disease and the person has never smoked or vaped tobacco, according to a February 2024 study. Weed has\u00a0also been linked\u00a0to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation; myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle;\u00a0spasms of the heart\u2019s arteries\u00a0and a higher risk of\u00a0heart failure. However, many participants in those cardiovascular studies are smoking or vaping marijuana instead of ingesting it, said Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician and cannabis specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who authored \u201cSeeing\u00a0 Through the Smoke: A Cannabis Specialist Untangles the Truth About Marijuana.\u201d \u201cNo doctor recommends smoking marijuana, unless someone is in acute pain or has cancer and is on chemotherapy, when they might want the faster pain relief that comes from inhaling,\u201d Grinspoon said. Burning anything, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, creates\u00a0toxic compounds that are harmful to health when inhaled, said marijuana reseracher Dr. Beth Cohen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cCannabis smoke contains toxins, carcinogens, and particulate matter that have been linked to cancer, lung damage, and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cWith potential harms for any substance, we would expect to see a dose response. So, I\u2019m particularly concerned about the increases in daily or near daily use of cannabis.\u201d In fact, marijuana smoke may even be more harmful than tobacco because users hold the hot smoke in their lungs longer to maximize their high. A March 2021 study by Boyd found teens twice as likely to report \u201cwheezing or whistling\u201d in the chest after vaping marijuana than after smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes. \u201cNew data is beginning to show\u00a0that secondhand marijuana smoke may be just as dangerous as the primary smoke,\u201d Robert Page II, a\u00a0professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora, told CNN in a prior interview. However, there are many other options than inhaling marijuana smoke, Grinspoon said, including \u201cusing topicals like oils, lotions or a skin patch, or a suppository, or a tincture put under the tongue or in tea, or an edible. You don\u2019t have to smoke the cannabis.\u201d There is a problem, however. Research on edibles, such as baked goods, candies and beverages, and other methods of using cannabis is in its infancy. Whether there are longer-term impacts on human health than ingesting too much at one sitting and getting an uncomfortable high are unknown. \u201cWe do not yet know risks of daily use of edibles \u2014 thus, I cannot say whether the trend will end up as a healthy one,\u201d Boyd said in email. \u201cRegulation is uneven, products vary, and use is still illegal under federal law. We need better data!\u201d \u2018Like the Wild West\u2019 B lives in Georgia, a state where only medical marijuana is allowed. Therefore, B began using hemp-based gummies laced with delta-9, the most abundant form of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the part of the cannabis plant that creates a high. The synthetic form used in edibles is called delta-9 THC-O acetate. With the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which removed the hemp plant from the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s schedule of controlled substances, B can buy numerous brands of hemp gummies nearly everywhere, including her local gas station. \u201cFirst, I want to commend her for giving up alcohol,\u201d said Grinspoon, who is on the board of the advocacy group Doctors for Drug Policy Reform, which addresses cannabis, psychedelic and drug regulation in general. \u201cBut the hemp products she buys at the gas station or liquor store or the like are completely unregulated, sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids like delta-8, delta-9 and delta 10 that are pretty cheap to make. \u201cThat\u2019s really dangerous for a million reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in these new synthetic cannabinoids. You can get all kinds of industrial byproducts, a mixture of all kinds of synthetics, or an extremely high or low dose of the synthetic. It\u2019s like the Wild West out there.\u201d \u201cPotentially harmful chemicals \u201care needed to convert cannabinoids in hemp into synthetic products like delta 8, according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while manufacturing may \u201coccur in uncontrolled or unsanitary settings.\u201d Of the nearly 2,400 calls about delta 8 to the National Poison Center in one year from 2021 to 2022, 70% required a doctor\u2019s care and 8% were admitted, the FDA said. One child died. A June 2018 review of existing literature on synthetic versions of cannabis found they may cause more severe adverse effects, which could include breathing problems, a spike in blood pressure, chest pain and a rapidly beating heart, cognitive impairment. anxiety, agitation, suicidal ideation, and even death. \u201cIn and of itself, it\u2019s not good that more people are using cannabis,\u201d Grinspoon said. However, If they are going to use it to replace alcohol, he added, \u201cpeople should be buying marijuana and hemp cannabis products at a legal, regulated dispensary in a state where the product is tracked from beginning to end and tested along the way.\u201d If a person chooses to buy weed or hemp online or at a smoke shop, be sure to choose a product with a label that shows they have paid an independent outside company to assure the purity of their products, he said. \u201cMy other advice for people who want to use weed is to get educated,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t smoke it. Start at a very low dose and go slow. Don\u2019t use it before driving. And get it from a medical marijuana dispensary or well-regulated legal shop, as that is much safer than these hemp-derived products that are unregulated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_bird-flu-mexico-human-h5n2", "text": "Even as the United States grapples with an outbreak of H5N1 flu in dairy cattle, the World Health Organization has announced the first known human infection with a different strain, H5N2, in a person in Mexico who died of complications of their infection. Both of these strains of the influenza A virus have primarily affected farmed and wild birds, infecting flocks around the world. About 900 human cases of H5N1 have been reported since 1996, and about half of people known to be infected have died.\u00a0On Wednesday, WHO said it had confirmed the first case of human infection of H5N2 in a 59-year-old resident of Mexico. The source of the person\u2019s infection is unknown, although WHO noted that H5N2 viruses had been reported in poultry in Mexico. Because any new influenza A infection in people has the potential for high public health impact, it must be reported to WHO.\u00a0The organization said that based on current knowledge, the risk to the general public from H5N2 is low, since other H5 subtypes are known to infect humans but none has been shown to cause sustained human-to-human spread. The person, who had multiple underlying medical conditions, had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before they developed new symptoms. In mid-April, they developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness.\u00a0On April 24, they sought medical attention and were hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. The person died of complications that day. On May 8, a sample sent for specialized testing indicated that it was positive for H5N2, and the result was subsequently confirmed by a different lab. Of 17 people at the hospital who\u2019d been in contact with the patient, no further cases were identified. Twelve additional contacts were identified near the person\u2019s residence, and seven of those had symptoms, but testing of samples from these cases didn\u2019t identify Covid-19 or any type of flu.\u00a0Scientists are now testing blood samples to see whether they can find antibodies that would point to past infections. In March, an H5N2 outbreak was reported in a backyard poultry farm in a neighboring state to the one where the person lived.\u00a0According to WHO, it hasn\u2019t been possible to establish whether this case is related to recent poultry outbreaks. Flu viruses normally circulate in birds but occasionally can jump to other species, including humans.\u00a0People catch the viruses from direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, type A flu strains can be classified as bird flu, swine flu or other types of animal influenza viruses. Bird flu infections in humans can cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal.\u00a0 Eye infections like conjunctivitis, gut symptoms and brain swelling are also possible.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/bird-flu-mexico-human-h5n2/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_male-birth-control-gel-wellness", "text": "After decades of false starts, researchers say they are finally making progress on a long-acting and reversible birth control option for men. The experimental product is a hormonal gel that men rub on their shoulders once daily. Over time, it blocks the production of sperm in the testes. The gel was developed by the National Institutes of Health and the nonprofit Population Council, and it takes much the same approach as birth control pills for women. It uses two hormones: nestorone, a progestin, and testosterone, the male sex hormone.\u00a0The nestorone suppresses the production of testosterone in the testes and, with it, the development of sperm. But testosterone serves many functions in the body: It is responsible for muscle maintenance and libido, for example, and men need some in their circulation to function normally. The gel replaces enough to keep them healthy but not so much that they make enough sperm to get someone pregnant. Researchers have been formulating and refining the dose and concentration of the gel since 2005.\u00a0In this latest test, which included more than 300 couples, they think they got it right. Normal sperm counts range from about 15 million to 200 million sperm per milliliter of semen, and studies have shown that sperm counts of less than 1 million per milliliter are low enough to prevent pregnancy. In a clinical trial, 86% of men achieved these low sperm counts by 15 weeks of using the gel.\u00a0For some, it worked even faster, suppressing sperm production within four to eight weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been just really excited by the results. The combination seems to provide better, faster suppression than we expected,\u201d said Diana Blithe, branch chief of the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who gave an update on the trial results this week at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Boston. Blithe declined to say whether there were any unintended pregnancies during the trial.\u00a0The researchers hope to have the final data published in a medical journal, and she said she didn\u2019t want to give away the results. \u201cI would say our expectation was that it would be similar to hormonal birth control pills. And I can just say that it\u2019s much, much better than that,\u201d she said. With typical use, birth control pills, rings and patches for women have failure rates of about 7%, meaning 7 women of every 100 who use the method for a year will get pregnant.\u00a0Condoms have a failure rate of about 13%. The gel also seems to have other advantages over female birth control. For example, if a woman misses a day or two of the pill, she can ovulate, making it more likely that she\u2019ll have an unintended pregnancy. With the gel, if a man\u2019s sperm production is fully suppressed and he misses a day or two of usage, his hormones would start to recover, but it takes about 8 to 10 weeks for a man\u2019s sperm count to recover to levels that would cause a pregnancy. Blithe says that in clinical trials, the researchers are not seeing the kind of mood swings and depression that women can experience with birth control pills, either. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s a small percentage who have mood swings that they don\u2019t like, but that\u2019s it\u2019s a relatively small number. And we\u2019ve actually been surprised at how few,\u201d she said. The World Health Organization tested injections that used a similar combination of hormones. The approach seemed effective, but the study enrollment was stopped early, in 2011, because the shots caused too many side effects, including serious depression. Blithe said that was because the hormones were clearing at different rates when injected.\u00a0With the gel, a concentration of hormones seems to build up in the skin and create a reservoir that releases more slowly. \u201cThat fluctuation is not really happening, so we\u2019re not creating ups and downs,\u201d she said. Matthew Trevi\u00f1o, 35, of Sacramento, California, participated in the study. He rubs a little gel on each shoulder first thing in the morning and says it\u2019s become as routine as showering and brushing his teeth. Aside from a little weight gain, he\u2019s had no complaints, he said.\u00a0If anything, his sex drive has increased. \u201cI\u2019ve only experienced increased libido,\u201d he told the \u201cUnfold\u201d podcast, which is produced by the University of California at Davis, which was also one of the study sites.  \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just lucking out, but I hope this is the case for the majority of participants. If it is, it\u2019s definitely going to change contraception as a whole.\u201d To participate in the study, couples had to be in committed relationships, and they signed on for a two-year commitment to the research. Men are warned that they could experience a number of side effects from the gel, including dry or oily skin, increased or decreased libido, hair growth or loss, and mood swings. For Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s partner, Emily Fletcher, 28, participating in the research meant giving up her own birth control \u2013 an IUD \u2013 and taking a big leap of faith right around the time the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. \u201cI was worried,\u201d she told \u201cUnfold.\u201d \u201cThere was still a thought in the back of my mind that \u2018maybe this will be an issue if the drug doesn\u2019t work, and I get pregnant.\u2019 \u201c Fletcher and Trevi\u00f1o, who are both researchers at UC Davis, ultimately felt like it was important to participate in the study. Trevi\u00f1o told the podcast he\u2019s been interested in a male contraceptive for a long time. To him, it doesn\u2019t feel fair that his partner has to shoulder the burden of birth control. Women release an egg only once a month, on average, whereas men produce about 1,000 sperm every second. \u201cMaybe the burden is on the wrong side,\u201d Trevi\u00f1o said. \u201cI kind of think it\u2019s unfair that it only lands on the women.\u201d  After men stop using the gel, their sperm count returns to normal levels within two or three months.\u00a0After the recovery phase of the trial, many of the participants went on to become fathers, proving that the method is fully reversible, Blithe said. That\u2019s a big step forward. Right now, the only birth control options for men are condoms, which have a high failure rate, and vasectomy, a surgical procedure that can be hard to reverse. The researchers have started a conversation with the US Food and Drug Administration about how to test the gel in a final definitive trial.\u00a0No male contraceptive method has ever made it this far, Blithe said. Normally, drugs that make it to this stage have to be compared head-to-head against a placebo. But testing a true placebo in research where the goal is to prevent pregnancy just wouldn\u2019t be ethical, said Dr. Christina Wang, a co-principal investigator on the trial, who specializes in male reproductive biology at the Lundquist Institute at UCLA\u2019s Harbor Medical Center. If the researchers get the FDA\u2019s nod for a trial, they hope to start the final phase of testing in 2025.\u00a0It will take another couple years, and Wang said they\u2019ll probably expand the study to more locations and recruit more couples. Big trials usually require significant investment, too. Blithe says she\u2019s hopeful they\u2019ll get interest from pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Brian Nguyen, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Southern California who has been involved in helping participants with the social and behavioral needs during the trial, says he\u2019s looking forward to seeing the gel come to market and usher in a new era of gender equity in birth control. \u201cWe often think of men as kind of not being aware or not wanting to be involved. But when you think about men who are in very close partnerships, how does a female partner hide the fact that they are either in pain, or they\u2019re having abnormal bleeding, or mood swings?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a couples-driven medication, which is very unique.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/male-birth-control-gel-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

You grab your neck pillow, eye mask and a glass of wine to make sure you are well-rested on the other side. That tactic isn\u2019t such a good idea, according to new research. Airplane cabins are pressurized to maintain the equivalent of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) of elevation, meaning the air pressure and oxygen levels are lower than what most people experience on Earth. Combine that with alcohol consumption and sleep, and it\u2019s more likely a person will experience an intensified drop in oxygen saturation in their blood, according to a study published Monday in the journal Thorax. \u201cPlease don\u2019t drink alcohol on board of airplanes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Eva-Maria Elmenhorst, deputy of the department of sleep and human factors and leader of the Working Group on Performance and Sleep at the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne, Germany, in an email. To investigate, researchers created an atmospheric environment similar to an airplane cabin in flight. Over two nights, 48 healthy adults slept for four hours in two different environments \u2014 once without alcohol and once after drinking the equivalent of two glasses of wine or cans of beer, according to the study. On the nights with alcohol, researchers saw a lowered amount of oxygen and an increased heart rate, the study showed. \u201cThe combination of alcohol intake with sleeping under hypobaric conditions poses a considerable strain on the cardiac system and might lead to exacerbation of symptoms in patients with cardiac or pulmonary diseases,\u201d the researchers said. The study is small, but it provides a starting point from which researchers should keep investigating the relationship between sleep, flight and alcohol, said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. Many people may be drinking onboard to help them get to sleep in an often uncomfortable cabin \u2014 but doing so negatively impacts both long-term health and the immediate goal of getting some rest, experts said. Alcohol gets you sleep \u2014 but not good sleep The study authors didn\u2019t just collect data on heart strain. They also took a closer look at the participants\u2019 quality of sleep. It wasn\u2019t great. Time in REM sleep \u2014 the rapid-eye movement stage that may be important to memory consolidation and brain recuperation \u2014 was shorter for people in the airplane conditions who had alcohol, the study showed. The finding isn\u2019t a surprise, Freeman said. Alcohol may help you get to sleep, but the quality isn\u2019t as good as sleep while sober, he said. \u201cMany people have witnessed when people drink heavily, their snoring and the sleep apnea is much more severe,\u201d Freeman said. The quantity of sleep under the influence also tends to be different, said Dr. Shalini Paruthi, adjunct professor at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. People tend to get more fragmented sleep after drinking, meaning they wake up more in the night and tend not to sleep as long, said Paruthi, an American Academy of Sleep Medicine spokesperson. She was not involved in the research. \u2018Sometimes people will just think about the immediate effect of \u2018ooh it will make me fall asleep faster\u2019 but they forget about all the other effects of the alcohol,\u201d she said. Be especially careful not to mix sleep aids with alcohol, because both are depressants and intensify their sedative effects when taken together, Freeman said. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen \u2026 people taking sleeping pills combined with alcohol, which is a major issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, there\u2019s oftentimes a medical emergency.\u201d How to rest before your destination If possible, try to keep to your natural body cycles when flying, Freeman said \u2014 although that might not always be possible. That can look like choosing a flight that lines up with your sleep patterns so you can either land and just finish sleeping or land and start your day, he said. Avoid creating those sleep and wake cycles with too many stimulants such as coffee or energy drinks and depressants like alcohol, he added. Next, stay hydrated, because flying typically involves a dry environment and people don\u2019t always hydrate properly, Freeman said. The best thing to drink is water, he said. Foods served at airports and airplanes can lean salty, greasy and heavily processed, so Freeman recommends either packing your own or finding airport options that are lighter and largely plant-based. Exercise can also help you sleep better, so he advises avoiding the elevators and moving sidewalks to get some steps in instead. If you are on a long flight, try to get up and get some movement as well, Freeman said. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019ll point out is there\u2019s lots of evidence that suggests that the blue lights that are emitted from screens and all that interfere with our sleep patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are trying to sleep on a plane, consider getting a noise-canceling headphone and maybe not use your screens, especially while you\u2019re waiting for the flight to take off.\u201d It may be harder to keep up your healthy habits on days when you fly, but making efforts to do so can help you arrive feeling good and ready for an adventure, Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/health/alcohol-planes-heart-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_02_13_health_adhd-body-doubling-productivity-benefits-wellness", "text": "Once a week, ADHD coach Robin Nordmeyer joins a Zoom meeting with other coaches while she writes blogs, does administrative tasks or works on content for presentations she has been putting off.  Nordmeyer, who has ADHD, isn\u2019t necessarily using the meeting to collaborate with others \u2014 she just needs their presence as a motivator to help her get things done.  \u201cI run a business, and I have to balance lots of different areas of the business,\u201d said Nordmeyer, cofounder and managing director of the Center for Living Well with ADHD-Minnesota, an ADHD coaching group near Minneapolis serving all ages.  \u201cSome of those things come very easy \u2014 like, they\u2019re in my wheelhouse, they energize me, I can\u2019t wait to get to them,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cAnd some of those things are a little more tedious, or I have some resistance around them.\u201d  What Nordmeyer does to get through those tougher tasks is sometimes known as \u201cbody doubling,\u201d a productivity and self-help strategy that involves working with another person around to help improve motivation and focus. It has been popular for some time among people with ADHD \u2014 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \u2014 especially during the pandemic.  \u201cThe idea is that the presence of another is essentially a gentle reminder to stay on task,\u201d said Billy Roberts, clinical director of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cFor folks (with) ADHD whose minds tend to wander and get off task, the body double somehow works as an external motivator to stay on task.\u201d  Body doubling isn\u2019t just for people with ADHD, but like many \u201ccoping strategies, something that can be helpful for anybody is more central and important for folks with ADHD,\u201d said Dr. J. Russell Ramsay, founding codirector of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s ADHD Treatment and Research Program.  Why body doubling works A neurodevelopmental disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood but lasting into adulthood, ADHD stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University\u2019s Center on the Developing Child. Those skills help us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and multitask. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity \u2014 so people with this disorder might have trouble concentrating, staying organized, managing their time or controlling their impulses, which can affect both their work and personal lives, Roberts said.  If people with ADHD have no intrinsic interest in a task, Roberts said, they typically struggle with a lack of internal motivation to complete it or even to get started. Body doubling provides that motivation, experts said.  \u201cIt also draws on our social selves,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cA lot of people with ADHD will say, \u2018I have a hard time getting started on this if I\u2019m doing it for myself, but if I know somebody else is relying on me, if somebody else is waiting outside for me to show up to go for our walk, I\u2019m more likely to go and be there because I don\u2019t want to let them down.\u2019\u201d  There doesn\u2019t appear to be extensive research on body doubling for productivity, according to Roberts and other experts. \u201cBut I do know that the idea of externalizing motivation is a long-standing, evidence-based mechanism for managing ADHD,\u201d Roberts said.   In theory, the method is pretty straightforward, but there a few factors to keep in mind to make the most of it. How to use body doubling effectively Body doubling can help with pretty much any task you\u2019re having a hard time getting done \u2014 whether that\u2019s work, chores, exercise, schoolwork or paperwork. The other person doesn\u2019t have to be doing the same thing as you, unless the activity you need body doubling for \u2014 such as exercising \u2014 requires that assistance.   Be choosy about whom you ask to be your body double. The person should be as committed to you completing your work as you are, Roberts said \u2014 not distracting you with conversation or anything else. Choose someone who usually makes you feel comfortable and safe, and who can encourage you when necessary.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep a body double session focused on its purpose,\u201d Nordmeyer said. If conversations do come up, table them for later, perhaps during a break or dinner. Asking someone to be your body double might feel awkward, but Roberts said the best approach is often a straightforward one. You could say, \u201cIt\u2019s something I heard can help with productivity. Would you mind just being around me while I work on this? Maybe you have something you could work on, too.\u201d  You could also barter with them, in a sense, by making an offer such as, \u201cYou help me organize my garage on Saturday; I\u2019ll help you organize your home office on Sunday,\u201d Ramsay said.  Those small first steps of seeking a partner and setting up the session get you started and keep you going, he added. Scheduling regular body doubling sessions is one option, Nordmeyer said, or just ask whenever the need arises. How transparent you are about why you need a body double is up to you, as is whether you have more than one body double. \u201cIt depends on the individual,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf it turns into a distraction more than mindfulness, accountability or behavioral support, then you just want to rework things. You can kind of tinker with things until you find what works.\u201d  Virtual body doubling If you don\u2019t have a friend or colleague to be your body double, you aren\u2019t out of luck.  Some TikTok users, such as Allie K. Campbell, regularly go live while they\u2019re working so others can use them as a virtual body double. There are also body doubling or coworking platforms or apps such as Flown, Focusmate or Flow Club.  In virtual sessions, \u201cmost body doubles ask you to share your camera, and a lot of people are real nervous about being visible,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cThe purpose of that is to make sure you\u2019re still in your chair working. \u2026 But there might be other ways you can create that accountability through a chat feature.\u201d  The benefits of body doubling are likely why some people like working on things in coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces \u2014 which can be sources of passive body doubling if you don\u2019t have someone to ask, Roberts said. \u201cSome people work better with community support and just the awareness of other people around them,\u201d he added. \u201cYou saw that a lot with the pandemic, like people learning more about the kinds of structure they needed.  \u201cWe all think and work differently, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d Roberts said.

In an open letter posted to the agency\u2019s website on Thursday,\u00a0it\u00a0urged states to\u00a0warn the public more strongly about the dangers of raw milk\u00a0and to\u00a0test\u00a0herds that produce it for sale. The\u00a0FDA\u00a0also recommended that states use their regulatory authorities to stop the sale of raw milk\u00a0within the state or\u00a0in areas where dairy herds have tested positive. On Thursday, Minnesota became the 10th\u00a0state\u00a0to report infected herds.\u00a0According to the US Department of Agriculture, 82 herds in the US have tested positive for the H5N1 virus. The FDA doesn\u2019t allow the sale of raw milk across state lines, but several states allow the sale of raw milk for human consumption within their borders, with varying requirements. Some states allow raw milk to be sold as pet food labeled \u201cnot for human consumption,\u201d\u00a0understanding that what people do with the milk in their own homes is up to them. Raw milk\u00a0can carry high levels of the H5N1 bird flu virus because the virus appears to infect cows through their udders.\u00a0It is not yet known whether people can get bird flu by drinking milk contaminated with the virus.\u00a0 However, cats living on farms with infected cows have died after consuming unpasteurized milk, and three\u00a0dairy\u00a0workers exposed to raw milk have been infected. \u201cGiven the current and potential future risks that HPAI H5N1 virus poses to our nation\u2019s public health, as well as the health of our nation\u2019s food-producing animals and wildlife, it is important to work together to minimize the additional exposure of humans and other animal species,\u201d wrote Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, who is leading the agency\u2019s H5N1 response. Beyond bird flu, the FDA says health risks of raw milk include illness, miscarriages, stillbirths, kidney failure and death. In addition to stronger warnings about the dangers of consuming raw milk, the FDA is asking states to monitor dairy cattle herds for signs of illness that would indicate infection with H5N1 bird flu virus and tell farms to safely discard milk from sick cows. Any raw milk or raw milk products from exposed cattle that are fed to calves or any other animals should be heat-treated or pasteurized, the FDA said. The FDA is also calling on states to implement surveillance testing for the presence of H5N1 virus in dairy herds that might be engaged in producing raw milk and to report their results to\u00a0state and federal regulatory agencies. The agency said it would soon share new research and data on both bird flu virus in raw milk and raw milk products.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/with-bird-flu-infecting-dairy-cattle-fda-asks-some-states-to-curb-sales-of-raw-milk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_h5n1-bird-flu-in-wastewater", "text": "Results from recent wastewater testing across the US suggests that H5N1 bird flu may not be as widespread as first feared. The data, released Monday by the nonprofit WastewaterSCAN network, showed detections of the H5 protein portion of the flu virus in sewage from 14 water treatment plants in five states, mostly in Texas and Michigan, suggesting that an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle may largely be confined to states that have already been identified as having affected herds. \u201cWe\u2019re not detecting H5 everywhere. We\u2019re only detecting it in certain locations,\u201d said Dr. Alexandria Boehm, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. The test for H5 was run in 190 monitoring sites across the US over the past two weeks.\u00a0Nine states are not enrolled in the WastewaterSCAN network and so are not included in the surveillance: South Carolina, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. There were detections in two states where no affected dairy herds have been identified: Iowa and Minnesota.\u00a0However, both states have seen recent outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry. Boehm explained that the researchers aren\u2019t sure exactly what the sources of H5 in wastewater may be. It could be from permitted discharges of unused or leftover raw milk to wastewater treatment plants where the samples are collected. \u201cIn the case of Amarillo in Texas, for example, they had a dairy processing plant that was making processed dairy products, and their waste stream discharges into the wastewater treatment plant because milk, raw milk from the local area, was coming into that plant with H5N1,\u201d Boehm said. That may not be the source in all areas, however.\u00a0There\u2019s a chance the H5 detections might also be due to human infections or from less-likely sources such as infected wild birds that might contaminate wastewater or stormwater runoff that picks up H5N1 virus on its way into sewers, perhaps from bird droppings, Boehm said. People shouldn\u2019t be unduly alarmed if H5 appears in a nearby sewer system, Boehm said. \u201cThe way that we\u2019re thinking about it is that wastewater is providing an additional tool to the nation\u201d to keep eyes on the virus amid the outbreak, Boehm said. Experts say such tools are needed because testing of cattle has been limited, and the farm workers who are most at risk of catching the virus from infected cattle often live on minimal incomes and might not want to be tested if it means they could miss days of work without pay. As of Tuesday, 81 dairy herds with infected cows have been identified across nine states.\u00a0States reporting the highest numbers of affected herds are Michigan, Idaho and Texas, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The USDA issued an order in late April requiring dairy cattle to test negative for H5N1 before they can be transported across state lines, but many farmers have been reluctant to let government officials into their farms to conduct further surveillance for the virus. Dr. Eric Deeble, deputy assistant secretary for the USDA, said last week that more than 17,000 tests for H5N1 flu had been run on cattle, with the caveat that\u00a0some of the samples were pooled, so one test may represent more than one cow. But when asked to estimate whether one thousand, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of cows had been affected, Deeble said he could not, underscoring the large degree of uncertainty involved in understanding the scope of the outbreak. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring for human infections through a representative network of clinics that submit test results for respiratory viruses to the agency and through public health laboratories.\u00a0It\u2019s also hoping to conduct an epidemiological study to better understand the risk of transmission between animals and humans on farms. In a study published May 29, the CDC estimated that there was a 72% to 77% chance that current surveillance would detect one human case of H5N1 in an emergency room or urgent care clinic monthly, provided the person had symptoms similar in severity to a case of seasonal flu, and there were at least 100 cases of H5N1 in the population. \u201cWhile these findings indicate that existing flu surveillance systems are likely to detect at least one novel influenza case before the virus has spread widely, CDC is asking that health care providers remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of influenza virus infection over the summer and maintain high rates of testing,\u201d the agency said in a news release.\u00a0It also encouraged providers to forward any specimens that test positive for influenza A to public health laboratories for additional testing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/h5n1-bird-flu-in-wastewater/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

The JN.1 version of the virus, along with its descendants KP.2 and KP.3 are the most common strain of the virus that are getting people sick right now,\u00a0according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA\u2019s\u00a0committee of independent advisers\u00a0voted unanimously Wednesday to recommend that the agency tell vaccine manufacturers to update the Covid-19 shots for the fall. The FDA told the advisory committee Wednesday that studies have shown that the currently available\u00a0Covid-19 vaccines appear to be less effective against the variants that are now in circulation. When manufacturers updated their vaccines last year to better match the variants that were in circulation then, the reformulated vaccines seemed to offer better protection, the FDA said. Covid-19 cases are relatively low right now. Only 3% to 4% of people who are getting tested are positive for the virus,\u00a0the CDC told the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisers this week. By comparison during the height of the pandemic, rates were at 30%. Hospitalization rates are also currently the lowest they have been since March 2020, the CDC told the committee. Many people in the US have some protection against the virus through vaccination or prior infection, but that protection wanes over time. In just the fall and winter months last season,\u00a0Covid sent more than half a million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000 people, according to data presented at the meeting. The people most likely to get seriously ill or die were unvaccinated, studies show, and among\u00a0the children who were hospitalized, half had no underlying conditions. Covid vaccine makers Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax said their new products should be ready by the fall. The challenge may now be on how to convince people to get the Covid-19 vaccine.

{"id": "2024_06_03_health_auto-brewery-syndrome-wellness", "text": "Her breath reeked of alcohol. She was dizzy, disoriented and weak, so much so that one day she passed out and hit her head on a kitchen counter while making lunch for her school-age children. Yet not a drop of liquor had passed her lips, a fact that the 50-year-old Toronto woman and her husband told doctors for two years before someone actually believed her. \u201cShe visited her family doctor again and again and went to the emergency room seven times over two years,\u201d said Dr. Rahel Zewude, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto. Doctors found the woman\u2019s alcohol levels could range between 30 millimoles per liter and 62 millimoles per liter\u00a0\u2014 below 2 millimoles per liter\u00a0is normal, Zewude said. Alcohol levels of up to 62 millimoles per liter are extraordinarily high and would be considered life-threatening, even fatal, said Barbara Cordell, president of an advocacy association called Auto-Brewery Syndrome Information and Research, which provides patient education and does research on the unusual condition. While no one she knows has had alcohol levels reach that level, many people can function at blood alcohol levels of up to 30 millimoles per liter or 40 millimoles per liter, Cordell said in an email. \u201cI know of over 300 people diagnosed with auto-brewery syndrome and we have over 800 patients and caregivers in our private Facebook support group,\u201d said Cordell, who was not involved in the new case. \u201cPart of the mystery of this syndrome is how these people can have these extremely high levels and still be walking around and talking.\u201d All of the emergency room doctors questioned the Toronto woman\u2019s drinking habits, and she was examined by three different hospital psychiatrists who concluded that she did not meet criteria for the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \u201cShe told doctors her religion does not allow drinking, and her husband verified she did not drink,\u201d said Zewude, who treated the woman and coauthored a report on the\u00a0anonymous case\u00a0that published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until the seventh visit that an emergency room doctor finally said, \u2018I think this sounds like auto-brewery syndrome,\u2019 and sent her to a specialist,\u201d Zewude said. Dr. Fahad Malik, a gastroenterologist at United Heath Services in Binghamton, New York, who currently has 30 patients with the disorder, said in an email that being treated with disbelief and ridicule is common for patients. He was not involved in the new case study. \u201cMost patients have been disregarded as \u2018closet drinkers\u2019 or with behavior conditions prior to diagnosis,\u201d said Malik, who is also a clinical assistant instructor at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University. Extremely rare and frequently unrecognized Auto-brewery syndrome, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is an extremely rare condition in which bacteria and fungus in the gastrointestinal tract turn the carbohydrates in everyday food into ethanol. The first known case occurred in 1946 in Africa, when a 5-year-old boy\u2019s stomach ruptured for no known reason. An autopsy found his abdomen filled with a \u201cfrothy\u201d fluid smelling of alcohol. Since 1974, 20 diagnosed cases of auto-brewery syndrome have been reported in English medical literature, according to an April 2021 review. Additional reports of auto-brewery symptoms have occurred in Japan, where the condition is known as meitei-sho, or \u201calcohol auto-intoxication syndrome.\u201d Auto brewery syndrome occurs when certain species of bacteria and fungi overpopulate a person\u2019s gut microbiome, basically turning the gastrointestinal tract into a still apparatus. Scientists believe the process takes place in the small bowel and is vastly different from the normal gut fermentation in the large bowel that gives our bodies energy. While a number of pathogens can contribute, most cases are due to an overgrowth of two species of fungi: Saccharomyces and Candida. Candida lives on the body and in the mouth, digestive tract and vagina, often taking over when more beneficial bacteria are killed off by a round or two of antibiotics. A July 2013 report documented the case of a 61-year-old man\u00a0who had frequent bouts of unexplained drunkenness for years before being diagnosed with an intestinal overabundance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or brewer\u2019s yeast, the same yeast used to make beer. Many people with the syndrome can function with an enormous amount of metabolically generated alcohol in their system, sometimes only realizing it when they get in trouble with the law. A North Carolina\u00a0man in his late 40s was pulled over for what cops were convinced was drunk driving. He denied drinking despite a blood alcohol level of 0.2%, the equivalent of consuming 10 drinks an hour and about 2.5 times the legal limit. \u201cIt\u2019s not as rare as we think, it\u2019s (just) rarely diagnosed,\u201d Cordell said. \u201cI believe many people may walk around feeling foggy and just think they are tired when they might be fermenting alcohol.\u201d \u2018A metabolic storm\u2019 There are risk factors for auto-brewery syndrome. Diabetes and liver disease can play a role as can gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and short gut syndrome, in which the small intestine is damaged or shortened, Zewude said. There may even be a genetic predisposition connected to how well a person metabolizes alcohol. \u201cBut all of these things have to collide at the perfect time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires multiple risk factors interacting and creating a metabolic storm for this syndrome to emerge in an individual.\u201d For Zewude\u2019s Toronto patient, that metabolic storm began in her mid 40s when she started to have concurrent urinary tract infections, each treated with a round of antibiotics. Beneficial bacteria in her intestinal tract began to die off, allowing the fungi lying in wait to take over. That much yeast needs fuel, which it gets from carbohydrates in the diet. By the time the woman was 48, her body was turning nearly every carb she ate into alcohol. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t eat many carbs, the symptoms weren\u2019t so bad,\u201d Zewude said. \u201cBut then she might have a slice of cake or another big carbohydrate meal, which led to a rapid rise in her alcohol level. These were the times where she might be getting lunch ready for her kids and just fall asleep.\u201d Treatment for auto-brewery syndrome begins with a course of fungicides prescribed after a biopsy or colonoscopy identifies the specific pathogens that have colonized the gut, Zewude said. Starting with a broad spectrum fungicide can backfire. \u201cAntimicrobial resistance is an important part of the syndrome, because part of the reason people get this is because of the frequent antibiotic use that disrupts their gut,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to start narrowly, and then if the patient becomes resistant to that fungicide, try others.\u201d In addition to killing off the yeast, patients are expected to follow an extremely restricted low-carb diet. \u201cNo carbs would be best, but it\u2019s almost impossible to do that,\u201d Zewude said. Probiotics to build back beneficial bacteria can also help, she said. Today, the woman is no longer taking antifungal medications, but she remains on a very low-carb diet after having a relapse. As each person\u2019s experience is different, it\u2019s important that patients stay in close touch with their doctors to manage their condition, Zewude said. \u201cIn this case, the woman has a very supportive husband, who called me immediately when he began to smell alcohol on her breath again,\u201d Zewude said. \u201cFor anyone dealing with the syndrome, it\u2019s important that your spouse, friend, roommate or whatever, know the signs and symptoms and connect with physicians or bring the person to the emergency department when this occurs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/health/auto-brewery-syndrome-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_health_transgender-children-parenting-advice-wellness", "text": "Maryhope Howland gave birth to a baby she thought was a boy. But at 6 years old, the child asked her questions such as \u201cMom, am I a boy? How do you know I\u2019m a boy?\u201d \u00a0 \u201cOnce I clued in, I said, \u2018The doctors make a best guess based on your body \u2026 but only you can know, and we love you no matter what,\u2019\u201d said Howland, now co-lead for the Families United for Trans Rights, an organization of transgender kids and their loved ones. Her child\u2019s questioning didn\u2019t stop there. It marked the beginning of a yearslong evolution not just for her daughter, who came out as nonbinary at age 8 and transgender at 10. It was also a journey for Howland and her husband as they navigated what it means to be trans, ways of affirming their daughter\u2019s gender identity, their responsibilities as parents, and the grief associated with \u201cletting go of one idea of what our life is going to be,\u201d Howland said. \u201cOne of the hardest things for us to do as parents is pause when that vision gets interrupted and really listen to what our kiddos are saying to us,\u201d said Nova Bright-Williams, a trans woman who is head of internal training at the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis organization for LGBTQ+ youth. Listening to a child\u2019s experience can be difficult for many parents, regardless of their political or religious beliefs. But there\u2019s good reason to try. \u201cResearch is constantly showing that LGBTQ young people report lower rates of attempting suicide when they have access to affirming spaces, communities (and) adults,\u201d Bright-Williams said. CNN spoke with a doctor, gender rights activists and parents of trans children about what to say when a child comes out as transgender, how to address certain challenges and what receiving gender-affirming care is like. Here\u2019s what they want you to know. The coming out conversation The Rev. Rachel Cornwell\u2019s child, Evan, was assigned female at birth and had been showing aversion to the trappings of girlhood. When Cornwell asked Evan at age 4 if he were upset he was born a girl, Evan\u2019s answer shocked her: \u201cYes, Mommy. I told God when I was a star in the sky that I was a boy, but God made me a girl, and now I just have to live with it.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cIt seemed that my child knew something very deep and true about himself, and that he had an awareness of how his identity was also wrapped up in his relationship with God,\u201d Cornwell, a pastor at Dumbarton United Methodist Church in Washington, DC, and author of \u201cDaring Adventures: Helping Gender-Diverse Kids and Their Families Thrive,\u201d said via email. \u201cWe started to go to therapy as a family and just after Evan turned 6, he decided that he wanted to use male pronouns and a new name, at first just at home.\u201d Cornwell initially felt surprised, and she feared for Evan\u2019s well-being, which is common for many parents, experts said. But these discussions can also create a moment of joyful bonding for families, said Dr. Kade Goepferd, medical director of gender health at pediatric health system Children\u2019s Minnesota. It\u2019s also common for a child\u2019s revelations about gender identity to provide a sense of clarity and relief for parents who have been witnessing behavioral and mood issues for which they couldn\u2019t pinpoint a cause, Goepferd added. Other parents have always noticed their child has never quite fit into gendered expectations and feel the conversation is a confirmation. That was the case for Cornwell, whose son had preferred typical boys\u2019 clothes, hairstyles and activities since preschool. He had also started to ask when he would develop breasts and said that whenever he did, he was going to cut them off. Some parents want to support their child but worry if their gender identity is the result of a phase, or if they\u2019ll change their mind later. But the consensus of those interviewed is that even if a child changes their mind one day \u2014 which is rare \u2014 that\u2019s OK. It would be their decision resulting from the exploration of their gender identity, rather than someone trying to control it for them. \u201cThere\u2019s really no harm in ever affirming or loving our kids when they share with us who they are,\u201d Goepferd said. \u201cThe harm really can only come if we refuse to listen or acknowledge the truth that they\u2019re sharing with us and how vulnerable they\u2019re being.\u201d Rejecting them could not only cause hurt and anger but also could ruin chances of a long-term relationship. Therefore, when your child tells you they\u2019re trans, your first response should be to thank them for sharing and learning about their experience, Bright-Williams said. Say you want to get to know more about this part of who they are. Ask how long they\u2019ve known this about themselves, who else they\u2019ve shared their identity with and how you can support them. Jocelyn Rhynard\u2019s son, then 15, told his family he was nonbinary by frosting a cake he\u2019d baked with the phrase \u201cI am NB.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s awesome. Congratulations,\u2019\u201d she said. Rhyland\u2019s son later realized he is trans masculine nonbinary and uses he/him pronouns, and he\u2019s OK with Rhyland calling him her son. (Trans masculine nonbinary means someone\u2019s gender identity is nonbinary, yet they present in a typically masculine fashion with their name, style and more.) If you feel fear, concern, bias or grief, process that away from your child, said experts and parents, who also emphasized the importance of learning about transness by doing your own research. Don\u2019t rely solely on your child to guide you. Forms of gender affirmation Not every transgender person feels the need for any or all forms of changing their gender expression or their body, experts said. When older children come out, they typically already have chosen a new name, pronouns and more. But if your child isn\u2019t sure what support or changes they need, you can have conversations over time about what stylistic choices, hobbies and toys help them feel most like themselves, Bright-Williams said. Many children aren\u2019t in a rush to make these changes, experts and parents said \u2014 some experiment at home for a while before debuting a new style or name at school, for example. Once kids reach adolescence, some experience distress over their body nearing or going through pubertal changes \u2014 which can be relieved by puberty blockers that temporarily put a pause on these developments. One thing that helped Howland feel more comfortable with her daughter starting puberty blockers at age 12 was realizing that withholding them would not be a neutral decision, since puberty is permanent \u2014 which could have negative consequences for a child who doesn\u2019t identify with that body. Dealing with friends and family The response from Howland\u2019s family and friends was one of support, she said. But Rhynard, a descendant of \u201csome of the very first Mormons,\u201d didn\u2019t have that experience. \u201cIt has been difficult for our extended family, some more than others,\u201d Rhynard said. \u201cSome of the family members have been accommodating, and they have tried their best to use different pronouns, but they still get it wrong a couple years later.\u201d Rhynard and her husband have had to have some really difficult conversations in which \u201cwe\u2019ve said, \u2018Our child comes first, and we would love for you to be a part of our lives, but you can\u2019t call them by their dead name. It is too painful for them,\u2019\u201d she added. Their parenting philosophy is based on humility, learning and growing, but they realized they can\u2019t make everyone learn and grow with them. While some family relationships have become strained, Rhynard knows her responsibility is to her children. \u201cIf we centered them in the conversation about our child, we would no longer be centering our child, the most vulnerable person in our family and the person that we\u2019re lucky enough to raise,\u201d Rhynard added. For parents struggling with complicated family relationships, Goepferd recommends finding support from another parent of a transgender child, a trustworthy friend or an understanding church leader. Organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign and PFLAG have resources for how to talk about your child\u2019s identity with loved ones and their school. \u201cWe, as a society, put a lot of pressure on appearance and how other people perceive us,\u201d Bright-Williams said. But parents have the burden of shouldering that pressure so their kids don\u2019t have to. Parents have to make these sorts of decisions all the time, she added. \u201cMaybe your child is biracial and some people in your family have a problem with that,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you want them to experience that type of bias or hate, or would you protect or shelter them from that? It is up to you to create a safe and affirming space for your child.\u201d \u2018A political lightning rod\u2019 These parents have said their kids are doing well, and that their support has led to strengthened, more trustful relationships with them. Howland, Rhynard and Cornwell all said they have also changed \u2014 they\u2019re more accepting, open-minded and confident in protecting their families. \u201cShe\u2019s great,\u201d Howland said of her daughter, but \u201cwe keep waiting for the world to rear its ugly head on her. She is aware that trans people are a political lightning rod. Sometimes she says things that break my heart, like \u2018There are people who hate me,\u2019 or \u2018There are people who wish I didn\u2019t exist.\u2019\u201d Howland and her husband know they can\u2019t shield their daughter from every news story or potential bully. \u201cDesperately afraid about my child not having federal civil rights protections in this country,\u201d Howland said she even has a spreadsheet of what countries they could move to if they had to one day. To make her daughter aware and prepared, she has exposed her to the issues in as positive of a context as she can \u2014 such as the time she took her to a recent fundraiser for Sarah McBride, a Delaware-based trans woman who is the nation\u2019s first known transgender person to serve as a state senator and who is now running for Congress. \u201cI say to her that it\u2019s my job to carry that right now, not hers,\u201d Howland said. \u201cAnd that she\u2019s safe and that we will always do everything we can to protect her.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/health/transgender-children-parenting-advice-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_health_mediterranean-diet-women-early-death-risk-wellness", "text": "Women who closely followed a Mediterranean diet lived much longer than those who did not, according to a new study that followed more than 25,000 women for 25 years. \u201cFor women interested in longevity, our study shows that following a Mediterranean dietary pattern could result in about one quarter reduction in risk of death over more than 25 years with benefit for both cancer and cardiovascular mortality, the top causes of death,\u201d senior study author Dr. Samia Mora, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said in an email. The Mediterranean diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with much of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods should be avoided. Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. \u201cIn this study, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was a proxy for diet quality. Those who adhered most closely were eating more legumes, more vegetables, more fruits, less meat, and less processed meats,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. While the study was observational and thus could not show a direct cause and effect, \u201cthe finding is entirely consistent with many other studies of the now famously healthful Mediterranean diet,\u201d said Katz, who was not involved in the research. \u201cWe may be comfortable inferring that a high quality diet did, indeed, \u2018cause\u2019 a lower risk of death,\u201d Katz said in an email. Why studying women is important The Mediterranean diet has a long list of scientific kudos: The Mediterranean style of eating may reduce the risk for breast cancer,\u00a0dementia, depression,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0high cholesterol and memory loss. Adherence to the diet can also lead to stronger bones, a\u00a0healthier heart and\u00a0longer life. It\u2019s also good for healthy weight loss. In all that data, however, are few details on the specific ways the Mediterranean diet may affect women, especially long-term. That\u2019s important, experts say, because women are not little men. A woman\u2019s brain works differently on a molecular level than a man\u2019s brain. The size of a woman\u2019s heart may differ from a man\u2019s, and women have completely different symptoms for a heart attack than men. Women\u00a0metabolize alcohol and medications differently than men. And then there\u2019s the obvious difference of menarche and menopause, which creates an entire class of health risks specific to women. Every bite counts In the new study, published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open, researchers asked 25,315 healthy women participating in the Women\u2019s Health Study about their diet and collected blood and other biomarkers between 1993 and 1996. Those women were reevaluated between 2018 and 2023. Not only did closely following the Mediterranean diet cut the risk of early death by 23%, it lessened the risk of dying from cancer by 17% and dying from cardiovascular disease by 20%, the study found. \u201cThere was a graded stepwise increase in benefit \u2014 the more committed the more benefit,\u201d said lead author Shafqat Ahmad, an associate professor of molecular epidemiology at Uppsala University in Sweden, in an email. Each increase in adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a 6% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 5% reduced risk of dying from either heart disease or cancer, Ahmad said. \u201cWhat might be worth noting is that the adherence measure \u2018corrects\u2019 for distortions of the Mediterranean diet,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIn the US, simply adding olive oil to French fries might result in someone claiming to be \u2018on\u2019 the Mediterranean diet.\u201d However, the study corrects for distortions by looking at all the \u201ckey features of a \u2018true\u2019 Mediterranean diet, and thus precludes that kind of misrepresentation,\u201d Katz said. Want to start the Mediterranean diet? It\u2019s not hard to incorporate a Mediterranean style of eating into your life, experts say. Start by adding more veggies and legumes to each meal and use all kinds and colors to get the broadest range of nutrients, phytochemicals and fiber. Cook, roast or garnish them with herbs and a bit of extra-virgin olive oil. Add whole grains and fruit to every meal, but use nuts and seeds as a garnish or small snack because of their higher calorie and fat content. Cut way back on the use of red meat. Instead turn to fish and other seafood, which are often consumed at least twice a week. Get as much protein as you can from beans and other legumes. Start with one bean-based meal a week, then add two and build your nonmeat meals from there. Mix in cheese and yogurt daily to weekly in moderate portions. Chicken, pork and eggs are OK on occasion. Keep sweets for special occasions and satisfy your sweet tooth with fresh and frozen fruit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/mediterranean-diet-women-early-death-risk-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

It was 1:30 a.m.\u201d How did a dream from a retired grocery manufacturer from Golden Valley, Minnesota, become worthy of a profile in a well-known national magazine? Five years earlier, Dorff had become the first patient diagnosed with an unusual disease called rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, or RBD. There\u2019s more. Dorff\u2019s case also launched researchers on a journey that uncovered one of the earliest signs of two devastating diseases: Parkinson\u2019s and a unique form of dementia called Lewy body. Symptoms include screaming, kicking and throwing punches The discovery of RBD was made in 1982 when Dorff, after years of experiencing \u201cviolent moving nightmares,\u201d became a patient of psychiatrist and sleep specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck,\u00a0then working at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis. \u201cDuring rapid eye movement or REM sleep, the brain basically paralyzes the body so that we cannot act out our dreams,\u201d Schenck, now a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota, told CNN recently. \u201cBut Dorff was able to get up and hurt himself while dreaming, a very odd behavior. We were scratching our heads about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we put him in a sleep lab, and lo and behold, all his physical behaviors came out of REM sleep, which had never been reported before.\u201d More patients with the unusual disorder were identified, many exhibiting a disturbing set of violent symptoms, Schenck said. \u201cThey start kicking in bed, throwing punches at their bed partners, talking or screaming loudly, things like \u2018Get the hell out of here!\u2019 Then the wife has to scream really loudly to stop the episode,\u201d he said. \u201cLimb jerking, twitching, throwing out your arm, throwing punches, kicking, sitting up, standing, jumping out of bed and running. Those behaviors are very typical with RBD,\u201d he added. One 70-year-old patient, described by his wife as having a gentle nature during the day, would punch and kick her as many as five times a night, Schenck said. On one occasion, he tried to strangle his wife while dreaming of fighting off a mauling bear. Another patient, also 70, dreamed he had just taken down a deer and was going to break its neck. In reality it was his wife\u2019s neck, which he discovered when he woke up. (She quit sleeping in the same bed.) By 1986, Schenck and his team had published their first paper on the newly discovered sleep disorder. As he followed patients over the years, however, Schenck discovered something more disturbing \u2014 the behavior could be a \u201ccanary in the mine\u201d for later neurodegeneration. \u201cLosing the paralysis of REM sleep that is the basis of RBD is the earliest and strongest predictor of a later diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy body,\u201d Schenck said. RBD can affect women, too Lewy body dementia can refer to two different types of dementia:\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which both affect cognition. Parkinson\u2019s disease, however, is a slowly progressive disorder that inhibits muscle control, balance and movement \u2014 although about 4 in 5 people with Parkinson\u2019s ultimately develop dementia, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. In both Parkinson\u2019s and the two dementias, cells in and around the stalk-like stem at the bottom of the brain begin to die. In addition to breathing, swallowing, heart rate and eye and facial movements, the brain stem also controls the sleep-wake cycle. Early damage to the brain stem caused by Parkinson\u2019s can interfere with the body\u2019s innate ability to freeze the muscles while dreaming, thus allowing the body to sit up, scream, flail or otherwise act out a dream. Hallucinations, which are common in Parkinson\u2019s, can also occur, according to case studies. A 67-year-old man would see faceless, hooded or cloaked figures or animals while awake during the night. The images vanished when the man turned on a light or got up to investigate. Such nighttime behaviors can often be controlled with medication, including high doses of melatonin or the drug clonazepam, which stops seizures and relaxes tense muscles, Schenck said. \u201cEither one alone or both in combination works 80% to 90% of the time, and there are a long list of alternative treatments,\u201d said Schenck, who first published the connection between RBD and Parkinson\u2019s in February 1996. \u201cWe know the mechanism for RBD very well, and we know how to treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next step is to slow down or halt the progression to Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.\u201d At first, researchers believed RBD only affected men but then realized that women are equally impacted. \u201cJust as many women have this problem, but because it\u2019s much milder and doesn\u2019t cause injury as often, they frequently don\u2019t come in to seek help,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cYet they have lost that muscle paralysis in REM sleep, and they\u2019re just as much at risk for future Parkinson\u2019s disease as the men.\u201d A clinical trial is underway at nine medical centers in the United States, Schenck said. Called the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy Consortium, the research hopes to identify potential treatments for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and slow its progression into Parkinson\u2019s and dementia. Seek medical treatment if violent dreams begin As a child, Donald Dorff shared a room with three brothers and never had any signs of a sleep disorder. On his wedding night, however, he scared his new bride with loud talking, groaning, teeth grinding and minor movements, according to Schenck\u2019s case study. About 41 years later, however, he began to have vivid, violent dreams that he would act out. In one dream, he was riding a motorcycle when another motorcyclist tried to ram him. \u201cI decided I\u2019m going to kick his motorcycle away and at that point my wife woke me up and said, \u2018What in heavens are you doing to me?\u2019 because I was kicking the hell out of her,\u201d Dorff told Schenck during treatment. In another dream Dorff was under attack by a man with a rifle and preparing to shoot back when he suddenly woke up. \u201cI was kneeling alongside the bed with my arms extended like 1 was holding the rifle up and ready to shoot.\u201d One night Dorff dived into a bedside dresser and cut himself, Schenck said. It was then that he found Schenck\u2019s clinic and went there for treatment. While some people with RBD develop full-blown Parkinson\u2019s rather quickly, Dorff was not one of them. He died of prostate cancer, Schenck said, and was able to control his violent nighttime behavior until his death as long as he remained on medication. Dorff\u2019s case helped physicians discover an early key to two devastating disorders, allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never been a sleepwalker or sleep talker throughout your life and suddenly, after the age of 50, you start and the talking becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should be evaluated by your primary care doctor,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cYour doctor should consider neurological evaluation because that could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/health/violent-dreams-parkinsons-dementia-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_juul-vaping-products-fda", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday it had rescinded marketing denial orders\u00a0for vaping products from Juul Labs Inc., although it has not yet decided whether the products will ultimately stay on the market. Juul said Thursday its products will remain on the market during scientific review. On Thursday, the FDA said court decisions since then \u201cestablish new case law and inform the FDA\u2019s approach to product review to maintain the agency\u2019s commitment to issuing final decisions that are appropriate on both the scientific merits and the law.\u201d In 2022, the FDA\u00a0issued a marketing ban on Juul products, including devices and tobacco and menthol-flavored pods. The marketing denial order was stayed weeks later as \u201cscientific issues warranted additional review,\u201d but had not been rescinded. Juul appealed the decision and the products stayed on store shelves pending the appeal. Recission of the marketing ban \u201cis not an authorization or a denial and does not indicate whether the applications are likely to be authorized or denied,\u201d the FDA said Thursday. \u201cThe agency\u2019s continued review does not alter the fact that all e-cigarette products, including those made by JUUL, are required by law to have FDA authorization to be legally marketed.\u201d As of the end of May, the FDA says it has only authorized 23 e-cigarette products and devices after the products have undergone what the FDA says is \u201crigorous scientific review\u201d that includes toxicologic assessments. To get the green light, the products must also be appropriate by the FDA\u2019s product standard. In a statement, Juul said it\u00a0looks forward to \u201cre-engaging with the agency on a science- and evidence-based process to pursue a marketing authorization for JUUL products.\u201d The American Lung Association said on Thursday that it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the FDA\u2019s decision. \u201cThe Lung Association is deeply troubled that the marketing denial orders for Juul have been rescinded and urge FDA to issue marketing denial orders for all of its products. Juul is largely responsible for the youth e-cigarette epidemic from 2017-2019. These products and its manufacturer clearly do not meet the standard for protecting the public health. FDA must\u00a0follow the law and not permit any Juul product or other tobacco product to be sold in the U.S. prior to it receiving a premarket authorization,\u201d said Erika Sward, the association\u2019s assistant vice president of nationwide advocacy, in a statement. Juul has remained one of the most popular e-cigarette products on the market and are also among the most popular with young people. For the past decade, the FDA and US Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s annual National Youth Tobacco Survey has found that in general e-cigarettes are the most popular tobacco products among young people. In a statement, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids cited the popularity of the brand and said, \u201cthe FDA\u2019s continuing delays in reviewing Juul\u2019s marketing applications are unacceptable and harmful to America\u2019s kids.\u201d \u201cThe FDA should swiftly finish its review and again deny marketing applications for all Juul products given Juul\u2019s primary role in causing the youth e-cigarette epidemic and the continuing popularity of Juul\u2019s products among youth,\u201d Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids CEO and president Yolonda Richardson said in part in the statement. \u201cThere is no question that Juul fueled this epidemic by introducing a sleek, easy-to-hide product that was sold in appealing flavors including menthol, marketed in ways that appeal to kids, and delivered massive doses of nicotine that can quickly addict kids. Juul\u2019s history shows that its products are highly appealing to kids, and it cannot be trusted to act responsibly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/juul-vaping-products-fda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

On May 24, Dairy Manufacturers Inc. recalled 12.4-ounce containers of Crecelac Infant Powdered Goat-Milk Infant Formula with Iron 0 to 12 months, Farmalac Baby Powdered Infant Formula with Iron 0 to 12 months and Farmalac Baby Powdered Infant Formula with Iron Low Lactose 0 to 12 months because the products were not in compliance with all FDA infant formula regulations, the FDA said in a news release. The company had not submitted the products for the required premarket notification before selling them in the US, the agency said. The products are sold in stores in Texas and, the FDA said, possibly in other locations in the United States. However, as part of the FDA\u2019s ongoing investigation into the products, the agency said Friday, it found Cronobacter contamination in a sample of Crecelac formula. Limited sampling of other versions of the formula included in the recall did not turn up Cronobacter. No illnesses have been reported in connection with the recall, but Cronobacter can cause serious infections of the central nervous system and the bloodstream and can lead to life-threatening conditions like sepsis and meningitis. In 2022, four cases of Cronobacter infections in infants - including two who died - triggered a large recall of infant formula that compounded a nationwide shortage. In general, infants who get sick with Cronobacter can go on to develop brain abscesses, motor development problems, developmental delays and even death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Early symptoms of infection can include jaundice, abnormal body movements, irritability, poor feeding and a change in body temperature. The FDA said it is working with Dairy Manufacturers and its distributors to make sure that the recall is carried out fully. Parents and caregivers are advised not to give these particular brands to their infants, the FDA says. Those looking for goat milk infant formulas can find options that have completed the required premarket notification process and speak with their health care providers about possible alternatives.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/crecelac-baby-formula-cronobacter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2022_07_18_health_how-to-stay-cool-without-air-conditioning-wellness", "text": "Whether you\u2019re without power, enduring extreme heat or trying to save money, there are ways to feel comfortable without artificial cooling.  Heat can foster fun summer activities, but the body shouldn\u2019t be too hot for too long, as too much heat can harm your brain and other organs, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Sweating is the body\u2019s natural cooling system, but when that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s increased risk for developing the heat-related illness hyperthermia \u2014 signs of which include heat cramps, heat edema and heat stroke. Heat combined with high humidity exacerbates this risk, since the air\u2019s saturation level makes sweat accumulate on the skin, preventing the body from cooling naturally.     Staying cool can be done by using some basic supplies and knowing how to manipulate your home to control its temperatures. Here are 14 methods for doing so.   Stay hydrated When you\u2019re hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer emeritus in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.  The temperature of the water doesn\u2019t matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can\u2019t do that without enough moisture, since the body cools itself by sweating.  Take a cold shower or bath Taking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature, Porter said. For an extra cool blast, try peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that tell your body something you\u2019re eating or feeling is cold.  Use cold washrags on your neck or wrists  Place a cold washrag or ice bags (packs) on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you\u2019ll cool down more quickly.  Use box fans  Place box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you\u2019re spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.  If the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, opening the windows on both sides of the house during those times can facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. If you do this, you can opt to use or not use the fans, but the fans would help cool the house faster, Porter said. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again. Just resting near a fan would reduce your body temperature as well.  Close your curtains or blinds If you have windows that face the sun\u2019s direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to \u201ckeep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up (the) inside,\u201d Porter said.  You could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.  If you do turn the air conditioning on, don\u2019t set it below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, founder of Spaces Alive, an Australia-based design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.  \u201cIt just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,\u201d she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.  Sleep in breathable linens Cotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.  The lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That\u2019s because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.  Sleep in the basement  If you can\u2019t sleep through the night because you\u2019re too hot, try sleeping somewhere besides your bedroom, if that\u2019s an option. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.  Don\u2019t refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing  Common advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out to wear while you sleep. But this isn\u2019t a good idea, Porter said.  Because of \u201cthe amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019d have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d  Close the doors of unused rooms  If no one\u2019s using a room that doesn\u2019t have vents or registers, close the door to that area to keep the cool air confined to only occupied areas of the house.  Use the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom  Flip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.  Install energy-efficient light bulbs Incandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs, then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.  Switching light bulbs can save money but won\u2019t reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. However, if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you\u2019re sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.  Cook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside Oven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.  Enjoy frozen treats Eating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don\u2019t go overboard on the sugar if you\u2019re overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.  \u201cSugar would run your metabolism up and you\u2019d start feeling internally hot,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.\u201d  Research what your state offers If you\u2019ve tried everything and still can\u2019t beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.  Depending on your state, some cooling centers \u2014 air-conditioned public facilities where people might go for relief during extremely hot weather \u2014 may be open and taking precautions to ensure they\u2019re as safe as possible. You could start by checking with your local utility offices, as they would know who is offering certain programs, Porter recommended.

{"id": "2024_06_04_health_internet-addiction-teen-brain-activity-wellness", "text": "Teens who spend lots of time on social media have complained of feeling like they can\u2019t pay attention to more important things like homework or time with loved ones. A new study has possibly captured that objectively, finding that for teens diagnosed with internet addiction, signaling between brain regions important for controlling attention, working memory and more was disrupted. The findings are from a review, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Mental Health, of 12 neuroimaging studies of a few hundred adolescents ages 10 to 19 between 2013 and 2022. \u201cThe behavioural addiction brought on by excessive internet use has become a rising source of concern since the last decade,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. The criteria for clinical diagnosis of internet addiction in the included studies were \u201cone\u2019s persistent preoccupation with the internet, withdrawal symptoms when away from the internet, and sacrificing relationships (for) time to spend on the internet over an extended period of time (e.g., 12 months),\u201d said Max Chang, first author of the study and outreach case manager at the nonprofit Peninsula Family Service in San Francisco, via email. \u201cThe pattern of behaviour results in significant impairment or distress in the individual\u2019s life.\u201d Given the changing state of adolescent brains compared with adults, the authors felt understanding the impacts of internet addiction on the teenage participants\u2019 brains was vital. When participants clinically diagnosed with internet addiction engaged in activities governed by the brain\u2019s executive function network \u2014 behaviors requiring attention, planning, decision-making and impulse control \u2014 those brain regions showed substantial disruption in their ability to work together, compared to those in peers without internet addiction. The authors think such signaling changes could suggest these behaviors can become more difficult to perform, potentially influencing development and well-being. \u201cWhile this paper presents a straightforward systematic review suggesting that there are associations between functional connectivity in the brain and internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 there are a number of fundamental limitations to be aware of that are critical to any interpretation,\u201d Dr. David Ellis, a behavioral scientist at the University of Bath\u2019s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour, said in a news release. \u201cCause and effect cannot be drawn from these studies,\u201d said Ellis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cSecond, the focus on functional connectivity comes at the expense of any critique about the key measure of interest. Specifically, internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 which was initially conjured up by (psychiatrist) Ivan K. Goldberg in 1995 as a joke. \u201cToday, the conceptualisation and measurement of internet \u2018addiction\u2019 is neither universally accepted and certainly not diagnosable using the survey instruments used in the studies included as part of the review,\u201d Ellis added. \u201cSimilarly, the enormity of activities that the internet allows for immediately makes this definition somewhat redundant.\u201d In the United States, internet addiction isn\u2019t included in the DSM-V \u2014 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the US. It does, however, list internet gaming disorder. All the studies the authors reviewed were all conducted in Asia and consisted of mostly male participants. China was the first country to declare internet addiction a \u201cpublic health crisis.\u201d \u201cSuch definitions, despite being widely critiqued, also have a tendency to move the focus away from genuine online harm and towards a conclusion that suggests the removal of technology from people\u2019s lives will be helpful,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSolid evidence to suggest that removing the internet brings any tangible benefits has not been forthcoming.\u201d Additionally, all studies were conducted at one point in time, said Dr. Eva Telzer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cGiven that there are no longitudinal data,\u201d Telzer said, \u201cit is very possible that adolescents who have underlying differences in brain connectivity patterns are more vulnerable to developing internet addiction.\u201d Overcoming internet addiction If internet addiction is what caused the disruption in participants\u2019 brain signaling, the reason why may have to do with neural pathways related to addiction, said Dr. Smita Das, an addiction psychiatrist and clinical associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine in California. Das wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The functional connectivity patterns in participants\u2019 brains are, in fact, in line with those observed in people with substance addictions, said Dr. Caglar Yildirim, an associate teaching professor of computer science at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston. Yildirim wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cOverall, the mechanisms underlying internet addiction are more like an emerging pattern than a finished picture,\u201d Chang said. \u201cA lot of causality between what happens in the brain and what is displayed through behavior is still being understood. As of now, observation using biomarkers such as functional connectivity helps bridge that gap.\u201d\u00a0 If you\u2019re wondering if your teen struggles with internet addiction, behaviors such as withdrawing from relationships are a telltale sign, Chang said. \u201cSimilar to substance and gambling disorders, internet addiction rewires the brain, making it harder to resist internet related stimuli,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, unlike gambling or substance usage, the internet is an important part of our lives. Balancing the usefulness and dangers of the internet is a field that is very crucial going forward in adolescent development.\u201d Find what keeps your teen off the internet and help them do more of it, Yildirim suggested. You can also talk with your child\u2019s doctor to see if behavioral strategies can work, Das suggested. Therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness and motivational interviewing are helpful. The latter, which originated in the field of addiction treatment, is a counseling method that aims to increase a patient\u2019s motivation for, and commitment to, behavioral change by eliciting and exploring the patient\u2019s own reasons for wanting change. In severe cases, a psychiatrist may suggest medication to treat certain types of technology addiction, she added.

{"id": "2024_06_09_health_therapy-benefits-happiness-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Therapy often gets a bad rap. In old movies, it\u2019s often depicted with a patient lying on a couch, talking to a stony-faced, note-taking analyst who never speaks. Critics sometimes derisively describe it as navel-gazing. Therapists are offhandedly called \u201cshrinks,\u201d a throwback to the ancient practice \u00a0of shrinking the head of a conquered enemy. And let\u2019s face it, the practice still carries a stigma for many; acknowledging you see a therapist is akin to admitting you are weak or \u201ccrazy,\u201d especially in some professions. When it comes to physical health, most of us don\u2019t hesitate too long to get help for injuries such as a broken bone or a burn. But when it comes to emotional health, there often is a delay, possibly resulting in a bigger mental health crisis. \u201cPeople don\u2019t come to therapy until they\u2019re having the equivalent of an emotional heart attack,\u201d psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently. Gottlieb is the author of \u201cMaybe You Should Talk to Someone,\u201d a cohost of the \u201cDear Therapists\u201d podcast\u00a0and the writer of the weekly \u201cDear Therapist\u201d advice column for The Atlantic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this hierarchy of pain with our physical health. We don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I fell down and broke my wrist, but I don\u2019t have stage 4 cancer, so I\u2019m just going to let my wrist hang out there and I\u2019m not going to get a cast.\u2019 And we have a very different attitude about emotional health,\u201d she said. Hesitancy over therapy may be due to its stigma, a skepticism about its worth, the cost in time and money, or just the uncertainty about how it works \u2014 and this reluctance to discuss mental health is pretty widespread. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center released in May, 31% of respondents said they would only be somewhat comfortable talking to a therapist about their mental health, while 18% said they\u2019d be either not too or not at all comfortable doing so. \u201cThere are so many misconceptions about therapy, and I think that often prevents people from going,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c(One) is that you\u2019re going to go in, you\u2019re going to download the problem of the week, and you\u2019re going to leave, and you\u2019re basically just complaining and getting validated for your complaints. \u201cAnd that is not what therapy is. We like to say that insight is the booby prize of therapy, that you can have all the insight in the world, but if you don\u2019t make changes out in the world, the insight is useless,\u201d she said, noting that most therapy takes place in the week between sessions \u201cwhere you are actually taking what you\u2019ve learned and doing something different.\u201d Taking action not only rewires your brain, but it can ultimately result in a happier you. \u201cDo they experience joy more? Yes. Are they generally more content in their lives? Do they feel less stressed, less sad, more able to manage when things don\u2019t go well, less reactive when they\u2019re in a situation that maybe is relationally difficult for them, more able to find sort of inner peace? Yes,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. I think that when people say, \u2018Oh, I just want to be happy.\u2019 All of the things that I just described bring you happiness.\u201d You can listen to the full episode here. How can therapy improve your happiness? Here are Gottlieb\u2019s top five reasons. 1. Therapy offers perspective Ideally, therapy is impartial. \u201cTherapy is like getting a really good second opinion on your life, from someone who\u2019s not already in your life,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWhen we try to get advice or guidance from people who are close to us, it\u2019s hard for them to separate out the relationship they have with us and to be able to see the issue objectively.\u201d Our friends, she said, give us \u201cidiot compassion\u201d \u2014 they loyally validate our feelings often without pointing out our own role in any conflicts. Therapists are trained to give us \u201cwise compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hold up a mirror to you, and we help you to see something about what is getting you stuck, that maybe you haven\u2019t been willing or able to see. We help you to see something that you can actively change,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAnd I think that there\u2019s something so empowering about that, and it\u2019s so translatable to many different relationships.\u201d 2. Therapy is a safe space In therapy, you can explore seemingly frivolous subjects. \u201cTherapy can make you happier because it helps you to really be intentional about what you want in your life. And I don\u2019t think we have a lot of spaces to talk about that,\u201d Gottlieb said, referring to concepts such as life satisfaction. \u201cSometimes people think, \u2018Well, I have a roof over my head and food on the table. So this whole thing about meaning and fulfillment \u2014 I can\u2019t really talk about that,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIn therapy, you have a space where you can really ask those hard questions, and nobody\u2019s judging you and nobody\u2019s trying to tell you, \u2018Well, you have enough already.\u2019\u201d 3. Therapy helps to connect with others Modern times have created an epidemic of loneliness; the pandemic only made it worse. Therapy can be a bridge. \u201cWe do have this epidemic of loneliness. And I think a lot of people want deeper connections, and they want more meaningful connections, but they don\u2019t know how to go about it,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think that we all grew up with certain ideas about what relationships look like, what friendships look like. (But) we aren\u2019t always aware of the ways in which we may be preventing ourselves from having more meaningful relationships.\u201d For example, many people avoid conflict or seek it out, while others have social anxiety or never learned the necessary social skills. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know how to reach out even if we want to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think in therapy, you learn how to create connection in your life, which is one of the most influential factors when it comes to happiness.\u201d 4. Therapy helps us see the big picture Therapy helps people see that they are part of larger forces, and not simply individuals who formed with no external influences. \u201cWe sometimes feel that the problems are sort of \u2018out there\u2019 \u2014 we don\u2019t really know that we are part of that dynamic, part of that dance,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c(Therapy) helps you to process that unfinished business.\u201d She pointed out that our parents were human and often did what they learned from their parents. \u201cAnd (therapy is) a place where you can say, \u2018What is some of this old stuff that I\u2019m carrying around with me that I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m carrying around?\u2019\u201d she said, noting that once you understand how your history influences how you navigate through the world, you can change patterns. \u201cIt makes you happier because you\u2019re not carrying around the burden of something that happened a long time ago,\u201d she said. 5. Therapy helps us control our story Our life is a narrative, and therapy can help us make sense of it. \u201cWhen you think about our lives \u2026 they\u2019re really stories. (Therapy) helps you clarify your story and take authorship of your story,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt helps you to take authorship of your own life. \u2026 If I\u2019m creating this one limited time that I have here \u2014 this one life that I have here \u2014 why am I letting all these other people write my story for me, and how can I really take ownership of my story?\u201d We hope these five tips help you understand the benefits of therapy.

The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other. Doing so should allow the satellites to collect data about phenomena that take place on a short time scale and require frequent measurements \u2014 such as how the amount of cloud cover affects the temperature on Earth beneath it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/world/nasa-prefire-mission-launch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_fda-vaccine-advisers-covid-shot", "text": "Another new version of the Covid-19 vaccine will probably be coming this fall. The US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s\u00a0committee of independent advisers\u00a0voted unanimously Wednesday to recommend that the agency tell vaccine manufacturers to update the Covid-19 shots so they will be more effective against the JN.1 lineage of the coronavirus. The committee voted on the question, \u201cFor the 2024-2025 Formula of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., does the committee recommend a monovalent JN.1-lineage vaccine composition?\u201d All 16 of the advisers voted \u201cyes.\u201d The decision now goes to the full FDA. If the agency agrees with its advisory committee, the new shot will be a monovalent vaccine, offering protection against one coronavirus variant. Some previous vaccines have been bivalent, meaning they were formulated to protect against two variants. There are a few virus variants in circulation now, but they are relatively similar. JN.1 and its descendants KP.2 and KP.3 are the versions of the virus that are most common in the US right now, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA told the advisory committee Wednesday that studies have shown that currently available Covid-19 vaccines appear to be less effective against the variants that are now in circulation. When manufacturers updated their vaccines last year to better match the variants that were in circulation then, it seemed to offer better protection. \u201cMatch does matter somewhat,\u201d said Dr. Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cJN.1 has continued to evolve, and it makes it somewhat difficult to pick the particular specific strain to be used\u201d this year, he told the committee. Because of manufacturing timelines, experts have to make predictions now if they want a new vaccine for fall. This is what the FDA\u2019s committee has done for the past couple of years, and \u201cI think it\u2019s worked pretty well,\u201d Weir said. Covid-19 cases are relatively low right now. Only 3% to 4% of people who are getting tested are positive for the virus, said Dr. Natalie Thornburg, acting chief of the Laboratory Branch of the Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC. By comparison, at the peak of the Omicron surge in late 2021, test positivity rates were at 30%. Hospitalization rates are also the lowest they have been since March 2020, Thornburg said. Many people have some protection against the disease through vaccination or because they\u2019ve had Covid before. People who got the current Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 which was updated last fall \u2013 have protection from serious disease and death across all age groups, but as with past formulations, that protection wanes over time, Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles, vaccine effectiveness program lead with the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the committee. The advisers agreed that more people need to get updated vaccines. Only about 25% of adults have gotten the most recent shot, according to a presentation to the committee. In only the fall and winter months last season, Covid sent more than half a million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000, according to data presented at the meeting. The people most likely to get seriously ill or die were unvaccinated, Link-Gelles said, and among the children who were hospitalized, half had no underlying conditions. \u201cThis, I think, emphasizes the need for vaccination regardless of underlying condition, status or age,\u201d she said. The Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers told the committee that they have done some work to prepare for the FDA\u2019s decision on the composition of the vaccine. Animal and lab studies show that shots made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax that target the JN.1 variant seem to work well and are safe, the companies said. Novavax said its updated shot would need to be the JN.1 version because its protein vaccine takes about six months to make, and that\u2019s the version it has been working on. The company said it could get the shot to US warehouses by August. Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines can be developed more quickly, and those companies said they could have either a JN.1 shot or a KP.2 shot ready for fall. Moderna said it could supply the US market by mid-August, and Pfizer said its shot could be immediately ready upon approval. The committee discussed but did not vote on whether the shot should match JN.1 or KP.2. Most of the members preferred JN.1 so Americans would have an option to get an mRNA vaccine or a more traditional protein-based vaccine. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told the committee that the FDA will take these recommendations into consideration as it makes its final choice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/fda-vaccine-advisers-covid-shot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_health_maternal-deaths-high-income-nations", "text": "The United States continues to have a higher rate of women dying in pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum compared with all other high-income nations, even despite recent declines in the US maternal death rate, a new report shows. There were about 22 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in the United States in 2022, the most recent year for which data was available. That rate was more than double, sometimes triple, those seen in most other high-income countries that year, according to the report released Tuesday by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on health care-related issues. And the rate of maternal deaths among Black women in the United States remains even higher, at nearly 50 deaths per 100,000 live births, the new report shows. Meanwhile, half of the high-income nations in the new report had fewer than 5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, and one country recorded zero maternal deaths: Norway. Unlike Norway and some other peer nations, \u201cthe US has a maternal care workforce shortage problem, which is only supposed to get worse,\u201d said\u00a0Munira\u00a0Gunja, lead author of the report and senior researcher at the International Program in Health Policy and Practice Innovations at the Commonwealth Fund. In the United States, she noted, there is\u00a0limited access to midwives, who provide support to a patient from the prenatal period through postpartum. \u201cWe have an under-supply of midwives, and midwives are underutilized, whereas in most other countries, midwives greatly outnumber ob-gyns. They\u2019re part of their health care systems. Midwifery care is not integrated enough into our system,\u201d Gunja said. In the United States, \u201cthere\u00a0are several barriers to\u00a0getting midwifery care, and other countries just don\u2019t have that. They\u2019re able to make sure that every woman has access to care, whether it be in some cases an ob-gyn and in most cases a midwife,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the US, we\u2019re the only country in this analysis without a universal health system. Nearly 8 million women of reproductive age are without health insurance.\u201d In Norway, which has universal health coverage, prenatal care is accessible free of charge, and high-risk pregnancies are effectively identified. US \u2018is still such an outlier\u2019 Researchers at the Commonwealth Fund analyzed maternal mortality data from 14 high-income countries: Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. The data, which came from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, showed that the top three nations with the highest maternal death rate were the United States, Chile and New Zealand. Chile and New Zealand each recorded about 14 deaths per 100,000 live births. The three nations with the lowest maternal death rate were Norway with zero, Switzerland with a rate of 1 death per 100,000 live births and Sweden with about 3 deaths per 100,000 live births. During the Covid-19 pandemic, maternal death rates increased in Australia, Japan, the Netherlands and the US, according to the report, which notes that the increase may have been due to a rise in Covid-related infections, complications worsened by the virus or delays or decreased access to care at the time. More recently, maternal death rates have started to decline in Chile, Norway and the US. The US maternal mortality rate fell from 32.9 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021 to 22.3 per 100,000 in 2022, according to data from the CDC. \u201cIt is encouraging to see fewer maternal deaths in the U.S. in 2022, however the U.S. is still such an outlier, and the racial disparities are profoundly disturbing,\u201d Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, senior vice president for advancing health equity at the Commonwealth Fund, said in a news release. \u201cIt is time to center equity by diversifying the workforce and addressing head on the racial inequities in health care quality and access,\u201d she said. \u201cNow is the time to prioritize what we know is already working well in other countries: expanded health insurance coverage, stronger workforce and support systems, and paid maternity leave.\u201d The new report points to the US health care system, policy differences and maternity care deserts \u2013 where residents have limited or no access to maternity health care \u2013 as among the factors driving the high US maternal mortality rate. The US and Canada have the lowest overall supply of midwives and ob-gyns to care for pregnant and postpartum mothers, with only 16 and 13 providers per 1,000 live births respectively, according to the new report. In Canada, the maternal death rate is estimated to be about 8 deaths per 100,000 live births. More than 2.2 million US women of childbearing age \u2013 15 to 44 \u2013 live in maternity care deserts, a report by the nonprofit March of Dimes found in 2022. And last year, a separate analysis found that hospitals in a 10th of US counties have lost their childbirth units in the past five years. Midwives \u201ccould help address maternity workforce shortages in the U.S., where nearly half of counties lack a single ob-gyn. An estimated 8,000 more ob-gyns are needed to meet demand \u2014 a number that may rise to 22,000 by 2050,\u201d according to the new report. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period, up to 42 days after giving birth, and US women are least likely to have postpartum home visits, according to the new report. All the countries in the report, apart from the US, guarantee at least one home visit within a week postpartum. On the state level, only some Medicaid programs in the US cover these visits. \u201cThe World Health Organization recommends at least four health contacts in the first six weeks following birth, yet two of five U.S. women \u2014 more often than not younger, low-income, and uninsured \u2014 skip their one postpartum check-up,\u201d according to the new report. In the first week postpartum, the most common contributors to maternal deaths were severe bleeding, high blood pressure and infection, while cardiomyopathy \u2013 a heart muscle disease \u2013 was the leading cause of deaths later in the postpartum period, according to the new report. The US also stands alone as the only high-income country where there is no federally mandated paid leave policy for postpartum mothers, according to the new report. US women are less likely to have guaranteed paid leave compared with women in other high-income nations, where at least 14 weeks of paid leave from work is mandated. \u201cMaternal deaths are a preventable problem, and this problem can be solved. A lot of countries have been able to figure out ways to make it so that all women are in safe hands when it comes to having a baby and after giving birth. We need to extend that to women in the US as well,\u201d Gunja said. \u201cWe know most deaths are during the postpartum period \u2013 so making sure we have federally mandated paid leave, making sure we make it easy for women to get postpartum care, which means having home visits and not making women go to the doctor.\u201d A need for maternal health equity Racial disparities in maternal death rates persist not only in the United States but in other parts of the world where some women have less access to postpartum support, according to the new report. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, for example, Black women are four times more likely to die than white women are. In Australia, Aboriginal women are about twice as likely as non-Aboriginal women to die from maternal complications,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cOur findings suggest that an undersupply of maternity providers, especially midwives, and lack of access to comprehensive postpartum support, including maternity care coverage and mandated paid maternity leave, are contributing factors,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBecause both these factors disproportionately affect women of color, centering equity in any future policy changes will be a key to addressing the crisis.\u201d The Commonwealth Fund\u2019s report \u201chighlights the need to have enhanced maternal health care and maternal health equity in the US,\u201d said\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Tochi\u00a0Iroku-Malize, a family physician in Long Island, New York, and board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, who was not involved in the new report. \u201cFor us in family medicine, we know that we do play a crucial role in providing the obstetric care throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, which is needed, and maternal health care cannot stop after a patient gives birth,\u201d she said, calling on her US colleagues to watch out for maternal health complications \u2013 such as inflammation of the heart muscle or mental health conditions \u2013 in their postpartum patients, as the majority of maternal deaths occur during that time. \u201cA postpartum patient\u2019s body is still going through immense physical, hormonal and emotional changes that you really cannot overlook,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our training as family physicians, it helps us to screen and address the full spectrum of physical, emotional and social needs during pregnancy and the postpartum period.\u201d Adding more birth workers to the maternal health care workforce remains an important component and major need, said Dr. Michelle Owens, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Jackson,\u00a0Mississippi, who was not involved in the new report. \u201cBut we also need to ensure we have systems in place to facilitate escalation of care when needed so that each birthing person has access to the appropriate care in a timely manner. Timely diagnosis and treatment of complications are essential to ensuring the overall health and safety of our mothers and their children,\u201d Owens, a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, wrote in an email. \u201cACOG recommends that expectant mothers engage as active partners in their care, attend their scheduled appointments during and after pregnancy, and consider pregnancy planning in order to optimize pregnancy outcomes,\u201d she added. \u201cFinally, patients need to feel empowered to voice their concerns to their healthcare\u00a0providers, and for their providers to listen to their concerns and work collaboratively with patients for resolution of their\u00a0concerns.\u201d The report joins several other studies that have highlighted the United States\u2019 high maternal mortality rate, said Dr. Christopher Zahn, interim CEO and chief of clinical practice and health equity and quality for ACOG. \u201cDespite capturing different time periods and using different methodologies, what we can confidently take away from these reports is that the number of maternal deaths in this country is still unacceptably high,\u201d Zahn, who was not involved in the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s latest report, wrote in an email. \u201cIn 2016, the public was surprised to learn from a widely publicized study in The Lancet that the United States had the highest rate of maternal mortality compared to other developed countries. The Commonwealth Fund report shows that nearly a decade later this is still the case. This is obviously disheartening news, but we also must acknowledge that, despite the collective effort put toward improving maternal health outcomes, we have faced tremendous setbacks,\u201d Zahn said, referring to disruptions in access to care due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the overturning of Roe v. Wade and ongoing health inequities resulting in racial and ethnic disparities. \u201cThe areas of weakness in our policies and systems have been longstanding pain points and are clearly all contributors to the poor maternal health outcomes we are experiencing today,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cACOG will continue its work in improving quality and safety in maternal health care, educating its members on the necessity of eliminating racism and bias in medicine and advocating for policies that are supportive of both clinicians and patients in an effort to improve outcomes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/maternal-deaths-high-income-nations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_mpox-vaccine-lgbtq-pride-month", "text": "As the LGBTQ+ community gears up for Pride celebrations this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hopes people will get more than just their rainbow gear and sunscreen ready. The agency is urging more people \u2013 particularly some gay and bisexual men \u2013 to get the mpox vaccine. The US Department of Health and Human Services plans to be at dozens of Pride and community events across the country to remind people that mpox is still a problem in the United States, but with vaccination, it doesn\u2019t have to be. Anyone can get sick with mpox, the painful and sometimes deadly disease formerly known as monkeypox. But in the global outbreak that started in 2022, certain members of the LGBTQ+ community are considered especially vulnerable. According to recent case reports, 90% of those who got mpox in the US during this outbreak who reported their sexual orientation were men who identified as gay or bisexual. And nearly all of those who got sick were unvaccinated. \u201cFor folks who have not yet gotten two doses of the Jynneos vaccine, it\u2019s really important for protecting them from this disease,\u201d said Alex Tuttle, an epidemiologist with the Poxvirus and Rabies Branch of the CDC. \u201cAbout a quarter of the population that we believe is at risk is currently vaccinated, so we really want to push that up, especially as we\u2019re going into these summer months where risk might be heightened a little bit.\u201d Mpox is a viral disease that can spread easily between people and from infected animals. It can spread through close contact such as touching, kissing or sex, as well as through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles, according to the World Health Organization. Symptoms include a fever, a painful rash, headache, muscle and back pain, low energy and enlarged lymph nodes. For decades, the disease had largely been found in Central and West Africa, but in the 2022 outbreak, cases also began spreading in Europe and North America. Case numbers in the US remain stable and are nowhere near as high as in 2022, when WHO declared the outbreak in North America and Europe a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But there were about 59 new cases a week reported in the US as of the end of April, according to a report published in May, which Tuttle co-authored. By comparison, at the height of the outbreak in 2022, there were about 3,000 new cases reported per week in the US. Another report published by the CDC Thursday looked at the kinds of patients who were seeking care at their local emergency room for mpox between June and December of last year. Of the 196 patients with rashes that doctors suspected could be mpox, three actually were infected. All three were gay or bisexual men who who engaged in sex with one or more partners that they initially met through dating apps. None had been vaccinated. Other studies have shown that the vaccine, which is now commercially available, can help keep people safe. A recent report confirmed that two doses of the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic are highly effective in preventing many mpox cases. If someone who was vaccinated did get sick, the vaccine can reduce the severity of symptoms. There have been scattered reports of infections among vaccinated people, including one cluster in May 2023 in Chicago, but these cases are rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases, the CDC said. Mpox isn\u2019t just an uncomfortable inconvenience. About 10% of people who got sick with mpox in the US in the latest outbreak were hospitalized, and five have died since October. People with compromised immune systems, particularly those with advanced HIV, have more severe infections, the CDC says. Another reason to get the vaccine is the threat of a deadlier version of the virus known as clade I, which carries a case fatality rate of up to 10%, compared with 0.1% to 3.6% for clade II, the version currently in circulation in the US. This version of the disease, the CDC said, is also more transmissible. It hasn\u2019t made its way to the US yet, but it is at the heart of an outbreak that the CDC is monitoring in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tuttle said the Jynneos vaccine should protect against clade I as well as clade II. \u201cThe measures that we have right now, both the vaccine and any of the antivirals, are expected to work on both clade I and clade II of the virus, should it come here,\u201d Tuttle said. Brian Hujdich, executive director of the\u00a0National Coalition for LGBT Health, said his organization and others will continue to work hard to encourage mpox vaccination. \u201cWith all the Pride events over the summer and just being summertime, there\u2019s going to be more interaction. And we\u2019ve seen already that there has been an increase in Virginia and in New York City and in some other locations,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it might not be in numbers that get a lot of attention, but even a small increase can be a preamble to an outbreak.\u201d The CDC is working with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, local organizations and community health partners on what it calls the Summer of Pride initiative, which includes a campaign to remind people that although mpox case numbers have declined significantly, the threat has not disappeared. \u201cI do think some people are surprised that it is still a problem,\u201d said Adrianna Boulin, director of racial equity, social justice and community engagement at Fenway Health, an organization that advocates for and delivers equitable care focused on the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cLast year, we had such a robust program of getting education and information out to people, and we saw mpox rates decline initially, so everyone is surprised, like \u2018wow, this is still an issue.\u2019 It\u2019s important for everyone to know about it, because it can impact all of us.\u201d Boulin, who is also president of Boston Pride of the People, the group that puts on that city\u2019s Pride parade and celebrations on June 8, said there is a health corner at the festival where a number of organizations will talk about the programs and services they offer, including information about the mpox vaccine. Fenway had been running mpox vaccination clinics when the outbreak started, but as the number of cases declined, fewer people were showing up, so it now offers the vaccine by appointment only. Across the country, doses have become much more readily available than early in the outbreak, when people had to stand in long lines at special clinics. Now, pharmacies and many regular medical providers have the vaccine. In addition to the big Pride festival, Fenway Health plans to be at several other LGBTQ events, Boulin said, and at each, workers will talk about mpox. \u201cPeople are excited that they\u2019re outside at these events and they\u2019re motivated, they\u2019re open, they\u2019re listening, and so those are all recipes for really getting information out to folks that they need to help their health,\u201d Boulin said. Key West Pride, which is one of the first of the year and runs from from June 5 to 9, said it will also have a visible health organization presence that will offer educational materials at its Street Fair/Dance Party about mpox and the benefits of the mpox vaccine. The local department of health also provides resources on mpox and vaccination, he said. Hujdich said an important message that health organizations will want to emphasize is that mpox vaccines provide not only protection but real peace of mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be worried about being in contact with people if you\u2019ve been vaccinated,\u201d Hujdich said, \u201cSo it gives you the freedom to enjoy and be proud during Pride.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/mpox-vaccine-lgbtq-pride-month/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

Bright and contrasting colors stand out more clearly against the water, making it easier for lifeguards and parents to spot a child quickly, especially in an emergency situation,\u201d Bernard Fisher, director of health and safety for the American Lifeguard Association, said in an email. \u201cPeople should avoid swimsuits in light blue, gray, or green as they can blend with the water and pool surroundings, making it difficult to spot a child. We recommend bright and contrasting colors such as neon yellow, orange, pink, and bright red,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cThese colors are highly visible both underwater and on the surface. Swimsuit colors are not talked about enough in public safety, said Wyatt Werneth, a coastal lifeguard in Florida and spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association. \u201cThe bright clothes are something that we\u2019ve identified as being a game-changer. If you have the same colors of the water or the environment, you\u2019re going to blend in,\u201d Werneth said while patrolling Cocoa Beach. \u201cWe consider this also with missing children. Not only the fact that the bright colors are going to help us locate them in a pool environment or the beach, but one of the things that lifeguards do more than anything else \u2013 you think we go out and wrestle with sharks and save people from rip currents \u2013 but we also look for missing children at the beach,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re wearing a bright color, and if you take a picture of those children before, then we\u2019ll have a picture and know what to look for. So, you can help us \u2013 not only can drowning be prevented, missing persons\u2019 [cases] can be prevented as well.\u201d Swimsuit color test A company called Alive Solutions, which specializes in water safety, has found in two separate experiments that certain swimsuit colors are easier to spot in a swimming pool or open water, such as a lake. In tests, the company\u2019s water safety experts placed swimsuits of various colors in swimming pools and lakes to determine how visible they may be. The tests were conducted independently and not published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cIn our main testing we did 14 different colors,\u201d Natalie Livingston, co-founder and owner of Alive Solutions, said in an email. \u201cWater is not like looking through air.\u00a0Even the tiniest bit of surface agitation, glare, or movement in the water can cause objects and people to become distorted,\u201d she said. \u201cVisibility in water can be increased or decreased depending on the color of a swimsuit or clothing.\u201d Livingston, who has been a lifeguard for more than 25 years, remembers watching her children at the pool one afternoon with other parents and that\u2019s when she realized that some children wearing either dark- or pastel-colored swimsuits seemed to visibly disappear in the water. Her colleagues and she later decided to conduct the tests from 2019 through last year. In a swimming pool, with a light-colored bottom, the company\u2019s tests showed that neon pink and neon orange appeared to be the most visible. Darker colors showed up against the light pool bottom, but could often be dismissed for shadows, leaves or dirt. White and light blue swimsuits were not as visible and seemed to disappear completely in the pool. \u201cLight colors or blues tend to look like glare spots or cloud reflections, or completely blend in with the environment,\u201d Livingston said in the email. In 18 inches of lake water, the tests showed that bright neon colors \u2013 including neon orange, yellow and green \u2013 were most visible against the lake bottom, but neon pink did not perform well. White swimsuits appeared more due to reflecting light, but not as much as the bright neon colors. All other colors were not very visible. Overall, Livingston said, neons won for visibility in all environments. \u201cWe have heard from so many parents that said they had their kid in a bright-colored swimsuit and the color caught their attention out of the corner of their eye and they responded to prevent a drowning event,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cOf course, the color of the suit doesn\u2019t matter if no one is supervising effectively, but it can and does help in partnership with effective supervision and other layers of water safety prevention.\u201d Layers of water safety It certainly makes sense that bright swimsuit colors can play a role in making a child more visible in the water in case of an emergency, but there isn\u2019t \u201creal-world evidence\u201d that having a child in a neon bathing suit leads to better outcomes in a drowning event, said Dr. Maneesha Agarwal, an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Emory University School of Medicine. \u201cThe goal is that you never have to even rely on your child\u2019s bathing suit color to find them in a drowning event at all,\u201d Agarwal said, adding that appropriate water safety includes various layers of protection. \u201cOther important layers include making sure your child is water-competent \u2013 so that means swim lessons. Making sure your child has good supervision whenever they are in the water, which means that the parents or a designated adult is watching the child in the water,\u201d she said, adding that it is important to look out for signs of drowning. Unlike how drowning is portrayed in the movies \u2013 with loud splashing and screams for help \u2013 drowning events in the real world occur silently and quickly, Agarwal said. \u201cThe child that\u2019s drowning, they\u2019re not going to be yelling for help. They are typically going to be struggling to keep their face above water level, so you might see their face kind of going up and down above the water level. And it really can only take 30 to 60 seconds before they\u2019re completely submerged,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cYou also want to make sure that you are doing everything you can to prevent your child from getting into the water unsupervised. That means if you have a pool, wherever you live or wherever you are visiting, making sure there\u2019s appropriate four-sided pool fencing that keeps children from accessing the pool,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then if the unthinkable happens, making sure that you are prepared \u2013 you know how to perform CPR, and you are able to rapidly call 911, and if you happen to be near an open body of water in particular, life jackets are imperative.\u201d The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data last month showing that accidental drowning rates are on the rise in the United States. The new numbers show that more than 4,500 people drowned each year between 2020 and 2022, which is about 500 more\u00a0drowning\u00a0deaths each year compared with the previous year in 2019. Children especially are at high risk, as drowning\u00a0is the number-one cause of death for children 1-4 years old in the United States. But some studies have shown that participating in formal swimming lessons is associated with an 88% reduced risk of drowning in young children, said Chris DeJong, founder and president of Big Blue Swim School, which offers swimming lessons to children. He added that wearing bright-colored swimsuits is just one tool in a toolbox of many steps children can take to be safer while in or around a swimming pool. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends swim lessons as a layer of protection against drowning and says they can start for many children as early as 1. \u201cStarting at that very early age can help make them more comfortable as we start to get into more advanced lessons when they\u2019re older \u2013 so they\u2019re not starting from scratch and having to overcome a fear of something brand new, which can be challenging with swim lessons,\u201d DeJong said. \u201cSwim lessons are the most important tool to help kids save themselves and know what to do in an emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd know your risk factors. Younger children, typically under the age of 10, are most commonly drowning victims in residential pools, whereas drowning victims over the age of 14 are typically in natural bodies of water.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/swimsuit-color-pool-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_antidepressant-discontinuation-withdrawal-symptoms-wellness", "text": "Antidepressants can do wonders for persistent mental health problems. But some people may be reluctant to take the medications, fearing what could happen if they want to stop taking them one day. That risk has now been quantified, thanks to a new review of 79 studies \u2014 known as a meta-analysis \u2014 totaling 21,002 adult participants age 45 on average. Roughly 15% of participants who discontinued antidepressants experienced withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, insomnia and irritability, according to the review published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry. One in 35 participants experienced severe symptoms once they stopped taking antidepressants. The review is the first publication of a larger project on antidepressant withdrawal symptoms, the authors said. \u201cThere is strong evidence that antidepressants can be effective for many people who are experiencing a depressive disorder, either alone, or alongside other treatments such as psychotherapy,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Henssler, senior author of the study and senior physician in the department of psychiatry and neurosciences at Charit\u00e9 \u2014 University Medicine in Berlin, in a news release. \u201cHowever, they do not work for everyone, and some patients may experience unpleasant side effects. In patients who have recovered with the help of antidepressants, the decision from doctors and patients may be to stop taking them in time,\u201d Henssler added. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s important both doctors and patients have an accurate, evidence-based picture of what might happen.\u201d The occurrence of withdrawal symptoms was reported or described as early as 1959, but researchers neglected those reports until the late 1990s, according to the review.\u00a0 Until now, \u201cthere has been a lot of \u2018debate\u2019 about the important problem of antidepressant withdrawal in the last few years, which has appeared within print and social media, with very high estimates of withdrawal being pronounced at around 50% and half (considered) as severe,\u201d said Dr. Sameer Jauhar, senior clinical lecturer in affective disorders and psychosis at King\u2019s College London, in a news release. Jauhar wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis was based on a very unconventional review,\u201d Jauhar added, \u201cwhich included data from online surveys, which are notoriously difficult to interpret (ask anyone involved in election polling).\u201d To determine the risk of withdrawal more accurately, the authors reviewed data from 44 randomized controlled trials and 35 observational studies published between 1961 and 2019. These studies investigated abrupt cessation or tapering of an established antidepressant or placebo. More than half of these studies focused on mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, and more than a fourth concentrated on anxiety disorders. \u00a0 The authors also discovered the medications most often linked with withdrawal symptoms were desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, imipramine and escitalopram. Those with the lowest rate of discontinuation symptoms were fluoxetine and sertraline. Pharmaceutical companies funded 45 of the studies, but this backing didn\u2019t appear to influence the overall results, according to the review. The rate of withdrawal symptoms in pharma-funded studies was about the same as trials not funded by pharmaceutical companies. \u201cThis work is a salutary lesson, as some people may have been dissuaded from taking a potentially effective treatment, based on poor quality evidence,\u201d Jauhar said. \u201cScience does correct itself, and the authors are to be congratulated on this work.\u201d The findings are also an important first step to helping patients responsibly discontinue taking antidepressants, said Dr. Christiaan Vinkers, a psychiatrist and full professor in the department of psychiatry at Amsterdam University Medical Center, in a news release. What these findings mean for patients Another weakness of the review was that many of the included studies weren\u2019t primarily focused on antidepressant discontinuation, but rather the efficacy of antidepressants versus placebos, Dr. Tony Kendrick, professor of primary care at the University of Southampton in England, said in a news release. These studies \u201calso happened to observe patients in the wash-out period coming off the drugs at the end of the trials. Consequently, the period of taking the antidepressant was 12 weeks or less in 36 out of the 79 included studies,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cSevere discontinuation symptoms would not usually be expected to arise after only a few weeks of antidepressant use.\u201d Some of the other included studies had much longer treatment periods \u2014 some up to a year or longer. Regarding why antidepressant discontinuation sometimes leads to withdrawal symptoms, it\u2019s important to note these medications aren\u2019t addictive, Henssler said. The effects could be due to the suddenly lower amount of neurotransmitters in your brain, according to the Cleveland Clinic. In the review, there was no difference between studies on tapered or abrupt discontinuation. But the authors cautioned that finding isn\u2019t a firm conclusion due to variation in study designs. And other research still indicates tapering can be helpful for reducing the chances and severity of symptoms, they said. Though the rates of withdrawal aren\u2019t nearly as high as previously reported, when it comes to patients wanting to quit their antidepressants, doctors should still have conversations about what doing so would mean for the patient and how to do it safely, Jauhar said. \u201cThe doctor should help them to do so slowly and in a controlled manner that limits the impact of any potential withdrawal symptoms \u2026 at a pace that suits them and their individual needs,\u201d said Dr. Oliver Howes, chair of the psychopharmacology committee at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom, said in a news release. Howes wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Carefully strategizing is important also because of the risk of relapsing into the condition being treated, depending on a person\u2019s mental health history, Dr. Paul Keedwell, a consultant psychiatrist and member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said in a news release. The study didn\u2019t provide information on the duration of withdrawal symptoms, but other research suggests they can last for up to two weeks in most cases, Keedwell said. Discontinuation is more difficult for people who have been on their medications for a year or more, he added \u2014 in that case withdrawal symptoms can last for months but rarely up to a year. However, \u201cit is important to say that withdrawal symptoms are not dangerous, and the risk of experiencing them at some future date should not be a reason for refusing antidepressant treatment,\u201d Keedwell said. \u201cThe pros and cons of treatment should always be discussed with your doctor.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/antidepressant-discontinuation-withdrawal-symptoms-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_earwax-eye-discharge-wellness-partner", "text": "Dry scalp? Blocked ears? Crusted eyes? Our bodies produce many different unusual, sometimes repellent secretions, and their function doesn\u2019t always seem entirely clear. But each has their own important role, which often goes unappreciated. Flaky or dry scalp is an extremely common condition, but in severe cases it certainly doesn\u2019t feel trivial. Put aside notions that it\u2019s a factor of poor hygiene \u2014 the underlying cause is not completely clear, but it may be exacerbated by hair care regimes that dry or irritate the scalp. What is known is that flakes of dandruff are made up of cell complexes, arising from sloughed off skin. The outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is composed in part of dead cells that act as an\u00a0essential protective barrier. Dead cells shed more easily and will be replaced with new ones as skin constantly regenerates and grows. If this happens at too great a rate, the result is dandruff. The first measure is to try an over-the-counter, anti-dandruff shampoo. These contain antifungal and anti-inflammatory compounds both understood to have dandruff-healing properties since fungi and inflammation are believed to be potential factors in the development of a crusty scalp. These compounds \u2014 selenium and coal tar for instance \u2014 can also help relieve the symptoms of itch that may often prove worse than the flaking. It\u2019s worthwhile trying a different formula if the first doesn\u2019t work. Certain conditions such as\u00a0psoriasis\u00a0and eczema can also be the underlying cause and may require alternative treatment. Scabs may be unsightly \u2014 but they function beautifully Scabs are the body\u2019s natural response to being wounded. Cuts, punctures or breaks in the skin open up blood vessels to the atmosphere around us. In response, the bloodstream recruits its clotting agents \u2014 the platelets \u2014 to help plug the gap. Platelets bring blood cells together to form a clot, creating a bung to stop bleeding and prevent bacteria shifting from the skin into the circulation, where they can do more damage. When the clot dries out, a scab is formed. Scabs can look horrible, but don\u2019t worry \u2013\u2014 they\u2019re meant to. Sometimes pus forms, which can give scabs a yellow rather than reddish-brown color and might suggest that an infection is brewing.\u00a0Redness of the uninjured skin\u00a0around and tracking away from the scab is another telltale sign of possible infection, too. Resist the temptation to pick off a scab from the skin, no matter how tempting it may seem. Scabs may be unsightly, or itchy, but they\u2019re performing the job they\u2019re supposed to \u2014 keeping out bugs and allowing wounds to heal. Take good care of them instead, by keeping them untouched and clean, and wait for them to shed themselves. READ MORE: Is hot yoga good for you? Exploring the science behind the sweat The eyes have it Sleep sand. Eye bogies. Doze dust. The debris we find in the corners of our eyes each morning goes by many different names. Few of us know exactly what it is, why it\u2019s there, or its scientific name, rheum. Tears lubricate the exposed surface of the eyes, stopping them from getting dry and sore. They also hose away grit and dust and have\u00a0natural antibacterial properties\u00a0to fight infections. But our eyes make more than just tears. The lids have many little glands that discharge\u00a0natural oily substances\u00a0allowing tears to spread evenly across the eye and prevent them evaporating away. In addition,\u00a0mucus-secreting glands, much like those in the nose that make snot, make a thin mucus that also helps to trap and eliminate rogue particles. In large amounts, oil and mucus can irritate the eyes but normally get swept away by tears and blinking during the day. By night, our eyes remain shut, and rheum builds up. Whether they take on the appearance of sticky bogies or crusts depends on how dry they get overnight, and may be proportional to how long you sleep. READ MORE: Why do my armpits smell? (Ear) waxing lyrical Earwax is a largely invisible entity \u2014 more often felt than seen. Notice a feeling of blocked or congested ears, or a smothered sense of hearing, and the wax in your ears might be becoming problematic. It also has a clinical name \u2014 cerumen. In part,\u00a0it\u2019s made of oils and sweat\u00a0from glands lining the ear canal. The majority of earwax though is keratin, the natural protein that toughens skin, hair and nails. This is because the\u00a0ear canal is lined with skin, all the way up to the eardrum. In mixing with the secretions, shed skin produces a waxy substance ranging in colors across the brown spectrum. Fresh, healthy earwax tends to be yellow to honey-brown in color, whereas older, thicker earwax becomes darker brown, sometimes even black. Notice red or green staining? Then blood or bacteria may be mixing with the wax. Among other diagnoses, this raises the possibility of an ear infection, especially if there\u2019s also a runny or foul-smelling discharge. Like many of the other bodily secretions, cerumen also traps debris and other nasties (even insects) that could irritate or damage the delicate eardrum. But problems arise if the wax builds up or hardens too much, blocking conduction of sound to the drum, and dampening your hearing. Nothing smaller than an index finger (with well-trimmed nails) should ever go in your ear canal. Stop cleaning with cotton buds, too. All this does is compress cerumen into little impacted cakes. Instead, medicinal olive oil from the pharmacy can help soften it down,\u00a0making it easier for the ear to clear it naturally. Blood, sweat and tears \u2014 and wax, skin and mucus \u2014 can cause many commonplace issues. But look beyond these minor ailments and be grateful that they\u2019re there.

{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
