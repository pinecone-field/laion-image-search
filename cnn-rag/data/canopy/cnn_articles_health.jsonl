Sarai Holguin, a 71-year-old woman originally from Mexico, has accepted the bullet lodged near her knee as her \u201ccompa\u201d \u2014 a close friend. Mireya Nelson, 15, was hit by a bullet that went through her jaw and broke her shoulder, where fragments remain. She\u2019ll live with them for now, while doctors monitor lead levels in her blood for at least two years. Nearly three months after the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting left at least 24 people injured, recovery from those wounds is intensely personal and includes a surprising gray area in medicine: whether the bullets should be removed. Medical protocol offers no clear answer. A 2016 survey of surgeons found that\u00a0only about 15%\u00a0of respondents worked at medical facilities that had policies on bullet removal. Doctors in the U.S. often leave bullets buried deep in a person\u2019s body, at least at first, so as not to cause further trauma. But as gun violence has emerged as a public health epidemic,\u00a0some researchers wonder\u00a0if that practice is best. Some of the wounded, like James Lemons, are left in a precarious place. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to get it out, and it\u2019s safely taken out, get it out of the person,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cMake that person feel more secure about themselves. And you\u2019re not walking around with that memory in you.\u201d Lemons, Holguin, and Nelson are coping in very different ways. Pain Became a Problem Three days after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Lemons drove the 37 miles from Harrisonville, Missouri, to downtown Kansas City to celebrate the victory. The warehouse worker was carrying his 5-year-old daughter, Kensley, on his shoulders when he felt a bullet enter the back of his right thigh. Gunfire erupted in the area packed with revelers,\u00a0prosecutors later said, after a \u201cverbal confrontation\u201d between two groups. Detectives found \u201cmultiple 9mm and .40 caliber spent shell casings\u201d at the scene. Lemons said he understood immediately what was happening. \u201cI know my city. We\u2019re not shooting off fireworks,\u201d he said. Lemons shielded Kensley\u2019s face as they fell to the ground so she wouldn\u2019t hit the concrete. His first thought was getting his family \u2014 also including his wife, Brandie; 17-year-old daughter, Kallie; and 10-year-old son, Jaxson \u2014 to safety. \u201cI\u2019m hit. But don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Lemons recalled telling Brandie. \u201cWe gotta go.\u201d He carried Kensley on his shoulders as the family walked a mile to their car. His leg bled through his pants at first then stopped, he said. It burned with pain. Brandie insisted on driving him to the hospital but traffic was at a standstill so she put on her hazard lights and drove on the wrong side of the road. \u201cShe\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m getting you to a hospital. I\u2019m tired of people being in my way,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen my wife like that. I\u2019m looking at her like, \u2018That\u2019s kinda sexy.\u2019\u201d Lemons clapped and smiled at his wife, he said, to which she replied, \u201cWhat are you smiling for? You just got shot.\u201d He stayed in quiet admiration until they were stopped by a sheriff, who summoned an ambulance, Lemons said. He was taken to the emergency room at University Health, which\u00a0admitted 12 patients\u00a0from the rally, including eight with gunshot wounds. Imaging showed the bullet barely missed an artery, Lemons said. Doctors cleansed the wound, put his leg in a brace, and told him to come back in a week. The bullet was still in his leg. \u201cI was a little baffled by it, but I was like, \u2018OK, whatever, I\u2019ll get out of here,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. When he returned, doctors removed the brace but explained they often leave bullets and fragments in the body \u2014 unless they grow too painful. \u201cI get it, but I don\u2019t like that,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you take it out if you could?\u201d University Health spokesperson Leslie Carto said the hospital can\u2019t comment on individual patient care because of federal privacy laws. Surgeons typically do remove bullets when they encounter them during surgery or they are in dangerous locations, like in the spinal canal or risking damage to an organ, said\u00a0Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children\u2019s. Campbell also chairs the Injury Prevention and Control Committee of the American College of Surgeons\u2019 Committee on Trauma, which works on firearm injury prevention. LJ Punch, a trauma surgeon by training and the founder of the\u00a0Bullet Related Injury Clinic\u00a0in St. Louis, said the origins of trauma care also help explain why bullets are so often left. \u201cTrauma care is war medicine,\u201d Punch said. \u201cIt is set to be ready at any moment and any time, every day, to save a life. It is not equipped to take care of the healing that needs to come after.\u201d In the survey of surgeons, the most common reasons given for removing a bullet were pain, a palpable bullet lodged near the skin, or an infection. Far less common were lead poisoning and mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. What patients wanted also affected their decisions, the surgeons said. Lemons wanted the bullet out. The pain it caused in his leg radiated up from his thigh, making it difficult to move for more than an hour or two. Working his warehouse job was impossible. \u201cI gotta lift 100 pounds every night,\u201d Lemons recalled telling his doctors. \u201cI gotta lift my child. I can\u2019t work like this.\u201d He has lost his income and his health insurance. Another stroke of bad luck: The family\u2019s landlord sold their rental home soon after the parade, and they had to find a new place to live. This house is smaller, but it was important to keep the kids in the same school district with their friends, Lemons said in an interview in Kensley\u2019s pink bedroom, the quietest spot to talk. They\u2019ve borrowed money and raised\u00a0$6,500 on GoFundMe\u00a0to help with the deposit and car repairs, but the parade shooting has left the family in a deep financial hole. Without insurance, Lemons worried he couldn\u2019t afford to have the bullet removed. Then he learned his surgery would be paid for by donations. He set up an appointment at a hospital north of the city, where a surgeon took measurements on his X-ray and explained the procedure. \u201cI need you to be involved as much as I\u2019m going to be involved,\u201d he remembered being told, \u201cbecause \u2014 guess what \u2014 this ain\u2019t my leg.\u201d The surgery is scheduled for this month. \u2018We Became Friends\u2019 Sarai Holguin isn\u2019t much of a Chiefs fan, but she agreed to go to the rally at Union Station to show her friend the best spot to see the players on stage. It was an unseasonably warm day, and they were standing near an entrance where lots of police were stationed. Parents had babies in strollers, kids were playing football, and she felt safe. A little before 2 p.m., Holguin heard what she thought were fireworks. People started running away from the stage. She turned to leave, trying to find her friend, but felt dizzy. She didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been shot. Three people quickly came to her aid and helped her to the ground, and a stranger took off his shirt and made a tourniquet to put on her left leg. Holguin, a native of Puebla, Mexico, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018, had never seen so much chaos, so many paramedics working under such pressure. They were \u201canonymous heroes,\u201d she said. She saw them working on Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a well-known DJ and 43-year-old mother of two. Lopez-Galvan died at the scene, and was the sole fatality at the parade. Holguin was rushed to University Health, about five minutes from Union Station. There doctors performed surgery, leaving the bullet in her leg. Holguin awoke to more chaos. She had lost her purse, along with her cellphone, so she couldn\u2019t call her husband, Cesar. She had been admitted to the hospital under an alias \u2014 a common practice at medical centers to begin immediate care. Her husband and daughter didn\u2019t find her until about 10 p.m. \u2014 roughly eight hours after she\u2019d been shot. \u201cIt has been a huge trauma for me,\u201d Holguin said through an interpreter. \u201cI was injured and at the hospital without doing anything wrong. [The rally] was a moment to play, to relax, to be together.\u201d Holguin was hospitalized for a week, and two more outpatient surgeries quickly followed, mostly to remove dead tissue around the wound. She wore a wound VAC, or vacuum-assisted closure device, for several weeks and had medical appointments every other day. Campbell, the trauma surgeon, said wound VACs are common when bullets damage tissue that isn\u2019t easily reconstructed in surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical injuries,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cMany times it\u2019s the emotional, psychological injuries, which many of these patients take away as well.\u201d The bullet remains near Holguin\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019m going to have it for the rest of my life,\u201d she said, saying she and the bullet became \u201ccompas,\u201d close friends. \u201cWe became friends so that she doesn\u2019t do any bad to me anymore,\u201d Holguin said with a smile. Punch, of the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis, said some people like Holguin are able to find a way to psychically live with bullets that remain. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to make a story around what that means for that bullet to be in your body, that gives you power; that gives you agency and choice,\u201d Punch said. Holguin\u2019s life changed in an instant: She\u2019s using a walker to get around. Her foot, she said, acts \u201clike it had a stroke\u201d \u2014 it dangles, and it\u2019s difficult to move her toes. The most frustrating consequence is that she cannot travel to see her 102-year-old father, still in Mexico. She has a live camera feed on her phone to see him, but that doesn\u2019t offer much comfort, she said, and thinking about him brings tears. She was told at the hospital that her medical bills would be taken care of, but then lots of them came in the mail. She tried to get victim assistance from the state of Missouri, but all the forms she had were in English, which made them difficult to comprehend. Renting the wound VAC alone cost $800 a month. Finally she heard that the Mexican Consulate in Kansas City could help, and the consul pointed her to the Jackson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, with which she registered as an official victim. Now all of her bills are being paid, she said. Holguin isn\u2019t going to seek mental health treatment, as she believes one must learn to live with a given situation or it will become a burden. \u201cI have processed this new chapter in my life,\u201d Holguin said. \u201cI have never given up and I will move on with God\u2019s help.\u201d \u2018I Saw Blood on My Hands\u2019 Mireya Nelson was late to the parade. Her mother, Erika, told her she should leave early, given traffic and the million people expected to crowd into downtown Kansas City, but she and her teenage friends ignored that advice. The Nelsons live in Belton, Missouri, about a half hour south of the city. Mireya wanted to hold the Super Bowl trophy. When she and her three friends arrived, the parade that had moved through downtown was over and the rally at Union Station had begun. They were stuck in the large crowd and quickly grew bored, Mireya said. Getting ready to leave, Mireya and one of her friends were trying to call the driver of their group, but they couldn\u2019t get cell service in the large crowd. Amid the chaos of people and noise, Mireya suddenly fell. \u201cI saw blood on my hands. So then I knew I got shot. Yeah, and I just crawled to a tree,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know where I got shot at, at first. I just saw blood on my hands.\u201d The bullet grazed Mireya\u2019s chin, shot through her jaw, broke her shoulder, and left through her arm. Bullet fragments remain in her shoulder. Doctors decided to leave them because Mireya had already suffered so much damage. Mireya\u2019s mother supports that decision, for now, noting they were just \u201cfragments.\u201d \u201cI think if it\u2019s not going to harm her the rest of her life,\u201d Erika said, \u201cI don\u2019t want her to keep going back in the hospital and getting surgery. That\u2019s more trauma to her and more recovery time, more physical therapy and stuff like that.\u201d Bullet fragments, particularly ones only skin-deep, often push their way out like splinters, according to Punch, although patients aren\u2019t always told about that. Moreover, Punch said, injuries caused by bullets extend beyond those with damaged tissue to the people around them, like Erika. He called for a holistic approach to recover from all the trauma. \u201cWhen people stay in their trauma, that trauma can change them for a lifetime,\u201d Punch said. Mireya will be tested for\u00a0lead levels in her blood\u00a0for at least the next two years. Her levels are fine now, doctors told the family, but if they get worse she will need surgery to remove the fragments, her mother said. Campbell, the pediatric surgeon, said lead is particularly concerning for young children, whose developing brains make them especially vulnerable to\u00a0its harmful effects.\u00a0Even a tiny amount\u00a0of lead \u2014 3.5 micrograms per deciliter \u2014 is enough to report to state health officials, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mireya talks about cute teenage boys\u2019 being \u201cfine\u201d but also still wears Cookie Monster pajamas. She appears confused by the shootings, by all the attention at home, at school, from reporters. Asked how she feels about the fragments in her arm, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care for them.\u201d Mireya was on antibiotics for 10 days after her hospital stay because doctors feared there was bacteria in the wound. She has had physical therapy, but it\u2019s painful to do the exercises. She has a scar on her chin. \u201cA dent,\u201d she said, that\u2019s \u201cbumpy.\u201d \u201cThey said she was lucky because if she wouldn\u2019t have turned her head in a certain way, she could be gone,\u201d Erika said. Mireya faces a psychiatric evaluation and therapy appointments, though she doesn\u2019t like to talk about her feelings. So far, Erika\u2019s insurance is paying the medical bills, though she hopes to get some help from the United Way\u2019s\u00a0#KCStrong fund, which raised nearly $1.9 million, or a faith-based organization called\u00a0Unite KC. Erika doesn\u2019t want a handout. She has a job in health care and just got a promotion. The bullet has changed the family\u2019s life in big ways. It is part of their conversation now. They talk about how they wish they knew what kind of ammunition it was, or what it looked like. \u201cLike, I wanted to keep the bullet that went through my arm,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI want to know what kind of bullet it was.\u201d That brought a sigh from her mom, who said her daughter had watched too many episodes of \u201cForensic Files.\u201d Erika beats herself up about the wound, because she couldn\u2019t protect her daughter at the parade. \u201cIt hits me hard because I feel bad because she begged me to get off work and I didn\u2019t go there because when you have a new position, you can\u2019t just take off work,\u201d Erika said. \u201cBecause I would have took the bullet. Because I would do anything. It\u2019s mom mode.\u201d This story was produced as part of a reporting partnership\u00a0between\u00a0KCUR\u00a0and\u00a0KFF Health News,\u00a0a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/super-bowl-parade-survivors-bullets-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_sleep-talking-fixes-wellness", "text": "Do you or a loved one talk in your sleep? It\u2019s a common sleep issue for many, experts say. About 50% of children will talk in their sleep \u2014 and typically outgrow it \u2014 while only about 5% of adults are nighttime blabbermouths, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. However, about 60% to 65% of adults will experience at least one episode of nighttime speech during their lifetime, the academy said. Sleep soliloquies can occur at any stage of sleep, not just in rapid eye movement (REM), the\u00a0stage when dreams occur, experts say. These one-sided conversations are typically harmless and can include mumbled whispers, groans and nonsense words as well as vulgar language and outright yelling. At that point, a bed partner may cease to view the chatter as amusing and start looking for ways to protect their own sleep, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThere are some things you, the bed partner, can do to save your sleep,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cBut first make sure there are no hidden issues that might be causing the problem.\u201d Sleep talking, or somniloquy, can be connected to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. Medications to treat depression, and other mental health disorders, high blood pressure, seizures, asthma and, oddly, other sleep disorders can also cause sleep talking, according to the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cIf your partner has never been a sleep talker and suddenly starts sleep talking after the age of 50, and it becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should reach out to your doctor for a neurological evaluation,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIt could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder, such as Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds to two minutes 30 or more times an hour \u2014 can also cause the brain to partially wake and begin to jabber. Bed partners are often the first to notice sleep apnea, observing a total cessation of breathing, followed by a gasp of air. Acid reflux or it\u2019s more serious cousin, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can also create a partial arousal that can trigger the brain into speech, Schenck said. Tips for handling sleep talking A white noise generator or loud fan is a great defense, said Jennifer Mundt, assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \u201cEarplugs or comfortable noise-canceling headphones\u00a0may also help,\u201d she said. Earplugs come in several forms: expandable foam, pre-molded versions and custom molded, which are created to precisely fit the shape and size of the ear canal. \u201cThen try to go to sleep before the person who sleep talks so that you are not easily awakened. That\u2019s where a white noise generator or loud fan can be very, very helpful,\u201d Schenck said. Now, it\u2019s time for some detective work. Work with your bed partner to discover triggers for their sleep talking, such as stress, the use of alcohol, being sleep-deprived, not sticking to a normal sleep schedule or even sleeping in a new environment, experts say. For some people, something as benign as being on vacation or sleeping somewhere new can cause an episode, Mundt said. \u201cAt these times your brain is a little more vigilant because you\u2019re in a new environment, and that means you\u2019re more likely to have this partial awakening, where one part of the brain is awake and the other part is asleep,\u201d Mundt said. In the end, it\u2019s the responsibility of the person who sleep talks to take ownership of their disorder and find solutions to quit disturbing a partner\u2019s sleep, Schenck said. \u201cThe person who is sleep talking has to be very considerate of the partner,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIf sleeping on your back makes it worse, then get a nightshirt where you can put a tennis ball in the back of the shirt so you can\u2019t sleep on your back.\u201d And if drinking alcohol is a trigger, that should be stopped or diminished as well, he said. \u201cCut out alcohol so you can share your consideration for the bed partner who is disturbed by your sleep talking.\u201d What causes sleep talking? Sleep talking is a parasomnia, in the same category as sleep terrors, sleep eating, sleep paralysis and sleep sex. All are disorders of arousal, in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Parasomnias often run in families, and you are more likely to have one if you had one as a child. If more than one first-degree relative has a parasomnia, then it\u2019s much more likely that childhood sleep behaviors will remain or reoccur as an adult, Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to predict that you will develop a parasomnia. Some people who have sleep talking or walking as children do return to the behavior as adults, but many others do not,\u201d he said. Sleep talking often occurs spontaneously \u201cin a rather unpredictable fashion,\u201d Schenck said, although at times it can occur after fevers or emotional stress. However, \u201csleep talking should be differentiated from catathrenia, a sleep-related breathing disorder typically characterized by moaning during sleep.\u201d Many people who talk in their sleep do not need medical treatment, but if the disorder is severe, there are treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy, designed to help identify and reduce stress triggers and negative thoughts about sleep. Good sleep hygiene, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day, avoiding caffeine after 3pm and eliminating light from the bedroom, including screens such as smartphones, laptops and televisions can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/sleep-talking-fixes-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_02_22_health_oklahoma-narcan-vending-machines", "text": "In his darkest moments, Jason Hall felt worthless. During his childhood and early adulthood, he said, there were times when he would drink too much alcohol, pop pills at nightclubs and, inevitably, do something or say something that would hurt people he loved. Hall, 41, would never have thought that his life journey would take him from those dark experiences to potentially saving lives with his work refilling naloxone vending machines across Oklahoma. Over-the-counter naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, is an inhaled medication used to reverse an opioid overdose while it\u2019s happening. Naloxone vending machines \u2013 which provide the medications for free \u2013 can help people access doses quickly and reduce someone\u2019s risk of dying from an opioid overdose since, ideally, the medication should be given immediately. The vending machines also offer free fentanyl test strips, small strips of paper that can test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that drives most overdose deaths in the United States. From California to New York, vending machines stocked with harm-reduction tools have been placed in areas where high numbers of opioid overdoses have been reported. In Oklahoma, some of the machines are located along turnpikes, in casinos, on university campuses, at a library or outside fire stations. A CNN analysis of state health departments finds that at least 33 states and the District of Columbia have naloxone vending machines. In some states, like Oregon, city or county health departments or local nonprofits might operate the machines without state involvement. Other states, like Delaware, don\u2019t currently have vending machines but plan to launch programs this year. The size of these programs can vary. Oklahoma plans to expand its program this year from 27 machines to 40. Other large programs can be found in places like Michigan, where Wayne County officials announced last month plans to deploy 100 vending machines containing naloxone. When working with the vending machines in Oklahoma, Hall often reflects on his experiences to inform his work. As a senior field representative for harm reduction campaigns at the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, he leads community training sessions on harm reduction as well as helping restock dozens of naloxone vending machines for people to access anonymously. \u201cPeople\u2019s reasons for using substances are as vast and different as there are different types of suffering. I grew up as a queer kid in a small town, and it was not a super cool thing to be in the \u201880s and \u201890s,\u201d said Hall, who is based in Oklahoma City. \u201cYou\u2019re basically told from a very, very young age that this is kind of the worst thing that you can be. You internalize that, and it creates a lot of depression and anxiety.\u201d Hall, who is now sober, said that at a young age, he turned to substances like methamphetamines or opioids to give him the feeling of confidence he craved at the time. In his mid-30s, Hall sought treatment for substance use disorder. \u201cThis followed me my entire life. Then I got to a place where I wasn\u2019t using methamphetamines and opioids, and alcohol was my substance of choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a very cool hipster guy. I was vegan, and I only rode a bicycle around. It\u2019s funny that I was very particular about the foods that I would eat, but as far as substances, I wasn\u2019t so picky.\u201d Hall, who works for the state and occasionally bartends on the side, said he has personally administered naloxone several times to reverse opioid overdoses during his time bartending and while working in shelter and housing programs. Even though he knows that naloxone is accessible through the vending machines, he always keeps some on him too, just in case. \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to need these products. A lot of times, substance use isn\u2019t planned,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, people are out in the community and maybe having a few cocktails and a substance becomes available, and maybe it\u2019s a substance you typically wouldn\u2019t use, but you\u2019ve had a couple drinks, and your inhibitions are lowered.\u201d \u2018People are dying every minute of the day\u2019 More than 111,000 people in the US died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period that ended in September, according to\u00a0provisional data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about overdose death rates, I\u2019ve got any number of friends, I see their face every time I see those numbers or when we talk about the number of overdose reversals that come from kits that are distributed by our community partners,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhen I hear those numbers, I hear the voices of my friends that are currently struggling with substance use disorder,\u201d he said, eyes filling with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s very real to me.\u201d Overall, the number of overdose deaths associated with any drug continues to increase each month in the United States, although the pace appears to be slowing. Deaths reached a record high in May and changed little in the following months, through September. \u201cPeople are dying every minute of the day due to these overdoses, and so the vending machines are an amazing tool to help get the help into the hands of the public,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \u201cThis is a prevention technique, and it\u2019s very, very helpful to have these distribution points in the community that allow people to get what they need quickly without necessarily relying immediately on a first responder when seconds matter to save a life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so these distribution points and these vending access machines are meant to bring\u00a0the solutions closer to the community and put the tools in their hands to save lives.\u201d A study conducted in Cincinnati found that a single vending machine was directly associated with reversing overdoses for at least 78 people in its first year. In Clark County, Nevada, another study found that in the 12 months after the launch of naloxone vending machines, there were 229 opioid-involved overdose deaths. But researchers had previously predicted that there would be about 270 deaths in the county, suggesting that about 41 deaths were averted after the machines were launched. Machines need to be restocked every day Oklahoma\u2019s naloxone vending machine program launched in June. The state placed its first machine at a homeless shelter in Tulsa. The machines have become so popular that they need to be restocked every day, said Heath Hayes, former deputy commissioner for the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. \u201cAll of the vending machines have technology associated with it that ping us when they\u2019re getting low. So if they\u2019re at 50% capacity, we get the staff ready to activate the restockers,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThese vending machines that we have active right now have about 11,000 boxes of naloxone that have been distributed,\u201d he said, and each box contains two doses. The vending machines each hold 100 naloxone kits and 54 fentanyl test strip packages. Both items \u2013 naloxone and the test strips \u2013 are available in the machines free of charge. Typically, an over-the-counter box of two single-dose naloxone sprays can cost around $45. In 2022, before the launch of the vending machine program, about 700 people died of opioid overdose in Oklahoma, according to state health department numbers, up from about 400 deaths in 2021. Hayes said the state will closely watch those numbers to see whether they decline over time, especially as naloxone becomes more easily accessible with the addition of more vending machines. \u201cOur goal is to get naloxone in the hands of every Oklahoman, because we want to normalize that naloxone is something that every person should carry on them,\u201d Hayes said before he left the department. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to have naloxone in 2 million-plus people\u2019s hands that are 18 and older,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are overdosing can\u2019t use this medication on themselves, and for about 40% of the people who overdose, there\u2019s a bystander around. So it\u2019s critical that you have naloxone on you, because you never know when you can save a life.\u201d Aside from providing naloxone and fentanyl test strips at no cost, an appeal of the vending machines is that they offer a sense of anonymity. The machines do not collect any identifiable information, and anyone can walk up and use them. Hayes said there is still a lot of stigma around opioid use and the need for naloxone, but he hopes the vending machines can help reduce it. The machines have large print on the sides that reads \u201cnaloxone saves lives.\u201d \u201cNot often do you see a vending machine that says \u2018Naloxone can save lives\u2019 and it be very mental health- and addiction-focused, at your gas station,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThat\u2019s another piece to this, is that we have a physical symbol of anti-stigma in places that typically aren\u2019t associated with the mental health field.\u201d Some critics question whether the machines enable dangerous behaviors. Naloxone vending machine programs often can face\u00a0opposition from the communities\u00a0where they are placed. But public health advocates champion the machines as a way to reduce the number of lives lost to overdose while reducing stigma. In central Pennsylvania, six naloxone vending machines have been installed in rural communities where stigma can be prevalent but there is a greater need for expanded access to naloxone medication, said Carla Sofronski, executive director and co-founder of the\u00a0Pennsylvania Harm Reduction Network. \u201cHarm reduction is often highly stigmatized, especially in Pennsylvania, with the thought process that it is enabling drug use, when it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. Harm reduction does not condone drug use. It just provides life-saving interventions and tools in a toolbox to keep people alive and minimize risk,\u201d Sofronski said. \u201cWe have to start treating this as an urgent public health crisis, and folks should not be denied access to life-saving interventions due to stigma or because some folks may believe that people have addiction due to moral failure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to cut the stigma to actually get these tools out to people.\u201d \u2018You are not a broken person\u2019 Hall has faced stigma firsthand. He says he has heard some criticisms or \u201cdifficult\u201d questions about the naloxone vending machines and other programs. For instance, people might ask whether the vending machines enable opioid abuse on-site. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to think that somebody\u2019s going to walk into one of these spaces and see that this vending machine has fentanyl test strips and Narcan and think, \u2018oh, this makes it safe for me to use.\u2019 I think if anything, it\u2019s bringing more to the forefront the danger around using these substances,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt really is a shame that, a lot of times, we have to spend our time and energy into humanizing people that use substances or people that might need access to these tools,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some people that have the attitude of \u2018well, if somebody overdoses, then that\u2019s their problem,\u2019 and that\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d Some of these negative biases and attitudes around people with substance use disorders remind Hall of how easily stigma can chip away at someone\u2019s self-worth. If he could speak to his younger self, at the peak of his substance use, he would tell himself that he is worthy of all that life has to offer. \u201cI would tell little baby Jason that everything is going to be OK,\u201d Hall said. \u201cYou are not a broken person, and you are not less than anybody else, and you are not less deserving of everything that life has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these things about yourself that you think make yourself so different and so \u2018othered\u2019 really just make you so much more human.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/22/health/oklahoma-narcan-vending-machines/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_preeclampsia-risk-first-trimester-test-wellness", "text": "A new blood test can be performed in a pregnant person\u2019s first trimester to help assess their risk of developing preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening pregnancy complication. It\u2019s the first and only test of its kind available in the United States that can be used between 11 and 14 weeks gestation to determine the risk of preeclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy, its maker, Labcorp, announced Wednesday. The first trimester\u00a0is the period from 0 to 13 weeks of a pregnancy. However, the new test doesn\u2019t change clinical guidance on preeclampsia, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, also known as ACOG. Some doctors question how it will help. \u201cIt is currently unclear how useful the LabCorp test will be in accurately predicting risk for developing preeclampsia and whether it is appropriate for all pregnant patients,\u201d Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOG\u2019s interim CEO and chief of clinical practice and health equity and quality, said in a statement. \u201cBefore a screening test can be successfully employed, there needs to be an evidence-based intervention to either prevent or reduce the impact of the disease. We currently have no data on how to reduce the risk for a pregnant patient predicted to have preeclampsia from a blood test early in pregnancy as opposed to clinical factors,\u201d he added. Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy\u00a0marked by elevated blood pressure and high levels of protein in the urine or other signs of organ damage. The condition typically develops after 20 weeks\u00a0of pregnancy \u2013 in the second trimester \u2013 and if left untreated, it can turn serious or deadly for both mother and baby. There is no cure for preeclampsia, outside of the mother delivering the baby, but some severe cases can be treated with medications like antihypertensive drugs. Some factors that can put a pregnant person at risk of preeclampsia include being older than 35; being pregnant for the first time; having obesity; having a family history of preeclampsia; having diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease or an autoimmune disease; having twins or triplets; or having undergone in vitro fertilization. The new screening test evaluates any patient\u2019s risk of preeclampsia by 34 weeks gestation, which is the third trimester, and provides a comprehensive risk assessment with up to 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity, according to Labcorp. Sensitivity refers to the test\u2019s ability to accurately identify pregnancies at high risk, and specificity refers to its ability to accurately identify pregnancies that are not at high risk. Doctors who think their patients might benefit from this screening can talk to their patients about the option, order the test and get results within a few days. \u201cThis is one more tool in the tool belt for clinicians in the US and beyond to help deliver better maternal outcomes,\u201d said Dr. Brian Caveney, Labcorp\u2019s chief medical and scientific officer. About 1 in 25 pregnancies in the United States\u00a0is affected by preeclampsia, and it is one of the leading causes of maternal death. Options are limited for preeclampsia risk screening. Before the launch of the new test, at-risk patients could screen for their preeclampsia risk only during the second or third trimester of pregnancy if they were both symptomatic and hospitalized, and even that test was just launched last year. The new first-trimester test\u00a0isn\u2019t a diagnostic test\u00a0but a risk assessment tool to determine whether someone is more likely than average to develop preeclampsia during their current pregnancy,\u00a0\u201calong with all the other questions your doctor might ask you during a first-trimester visit,\u201d Caveney said. The screening results can lead to \u201ca whole bunch of slight changes in the prenatal care that you get from your doctor, based on the results of this risk predictor tool early on,\u201d he\u00a0said. Those changes may involve having more doctor visits to monitor your pregnancy, checking your blood pressure at home at least once a week, being mindful to not overexert yourself during exercise or at work or, if recommended by your physician, taking a low-dose aspirin preventively. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends the use of a low-dose aspirin as preventive medication after 12 weeks gestation in people at high risk for preeclampsia, but some people and their providers may not know that they\u2019re at high risk, especially if it is their first pregnancy. \u201cAt least half or more of cases of preeclampsia are potentially preventable,\u201d Caveney said. \u201cIf you identify it earlier in the pregnancy, you\u2019re more likely to be able to do things that lead to a healthier pregnancy and, therefore, hopefully a healthier delivery.\u201d The new screening test is a laboratory-developed test or LDT, so it does not require approval by the US Food and Drug Administration to be performed. Labcorp is in talks with health insurance plans to ensure that the test could be covered, Caveney said, adding that the screening assay has a list price of about $240. How the risk assessment works The risk of preeclampsia also has racial disparities. In the United States, the rate in Black women is about 60% higher than in White women. In general, Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than White women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cPreeclampsia is one of the main reasons why there is such a significant disparity in maternal outcomes,\u201d Caveney said. \u201cWith a focus on health equity, we think that better, more evidence-based preeclampsia screening can hopefully help address that, along with lots of other social services and health services and prenatal care to hopefully improve outcomes for pregnancies in the US and beyond.\u201d The new screening test works by identifying and measuring four biomarkers that are associated with preeclampsia risk. According to Labcorp, those biomarkers are the placental growth factor or PIGF hormone in the blood; pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A or PAPP-A in the blood; a blood pressure measurement of the average arterial pressure in the arteries; and the patient\u2019s uterine artery pulsatility index or UtAPI, which is measured during an ultrasound. Having low levels of PlGF and PAPP-A may suggest that the placenta is developing and functioning poorly, according to Labcorp, while high levels of arterial pressure and UtAPI may indicate elevated blood pressure and decreased blood flow in the uterine artery. One study published in 2018 in the journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology found that the performance of screening \u201cis substantially improved\u201d when the screening method includes maternal factors along with biomarkers, such as measurements of mean arterial pressure, UtAPI, PIGF and PAPP-A. Some doctors raise questions Not all physicians say they would recommend the new screening test for their patients. \u201cThe utility of the test in managing patients has yet to be proven and it is not clear that it helps more than it could possibly hurt.\u00a0It is not clear that the use of this test is any better than the current standards for prenatal care,\u201d Dr. Christian Pettker, chief of obstetrics at Yale-New Haven Hospital and a professor at Yale School of Medicine, wrote in an email. \u201cIt is not clear to me that this is appropriate for all patients who are pregnant in the first trimester.\u00a0Perhaps the most applicable group could be for patients who had preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy, though these patients already have a high risk and are often followed differently in their pregnancy,\u201d Pettker wrote. \u201cWhile the test is modestly good at predicting which patients may develop preeclampsia, it isn\u2019t clear how many patients are improperly told that they will develop preeclampsia,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cI would not underestimate the number of patients affected by a false positive.\u201d ACOG\u2019s Zahn agreed that false assessments come with risks. \u201cWith any new screening tool, it\u2019s always important to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks,\u201d Zahn said. Pettker also had some questions about how the test would be administered to evaluate a patient\u2019s preeclampsia risk, based on biomarkers, and how the ultrasound measurement of uterine artery blood flow \u201cis not a standard test done by ultrasound units or physicians and requires very specific expertise and training.\u201d Labcorp plans to talk with physicians and maternal-fetal specialists about the components of the test, Caveney said, but he added that the screening test could still be ordered using the blood-based biomarkers and regular blood pressure readings. \u201cMore data is better but not necessary, meaning this test performs best statistically if we have all of the pieces of data from the doctor in order to perform it. However, not every ob-gyn office or ultrasound center routinely has the ability to calculate this uterine artery pulsatility index,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t provide it, we will still perform the test and give an indication of risk. It just reduces the sensitivity or the likelihood of us being able to accurately predict the risk of preeclampsia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes it from a sensitivity of around 90% to the high 70s, which is still significantly higher than assessing traditional maternal risk factors alone.\u201d Losing a baby \u2018should not be the screening\u2019 Eleni Tsigas, chief executive officer of the Preeclampsia Foundation, said that a screening tool like the new first-trimester test could have \u201csignificantly\u201d changed her pregnancy experience if it had existed at the time of her first pregnancy in 1998. \u201cMy daughter died, and it was all due to a last-minute emergency,\u201d she said. Tsigas was diagnosed with preeclampsia only 11 weeks before her due date, and due to the complications of preeclampsia, her daughter, Nikonia Evangelia Tsigas, was stillborn. At the time, Tsigas said, she had only one risk factor: Her daughter was her first pregnancy. \u201cBut losing your first baby should not be the screening test that you\u2019re at high risk,\u201d Tsigas said. \u201cSo many people are completely caught off-guard in their first pregnancy when they develop preeclampsia, because they didn\u2019t have any of these risk factors other than it was their first pregnancy.\u201d Tsigas and her husband went on to have two more children after that first pregnancy, their sons Jordan and Jonathan. For those pregnancies, Tsigas said, she and her care team were more aware of her preeclampsia risk, they monitored her health closely, and she took a low-dose aspirin when recommended by her doctor. But something like the newly launched first-trimester screening test, \u201cif it\u2019s done right, it has the potential to eliminate those surprise cases\u201d of preeclampsia, Tsigas said. \u201cThe reason I emphasize \u2018done right\u2019 is because what we don\u2019t want to do is add another tool to the toolbox that\u2019s only accessible by some people. That\u2019s only going to increase disparities,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has issues with payer coverage and education and making sure that all women, no matter their socioeconomic status, are aware that this kind of information should be available to everybody. If it is, it has the potential to reduce the disparities we\u2019re seeing in maternal health outcomes and neonatal health outcomes,\u201d she said. \u201cTests like this absolutely move the bar.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/preeclampsia-risk-first-trimester-test-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

The reasons why they tend to affect these areas is not well understood. Hand, foot and mouth disease, or HFM,\u00a0begins in exactly these areas. It\u2019s caused by a virus known as\u00a0coxsackie and tends to produce raised pink-red spots that can blister and weep. The name is a bit of a misnomer \u2014 the rash can also affect the legs and buttocks, too. Noticing a new rash on the feet should prompt a doctor to consider HFM. HFM is a common childhood illness that\u2019s very contagious. Thankfully, it\u2019s also usually short-lived, clearing without treatment after a few days. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with\u00a0foot and mouth\u00a0\u2014 or better, hoof and mouth, however.

New research reveals the optimal mix Heart, vessels and feet Our circulatory system supplies blood to every part of the body \u2014 from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes. By the time blood vessels reach these extremities, like twigs from a tree, they have branched and got much smaller in size. At some point, we\u2019ve all experienced the discomfort of icy cold feet, especially when going barefoot around the house or during chillier days. It\u2019s normal for feet to feel cool to the touch, but they should not change color from their usual skin color to blue \u2014 nor should they ever get painfully cold. Severe symptoms of discoloration and pain can point toward a phenomenon called\u00a0blue toe syndrome. It can be triggered by tiny little masses called microemboli, made up of blobs of cholesterol. These emboli pass easily through large vessels but will struggle as they become smaller. On reaching the smaller vessels of the feet, they finally become stuck, cutting off the blood supply. The tissues then become starved of oxygen, causing the feet to change color and become painful. In serious cases, blue toe syndrome can lead to tissue death, breakdown and the formation of gangrene, which may require\u00a0amputation\u00a0of toes \u2014 or even the whole foot. This rare condition is sometimes called\u00a0\u201ctrash foot,\u201d because of the way in which the feet become so discolored. What\u2019s the underlying cause of these tiny cholesterol fragments? Most likely aneurysms and atherosclerosis \u2014 vessels that have ballooned or hardened upstream of the feet. When trash foot does occur, it is often following surgical treatment for these conditions, such as\u00a0aortic aneurysm repair. The procedures disrupt the vessel, which can cause emboli to break off. As well as trash foot, there are other signs in the feet that can point toward cardiovascular disease.\u00a0Raised red swellings\u00a0appearing on the feet (as well as the hands) can indicate an infection of the heart called\u00a0bacterial endocarditis.

After finding the upgoing plantar, the doctor may then have creased their brow with worry \u2014 and for good reason. The Babinski sign is a simple test that involves stroking the sole of the foot with a blunt-ended instrument to check the response of the toes. This is the\u00a0plantar reflex\u00a0\u2014 plantar relating to the sole of the foot. Normally, when this reflex is triggered, the toes should curl under or flex downward toward the sole. It the big toe points upward, and the smaller toes fan out, this is an \u201cupgoing plantar\u201d response \u2014 also known as the\u00a0Babinski sign, named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski who first described it. It is\u00a0normal to find this response in babies, whose nervous systems are undergoing development and not capable of all the motor functions of an adult. In\u00a0adults, however, finding the Babinski sign is an altogether different story. Most commonly, it signifies that a stroke is disrupting the normal brain circuitry that controls the feet. Other causes\u00a0include multiple sclerosis and (rarely) drug intoxication. In some otherwise healthy people though, the Babinski sign can be observed during deep sleep. The scope is much wider than just these conditions. Diabetes, kidney failure and even thyroid disorders can affect the feet.

{"id": "2024_04_15_world_cicada-fungus-zombie-scn", "text": "This spring, billions of cicadas will emerge after more than a decade underground, ready to climb into the trees and make a ruckus as they sing to attract mates. But some of these insects won\u2019t succeed in their goal of procreating \u2014 instead, they\u2019ll be controlled like zombies into spreading a strange fungus that hijacks cicadas\u2019 bodies and behavior. The details of the fungus\u2019 attack on the bugs \u2014 destroying the insects\u2019 genitals, replacing their abdomens with a cavity full of fungal spores, manipulating the bugs into hypersexual behavior to spread the fungus further and transforming the cicadas into what some scientists term \u201csaltshakers of death\u201d \u2014 may seem like they belong in a creature feature horror movie. But when it comes to the fungus Massospora cicadina, said Dr. John Cooley, an associate professor in residence of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut, Hartford, \u201cthe truth is actually much stranger than science fiction.\u201d Periodical cicadas lay their eggs in tree branches, and when those eggs hatch, the resulting baby cicadas, or nymphs, drop to the ground and burrow into the soil. Depending on their species, they spend 13 or 17 years underground, drinking sap from tree roots, until it\u2019s time for the nearly grown cicadas to emerge. At some point, the insects are exposed to spores of the fungus Massospora cicadina. It\u2019s not clear to scientists whether it happens when the cicadas enter the soil or when they leave it, or how that exposure happens. How Massospora cicadina controls cicadas The spores make their way into the cicadas\u2019 bodies, and from that point on, the cicadas are at the mercy of the fungal parasite. A mass of fungal spores builds up in the abdomen of each infected cicada. Eventually, the back end of the cicada \u2014 including its genitals \u2014 falls off. In its place, a white fungal plug is exposed, \u201ca clump of spores that are erupting out of where the genitals and abdomen once were,\u201d said Dr. Matt Kasson, an associate professor of mycology and forest pathology at West Virginia University. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s a gumdrop that\u2019s been dropped in chalk dust, glued to the backside of these cicadas.\u201d Despite having a chalky gumdrop of spores instead of genitals, the infected cicadas still attempt to mate, with gusto. The fungus manipulates the cicadas\u2019 behavior, causing what researchers including Kasson refer to as hypersexualization. The infected males keep trying to mate with females, and they also change their behavior to attract their fellow males. Healthy female cicadas will flick their wings to indicate that they\u2019re ready to mate. Both male and female cicadas infected with Massospora flick their wings to draw in amorous, soon-to-be-infected males. But attempting to mate is just one part of how infected cicadas spread the fungus. \u201cPeriodical cicadas have interlocking genitalia. So when they pull apart, guess what happens? Rip. And then there\u2019s a cicada walking around with someone else\u2019s genitals stuck to them,\u201d Cooley said. \u201cAnd now the cicada that\u2019s infected is busted open.\u201d Once the chalky fungal plug is ripped apart, the infected and disemboweled cicada flies around, raining down fluffy, brown spores. \u201cWe call them the saltshakers of death,\u201d Kasson said. The spores dispersed by these flying saltshakers go on to infect the next generation of cicadas that will emerge more than a decade later and begin the cycle again. Zombie cicadas stimulated by an amphetamine? It\u2019s an awful lot of moving around and mating for animals whose bodies have been torn apart. Kasson and his colleagues have found a potential explanation for what keeps these cicadas going. \u201cWe found an amphetamine in those fungal plugs, which provides a plausible explanation as to why the behavioral modification is occurring,\u201d Kasson said. After all, amphetamines are powerful stimulants in humans. Cooley noted that while amphetamines stimulate the central nervous systems of vertebrate animals, insects (which are all invertebrates) such as cicadas have different nervous systems, and it\u2019s not clear if those stimulants would affect them the same way. \u201cWe\u2019re left with this problem, that it\u2019s making a powerful psychoactive chemical, but the powerful psychoactive chemical may not do anything to the insects,\u201d Cooley said. He suggested that the fungus may have a different means of controlling the cicadas\u2019 behavior, and that the amphetamines it produces might instead serve to ward off vertebrate predators of cicadas (and thus, of cicada-dwelling fungi), such as birds. This spring\u2019s periodical cicada emergence is noteworthy because two different broods will emerge simultaneously in neighboring regions \u2014 17-year cicadas concentrated in northern Illinois, and 13-year cicadas throughout much of the Midwest and Southeast. These two broods have not been aboveground at the same time since 1803; however, scientists expect little geographical overlap of the two broods. Kasson said he hopes to study infected insects from the two different broods and see whether there are genetic differences between the M. cicadina infecting the 17-year and 13-year broods. While cicadas are edible, Kasson said people hoping to sample the bugs should be choosy about which ones they eat. If you find adult cicadas near the end of their lives, or already dead, Kasson said, \u201cyou do not want to put those in your mouth,\u201d regardless of whether they\u2019re infected with M. cicadina. If a person, dog or cat were to eat an infected cicada, they wouldn\u2019t be affected by the amphetamines in it \u2014 the dose is too small. And for \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d fans, M. cicadina is only capable of infecting cicadas (and just the 13- and 17-year varieties of these bugs), so humanity is probably safe from zombification.

{"id": "2024_05_12_health_mothers-day-less-body-shaming-wellness", "text": "Flowers and brunch are lovely, but there\u2019s an invaluable gift almost every mom would enjoy: a healthier body image. The pressure on women to look perfect isn\u2019t our fault. Recognizing and resisting unrealistic appearance ideals can improve mothers\u2019 lives at every stage of parenthood. While women face appearance pressures throughout their lives, for those who give birth, the postpartum period can be especially fraught. I\u2019ll never forget being the mom of young kids in 2010 when model Gisele B\u00fcndchen posed for Vogue only months after having a baby. During the internet frenzy that ensued, the supposedly reassuring takeaway was that \u201cordinary\u201d women shouldn\u2019t compare themselves to a supermodel. But almost all postpartum moms, celebrity or not, face an unspoken mandate to \u201cbounce back\u201d to their pre-baby body. Even if you had B\u00fcndchen\u2019s genetics and support staff, it\u2019s unreasonable and even cruel to expect you to focus your energy on appearing as if you\u2019ve never been pregnant. The reality is that you\u2019ve just created a human inside your body and physically pushed them out or undergone major abdominal surgery. Despite what we see on magazine covers and social media, \u201cthere\u2019s no bouncing back from growing a human,\u201d said Jen McLellan, a certified birth educator in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \u2018Bouncing-back\u2019 expectations can be harmful Since pregnancy and childbirth are among the biggest physical changes someone can experience, bounce-back expectations aren\u2019t just absurd \u2014 they can threaten new moms\u2019 health and well-being. The impact of these harmful appearance pressures is something we need to take seriously, according to Jill Schwartz, a Los Angeles-based therapist specializing in perinatal mental health. \u201cOur society does such a disservice to moms,\u201d she noted, by bombarding them with rules about how they should look instead of providing much-needed support. These damaging appearance ideals can worsen or even trigger mental health conditions, especially for postpartum women who have a history of depression, anxiety or an eating disorder. If moms feel preoccupied with their appearance, exercise or what they eat (even \u201chealthy eating\u201d), it could be a sign of significant maternal mental health problems. One of the most important steps for new moms is to work toward acceptance of and gratitude for the changes that come with parenthood. \u201cThe body isn\u2019t what it was before. And you\u2019ve done this beautiful, amazing thing that not everybody gets to experience,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cYou can grow and embrace that. But your body isn\u2019t going to be just like how it was before, just like life isn\u2019t going to be how it was before.\u201d When feeling pressure to try to control or shrink their body, moms can start by identifying that these ideas aren\u2019t natural or innate but have been \u201cinherited from the culture,\u201d according to Debra Benfield, a registered dietitian in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who specializes in supporting women\u2019s body image. Awareness of these external diet culture directives can help moms start to push back against unrealistic and harmful ideals. Some women may find strength in actively rebelling against the dominant narrative: \u201cDo the polar opposite of the pressure that society is placing on you,\u201d Schwartz advised. For example, while people may encourage new parents to ramp up exercise quickly, the healthier approach is to \u201cgo slow, be patient, give yourself grace and remember you\u2019re in healing time.\u201d Appearance pressures intensify again leading up to menopause The devastating mismatch between heightened maternal vulnerability and a fresh onslaught of unrealistic appearance expectations peaks again for women in the years leading up to menopause. As with the postpartum period, perimenopause brings new challenges at a stressful time of life. Many midlife women are experiencing hormonal shifts and physical changes, all while raising children and caring for aging parents. \u201cThe collision of motherhood and perimenopause is a very hard thing,\u201d Benfield said. It\u2019s no surprise that negative body image and disordered eating tend to increase again in midlife, when women are expected to look as if they\u2019re \u201cfrozen in time\u201d rather than experience the natural and expected changes that come with age, noted Benfield, who treats people with eating disorders. Women of all ages need to hear her important reminder: \u201cBodies change. And that\u2019s OK. And let\u2019s normalize that.\u201d A positive influence on family Moms may find it easier to reject diet culture and the thin ideal when they recognize the positive influence they can have on their families. \u201cWe are teaching our children how to love themselves,\u201d McLellan said. Even if a mom isn\u2019t overtly dieting or weighing herself in front of her kids, \u201cchildren are listening and watching in more ways than you can imagine,\u201d Benfield said. Benefits to children are compelling, but moms deserve to feel better about their bodies for themselves, Benfield added. By resisting harmful ideals, moms are \u201cless burdened and feel more present and therefore more powerful in their own lives.\u201d A key step in this process involves unlearning a lot of what diet culture has taught us about the importance of thinness. \u201cIt is really important that we unpack our own weight bias,\u201d McLellan said. \u201cWe all have internalized messages because we grew up with them. And the more we\u2019re willing to start doing that work, the more deepened love we can find for ourselves.\u201d One strategy for moms to feel better about their bodies is to practice meaningful self-care. \u201cI don\u2019t mean bubble baths and fuzzy socks. I mean scheduling our pap smears, scheduling our dental work,\u201d McLellan explained. Finding weight-inclusive providers, especially for moms in larger bodies, is essential not only for body image but for overall health. By recognizing weight stigma and truly caring for ourselves, moms can start to \u201cunwrite those messages that we grew up with, thinking that our bodies are wrong or bad and instead really focusing on the importance of our overall wellness,\u201d she added. How can I support other moms? If a mother in your life is struggling with poor body image, it can be tempting to dismiss her concerns and instead offer compliments. While some mothers may appreciate this type of reassurance, it comes with the risk of backfiring because it shuts down her feelings while also reinforcing the importance of how her body looks. Really listening and trying to \u201cdecentralize appearance\u201d can often be the better way to go, according to Benfield. Friends, family and partners can express their unconditional love and even talk directly about the toxicity of our culture\u2019s unrealistic standards for women. One potential way to express empathy and start a deeper conversation could sound like this: \u201cIsn\u2019t it a shame women feel so much pressure to look a certain way, especially in this season of life?\u201d Externalizing and rejecting beauty ideals can be an opening to start resisting the other ways mothers often feel they don\u2019t measure up. There is an important reminder every mom needs to hear all year long, McLellan said: \u201cYou are already worthy. Who you are today is wonderful. You are absolutely enough, and you are doing enough.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/health/mothers-day-less-body-shaming-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_world_giant-hummingbirds-new-species-backpacks-scn", "text": "The world\u2019s largest hummingbird has been hiding in plain sight for centuries \u2014 and scientists only discovered the species is distinct from another giant species after attaching tiny backpacks to hummingbirds to understand migration patterns. Along the way, researchers also identified the longest hummingbird migration journey, which spans a 5,200-mile (8,368-kilometer) round trip, or about the distance between New York City and Buenos Aires. Questions around the giant hummingbird of South America have persisted since naturalist Charles Darwin first observed them in 1834 during his expedition aboard the HMS Beagle. Darwin observed the birds, which are about eight times the size of typical hummingbirds, breeding along the Pacific coast of Chile, but then they seemed to completely vanish after breeding. He speculated that the giant hummingbirds migrated to the Atacama Desert region, located in northern Chile. Now, new research has revealed that there are two distinct species of giant hummingbird in South America \u2014 the northern giant hummingbird that lives year-round in the Andes, and the migratory southern giant hummingbird \u2014 and they have been evolving separately for millions of years. A new study describing the birds appeared Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many animal migrations of large, charismatic species that are still totally unknown, but that was the case for southern giant hummingbirds,\u201d said lead study author Jessie Williamson, a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow and Rose Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York. \u201cWe wanted to finally solve this mystery.\u201d Designing backpacks for hummingbirds Giant hummingbirds differ from hundreds of other hummingbird species in many other ways. \u201cEverything about the giants is anomalous \u2014 they are not only far larger (two times or more) than the second largest hummingbird \u2014 but their wingbeats and heartbeats are far slower,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAnd their wings are proportionately longer, so they have a completely unique appearance in flight \u2014 almost like a hovering swift.\u201d Swifts are medium-size fast-flying birds included in the family Apodidae, which also includes hummingbirds. But studying hummingbirds, no matter their size, is an arduous task. The team worked with local landowners and residents of villages across Peru and Chile during fieldwork. \u201cCapturing Giant Hummingbirds is very challenging,\u201d said study coauthor Emil Bautista, researcher at the Centro de Ornitolog\u00eda y Biodiversidad in Lima, in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThey watch everything, and they know their territories well. We had to be strategic in choosing sites for our nets. If Giant Hummingbirds see something unusual, they won\u2019t visit that spot. They are more observant than other birds.\u201d The research team spent nine months camping in rural parts of Chile and Peru, working from sea level to the steep, cactus-strewn slopes of the Andes and going without electricity or running water for weeks at a time, Williamson said. Williamson designed a backpack harness, using a type of jewelry cord to attach a microtracking device to 57 hummingbirds in Chile. \u201cDesigning appropriate backpack harnesses for giant hummingbirds took two field seasons of trial and error, including practicing the harness design on a stuffed hummingbird finger puppet \u2026 with a paper mach\u00e9 mock-up geolocator device, plus lots of consultation with colleagues who have experience tracking small migratory birds,\u201d Williamson said. The geolocator backpacks weighed 0.3 grams and were designed to be small and light enough so they didn\u2019t interfere with the birds\u2019 style of flight. Williamson published a paper describing her design and how to safely attach it to hummingbirds in the Journal of Avian Biology in June 2021. \u201cHummingbirds are challenging to work with because they are lightweight with long wings and short legs. They\u2019re nature\u2019s tiny acrobats,\u201d she said. But it wasn\u2019t enough to catch the birds, attach the backpacks and release them \u2014 the birds had to be recaptured for the team to collect the data. The researchers were able to retrieve data from eight of the geolocators by recapturing the birds using fine mesh nets called \u201cmist nets,\u201d commonly used by ornithologists, Williamson said. What the team discovered was that migratory southern giant hummingbirds are like human mountaineers. High-altitude bird flights The geolocator data revealed that migratory giant hummingbirds can ascend from sea level to more than 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) in elevation, and their travels brought them as far north as the Peruvian Andes. But the birds don\u2019t just fly directly to these towering altitudes. Instead, like mountaineers, they pause during their ascent for days at a time to allow their blood and lungs to acclimate to lower oxygen levels. By tracking the birds\u2019 migration with geolocators and satellite transmitters, the scientists discovered what they believe to be the longest known hummingbird migration, spanning 5,200 miles (8,368 kilometers) from the Chilean coast up to the Andes in Peru and back. As the researchers studied the birds and compared them with genetic data from museum specimens, they realized there were two types of giant hummingbirds. \u201cNobody had figured out where migratory giant hummingbirds go because they were hiding among the non-migratory giant hummingbirds,\u201d said senior study author Christopher Witt, professor of biology and director of the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico, in a statement. \u201cThe two forms of giant hummingbird look almost identical \u2014 for centuries, ornithologists and birders never noticed that they were different. We couldn\u2019t have figured this out without the miniaturized trackers.\u201d A shift in migratory behavior likely drove the difference between the two species. By studying museum species, including a 154-year-old specimen, the researchers realized that the two types of giant hummingbird had been evolving separately for about 3 million years. \u201cThey are as different from each other as chimpanzees are from bonobos,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThe two species do overlap on their high elevation wintering grounds. It\u2019s mind-boggling that until now nobody figured out the Giant Hummingbird mystery, yet these two species have been separate for millions of years.\u201d The northern giant hummingbird, which lives in the high Andes year-round, has a different lung and blood capacity compared with the southern giant hummingbird. After realizing the two birds were entirely different species, the study team named the northern giant hummingbird Patagona chaski, a nod to chaskis, the Quecha word for messengers, of the Inca Empire. Quecha is a group of indigenous languages used across Peru and neighboring countries. \u201cChaski runners were surefooted sprinters, capable of speed and endurance on steep slopes, in part due to high-capacity lungs and rigorous aerobic training at high elevations,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. New bird mysteries emerge The researchers reported that both populations of giant hummingbirds are stable, and some can even be seen enjoying nectar from backyard feeders. Now that the two distinct species have been confirmed, the team wants to better understand how the populations interact, especially when they live in the same parts of the Andes during the winter. \u201cWe have to figure out where these two forms come together and how they interact,\u201d Witt said. \u201cDo they compete, is one dominant over the other, how might they partition resources, and do they mix or spatially segregate within the winter range? Lots of interesting questions to pursue!\u201d Williamson also wants to work with botanists to understand how the birds\u2019 migration patterns may have coevolved with the flowering plants the birds use for sustenance on their journeys. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in how Southern Giant Hummingbirds make such dramatic shifts in elevation during migration,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThey\u2019re like miniature mountain climbers. How do they change their physiology to facilitate these movements?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/world/giant-hummingbirds-new-species-backpacks-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_health_genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Even if your genetics put you at greater risk for early death, a healthy lifestyle could help you significantly combat it, according to a new study. That risk could be mitigated by about 62% in people with a genetic predisposition, said lead author Dr. Xifeng Wu, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejiang Univeristy School of Medicine in China. Many studies have shown the connection between a healthy lifestyle and longevity and others have underscored the genetic component in lifespan, but the report published Monday in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine explored how the two come together. With data from more than 350,000 people and information on their genetics, education, socioeconomic status and disease history, this study had strong methodology, said Dr. Aladdin Shadyab, associate professor of public health and medicine at University of California San Diego. He was not involved in the research. The sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added. The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan. Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed. And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Wu, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University. Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed. \u201cAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,\u201d Wu said. The factors that made a difference The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan. But researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death. \u201cThe study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors \u2014 no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet \u2014 that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,\u201d Wu said. Adequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults. Moderate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Making lifestyle changes Building a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there. There are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking. A CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Committing to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of \u201cMindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,\u201d said in a previous CNN article. For a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly. When it comes to catching enough z\u2019s, if you can\u2019t seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you can\u2019t sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics. And if you\u2019ve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_medical-residents-abortion-restrictions-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "Isabella Rosario Blum was wrapping up medical school and considering residency programs to become a family practice physician when she got some frank advice: If she wanted to be trained to provide abortions, she shouldn\u2019t stay in Arizona. Blum turned to programs mostly in states where abortion access \u2014 and, by extension, abortion training \u2014 is likely to remain protected, like California, Colorado, and New Mexico. Arizona has enacted a law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. \u201cI would really like to have all the training possible,\u201d she said, \u201cso of course that would have still been a limitation.\u201d In June, she will start her residency at Swedish Cherry Hill hospital in Seattle. According to new statistics from the Association of American Medical Colleges, for the second year in a row, students graduating from U.S. medical schools were less likely to apply this year for residency positions in states with abortion bans and other significant abortion restrictions. Since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, state fights over abortion access have created plenty of uncertainty for pregnant patients and their doctors. But that uncertainty has also bled into the world of medical education, forcing some new doctors to factor state abortion laws into their decisions about where to begin their careers. Fourteen states, primarily in the Midwest and South, have banned nearly all abortions.\u00a0The new analysis by the AAMC\u00a0\u2014 a preliminary copy of which was exclusively reviewed by KFF Health News before its public release \u2014 found that the number of applicants to residency programs in states with near-total abortion bans declined by 4.2%, compared with a 0.6% drop in states where abortion remains legal. Notably, the AAMC\u2019s findings illuminate the broader problems abortion bans can create for a state\u2019s medical community, particularly in an era of provider shortages: The organization tracked a larger decrease in interest in residencies in states with abortion restrictions not only among those in specialties most likely to treat pregnant patients, like OB-GYNs and emergency room doctors, but also among aspiring doctors in other specialties. \u201cIt should be concerning for states with severe restrictions on reproductive rights that so many new physicians \u2014 across specialties \u2014 are choosing to apply to other states for training instead,\u201d wrote Atul Grover, executive director of the AAMC\u2019s Research and Action Institute. The AAMC analysis found the number of applicants to OB-GYN residency programs in abortion ban states dropped by 6.7%, compared with a 0.4% increase in states where abortion remains legal. For internal medicine, the drop observed in abortion ban states was over five times as much as in states where abortion is legal. In its analysis, the AAMC said an ongoing decline in interest in ban states among new doctors ultimately \u201cmay negatively affect access to care in those states.\u201d Jack Resneck Jr., immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said the data demonstrates yet another consequence of the post-Roe v. Wade\u00a0era. The AAMC analysis notes that even in states with abortion bans, residency programs are filling their positions \u2014 mostly because there are more graduating medical students in the U.S. and abroad than there are residency slots. Still, Resneck said, \u201cwe\u2019re extraordinarily worried.\u201d For example, physicians without adequate abortion training may not be able to manage miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, or potential complications such as infection or hemorrhaging that could stem from pregnancy loss. Those who work with students and residents say their observations support the AAMC\u2019s findings. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to go to a place where evidence-based practice and human rights in general are curtailed,\u201d said Beverly Gray, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine. Abortion in North Carolina is banned in nearly all cases after 12 weeks. Women who experience unexpected complications or discover their baby has potentially fatal birth defects later in pregnancy may not be able to receive care there. Gray said she worries that even though Duke is a highly sought training destination for medical residents, the abortion ban \u201cimpacts whether we have the best and brightest coming to North Carolina.\u201d Rohini Kousalya Siva will start her obstetrics and gynecology residency at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., this year. She said she did not consider programs in states that have banned or severely restricted abortion, applying instead to programs in Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, and Washington, D.C. \u201cWe\u2019re physicians,\u201d said Kousalya Siva, who attended medical school in Virginia and was previously president of the American Medical Student Association. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be giving the best evidence-based care to our patients, and we can\u2019t do that if we haven\u2019t been given abortion training.\u201d Another consideration: Most graduating medical students are in their 20s, \u201cthe age when people are starting to think about putting down roots and starting families,\u201d said Gray, who added that she is noticing many more students ask about politics during their residency interviews. And because most young doctors make their careers in the state where they do their residencies, \u201cpeople don\u2019t feel safe potentially having their own pregnancies living in those states\u201d with severe restrictions, said Debra Stulberg, chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Chicago. Stulberg and others worry that this self-selection away from states with abortion restrictions will exacerbate the shortages of physicians in rural and underserved areas. \u201cThe geographic misalignment between where the needs are and where people are choosing to go is really problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people further concentrating in urban areas where there\u2019s already good access.\u201d After attending medical school in Tennessee, which has adopted one of the most sweeping abortion bans in the nation, Hannah Light-Olson will start her OB-GYN residency at the University of California-San Francisco this summer. It was not an easy decision, she said. \u201cI feel some guilt and sadness leaving a situation where I feel like I could be of some help,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel deeply indebted to the program that trained me, and to the patients of Tennessee.\u201d Light-Olson said some of her fellow students applied to programs in abortion ban states \u201cbecause they think we need pro-choice providers in restrictive states now more than ever.\u201d In fact, she said, she also applied to programs in ban states when she was confident the program had a way to provide abortion training. \u201cI felt like there was no perfect, 100% guarantee; we\u2019ve seen how fast things can change,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel particularly confident that California and New York aren\u2019t going to be under threat, too.\u201d As a condition of a scholarship she received for medical school, Blum said, she will have to return to Arizona to practice, and it is unclear what abortion access will look like then. But she is worried about long-term impacts. \u201cResidents, if they can\u2019t get the training in the state, then they\u2019re probably less likely to settle down and work in the state as well,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2023_11_06_health_parkinsons-spinal-cord-implant-study", "text": "Marc Gauthier can now step into an elevator without his body stiffening and freezing in place. He can take a 3-mile lakeside stroll without stopping. He can stand up out of a chair with ease. For Gauthier, 63, who has been living with Parkinson\u2019s disease for almost three decades, these everyday activities were a challenge \u2014 until now. \u201cWalking in a store would be really difficult, impossible before, because of the freezing of gait that would often happen in those environments. And now, it just doesn\u2019t happen anymore. I don\u2019t have freezing anymore,\u201d Gauthier, who lives near Bordeaux, France, said in a news briefing, speaking in French that was translated to English. In a new study, Gauthier was surgically implanted with an experimental spinal cord neuroprosthesis to correct walking disorders in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Step by step, he said, it has helped him get his stride back. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, details how the neuroprosthesis works by targeting specific areas of the spinal cord with electrical stimulation that are associated with walking. \u201cAddressing deficits of gait and balance in Parkinson\u2019s disease is extremely challenging. These deficits can be very heterogenous. They can be variable across patients. They can affect walking but also symmetry, balance, posture,\u201d Dr. Eduardo Moraud, an author of the study and researcher at Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland said during the news briefing. \u201cThe neuroprosthetic approach that we have developed here allows for the first time to target and address these problems individually in a highly specific manner for each patient,\u201d Moraud said. \u201cIt operates in real time, and importantly, it is complementary to other existing therapies.\u201d Parkinson\u2019s disease, a degenerative brain disorder, causes parts of the brain to deteriorate. Symptoms related to walking occur when the nerve cells in the brain\u2019s basal ganglia area, which controls movement, become impaired or die. These nerve cells normally produce dopamine but, when they die or become impaired, the lack of dopamine often impacts a person\u2019s ability to move, walk or balance. About 90% of people with the disease experience locomotor deficits. While there is currently no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease, some therapies \u2014 such as deep brain stimulation or medications to increase dopamine levels \u2014 may relieve symptoms. Gauthier, a father of two, was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s when he was 36 years old and was previously treated with dopamine replacement therapy and then deep brain stimulation in 2004 to help with tremors and stiffness. But more recently, as the disease progressed, he developed severe walking disorders that did not respond to either therapy. His body would often stiffen, he said, and he had falls about four times a day on average, forcing him to stop his work as an architect. Then, Gauthier was invited to participate in the new study to test the experimental spinal cord neuroprosthesis. At first he declined because of the time commitment, he said, but then changed his mind, took a \u201cchance\u201d and said yes. Stimulating the spinal cord To develop the implant, researchers from France, Switzerland and other institutions around the world visualized and mapped which hotspots in the lower spinal cord the neuroprosthesis must target with electrical stimulation to alleviate gait impairments and balance problems in a patient with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \u201cThe stimulation here is focused on the spinal cord,\u201d Moraud said. \u201cWe target the region of the spinal cord that will control all the leg movements.\u201d The researchers identified six hotspots to facilitate walking. Next, they implanted an array of electrodes against the lower region of Gauthier\u2019s spinal cord to target those zones. The electrodes were linked to a neural stimulator placed under the skin in the region of the abdomen. That stimulator was programmed to apply electrical stimulation to the spinal cord. \u201cThe connection between the electrode and the stimulator is under the skin, everything is hidden, and you control the device with a remote control,\u201d neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyn Bloch, an author of the study and professor at Lausanne University Hospital, said during the briefing. The surgery was performed at Lausanne University Hospital about two years ago. And after a few months of rehabilitation with the neuroprosthetic stimulation, Gauthier has regained the ability to walk independently using the implant. He also has the option to wear sensors on his legs to receive more of a stimulation. Signals from the wearable sensors can help synchronize epidural electrical stimulation to movements and reinforce movements. Overall, the neuroprosthesis, based on epidural electrical stimulation, helped to \u201cpromote longer steps, improve balance and reduce freezing of gait,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study. Gauthier now uses his neuroprosthetic for about eight hours a day, turning on the stimulator in the morning and then turning it off when he is sitting down for long periods of time or sleeping. Gauthier said during the news briefing that he feels a little tingling on the legs with the stimulation, but it doesn\u2019t bother him, and he joked that his wife is \u201cvery happy\u201d that he now can get outdoors on his own while she can enjoy some quiet time at home. But this is not a cure. The researchers expect his Parkinson\u2019s disease to still progress. \u201cWith this spinal cord stimulation, we still have an effect, but we have to fight against worse and more severe symptoms,\u201d Bloch said. \u201cBut we can still give him, with the therapy, a bit of quality of life.\u201d \u2018An exciting development\u2019 This proof-of-concept study is \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201cimpressive,\u201d Dr. Svjetlana Miocinovic, a\u00a0neurologist specializing in Parkinson\u2019s disease and associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine, said in an email. \u201cThis is an exciting development as better treatments for gait and balance impairment in PD are desperately needed,\u201d said Miocinovic, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt will be important to demonstrate that gait benefit observed in this study is specifically due to spinal stimulation (so comparisons with sham stimulation are important), that it can be achieved in other patients with PD,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd that it can be deployed\u00a0in clinical practice (technology needs to be streamlined sufficiently for clinicians to implement and for patients to use).\u201d \ufeffThis technology not only needs to be tested in more people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, but also those who had not previously received deep brain stimulation as a therapy, David Dexter, director of research at Parkinson\u2019s UK, said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre. \u201cThis has so far only been tried in one individual with Parkinson\u2019s who already had Deep Brain Stimulation. We now need to see this be tested in many more people with the condition, including those without DBS, in clinical trials to further explore the potential benefits and side effects/risks of this experimental new therapy,\u201d said Dexter, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cThis is quite an invasive procedure\u00a0but could be a game changing technology to help restore movement in people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s where the drugs are no longer working well,\u201d he said. \u201cThis research is still at a very early stage and requires much more development and testing before it can be made available to people with Parkinson\u2019s, however this is a significant and exciting step forward and we hope to see this research progress quickly.\u201d A second patient already has started the process of this therapy, Moraud said in the news briefing, and the researchers plan to conduct clinical tests next year in six other patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. This work is being supported by a $1 million donation from the Michael J. Fox Foundation. And in partnership with the Netherlands-based medical technology company ONWARD Medical, Bloch and Gre\u0301goire Courtine, an author of the study and professor of neuroscience at the Lausanne University Hospital, are working on developing a commercial version of the neuroprosthesis. \u201cThe idea is, really after this first phase, to launch a larger scale clinical trial to really validate the therapy,\u201d Courtine said during the news briefing, adding that this ongoing research will take some time, \u201cat least five years of development and tests.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/06/health/parkinsons-spinal-cord-implant-study/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

An international coalition of astronomers has newly discovered an unusual planet, dubbed WASP-193b, that\u2019s about 50% bigger than Jupiter and somehow still the second lightest planet ever found. But WASP-193b, located beyond our solar system about 1,200 light-years from Earth, isn\u2019t just a scientific oddity. The exoplanet could also be key to future research investigating atypical planetary formation, according to a study describing the find that published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy. This cotton candy planet isn\u2019t alone; there are other similar planets belonging to a class scientists facetiously call \u201cpuffy Jupiters.\u201d The lightest planet ever discovered is the superpuffy Kepler 51d, which is nearly the size of Jupiter but a hundred times lighter than the gas giant. Puffy Jupiters have largely been a mystery for 15 years, said lead study author Khalid Barkaoui. But WASP-193b, because of its size, is an ideal candidate for further analysis by the James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories. \u201cThe planet is so light that it\u2019s difficult to think of an analogous, solid-state material,\u201d said Barkaoui, a postdoctoral researcher of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a news release. \u201cThe reason why it\u2019s close to cotton candy is because both are mostly made of light gases rather than solids. The planet is basically super fluffy.\u201d Low-density planet presents big challenge WASP-193b, which researchers think is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, was a huge puzzle for researchers to piece together. Because the exoplanet\u2019s density is so light for its size, calculating its mass became a challenge. Usually, scientists determine mass using a technique called radial velocity, in which researchers analyze how a star\u2019s spectrum, a graph that indicates the intensity of light emissions in wavelengths, shifts as a planet orbits it. The bigger the planet, the more the star\u2019s spectrum can shift \u2014 but this didn\u2019t work for WASP-193b, which is so light, it didn\u2019t make any pull on the star that the team could detect. Because of how small the mass signal was, it took the team four years to gather data and calculate WASP-193b\u2019s mass, Barkaoui explained. Because the extremely low numbers they found were so rare, the researchers completed multiple trials of data analysis, just to be sure. \u201cWe were initially getting extremely low densities, which were very difficult to believe in the beginning,\u201d said co-lead author Francisco Pozuelos, a senior researcher at Spain\u2019s Institute of Astrophysics of Andalucia, in a news release. Eventually the team discovered the planet\u2019s mass is a measly 14% that of Jupiter, despite being so much bigger. But a bigger size means a bigger \u201cextended atmosphere,\u201d said study coauthor Julien de Wit, an associate professor of planetary science at MIT. That means WASP-193b provides an especially useful window into these puffy planets\u2019 formation. \u201cThe bigger a planet\u2019s atmosphere, the more light can go through,\u201d de Wit told CNN. \u201cSo it\u2019s clear that this planet is one of the best targets we have for studying atmospheric effects. It will be a Rosetta Stone to try and resolve the mystery of puffy Jupiters.\u201d But it\u2019s also not clear how WASP-193b even formed, Barkaoui said. The \u201cclassical evolution models\u201d of gas giants don\u2019t quite explain the phenomenon. \u201cWASP-193b is an outlier of all planets discovered to date,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/world/cotton-candy-exoplanet-discovery-wasp-193b-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_fda-blood-donations-malaria", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration is considering a requirement for blood banks to use a new test that can detect the parasites that cause malaria in certain donors\u2019 blood, and it\u2019s seeking the opinion of its independent advisers on the best way to meet its goal of zero transfusion-related cases without unnecessarily prohibiting some people from donating blood.  The World Health Organization says malaria is a significant global health issue, with 249 million cases and more than 608,000 deaths in 2022 alone. Malaria is not considered a big threat to the US blood supply like it is in some other countries. But nearly 28 million US residents travel to parts of the world where malaria is common each year, the FDA says, and as more Americans travel and as the planet gets warmer, scientists have predicted that the disease could\u00a0become more likely in the US, even with aggressive mosquito control. As late as the 1940s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday in a presentation to the FDA\u2019s advisory committee, the US had about 65,000 cases of malaria a year \u2013 but that changed when the country needed healthy service members to fight in World War II. Knowing that many would train in malaria-prone areas in the South, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s government waged a war on mosquitoes that paid off. By 1949, according to the CDC, malaria was no longer considered a significant health problem in the US, and WHO declared the US free of the disease in 1970. The US still has about 2,000 cases a year, according to the CDC, but most are travel-related. The CDC noted that although the risk of locally acquired malaria in the US continues to be \u201cextremely low,\u201d just last summer, it warned doctors to watch for locally acquired cases. There were a handful of non-travel-related cases in Texas, Florida, Maryland and Arkansas last year, the first locally acquired malaria cases in the US since 2003. In March, the FDA approved the first test intended to screen donor blood for the evidence of malaria. The Cobas malaria test, made by Roche, can detect RNA and DNA from the parasite that causes malaria in donor blood, organs and tissue. Malaria transmission through a blood transfusion is not common, but an infection can trigger severe symptoms and even death, studies show. A CDC study found that from 1963 through 1999, there were just 93 cases spread through donated blood in the US, but 10 of those people died. Another study found 13 malaria cases related to blood donations between 2000 and 2021, the FDA said, but seven of the cases involved\ufeff donors who met current FDA eligibility criteria. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, and it doesn\u2019t prevent all cases,\u201d Jennifer Scharpf, associate director for policy in the agency\u2019s Office of Blood Research and Review, said of the current guidelines. The FDA told the committee Wednesday that its current guidance comes with a high level of \u201ccomplexity\u201d and that blood bank workers must assess several potential risk factors. Blood banks use a donor history questionnaire to screen for people who have had malaria or who lived in a country where the disease is endemic in the past three years. People are also deferred from donating if they have traveled to a country with endemic malaria in the previous three months; or if they were a resident of a malaria-endemic country, if they have spent less than three consecutive years in a country where malaria is endemic, or if they have a history of travel to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three years. The rules are slightly different for platelet and plasma component collection. \ufeffThese questionnaires have limitations, and the screening process is \u201cerror-prone,\u201d the FDA said. Deferral periods may also not be sufficient to catch asymptomatic donors, particularly for residents of countries where malaria is common, because they may have partial immunity from a previous infection\ufeff. On the other hand, the current guidance disqualifies a large group of healthy potential donors, the FDA said. Some estimates say that between 1% and 3% of all donors are turned away based on travel history alone, and blood banks say they can never get enough donors. Scharpf told the committee that about 50,000 to 160,000 donors may be deferred annually, and studies show that many\ufeff people who are deferred often don\u2019t return, even when they are eligible to donate. The FDA is considering a couple of strategies to update its guidelines. The first consideration is to do selective testing of a donor\u2019s blood based on their history of malaria infection, having traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months or having ever lived in a malaria-endemic country. Another option is to test all donors at least one time and then to selectively test donations from people at risk of exposure, including those who had ever had malaria and those who had traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months. Most of the advisory\ufeff committee members seemed to favor the first option, saying the second seemed like overkill. \u201cIt\u2019s such a low incidence of disease, and it\u2019s treatable,\u201d said committee member Dr. Richard Scanlan, a professor, vice chair of the Laboratory Medicine Transfusion Service and medical director at Oregon Health & Science University. The FDA is also considering requiring testing of all blood donated in areas where there was even one locally transmitted malaria case recently, but the committee members seemed less sure about this idea. Committee member Dr. Sanjay Ahuja, director of Rainbow Hemostasis & Thrombosis Center at Rainbow Babies & Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland, said that if there is proven local transmission, the decision of \ufeffwhen to test all donor blood from the area is a \u201cdifficult one.\u201d \u201cThere are so many nuances to this,\u201d Ahuja said. \u201cI think it might be a little bit much in my opinion, but I don\u2019t know whether more evidence of local transmission should be in place before we say \u2018yes\u2019 to this.\u201d During the meeting\u2019s public comment period, leaders of some\ufeff blood supply organizations encouraged the FDA to take a cautious approach to changing the guidelines. Ralph Vassallo, incoming chair of the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies\u00a0Transfusion Transmitted Disease Committee, said his group joins\ufeff America\u2019s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross in believing that the new test for malaria holds real promise to improve blood safety and may improve the availability of donors by removing \u201cunnecessary donor deferrals,\u201d particularly among subsets of donors with uncommon blood types, such as those from Latin American, Asian and African countries. But, he told the committee, there are no clinical studies that show that the test reduces the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria. Vassallo also encouraged the FDA to use flexible testing strategies and said that although the groups supported limited testing of all donations in ZIP codes with local malaria transmission, one case should not be enough to trigger such testing. \u201cFDA should support formal modeling studies designed in consultation with malariologists using the best available assumptions about parasite levels during asymptomatic infection before issuing final guidance,\u201d he said. The committee did not vote on the proposed strategies, but the FDA said it would take the discussion into consideration as it considered changing its guidance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/fda-blood-donations-malaria/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_05_15_health_overdose-deaths-decrease-2023", "text": "After a steep rise during the Covid-19 pandemic, preliminary data shows that drug overdose deaths in the United States ticked down in 2023 for the first time in five years. About 107,500 people died from a drug overdose in 2023, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics \u2014 about 3,500 fewer than in 2022. Last year\u2019s decrease is the first since 2018, but the 3% drop is far less substantial than the surges that pushed overdose deaths to record levels in recent years. Overdose deaths\u00a0spiked\u00a030% between 2019 and 2020 and rose another 15% between 2020 and 2021, CDC data shows. Preliminary data is subject to change as death certificates are reviewed and records are assessed, but estimates suggest that, despite the decline, overdose deaths in 2023 were still almost twice as high as they were five years ago, according to the CDC data. \u201cIt is a hopeful trend in some ways,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Keyes, a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health whose research focuses on substance use epidemiology. \u201cWe know that this drug epidemic is dynamic and changes quite quickly, so any time you see a leveling off or a slight decrease, it is promising. It is certainly not a sign that we need to take the foot off the gas of overdose prevention.\u201d The US Department of Health and Human Services launched a coordinated national strategy to prevent overdoses two years ago. \u201cThis progress over the last 12 months should make us want to reinvigorate our efforts knowing that our strategies are making a difference,\u201d CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry\u00a0said in a statement, but \u201cthere are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses at staggering numbers.\u201d \u201cOur thoughts remain with those who have lost loved ones and those who are struggling with addiction or know someone who is.\u00a0Our country is committed to ending this epidemic and preventing unnecessary death and suffering,\u201d she said. Fentanyl has been driving the latest wave of overdose deaths, with synthetic opioids involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths. These highly potent narcotics continue to play an outsized role: they were involved in nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023. However, there were about 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023 than in 2022, the new data shows. Still, the deadly threat of fentanyl \u2014 which is about 50 times more potent than heroin \u2014 remains. In one indicator of its pervasiveness, a study published Monday shows that law enforcement seizures of illicit fentanyl have surged in recent years. More than 115 million pills containing illicit fentanyl were seized by law enforcement in 2023, compared with about 71 million in 2022 and less than 50,000 in 2017. \u201cFentanyl has continued to infiltrate the drug supply in communities across the United States and it is a very dangerous time to use drugs, even just occasionally,\u201d Dr. Nora Volkow, director of National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a statement. She was not directly involved in the new study, but the research was funded by the federal agency. \u201cIllicit pills are made to look identical to real prescription pills, but can actually contain fentanyl. It is urgently important that people know that any pills given to someone by a friend, purchased on social media, or received from any source other than a pharmacy could be potentially deadly \u2014 even after a single ingestion.\u201d The number of deaths due to fentanyl remains \u201calarmingly high,\u201d Keyes said. But the more promising trends reflect significant, multi-pronged efforts from many different sectors, she said, including use of treatments for opioid use disorder, expanded access to naloxone and other harm reduction programs and reducing opioid prescribing. \u201cI think that has been a real success story for public health,\u201d she said. While overdose deaths involving opioids declined, those involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamine increased, according to the preliminary data from the CDC. There were more than 36,000 deaths involving psychostimulants in 2023, a 2% increase from the year before. And deaths involving cocaine rose 5%, to nearly 30,000. About a third of all overdose deaths in 2023 involved psychostimulants, and cocaine was involved in more than a quarter. Much of this increase is likely due to the proliferation of fentanyl throughout the drug supply, Keyes said. \u201cWe know that when stimulants mix with opioids, it\u2019s particularly lethal,\u201d she said. But expanded surveillance can help those who are working to address the overdose crisis understand its rapidly changing epidemiology and adapt their efforts in real-time. Vast disparities in overdose deaths remain, including state-level differences; the latest CDC data shows \u201cnotable\u201d increases in some Western states such as Washington and Oregon, with overdose deaths increasing at least 27% year-over-year. In other states, including Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana and Maine, overdose deaths dropped by at least 15%. \u201cState-to-state differences point to the need for continued expansion of these efforts,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cBut I think the trends you see nationally are indicative of how it can work. We can address the opioid epidemic. This is not inevitable.\u201d For many state and local governments, funds from opioid settlements have been \u201cinstrumental\u201d to overdose prevention efforts and increased access to treatment and recovery support, Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, jurisdictions will continue to prioritize investments in harm reduction, prevention, and addressing the social determinants of health across communities that have been hardest hit by the overdose crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, state and territorial health agencies will continue to coordinate with partners to build a comprehensive response to this complex public health issue. Lastly, jurisdictions will continue to monitor and prepare to respond to changes in overdose rates and emerging threats within the drug supply.\u201d Recent surveys suggest that drug use among teens in the US has been relatively low and trending down. But overdose deaths have been rising in this age group and millions of adults and adolescents have a drug use disorder. \u201cResearch has shown that delaying the start of substance use among young people, even by one year, can decrease substance use for the rest of their lives. We may be seeing this play out in real time,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cThis trend is reassuring. Though, it remains crucial to continue to educate young people about the risks and harms of substance use in an open and honest way, emphasizing that illicit pills and other substances may contain deadly fentanyl.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/overdose-deaths-decrease-2023/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_internet-greater-well-being-study-wellness", "text": "The internet is ruining our lives, right? Not necessarily, according to a new study. \u201cNearly everyone seems to think that internet-powered technologies are driving an epidemic of ill-being and mental health problems,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Matti Vuorre, assistant professor of social psychology at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, in an email. \u201cOur study of over two million individuals from 160+ countries runs contrary to this idea.\u201d People with access to home internet and/or mobile internet and actively use internet report greater well-being across eight different categories \u2014 including life satisfaction and social life, according to a study published Monday in the journal Technology, Mind, and Behavior. Researchers analyzed data from nearly 2.5 million people across 168 countries using the annual Gallup World Poll, trying to answer the following question: Do individuals who have access and actively use the internet report greater or lower levels of well-being than those who do not? \u201cBecause even such a simple question can be statistically answered in many different ways, we analyzed the data in tens of thousands of different ways,\u201d he added. Across all those ways of crunching the numbers, about 85% showed that those who have and use the internet report greater well-being that those who do not, according to the research. The global perspective is useful, and the data analysis of the research is strong, said Dr. Markus Appel, professor of the psychology of communication and new media at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany. He was not involved in the research. Other research has shown that the connection between mobile internet use and well-being is complex and varies among individuals, he added. \u201cThe internet is neither a curse (nor) a blessing for people\u2019s well-being,\u201d Appel said. \u201cIt depends on what people do with it.\u201d Online users report greater well-being This study was observational, meaning that the data doesn\u2019t show that the internet access necessarily caused the better well-being \u2014 there might be other factors responsible for the association. \u201cOur results might then simply indicate that individuals with more money, access to healthcare, etc, report greater well-being,\u201d Vuorre said in an email. The researchers accounted for that in their data and tried to adjust for factors such as income levels and still found that internet users reported greater well-being than those non-internet users, Vuorre said. Cut the internet or keep scrolling? The internet is used for a wide variety of things \u2014 including online banking, shopping, finding services, reading the news and cyberbullying \u2014 and those different uses will have different effects on well-being, Vuorre said. Much of life has moved online very quickly, and it hasn\u2019t left much time to investigate all the impacts of the internet, he added. \u201cWe as a society and/or academic scientists don\u2019t have time to sufficiently learn and develop methodology to address each panic carefully and therefore do not learn sufficiently to be able to inform policy and make conclusions with confidence,\u201d Vuorre said. \u201cCaution is warranted on all sides.\u201d Many studies have shown concerning connections between social media use and mental health, particularly among younger people. Scrolling through images of other people\u2019s lives and comparing them with your own has been associated with a poor effect on mood, for example. Before institutions advise harsh limitations on computers and mobile phones, more research is needed on both the potential harms and benefits, Vuorre said. \u201cAlthough prominent narratives and the cautionary principle might suggest draconian limitations to technology use, ours and many other findings provide a much more nuanced and mixed view,\u201d he added. To get the best out of your internet use, Appel recommends being mindful of your own experience. \u201cIf you sense that some activity on the internet makes you feel sad or envious \u2014 stop it.

The dead giveaway? It\u2019s the yummy, spicy, cheesy, neon-orange dust that coats each morsel and gets all over your fingers. Ditto for a frozen pizza and chicken nuggets. But what about a granola bar? An applesauce pouch? String cheese? Flavored yogurt? Surely these foods \u2014 snacks that millions of children and adults eat every day \u2014 are not bad, right? Well, it turns out that many fall under the category of ultraprocessed foods \u2014 depending on their exact ingredients. This type of food has been studied a lot lately, and the results aren\u2019t great. Ultraprocessed foods represent a relatively new way of categorizing foods. Proposed in 2009 by researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, the system, called NOVA, is based not on what kind of food it is \u2014 meat, grains, vegetables, etc. \u2014 but rather on how processed it is. NOVA separates foods into four groups, starting with natural and minimally processed foods in the first category to ultraprocessed foods, which use industrial formulations and manufacturing techniques, in the fourth. \u201cMy operating definition for ultraprocessed (foods) is you can\u2019t make it in your home kitchen because you don\u2019t have the machinery and you don\u2019t have the ingredients,\u201d food policy expert Dr. Marion Nestle told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell on the Chasing Life podcast recently. Nestle is the Paulette Goddard Professor of nutrition, food studies and public health, emerita, at New York University. Listen to more of the conversation between Nestle and Tirrell here. Ultraprocessed foods contain additives such as flavor enhancers, colors and thickeners \u2014 basically ingredients you wouldn\u2019t usually use in your cooking.\u00a0It makes them shelf-stable, easy to prepare (just heat and serve) and in many cases hard to resist. (The food industry pushes back on the NOVA system, saying there is no agreed-upon scientific consensus on the definition of ultraprocessed.) Due to a confluence of historical, regulatory and economic factors, Nestle said, food companies in the 1980s \u201cdid a lot of work on trying to figure out what flavor and texture and color combinations would be most attractive to people and started producing foods that would make them lots of money.\u201d She said tens of thousands of new products have hit store shelves since then. \u201cMost of them fail, but the ones that win, win big,\u201d Nestle said. Before you reach for that can of soda, bag of chips or frozen dinner, why not learn more about what you\u2019re eating? Here are five things to know about ultraprocessed foods: Ultraprocessed foods are linked to bad health outcomes Eating a lot of ultraprocessed foods isn\u2019t healthy. \u201cNow there have been more than 1,500 observational studies \u2014 all of them demonstrating a consistent finding, which is that eating ultraprocessed foods is linked to obesity,\u00a0type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, bad outcome from Covid-19, overall mortality,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cAny bad health problem you can think of that\u2019s related to diet is related specifically to ultraprocessed foods.\u201d The most recent study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, analyzed more than 30 years\u2019 worth of data and found that eating ultraprocessed foods was associated with a 4% higher risk of death by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths. Other studies have linked ultraprocessed foods to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Nestle pointed out that these studies have been observational and not designed to prove causation \u2014 that ultraprocessed foods caused these bad health outcomes. \u201cYou can do that when you have a controlled clinical trial,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd guess what? We have one.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods cause weight gain That one randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that ultraprocessed foods actually caused people to gain weight. These types of studies are not easy or cheap to undertake, which is why they are not done more often. To conduct this one, Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, had 20 volunteers spend four weeks living at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. For two weeks, they ate a diet made up of 80% healthy ultraprocessed foods (think yogurt and whole wheat bread, not chips and soda). For the other two weeks, they ate a diet that contained no ultraprocessed foods. The diets were matched, among other things, for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients. Participants did not know what exactly the study was measuring. \u201cWe basically just asked people, you know, just eat as much or as little of the food that you\u2019d like,\u201d Hall told Tirrell. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be trying to change your weight, (you) shouldn\u2019t be trying to gain weight or lose weight.\u00a0Just eat to the same level of appetite as you normally would.\u201d Researchers found that when the participants were on the ultraprocessed diet, they ate about 500 calories more per day than when they were on the minimally processed one. This difference in calories translated quickly to the scale. Participants gained on average 2 pounds during the two weeks on the ultraprocessed diet and lost 2 pounds on the minimally processed one. And their blood work showed lower markers of inflammation when they were on the latter. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with nutrition research, you have no idea what an important finding this is,\u201d said Nestle, who was not involved in the study. \u201cFive hundred calories is huge.\u201d Hall said it\u2019s unclear what drives people to consume more calories when they are on an ultraprocessed diet. \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re really interested in now,\u201d he said, \u201cis to figure out what the mechanisms were.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods are hard to avoid Ultraprocessed foods are everywhere, and most of us consume them without even realizing it \u2014 even when you think you are eating something relatively healthy, such as baked potato chips or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, researchers found that ultraprocessed foods make up more than half of American adults\u2019 diets. For US children, that percentage is even higher, at 67%. Ultraprocessed foods are cheap and convenient Yup, that\u2019s right: Truly eating \u201cclean\u201d costs more. \u201cTo actually create the minimally processed menu, it was about 40% more expensive than the ultraprocessed menu,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even account for the time that it takes to make the foods, right? So, all those factors probably play a huge role in \u2026 the foods that we choose to eat in the real world.\u201d Not all ultraprocessed foods are bad Some ultraprocessed foods can provide important nutrients, such as whole wheat bread and yogurt. And others, in Hall\u2019s study, were shown not to increase caloric intake. \u201cThe snacks were neutral in terms of how many calories (the participants) ate,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhich goes to show that not all ultraprocessed foods necessarily drive this effect.\u201d Hall\u2019s team is conducting a new study to tease out which ultraprocessed foods are harmful and which are neutral, or even healthy. Americans may soon get more help sorting through the health effects of ultraprocessed foods. The US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration will soon issue new Dietary Guidelines, which are updated every five years. Nestle said that the scientific advisory committee guiding this process has been asked to consider the connection between ultraprocessed foods and poor health outcomes. We hope these five things help you understand ultraprocessed foods a bit more.

{"id": "2024_05_09_health_bird-flu-cows-human-receptors", "text": "In early March, Dr. Barb Petersen, a large-animal vet in Texas, began getting calls from the dairy farms she works with in the Panhandle.\u00a0Workers there were seeing a lot of cows with mastitis, an infection of the udder. Their milk was thickened and discolored, and it couldn\u2019t be explained by any of the usual suspects such as bacteria or tissue damage. Several more dairies called.\u00a0One owner told her he thought his farm had \u201cwhatever is going around, and half of my pets have died,\u201d indicating that the contagion had moved beyond cattle. After running a battery of tests and ruling out every cause she could think of, Petersen sent samples from sick and dead animals to the Texas A&M state veterinary lab and to friends and colleagues at Iowa State University. What they found \u2013 loads of the H5N1 influenza virus \u2013 has rocked the dairy industry and put public health officials around the world on alert. It also created an urgent scientific to-do list. One of the first questions that needed to be answered was how the virus was infecting cows in the first place. Researchers in the US and Denmark took on that task. Their findings, published as a preprint study, show that cows have the same receptors for flu viruses as humans and birds. Scientists fear that cows could be mixing bowls \u2013 hosts that help the virus learn to better spread between people. Such an event, while rare, experts say, could put us on the path to another pandemic. Bird flu tries out new hosts For years, H5N1, or highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been primarily confined to the bird population, but it has recently begun to infect a growing number of mammals, suggesting that the virus might be adapting and moving closer to becoming a human pathogen. Avian flu viruses have decimated commercial poultry flocks in the US, and because pigs are known to catch bird flu viruses, swine have been closely monitored for signs of infection \u2013 but cows weren\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar as potential hosts. Since late March, 42 infected herds have been found in nine states, according to the the US Department of Agriculture. Only one person has been found to be infected with H5N1 after contact with infected cows, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health is low, although it is working with states to monitor people with animal exposures. \u201cThe finding in cattle has been so different,\u201d said Dr. Lars Larsen, a professor of veterinary clinical microbiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In mammals, influenza typically infects the lungs. In cats, it can also infect the brain. \u201cHere we see an enormous amount of virus in the mammary and in the milk,\u201d Larsen said. Larsen said the concentration of H5N1 viruses in the milk of infected cows is 1,000 times higher than typically seen in infected birds.\u00a0He said he and his colleagues calculated that even if the milk from a single infected cow were diluted in 1,000 tons of milk, scientists would still be able to pick up traces of the virus in lab tests. Tests by the US Food and Drug Administration found inert fragments of genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 out of 5 samples of milk purchased on grocery store shelves, raising questions about how the virus had become so widespread. Researchers confirmed in later tests that the pasteurized milk it tested wasn\u2019t infectious and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick. That hasn\u2019t stopped the outbreak from rattling more than a few nerves. There\u2019s big money riding on the health of cows. Milk and dairy products were the fourth largest agricultural commodity in the US in terms of cash receipts in 2022, according to the USDA\u2019s economic research service. Sales of cattle and calves were the second largest commodity. How viruses break into cells Viruses need a way to hack into cells.\u00a0For the virus that causes Covid-19, the key is a receptor called ACE2.\u00a0For flu viruses, it\u2019s a sugar molecule that sticks up from the surface of cells called a sialic acid. Different animals carry different forms, or shapes, of sialic acids. Birds have sialic acid receptors that are slightly different shapes from than the ones humans have in their upper respiratory tracts. If you hold your index finger straight up, that\u2019s kind of what a bird\u2019s sialic acid receptor looks like, says Dr. Andy Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0If you bend your finger at the knuckle into an upside-down L, that\u2019s what human sialic acid receptor looks like. Flu viruses tend to prefer to bind to one shape over the other, he said. Researchers think this may be one reason why H5N1, which originated in birds, hasn\u2019t been shown to spread efficiently between people. Until recently, nobody knew what kind of sialic acid receptors cows had, because it was believed that they didn\u2019t catch A-strain flu viruses like H5N1. Larsen and his colleagues in the US and Denmark took tissue samples from the lungs, windpipes, brains and mammary glands of calves and cows and stained them with compounds that they knew would attach to different kinds of sialic acid receptors.\u00a0They sliced the stained tissues very thinly and peered at them under a microscope. What they saw was surprising: The tiny milk-producing sacs of the udder, called alveoli, were brimming with sialic acid receptors, and they had both the kind of receptors associated with birds and those that are more common in people.\u00a0Almost every cell they looked at contained both types of receptors, said lead study author Dr. Charlotte Kristensen, a postdoctoral researcher in veterinary pathology at the University of Copenhagen. That finding has raised concern because one way flu viruses change and evolve is by swapping pieces of their genetic material with other flu viruses.\u00a0This process, called reassortment, requires that a cell be infected with two different flu viruses at the same time. \u201cIf you get both viruses in the same cell at the same time, you can essentially get hybrid viruses coming out of it,\u201d said study author Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. In order to be infected simultaneously with two flu viruses \u2013 a bird flu virus and a human flu virus \u2013 a cell would need to have both kinds of sialic acid receptors, which cows do, something that wasn\u2019t known before this study. \u201cI think this is probably a pretty rare event,\u201d said Webby, who has been studying the H5N1 virus for 25 years. In order for something like that to happen, a cow infected with the bird flu virus would need to pick up a different flu strain from an infected human.\u00a0Currently, human flu infections are low across the country and dropping as flu season winds down, making the possibility of something like this happening even more remote. Still, it\u2019s not unheard-of. Pigs also have both human and bird sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tracts, and flu infections in pigs have been known to spark pandemic viruses.\u00a0The 2009 pandemic caused by H1N1 influenza, for example, is believed to have started in pigs in Mexico when the virus reassorted to become one that was able to spread quickly between people. Another way the bird flu virus could change in cows, Webby says, is more gradual \u2013 and more common. Each time a virus copies itself, it makes mistakes.\u00a0Sometimes, those mistakes make the virus less potent and hurt its chances of survival, but in other instances, they\u2019re happy accidents \u2013 at least for the virus.\u00a0If a bird flu virus happened to change in a way that made it able to bind more easily to the human-type sialic acid receptors in cows, it could gain a survival advantage: the ability to infect more cells and more types of animals, like humans. Viruses can shift and drift Reassortment would be a big shift in the evolution of the virus, but the gradual passage of the virus through new hosts could also result in a change to the virus\u2019 genome by evolutionary drift. Either way, it\u2019s not good news, said Dr. Sam Scarpino, a computational biologist and director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University. \u201cWe now have a piece of data that suggests the risk profile is higher,\u201d said Scarpino, who was not involved in the new study. He notes that this is early research.\u00a0It needs to be confirmed by a different group of researchers, and it was published quickly as a preprint ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. But he said the findings are also important because no one had really looked to at the susceptibility of cow tissues to influenza A viruses before. \u201cThis is the first that I\u2019m aware of. It doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t another one out there, but a number of us looked at it pretty carefully and didn\u2019t find any,\u201d he said. Kristensen said the researchers also couldn\u2019t find any prior research on it, which is why they did the study. \u201cWe just felt that, given the situation, that we should go out with these results as fast as possible,\u201d Larsen said. Other experts said that although there are more dots to connect, the study clearly raises the level of alert. \u201cI think we now have more than enough information to conclude that what has to happen is, we need to stop transmission in dairy cattle,\u201d Scarpino said. \u201cWe need to increase the kinds of protection that are mandated for workers that are in close contact with cows and milk products and significantly increase the funding that\u2019s going into understanding influenza and in cows, because there\u2019s just a huge amount that we don\u2019t know that we need to learn very quickly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/bird-flu-cows-human-receptors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_skin-cancer-screening-wellness", "text": "Skin cancer is by far the most common form of cancer in the United States, according to the\u00a0American Cancer Society. With summer coming in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s time to check in with CNN wellness expert and emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen about the dangers of skin cancer and the need for safe sun exposure. As we head into summer, what do we need to know about the chance of developing skin cancer? And how can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration needs to be checked out? Which health care provider should be contacted if there is a concern? Should people get full-body skin cancer screening exams? Are self-exams useful? Wen has some answers for us, as well as steps everyone can take to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.\u00a0An emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University, she previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: I was surprised to learn that skin cancer is so common. What are the major forms of skin cancer? Dr. Leana Wen: There are\u00a0three main forms\u00a0of skin cancer. The most common type is called basal cell carcinoma. These cancers can look like an elevated transparent bump on the skin and most frequently occur on the head, neck and other areas most exposed to the sun. Although these cancers generally develop slowly, they can grow deep and damage nerves and bones. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer. These often resemble a red bump and may manifest as a sore or wound that heals and then opens up again. These, too, tend to appear in areas with frequent sun exposure\u00a0and can also appear on the lip and ear. They can grow deep and spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is the third type that is critical to know. That\u2019s because while it only accounts for 1% of total cancers, it is the\u00a0cause of the majority of deaths\u00a0from skin cancer. In the United States in 2024, more than 8,000 people will die annually from this cancer. Melanoma can develop within a mole that already exists or as a new dark spot on the skin. There is also an association with sun exposure and melanoma. According to the American Cancer Society, though melanoma risk increases with age, it is\u00a0one of the most common cancers\u00a0in young adults. CNN: How can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration should be checked out by a medical professional? Wen:\u00a0There is an\u00a0\u201cABCDE\u201d rule\u00a0that describes warning features that could signify a melanoma. A is for asymmetry, if the shape of\u00a0one half\u00a0of the mole does not match the other. B is for border. A mole with blurred, irregular edges could be concerning. C is for color, meaning a mole that has multiple colors and shades. D is for diameter. Some melanomas can be very small, but most are over 6 millimeters, about \u00bc inch, wide. E is for evolving, meaning that the mole has changed over the past weeks or months. Anyone who notices these features of a mole should get it checked out. In addition, people who notice a new growth, a spot or bump that is increasing in size over time, a skin discoloration that is causing discomfort\u00a0or a sore that doesn\u2019t\u00a0get better\u00a0should also seek medical attention. CNN: Should people make an appointment with a dermatologist? What if they don\u2019t have one? Wen:\u00a0Those who have a dermatologist should contact that person first. Sometimes, a referral from a primary care provider may be necessary. People who have concerning signs that could point to melanoma should clearly state this as a reason \u2014 that they have a change in size or color of a mole, for example, and they are concerned about skin cancer. CNN: Is it recommended for everyone to receive regular skin cancer screening tests? Wen: The influential\u00a0US\u00a0Preventive Services Task Force issued a\u00a0recommendation\u00a0in 2023 that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus risks\u00a0of regular visual skin examination as a method to screen for skin cancer. It\u2019s important to note that this is the general recommendation for people at average risk for skin cancer\u00a0who\u00a0have\u00a0no suspicious moles or spots. People who do see concerning new skin changes should be sure to contact their physician right away. In addition, those who are at increased risk for skin cancer should ask a dermatologist if they should receive regular skin exams. These are done via visual inspection by the physician, meaning that the doctor looks over the entire body. Certain moles may be removed for biopsy to see if they are cancerous. CNN: What are factors that put someone at higher risk for skin cancer? Wen:\u00a0One main factor is ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. People who have extensive sun exposure, history of sunburns and tanning bed use are at elevated risk. Age is also a risk factor; the longer someone has UV exposure, the higher their risk. Those with 50 or more moles are also at higher risk, as are people with fair complexions. There are also specific risk factors related to personal and family medical history. These include personal or family history of skin cancer, history of precancerous lesions such as actinic keratoses, certain genetic disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum and history of immunosuppression. Individuals with risk factors, or who are not certain about them, should contact their physician to come up with a plan for screening. CNN: What about self-exams? Can these be helpful? Wen: Yes. It is a good idea for everyone to check their skin for moles. Look for the ABCDE warning signs as well as any new spots or sores that are itchy, tender\u00a0or painful. People should also remember to check everywhere on their bodies. While skin cancer is most likely in sun-exposed areas, other places are possible, too, including the palms of your hands, soles of your feet and genital areas. A good time to check is when you shower,\u00a0bathe, change clothes\u00a0or apply lotion. You could also ask for help from a family member or friend, especially in hard-to-see areas like the scalp. CNN: What are steps to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer? Wen:\ufeff Reducing UV exposure is a crucial step that everyone can take. That means, when possible, staying in the shade; wearing clothing that covers arms and legs; wearing a hat that covers the face, head, ears\u00a0and neck; and\u00a0regularly\u00a0using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. You can turn to the\u00a0excellent Environmental Working Group\u2019s resource on choosing sunscreens\u00a0that I use and that I recommend to everyone to find an effective sunscreen that works for your lifestyle, budget\u00a0and personal preferences. People should keep in mind that UV rays penetrate and can cause harm not just during the summer but year-round. Also, UV is not just present when it\u2019s sunny but also on cloudy days, and\u00a0the rays\u00a0can reflect off surfaces like snow, sand and water. And it\u2019s not only people who are fair-skinned who can have skin cancer;\u00a0individuals of all colors, including those with brown and Black skin, can develop skin cancer. Finally, I strongly urge people not to use indoor tanning beds. These expose users to high levels of UV rays and increase the risk of developing skin cancer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/skin-cancer-screening-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_world_first-warm-blooded-dinosaurs-scn", "text": "Were dinosaurs warm-blooded like birds and mammals or cold-blooded like reptiles? It\u2019s one of paleontology\u2019s oldest questions, and gleaning the answer matters because it illuminates how the prehistoric creatures may have lived and behaved. Challenging the prevailing idea that they were all slow, lumbering lizards that basked in the sun to regulate their body temperature, research over the past three decades has revealed that some dinosaurs were likely birdlike, with feathers and perhaps the ability to generate their own body heat. However, it\u2019s hard to find evidence that unquestionably shows what dinosaur metabolisms were like. Clues from dinosaur eggshells and bones have suggested that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and others were not. A new study published in the journal Current Biology on Wednesday suggested that three main dinosaur groups adapted differently to changes in temperature, with the ability to regulate body temperature evolving in the early Jurassic Period about 180 million years ago. Based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, the new study looked at the spread of dinosaurs across different environments on Earth throughout the dinosaur era, which started some 235 million years ago\u00a0and ended 66 million years ago when an asteroid slammed into Earth. Two of the three main groups \u2014 meat-eating therapod dinosaurs, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, whose notable members included Triceratops and Stegosaurus \u2014 spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, the research suggested. These dinosaurs may have evolved endothermy, or the ability to internally generate body heat, according to the study. Two adaptable dinosaur groups Therapods and ornithischians lived in a broad range of thermal landscapes in their respective evolutionary histories and were \u201cremarkably adaptable,\u201d the researchers wrote. Recent fossil discoveries have shown that different species of dinosaurs even thrived in the Arctic, giving birth and living there year-round. \u201cWarm-blooded animals are generally more active, for example, cold-blooded animals usually don\u2019t build nests,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, Royal Society Newton International Fellow at University College London\u2019s department of Earth sciences. By contrast, the towering, plant-eating sauropods kept to warmer, lower-latitude regions of the planet, and the availability of richer foliage in certain habitats wasn\u2019t the only factor why, the study found. Sauropods, which included Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, also appeared to thrive in arid, savannahlike environments and practiced \u201cprolonged climatic conservatism,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIt reconciles well with what we imagine about their ecology,\u201d Chiarenza said. \u201cThey were the biggest terrestrial animals that ever lived. They probably would have overheated if they were hot-blooded.\u201d What\u2019s more, he added, the amount of plant matter they would have needed to consume if they were warm-blooded would have been unsustainable. \u201c(These animals) were living in herds and we know that each one of them was the equivalent of 10 African elephants. (If they were warm-blooded) they would just destroy plant life. It makes more sense, as living animals, for them to be more cold-blooded.\u201d However, Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said that the findings from this study contrasted with her own research, which looked at molecular traces of oxygen intake found in dinosaur fossils. Her 2022 study suggested that ornithischians were more likely cold-blooded and sauropods were warm-blooded. She questioned to what extent the biogeographic range of a dinosaur was determined by its metabolic capacity as opposed to other factors such as behavior, growth strategy, dietary preferences and other ecological interactions. \u201cSome animals with incredibly fast growth rates (i.e., sauropods), and by requirement, fast metabolisms, are here found to be cold-blooded, while other animals with very slow growth rates (i.e., ceratopsians) are recovered as endotherms,\u201d Wiemann said. \u201cThese discrepancies will need to be addressed.\u201d Evolutionary trigger Chiarenza said that the model, developed by researchers at UCL and Universidade de Vigo in Spain, suggested that the earliest dinosaurs were more reptilian and cold-blooded. But a period of global warming resulting from volcanic activity 180 million years ago, known as the Jenkyns Event, may have been a trigger for the evolution of the ability to generate body heat internally. \u201cAt this time, many new dinosaur groups emerged. The adoption of endothermy, perhaps a result of this environmental crisis, may have enabled theropods and ornithischians to thrive in colder environments, allowing them to be highly active and sustain activity over longer periods, to develop and grow faster and produce more offspring,\u201d he said in a news release. As with all research based on models, the study made predictions grounded in existing information. New fossils or climatic information might alter that picture. \u201cOf course, if a sauropod turned up in the Arctic that would change things,\u201d Chiarenza said. Paleontologist Anthony Fiorillo, executive director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science, said the study was \u201cintriguing\u201d and the \u201cfirst real attempt to quantify broad patterns that some of us had thought about previously.\u201d Fiorillo, who is also a senior fellow at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, wasn\u2019t involved with the research. \u201cTheir modeling helps create a robustness to our biogeographical understanding of dinosaurs, and their related physiology,\u201d he said. \u201cThis study provides a platform for us to further test what we think we might know.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/world/first-warm-blooded-dinosaurs-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness", "text": "After decades of decline, accidental drowning rates are rising in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. With Americans getting ready to hit swimming pools and beaches on Memorial Day weekend, a new study shows that many lack the skills they need to stay safe in the water. Roughly 15% of US adults \u2013 40 million people \u2013 say they don\u2019t know how to swim.\u00a0More than half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to a new national survey by the CDC. The new data on swimming skills in the US population is included in a Vital Signs report released Tuesday by the CDC. It comes on the heels of an increase in drowning deaths in the US in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Each year, on average, about 4,000 Americans died from accidental drowning, a number that changed little from 2011 to 2020. But that number has been about 10% higher the past few years, adding 500 to 600 more deaths each year to the annual tally.\u00a0It\u2019s the first uptick in drowning rates in the US for at least\u00a0two decades. \u201cWhen I just look at the overall numbers, with over 4,000 people dying \u2013 that\u2019s over 12 people a day \u2013 that\u2019s really one person every two hours. And those are lives, not numbers,\u201d said Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC. The increases in drownings were even more dramatic for certain ages and racial groups. Drowning has long been the leading cause of death for preschool-age children. Drowning rates increased almost 30% in this age group in 2021 and 2022. Although the number of drowning deaths in children ages 4 and younger increased among young children in 2020, the rate increase was not statistically significant that year. Black people also saw drowning rates increase faster than the general population; compared with 2019, they were nearly 30% higher in 2021.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that Black Americans reported spending less recreational time in the water than White and Hispanic people.\u00a0If drowning rates were calculated based on exposure rather than population, the study authors noted, it\u2019s likely that the disparities for Black people would be even more pronounced. Additionally, the CDC\u2019s swimming skills survey found that 1 in 3 Black adults said they couldn\u2019t swim, compared with 1 in 7 adults in the general population, a legacy of segregation and discrimination in access to swimming pools in the US, according to the CDC. Hispanic Americans, a group that doesn\u2019t traditionally have disproportionately higher drowning rates compared with White non-Hispanics, also saw drowning rates increase by nearly 25% in 2022, compared with 2019. American Indian and Alaska Natives continued to have the highest rates of drownings of any racial or ethnic group overall. In 2019, there were about 3 drowning deaths for every 100,000 people among American Indian and Alaska Natives, a rate that has seen little change over the course of the pandemic.\u00a0By comparison, there were 1.2 accidental drowning deaths for every 100,000 among White people in 2019. Houry says it\u2019s hard to say exactly how the pandemic may have played a role in the increases.\u00a0The study can only make associations \u2013 it can\u2019t untangle the causes \u2013 but she notes that it was harder to get into public pools, with many closing or implementing policies that limited access.\u00a0Staffing was also problematic for many swim venues. \u201cThere would have been people, if swimming pools were closed for that year, who didn\u2019t get swim lessons and so might have been behind in getting swim lessons,\u201d Houry said. Berkeley Champlin didn\u2019t know the statistics around drowning deaths in young children until her son, Gordie, tragically became one of them. In July 2020, 3-year-old Gordie slipped unnoticed out of the sliding glass doors in Champlin\u2019s home in Livonia, Michigan, while Champlin was at work. Normally, he would have been in day care, but like many schools, it was shut down at the time. His father, who was home with him, later found him in the family\u2019s pool. He couldn\u2019t be revived. Gordie loved animals and couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night without special stuffed animals: an elephant and a bunny. \u201cI put his elephant and his bunny in his casket with him so that he has them always, because he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Champlin said.\u00a0She has drawings of the stuffies tattooed on her forearm. \u201cI wish he would have had swim lessons,\u201d she said. Every year since Gordie died, Champlin has channeled her grief into raising money for swim lessons for other children. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive.\u00a0It costs $120 a month in some places for a child to take lessons,\u201d said Champlin, who knows that may put them out of reach for some families. Champlin set a goal of paying for three kids to learn to swim each year.\u00a0This year, 42 families reached out to her for help, and she set up a\u00a0GoFundMe account\u00a0to raise money to cover them all. \u201cIf anyone else is ever in that situation, or if you go on vacation, or you\u2019re on the lake or a new pool or something that you don\u2019t have your standard parameters around, swim lessons is the way to prevent accidents from happening,\u201d she said. Houry, from the CDC, agrees. \u201cI think we forget drowning is still a really big problem for our young kids and that we can do something about it by making sure kids know how to swim,\u201d she said. Houry said the CDC is funding programs at the Red Cross and YMCA to help lower the cost of lessons and make sure everyone who needs them can get them \u201cbecause it\u2019s so important to have that equitable access,\u201d she added. Houry said kids should start getting swim lessons between the ages of 1 and 4. \u201cIf you are an adult and you don\u2019t know how to swim, it\u2019s never too late to get that swim lesson. It\u2019s really important,\u201d she said. But Houry\u00a0said that even if kids can swim, adults shouldn\u2019t leave them unattended, drink alcohol or get distracted while watching kids in the pool. In settings like a party, where it\u2019s easy for conversations or phones to divert attention, the CDC says it can be useful to assign an adult specifically to watch kids in the pool.\u00a0When swim time is over, the\u00a0CDC recommends\u00a0shutting and locking doors that give access to water.\u00a0In the event that something does happen, learning CPR can help you save a life before paramedics arrive. Houry says fencing that completely encloses a pool can help make backyard and community pools safer.\u00a0In open water, like lakes, life jackets are important for safety, too.\u00a0 When visiting a lake or ocean beach, it\u2019s a good idea to take stock of the hazards, such as rip currents, before going into the water. As Gordie\u2019s birthday approaches on July 12, Champlin said, she finds herself wondering what kind of a party he\u2019d want at age 6. Would he still love animals and superheroes as much, or would it be some kind of gaming thing like Roblox? Just as in past years, they\u2019ll spend his birthday at the zoo, a place that still holds vivid memories of her son. \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness", "text": "Eating enough healthy fats is great for brain and heart health, but new research has possibly provided even more evidence for adding them \u2014 particularly omega-3s \u2014 to your diet. \u201cWe found that a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is associated with a greater risk of dying,\u201d said Yuchen Zhang, lead author of the April study published in the journal eLife, in a news release. Zhang is a doctoral student in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia\u2019s College of Public Health. Omega-3 fatty acids are naturally found in foods including fish \u2014 especially fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines \u2014 as well as flaxseed, walnuts, chia seeds and in dietary supplements such as fish oil. The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA; eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA; and docosahexaenoic acid, known as DHA, according to the National Institutes of Health. The body must obtain all three from foods, and omega-3s contribute to the health of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system and endocrine system. Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, on the other hand, include nuts, seeds, corn and soy \u2014 and the oils and preservatives produced from these foods, the authors said. Linoleic acid is the most common omega-6 fatty acid.\u00a0 \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that the high omega-6 to omega-3 fats ratio typical of Western diets \u2014 20:1 or even higher, compared to an estimated 1:1 during most of human evolution \u2014 contributes to many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and autoimmune disorders,\u201d Zhang said. But the results of past studies have been mixed, she added, and few have investigated the role of an imbalance in mortality. Also, accurately measuring fatty acid intake is difficult, partly due to reliance on participants\u2019 own recollections of their dietary intake. Zhang and the other researchers looked into the associations between the omega-3/omega-6 ratio in blood plasma \u2014 a more objective measure \u2014 and death from any cause and specifically from cancer or cardiovascular disease, the top two leading causes of death worldwide. They used data from 85,425 people who had participated in the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than half a million people between ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom for at least a decade. Participants, whose plasma samples were collected between 2007 and 2010, had answered questionnaires about their diet, including whether they took fish oil supplements. After nearly 13 years of follow-up, the authors found participants with the highest ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 were 26% more likely to die early from any cause, 14% more likely to die from cancer and 31% more likely to die from heart disease than those with the lowest ratios. Considered individually, both high levels of omega-6 and omega-3 were linked with a lower risk of premature death. But the protective effects of omega-3 were greater, likely explaining \u201cwhy having a high ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s was linked to harm,\u201d the authors said. Despite the findings, the study is \u201conly one \u2018snapshot\u2019 in time of biomarkers and dietary intake of omega 3s and 6s. This is correlation, not causation,\u201d said Dr. Lauren R. Sastre, director of the Farm to Clinic Program and assistant professor in the department of nutrition science at East Carolina University, via email. Sastre wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cAnd even that relationship cannot be strongly supported due to methodological flaws in not considering other dietary components to the overall health/clinical outcomes,\u201d Sastre added. \u201cThere are many anti-inflammatory food components (nutrients, phytochemicals, etc.) that are associated with reducing all-cause, cancer and (cardiovascular disease) mortality, and to only evaluate omega 3s and 6s \u2014 strong confounders may be present that would bias the results.\u201d Managing healthy fat intake If the omega-6/omega-3 balance actually does have more to do with premature death risk than the study has the capacity to prove, it could be due to the possible function of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of \u201cRegenerative Health: Discover Your Metabolic Type and Renew Your Liver for Life.\u201d Arachidonic acid is what the body converts from linoleic acid. It\u2019s a \u201cbuilding block for molecules that can promote inflammation, blood clotting, and the constriction of blood vessels,\u201d according to Harvard Health. But this fatty acid can also be converted into molecules that fight inflammation and blood clots. Omega-6s aren\u2019t inherently bad, but having too many may offset the anti-inflammatory factors associated with omega-3, Kirkpatrick said, so \u201ca more balanced approach \u2026 may be favorable.\u201d \u201cThe source of the omega 6s may also be a factor in offsetting the balance as well,\u201d she added via email. \u201cProcessed seed oils may also contain high amounts of omega 6s for example.\u201d Focusing on this balance and increasing your intake of foods rich in omega-3s can be more important than simply limiting those high in omega-6s, Kirkpatrick said. \u201cI would also look at the quality of the omega 6 foods in the diet,\u201d she added, \u201caiming for whole foods \u2026 rather than more processed products that may contain large amounts via the addition of seed oils.\u201d If you\u2019re curious what your blood plasma ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is, ask your physician about testing for it. In Kirkpatrick\u2019s practice, she often works with her patients\u2019 doctors for this purpose. Some patients request it with the goal of improving their mental health, heart health or risk of dementia, she said. Overall, \u201cit\u2019s important to note that an unbalanced ratio is only one chapter in our story of better or worse health span,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cGetting a variety of fiber-rich foods (beneficial to the microbiome) and other nutrient-dense foods, as well as adequate, good-quality sleep, stress management and physical activity play a large role in how long we will enjoy good health within our lifetime.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_health_ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness", "text": "Eating ultraprocessed foods is associated with an early risk of death, according to a 30-year study \u2014 but different foods have different impacts. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. Processed meats and sugary foods and drinks aren\u2019t correlated with the same risks as ultraprocessed whole grains, for example, said lead study author Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. The study analyzed data from more than 100,000 health professionals in the United States with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. From 1986 to 2018, the participants provided information on their health and lifestyle habits every two years. Every four years, they completed a detailed food questionnaire. The group eating the least ultraprocessed food ate about three servings a day on average, while the highest averaged seven servings a day, according to the study published Wednesday in The BMJ journal. Those who ate the most had a 4% higher risk of deaths by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths, the data showed. Song described the correlation as \u201cmoderate,\u201d noting that the connection was not equally strong among all kinds of ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThe positive association is mainly driven by a few subgroups including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d he said. Findings in this study were consistent with hundreds of others in the field, but what makes this one unique is its parsing out of different subgroups within the ultraprocessed food category, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. Do we need to get rid of all ultraprocessed foods? Song wouldn\u2019t necessarily advise a complete rejection of all ultraprocessed foods because it is a diverse category, he said. \u201cCereals, whole grain breads, for example, they are also considered ultraprocessed food, but they contain various beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, I do think people should try to avoid or limit the consumption of certain ultraprocessed foods, such as processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and also potentially artificially sweetened beverages.\u201d There are also more questions that need to be answered when it comes to ultraprocessed foods. First, the recent study is strong because of the length of time covered\ufeff, but it is an observational study. That means that while researchers can observe a correlation, they can\u2019t say that the foods were the cause of the deaths, said Dr. Peter Wilde, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in the United Kingdom. Researchers also need to look more at the components of ultraprocessed foods that might be affecting health \u2014 whether they be food additives, emulsifiers or flavors \u2014 to advise governments and institutions on how to regulate foods, Song said. Overall diet matters most Researchers also found that the most important factor to reducing risk of death is the quality of a person\u2019s overall diet, Song said. \u201cIf people maintain a generally healthy diet, I don\u2019t think they need to be like scared or be freaked out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall dietary pattern is still the predominant factor determining the health outcomes.\u201d A healthy diet is varied, with as many colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains as possible, Wilde said. \u201cIf you are worried about food additives, then choose foods that have low levels of additives,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cJust be mindful of the nutritional content of (the ultraprocessed foods) that you do choose to consume.\u201d It is also important to recognize that foods need to be eaten in balance. Fruit juice contains beneficial vitamins, minerals and antioxidants when consumed in moderation, but too much will have high levels of sugar that may override their benefits, Wilde said. \u201cThis is not black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cA particular food is not either good or bad, it will contain elements of both, and the balance between the two may depend on how much you eat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

Rick Slayman received the kidney at Massachusetts General in March after he had been diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year. The hospital emphasized there is no indication his death was a result of the transplant. After undergoing the four-hour surgery at the recommendation of his doctors, Slayman, a manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, was discharged from the hospital\u00a0in April. After the surgery, doctors said they believed the new kidney could last years, but acknowledged there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. \u201cMr. Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation,\u201d Massachusetts General said in a statement. \u201cWe offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Slayman\u2019s family and loved ones as they remember an extraordinary person whose generosity and kindness touched all who knew him.\u201d Slayman\u2019s family described him as a kind man who was fiercely dedicated to the people in his life. \u201cOur family is deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick but take great comfort knowing he inspired so many,\u201d a family statement said. \u201cMillions of people worldwide have come to know Rick\u2019s story. We felt \u2013 and still feel \u2013 comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant.\u201d Slayman had been a patient in the hospital\u2019s transplant program for 11 years, he previously said in a statement. He received a kidney from a human donor in 2018, after living with diabetes and high blood pressure for many years. The kidney began to show signs of failure five years later, and he resumed dialysis in 2023. \u201cI saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,\u201d Slayman wrote in the statement. Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, director of the Legorreta Center for Clinical Transplant Tolerance, performed the groundbreaking operation in March to a round of applause in the operating room. The need for organs far exceeds the number available in the US. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are more than 100,000 people currently waiting for an organ donation. Experts have long been researching how to safely and successfully transplant animal organs into people, which they say could help solve the organ shortage. Before Slayman\u2019s transplant, just two transplants using pig organs had been completed \u2013\u00a0both heart transplants performed under compassionate use. Both patients died weeks after receiving the hearts. EGenesis, the biotech company providing the genetically edited pig kidney, called Slayman \u201ca true pioneer\u201d in a statement late Saturday night. \u201cWe are profoundly grateful to Mr. Slayman and his family and we will honor his legacy and invaluable contribution to science and medicine by continuing our efforts to advance xenotransplantation for the millions of patients globally in need of lifesaving organs,\u201d the company added. Slayman\u2019s family also thanked his care team at across Massachusetts General in a statement. \u201cAfter his transplant, Rick said that one of the reasons he underwent this procedure was to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive.

{"id": "2024_05_13_health_wegovy-trial-analysis", "text": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use. The analyses \u2013 of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss \u2013 also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used \u2013 and covered by insurers. \u201cThe implications are profound,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. \u201cWe have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.\u201d More than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans. One important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely \u2013 and how long \u2013 they\u2019ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years. Researchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways: Weight loss continued for more than a year The analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau. A previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events. It was sustained for up to four years The results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years. Patients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight. However, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did \u2013 almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug. Results vary for everyone In the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines. No safety surprises out to four years Overall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased. The researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn\u2019t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug\u2019s prescribing information because they\u2019d been seen previously in trials. Benefits beyond weight loss A key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play. That\u2019s because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didn\u2019t lose weight. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefit\u201d with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the new analyses. \u201cThat\u2019s because that\u2019s what GLP-1 does: It\u2019s cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you don\u2019t require weight loss \u2013 it\u2019s not the whole story.\u201d An analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight. \u201cThis suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,\u201d or body fat, the researchers concluded. A separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said. \u201cThese two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.\u201d A benefit from reducing inflammation Drucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,\u201d he said. But based on his lab\u2019s research, he said, \u201cone of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.\u201d Drucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis \u2013 driven by inflammation \u2013 who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive. The results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who don\u2019t have obesity or aren\u2019t overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event \u2013 another thing that would need to be studied. And, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely. \u201cWe probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are going to be helpful in terms of actually improving\u00a0health\u00a0and saving lives and saving\u00a0health\u00a0care dollars in people with obesity and heart disease even without much weight loss,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes and\u00a0death.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/health/wegovy-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

As part of the plan, announced Friday by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, the government will pay up to $28,000 per farm over the next four months to support specific steps to prevent the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle.\u00a0About $98 million will be funneled to the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to fund the program. The USDA confirmed the first bird flu infection in cows in late March.\u00a0Since then, more than 40 herds have tested positive in nine states. Right now, health officials say, the virus doesn\u2019t transmit efficiently from person to person, making the risk to humans low.\u00a0But scientists have said that having the infection spreading in domesticated animals like cattle is risky because it puts the virus in closer proximity to people, where it could adapt and evolve to become a fully human pathogen.\u00a0If that happens, researchers say, it could spark another pandemic. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our top priority at USDA, given our mission, is to contain this as an animal health event,\u201d Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said Friday. \u201cUltimately, we want to eliminate the virus in the industry and develop over time a vaccine to prevent another emergency of H5N1 in cattle.\u201d The USDA has acknowledged that some dairy producers have been wary of letting the government come onto their farms to test livestock. Farm workers with symptoms have also reportedly been reluctant to be tested for H5N1 influenza, since most are not compensated if they need to take time off for illness. As part of the plan announced Friday, the USDA will\u00a0provide financial support \u2014 up to $2,000 per affected farm per month \u2014 for producers who supply personal protective equipment to their workers or help them wash their uniforms.\u00a0Financial support is also available to farmers who allow their workers to participate in\u00a0a study through the USDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Workers who participate in the CDC study would also be compensated for their time. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said workers would get $75 for participating in an interview as well as providing a nasal swab and a blood sample, although he said they didn\u2019t have to do all three. Advocates for farm workers said they were skeptical that the $75 payment would be enough to encourage more testing. \u201cThere are some really significant resources that are being allocated to the owners of the cattle. But far less is being advocated to the workers who are in close contact and at high risk working in those milking parlors,\u201d said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers. \u201c$75 is not going to seem like a good gamble to someone who may be looking at much longer off of work. And $75 isn\u2019t going to feed their families,\u201d she said. Strater estimates that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 dairy workers in the US. \u201cThis is not a huge amount of people. But if you think about how important to protecting the public health that would be, you would think that we will be putting all of our resources into a protective ring around these folks,\u201d she said. Strater says there\u2019s a real reluctance on the part of farm workers to be tested, even when they have symptoms, because a positive test could mean time off work. \u201cThe testing situation is really challenging,\u201d said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health programs for the National Center for Farmworker Health. The way we now find out about human cases of H5N1 is \u201ca very passive system,\u201d she said. Alcauter says public health officials assume that if someone has influenza symptoms, they\u2019ll go to a doctor, who will take an occupational health history, and if the worker tests positive for the flu, the doctor will send that person\u2019s swab to a state public health lab to be tested for H5N1. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a very realistic scenario,\u201d she said, noting that only a few dozen people had been tested for the H5N1 virus after exposure to cattle. Besides payments to help assist farms in protecting their workers, payments of up to $1,500 per farm will be available to aid in the development of biosecurity plans.\u00a0The USDA will offer dairy farms $100 to purchase a piece of equipment called an in-line sampler so their milk can be tested as it travels between cows and holding tanks. Another $2,000 will be available to farms that heat treat their wasted milk before it is disposed. The USDA will also cover up to $10,000 of veterinary costs at farms where cattle have tested positive for H5N1 and will cover the cost of shipping samples to testing labs in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The government says it will also compensate farmers for lost milk production if their cows get sick. The National Milk Producers Federation said it was pleased by the announcement of additional financial help to dairy farmers. \u201cWe look forward to continued collaboration and consultation with USDA and other federal agencies as we monitor, understand, and contain this outbreak, and we will do what we can to help dairy farmers understand and benefit from these initiatives as swift implementation is put into motion,\u201d the group said in a statement. In addition, HHS is going to send an additional $101 million in funding to the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration to help fund their H5N1 response efforts. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified 93 million to be used by CDC to expand our monitoring of people exposed to infected animals, to scale up our testing and analysis capabilities, to determine whether candidate vaccines are effective and to manufacture, store, and distribute additional influenza diagnostic kits,\u201d HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said. Another $8 million will be given to the FDA to support to the agency\u2019s ability to conduct surveillance at different points in the milk production system, Becerra said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/bird-flu-government-farm-incentives/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

The agency also proposed the group be blocked from receiving federal funds in the future, possibly\u00a0for\u00a0years. Before Covid-19 emerged, a US government grant to EcoHealth had funded studies into bat coronaviruses at the lab in Wuhan, China. Although US-funded research at the lab has not been linked to the pandemic, the US suspended funding\u00a0to EcoHealth in 2020. The grant was later reinstated it. US funding to the Wuhan lab has since been blocked. In a new\u00a0letter\u00a0to EcoHealth Alliance and its president, Dr. Peter Daszak, HHS lists 30 pieces of information, some dating back to 2013\u00a0to support its decision.\u00a0HHS said in a\u00a0memo\u00a0that EcoHealth failed to \u201cadequately monitor\u201d virus growth in experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, notify the National Institutes of Health that viruses studied there \u201cappeared to grow beyond permissible thresholds\u201d laid out in a grant or provide requested information in a timely manner. \u201cHHS believes there is adequate evidence in the record\u00a0for\u00a0this debarment cause and that immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest,\u201d Henrietta Brisbon, an HHS suspension and debarment official, wrote in the letter. In a statement, a spokeperson for EcoHealth Alliance said the organization is \u201cdisappointed by HHS\u2019 decision today and we will be contesting the proposed debarment. We disagree strongly with the decision and will present evidence to refute each of these allegations and to show that NIH\u2019s continued support of\u00a0EcoHealth\u00a0Alliance is in the public interest.\u201d An\u00a0HHS Office of the Inspector General\u00a0report last year found that despite\u00a0potential risks from research performed through the EcoHealth grant, the group was late to report information and the NIH failed to follow up. EcoHealth Alliance has said it was\u00a0unable to access the NIH reporting system because of technical problems, but in a new HHS action memo, it says a forensic report found the group was \u201cnever locked out of the system.\u201d Earlier this month, House lawmakers questioned Daszak about EcoHealth\u2019s record on research and safety, including at the Wuhan lab. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Wednesday, Brad Wenstrup, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Oversight Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, said its investigation into EcoHealth and the origins of Covid-19 is \u201cfar from over.\u201d The origin of the virus that caused Covid-19 continues to drive research and investigations by scientists, intelligence officials and lawmakers.\u00a0Previous scientific studies\u00a0have suggested the virus that causes Covid-19 likely emerged naturally in a Wuhan seafood market, but they have not identified a specific origin. The US intelligence community\u00a0has maintained\u00a0it\u2019s plausible that\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0originated in a laboratory or in the wild.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/us-government-suspends-fundingforvirus-research-group-at-center-of-covid-19-origin-controversy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_how-to-move-better-wellness", "text": "Countless people seek emergency care for back pain, muscle strains and similar injuries resulting from \u201cmoving wrong\u201d during mundane, everyday tasks such as bending over to tie shoes, lifting objects or doing household chores. Even the most basic of human movement patterns \u2014 walking \u2014 can land you in the emergency room due to tripping or losing balance. Falls are one of the leading causes of emergency room visits, with more than 9 million logged annually. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 older adults report falling every year. These incidents highlight the importance of understanding proper movement mechanics to prevent avoidable harm. Read on for five essential strategies to correct improper movement patterns, enhance movement quality and minimize your risk of injury. What are \u2018wrong moves\u2019? The most significant way you can move wrong is by not moving enough.The clich\u00e9d saying \u201cmove it or lose it\u201d is sage wisdom. Human bodies are inherently designed for movement. Yet in our modern, sedentary lifestyles, we often neglect the importance of moving both regularly and well. The less we move, the less we can, and the more susceptible we are to hurting ourselves by moving in a way our body is not accustomed or intended. Understanding what constitutes right and wrong movement is crucial in preventing injury. The unique blueprint of the human body ensures the ability to move in all directions based on using the joints as they were designed. For example, certain joints, such as the hips and shoulders are ball and socket, enabling 360 degrees of rotation, while knees are hinge joints that have more limited mobility. Likewise, the middle of your spine, known as the thoracic spine, is designed for rotating, while the lower back or lumbar spine is not. Core muscles need to support and stabilize any carrying or lifting to avoid low-back stress. If you attempt to twist from your lumbar spine to get out of your car or ask your knees to compensate for a lack of hip mobility in your golf swing, you are moving wrong. Bending over to pet your cat without hinging from your hips and bending your knees or carrying heavy grocery bags without engaging your core to stabilize your spine are also examples of wrong moves. All these actions put unnecessary stress on your muscles, ligaments and joints. As you continue to adopt improper movement patterns, you not only increase your risk of injury but also compromise your body\u2019s functional performance long term. Editor\u2019s\u00a0note:\u00a0Consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Stop immediately if you experience pain. How to make the right moves Developing and maintaining proper movement patterns and training to enhance your movement quality are essential to enhance functional mobility so you can navigate your life pain- and injury-free. Here are five key strategies to make the right moves: 1. Master primary movement patterns Consider the movements required to function during daily life. To get to anything on the floor, you need to squat down and hinge from your hips. When you reach for something, you push your arm or arms forward. To open a door, you grasp the handle and pull back. You rotate to grab and latch your seat belt in the car, and you must stabilize through your core to sit, stand and walk. As such, the six generally accepted primary functional movements are squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling and rotating, as well as core stabilization. By mastering these patterns of bodyweight movements and regularly performing them with good form, you develop a strong foundation for safe and efficient movement in all aspects of life. 2. Practice moving in all planes of motion As you go through daily life, performing different variations of the primary movement patterns noted above, you are also moving your body forward, backward, side to side and twisting around. These directions cover what are known as the three planes of movement: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). It\u2019s important to incorporate intentional exercises within each of these planes into your training regimen. This comprehensive approach ensures that your body is prepared for the demands of all your daily activities and sports. 3. Train for better balance Adding balance training to your workouts will improve stability and proprioception (the ability to perceive the position of your limbs). This type of training helps you to better navigate uneven terrain and sudden changes in direction to reduce the risk of falls and injury. Unilateral exercises that focus on one side of the body at a time, such as single-leg Romanian dead lifts and lunging variations, challenge your neuromuscular system, enhancing coordination and spatial awareness. Because good balance is an essential part of moving well, you should incorporate some form of unilateral balance exercises into all your workouts. 4. Include strength training in your workouts Regular strength training builds more than muscle; it also increases bone density, joint stability, endurance, metabolism and overall durability. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends adults strength train two or more days per week. Aim to incorporate resistance exercises targeting different muscle groups through all the primary movement patterns using good form to ensure safe and effective strength development. Strong muscles support the joints in functional movement to reduce the risk of injury. 5. Cultivate your mind-body connection Another key to moving better and avoiding injury is to move with intention. While exercising, focus on your breath and what you\u2019re feeling to stay connected to your body\u2019s experience. By maintaining awareness of your body\u2019s movements and associated sensations, you can set a safe and effective foundation of mindfulness and focus on proper form during exercise. This mind-body connection enhances movement efficiency and reduces incidences of injury through unintentional \u201cwrong moves.\u201d Progressive muscle relaxation is a great exercise for cultivating your mind-body connection. I recommend practicing it several times per week. Are you ready to start moving better and safeguarding your physical fitness? Try the 10-minute single dumbbell workout featured at the top of this article, which incorporates all five strategies. Remember, injury prevention begins with understanding proper movement mechanics and consistently practicing functional movement patterns. Incorporating the five keys outlined above into your fitness routine and daily life can significantly improve your movement quality and reduce the risk of avoidable injuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/how-to-move-better-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial", "text": "When Cheri Ferguson started taking Ozempic last year, she said, she hoped to lose about 50 pounds she\u2019d gained during the Covid-19 pandemic. Over about three months, she told CNN in June, the medicine \u2013 which is approved for type 2 diabetes and used off-label for weight loss \u2013 helped reduce the constant chatter in her brain urging her to eat, just what she\u2019d hoped it would do. But it had another unexpected effect: Ferguson said her desire to drink alcohol and use her vape pen also drained away. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone\u2019s just come along and switched the light on, and you can see the room for what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of these vapes and cigarettes that you\u2019ve had over the years, they don\u2019t look attractive anymore. It\u2019s very, very strange. Very strange.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling described by thousands of people taking these medicines, which are in a class known as GLP-1 receptor agonists and used by an estimated 15 million Americans, according to a recent poll. And now, Ozempic\u2019s maker, Novo Nordisk, said it intends to study the phenomenon. The company plans to start assessing the effects of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and other medicines on alcohol consumption this month in a newly announced clinical trial in alcohol-related liver disease \u2013 although cutting drinking isn\u2019t the study\u2019s main goal. A focus on liver disease, not addiction The Danish drug giant has been saying since at least last year that it doesn\u2019t plan to study semaglutide \u2013 which is also approved for weight loss as Wegovy \u2013 in areas like alcohol addiction, despite so many anecdotal reports like Ferguson\u2019s, and academic studies that are already underway. Novo Nordisk reiterated that stance Wednesday, noting that the main purpose of its new trial is to assess whether the medicines can improve liver health. Its primary measure is the medicines\u2019 effects on enhanced liver fibrosis, or scarring, over 28 weeks. \u201cSecondary endpoints include safety and tolerability and changes in alcohol consumption,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThere is a significant unmet medical need in alcohol-related liver disease, and the first line of treatment for the condition is lifestyle intervention to refrain from drinking alcohol.\u201d The trial, first reported by Bloomberg News, aims to enroll about 240 participants and is slated to begin May 20, according to a government database. \u201cEven though not all patients in the trial will have alcohol use disorder, it is natural to include alcohol consumption as a secondary endpoint,\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s spokesperson said, noting that the trial is part of the company\u2019s plans to address liver diseases more broadly. Nonetheless, researchers in addiction science cheered the news. A need for more treatments \u201cThose of us doing work in this area see this as a step in the right direction,\u201d Christian Hendershot, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Bowles Center of Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who is running one of the few studies in this area, said by email Wednesday. \u201cAdditional treatment options for this group are really needed.\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s CEO told CNN in August that the company had heard many similar anecdotal reports. \u201cWe\u00a0know\u00a0that\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0benefits\u00a0in\u00a0obesity\u00a0is\u00a0that\u00a0it\u00a0addresses\u00a0this\u00a0craving,\u00a0the\u00a0desire,\u00a0to\u00a0snack\u00a0and eat,\u201d Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. \u201cThat function in the brain, in this craving center, is perhaps also what is benefitting some of the other addictions.\u201d Studies in animals suggest the same thing, National Institutes of Health researcher Dr. Lorenzo Leggio told CNN last year. He published a study in May 2023 showing that semaglutide reduces alcohol drinking in rodents, noting that \u201cat least one of the mechanisms of how these drugs reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol,\u201d like those related to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Jorgensen said Novo Nordisk hadn\u2019t studied that effect and had no plans to do so at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0the\u00a0easiest\u00a0to\u00a0study,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t expect that we would go in and study these addictions widely.\u201d Jorgensen did say there could be \u201can opportunity to collect data when we do large studies,\u201d as well as to use artificial intelligence to mine large databases of experiences with the medicines in the real world for signals of effects on things like alcohol use. A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes tirzepatide-based competitors to Ozempic and Wegovy called Mounjaro and Zepbound, said Wednesday that it too had seen \u201canecdotal commentary in publications about the potential use of GLP-1s for additional indications like addiction.\u201d But while the Indianapolis-based drugmaker continues \u201cto evaluate future development options for tirzepatide,\u201d the spokesperson said the company hadn\u2019t announced any plans to develop its medicines for those uses. An unattractive market for drugmakers Medicines for addiction, and particularly for alcohol use, haven\u2019t been successful financially for the drug industry, leading to less interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing drugs in the space. Research from financial firm TD Cowen found that less than 5% of the 29 million Americans estimated to have alcohol-use disorder receive drug therapy. The firm pointed to issues like doctors not being familiar with medicines to treat alcohol use and compliance with the drugs. \u201cAlcohol is now the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver transplantation in the US,\u201d Leggio told CNN by email Thursday. \u201cWe do need to develop novel treatments for alcohol-associated liver disease itself, plus novel treatments for the underlying medical problem that leads to ALD; that is, alcohol use disorder.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very promising and exciting that a company like Novo Nordisk is taking the lead in conducting such an important clinical trial,\u201d Leggio said. Novo Nordisk is looking at multiple medicines in its newly announced trial in alcohol-related liver disease; in addition to semaglutide, the company said it will investigate experimental drugs cagrilintide and zalfermin \u2013 listed on the trial posting as NNC0194-0499 \u2013 alone and in combination. Cagrilintide is a medicine that mimics a hormone called amylin that Novo Nordisk is testing in combination with semaglutide \u2013 which mimics another hormone, called GLP-1 \u2013 in large trials in both diabetes and weight loss, calling the combination CagriSema. Zalfermin, the company said, acts like yet another metabolic hormone, FGF21, which is produced mainly in the liver. Though trials in use of semaglutide and similar medicines have been slow to start, so many reports of the drugs\u2019 effects on alcohol use have emerged that Leggio, Hendershot and other researchers warned in a commentary in the journal Nature Medicine that the drugs shouldn\u2019t be prescribed for alcohol-use disorder until their safety and efficacy has been proven in clinical trials. \u201cClinical decisions should follow from controlled studies, triangulated with other clinical and preclinical evidence,\u201d the researchers wrote in the December commentary. \u201cWell-controlled [trials] with scientific rigor are needed before any claim of efficacy for alcohol-use disorder and other substance use disorders can be made.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_health_alternatives-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness", "text": "Many people love their ultraprocessed foods. Sodas, chips, ice cream, lunch meat and other prepared foods are staples of the American diet. They are hard to avoid, too. More than\u00a070% of the US food supply\u00a0is made of ultraprocessed food. But a diet heavy in ultraprocessed food isn\u2019t good for us, science has shown. Eating\u00a0ultraprocessed foods\u00a0raises the risk of developing or dying from dozens of health conditions, according to a February review covering nearly 10 million people. Science has also shown that when you eat Mediterranean meals, which focus on vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and fish, you can reduce the risk of some\u00a0cancers,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0heart disease, high cholesterol\u00a0and stroke. Adopting this approach to eating can\u00a0also improve brain health, strengthen bones and ward off depression and dementia. Hot dogs and cookies are delicious, though. So, what to do? Spot the troublesome ingredients Many ultraprocessed foods have very long lists of ingredients and include additives, according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. If you can\u2019t pronounce the names in your food\u2019s ingredient list, that\u2019s a warning sign. The list may include preservatives designed to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing. All are signs that the food is ultraprocessed. Skip eating out when you can\u2019t tell what ingredients are in your food, and note that many items on fast-food restaurant menus can be ultraprocessed (such as hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets and fries). Start with breakfast Breakfast may be the easiest meal to change. Instead of sugar-fortified cereal or toaster waffles,\u00a0have some warm and filling ancient grains such as quinoa, sorghum or wheat berries cooked with milk, honey, nuts and fruits. No time in the morning to prepare breakfast? Prep these overnight oats the night before. Or have a simple small bowl of plain Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of sliced nuts to go. How processed is your lunch? Instead of a loaded deli sandwich or slices of pizza every day, try to bring your own plant-based lunch once or twice per week. I love adding roast chicken leftovers to this kale ricotta salad (sub in feta if you can\u2019t find the ricotta). Or make this dish by registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, founder of\u00a0Olive Tree Nutrition. She created her Warm Farro Grain Salad With Pomegranate for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better newsletter. Need more ideas? Check out CNN contributor Casey Barber\u2019s ideas for school lunch. Try our interactive to help you buy the least ultraprocessed lunch you can. Is it time for a snack? Snacks can be tricky. The no-fly list of ultraprocessed food is loaded with store-bought chips, sugar-packed yogurts and candy-filled trail mix. Instead, think about apples, oranges, bananas, carrot sticks, and other fruits and veggies. Protein-packed nuts and seeds are filling while also providing a brain boost and heart-healthy fats. If you want to get fancy, Al Bochi created this\u00a0roasted almond snack for CNN that features the Mediterranean spice blend za\u2019atar. Suzy Karadsheh\u2019s avocado salsa dip is also amazing for movie nights, the big game and parties (whichever one you choose). Dinner during the week With dinner a rushed affair for many overscheduled families, it can be impossible to cook during the week. Try to avoid fast-food burgers and chicken nuggets when you can.  Instead, consider grilling chicken or cooking ground turkey on the weekend for easy-assemble Tuesday taco night. Karadsheh also has a Mediterranean twist on tuna salad that will convert even the most anti-tuna eaters (which once included me). May I have dessert, please? Baked goods and ice cream are fine for special occasions, but for an everyday dessert that\u2019s not highly processed,\u00a0Al Bochi\u2019s recipe for Strawberry Ricotta Granola Parfaits is next level. For something grown-up, try poaching pears with\u00a0pomegranate juice\u00a0or port and serve them over yogurt or bake pears and other fruits in parchment. Does this still sound too hard? Ultraprocessed foods are designed to be fun and taste good. Reducing your reliance on them can be hard. Try one suggestion at a time, for a week at a time.

{"id": "2024_05_16_health_usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers", "text": "Laboratory tests by the US Department of Agriculture haven\u2019t found any H5N1 bird flu virus in raw beef, but they are a good reminder why eating rare hamburgers can be risky. As part of a suite of tests conducted to check safe food handling advice after the detection of H5N1 bird flu virus in dairy cattle, the USDA recently mixed a substitute virus into ground beef and then cooked patties at varying times and temperatures. Researchers found none of the virus in hamburgers cooked to 145 degrees, roughly the temperature of a medium burger, or well-done burgers cooked to 160 degrees. They did, however, find some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, although the virus was present \u201cat much, much reduced levels,\u201d said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA. Whether that small amount of virus could make someone sick is still an unknown. The USDA already advises consumers to cook ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, as measured with a food thermometer, to avoid infections from bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli, he noted. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody needs to change any of the safe food handling or safe cooking practices that are already recommended,\u201d Deeble said. The USDA also announced $22 million in new government investments to protect animal health. The bulk of the funding will go to the Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and to a network of state laboratories called the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. \u201cThere are some labs that have equipment that needs to be updated or upgraded and additional folks that are interested in adding capacity to the laboratories that they operate. And so this funding is going to help support those types of projects,\u201d Deeble said Thursday. Between May 6 and May 12, the national lab network processed 1,100 tests for H5N1 bird flu in cattle, and 278 of those were presumed positive, Deeble said.\u00a0He cautioned that because multiple samples can be taken from the same animal or tests may be pooled, the number of tests doesn\u2019t reflect the number of animals tested or the number that are positive.\u00a0Approximately 600 of the tests were performed in accordance with the USDA\u2019s new order, which requires testing of dairy cattle moving between states.\u00a0Another 450 tests were performed on animals showing symptoms. USDA said that it had gotten a positive response to its offer last week to financially compensate producers who take steps to protect their herds and workers against further spread of the virus. However, it doesn\u2019t have the forms ready for farmers to fill out, so nobody has been signed up for the program.\u00a0It hopes to have the paperwork ready by the middle of next week, Deeble said. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency had not been able to find farmworkers willing to participate in studies looking at how bird flu transmits on dairy farms in return for $75. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up hope. We are in\u00a0constant conversation with a number of states. We\u2019re getting closer, but as of yet, nothing across the finish line,\u201d Shah said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
