The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

{"id": "2024_06_25_health_cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning\u00a0to doctors on Tuesday to be on the look out for cases of dengue. A surge in dengue cases globally is raising the risk that people could catch the disease in the US. The number of people who develop the mosquito-borne disease has been increasing globally as the world\u2019s climate warms due to the human-made climate crisis. The infected mosquitos that spread the disease, the Aedes aegypti, and sometimes\u00a0Aedes albopictus, mosquitoes like warmer and wetter weather. Generally, dengue had been relatively rare in the continental US with most people getting sick after having traveled to popular destinations overseas where the disease is more common. So far this year, a higher-than-expected number of dengue cases have been identified among US travelers, with 745 cases in records kept through June 24, the CDC said. In 2023, 1,829 travel-associated cases were reported by US travelers, the highest number of travel-associated cases since dengue became reportable in the US in 2010, according to the CDC.  Twenty-three countries reported outbreaks last year with more than 5 million cases reported to the World Health Organization and 4,000 deaths in the Americas alone. Over the years there have been a handful of outbreaks in locally-transmitted cases in states with warmer climates and habitat friendly to the kind of mosquito that spread dengue like Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona. California reported its first locally transmitted case in Pasadena last year. Tuesday\u2019s warning from the CDC says that the number of global infections in 2024 have been the highest on record. Cases in the Americas have already exceeded the highest number ever recorded in a single year,\u00a0with more than 9.7 million people getting sick with dengue; that\u2019s twice as many cases in all of 2023. So many people have gotten sick with dengue in Puerto Rico, local public health officials declared a public health emergency. Other areas with frequent dengue transmission associated with the US include American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. The CDC warning instructs doctors to test patients with symptoms that look like dengue, especially those patients who have traveled to a part of the world where the disease is more common. Symptoms typically start about a week after the person has been bitten by the infected mosquito, although 40 to 80% of infections are asymptomatic, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA). Symptoms of dengue can include a fever, vomiting, muscle aches, joint and bone pain, pain behind the eyes, headache, nausea, low white blood cell counts and a fever. Most people recover after about a week. The CDC said warning signs that the dengue is progressing to a more serious form of the disease include persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, bleeding from the nose or gums, liver enlargement, being tired and abdominal pain. Severe disease can bring with it severe bleeding, respiratory distress, and a person\u2019s organs can start shutting down and people can die. Mortality can be as high as 13% in untreated patients, the IDSA said. Infants, pregnant people and the elderly are at an increased risk for severe dengue, along with people who have certain underlying medical conditions. Other than supportive care including treatment with fluids and rest, there are no specific medicines to treat dengue. There is no dengue vaccine recommended for travelers or for adults. There was a vaccine, Dengvaxia, but Sanofi Pasteur stopped making it citing a lack of demand. The public health departments in Puerto Rico will still be giving the shots to children aged 9 to 16 years with a lab-confirmed case who live in areas with frequent transmission until the doses expire in 2026. In April of this year the CDC had launched an emergency response that addresses the increasing dengue caseload in the US. It also expanded lab capacity and is working with local leaders to strengthen surveillance for the disease. To prevent dengue, use bug spray when outside, particularly when traveling to parts of the world where dengue is common. Wear loose-fitting and long-sleeved shirts and pants. Run the air conditioning or use window screens so mosquitos stay outside.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}

The Maryland-based company halted ice cream production and distribution and recalled the products after FDA sampling revealed potential traces of Listeria monocytogenes. There are no reports of illnesses so far, the company said. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can cause listeriosis, the\u00a0third leading cause\u00a0of death from foodborne illness in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Listeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in pregnant women, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, while healthy people may experience short-term symptoms like high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, according to the recall notice. The infection can manifest as a fever, muscle aches, excessive tiredness, severe headache, nausea, stomachache, or diarrhea. Symptoms typically begin within two weeks after eating contaminated food but may start as early as the same day or as late as 10 weeks after, according to the CDC.  Earlier this year, the CDC investigated a deadly outbreak of Listeria linked to\u00a0queso fresco and cotija cheese\u00a0that led to 23 hospitalizations and two deaths.

{"id": "2024_06_18_health_resistance-training-older-adults-wellness", "text": "Retirement should be filled with time with loved ones, relaxation and\u2014according to new research\u2014heavy lifting. As people get older, their skeletal muscle function declines, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine. \u201cIf you do resistance training at this age, benefits in some parameters may last several years,\u201d said lead study author \ufeffMads Bloch-Ibenfeldt, a doctoral student at the Institute of Sports Medicine at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. To investigate whether resistance exercise programs could be helpful in the long term, researchers performed a randomized control trial with 369 recently retired and healthy adults who were between 64 and 75 years old. The participants were assigned one of three exercise programs for a year. They either lifted weights three times a week, did moderate-intensity training using their body weight and resistance bands three times a week, or did not change their usual exercise routines, the study said. Researchers measured their bone and muscle strength as well as body fat levels at the start of the trial at the end of the one-year program and then two and four years later, according to the study. It was up to the individuals whether they continued their strength training regimen or went back to their normal exercise level, Resistance training with heavy loads yielded the greatest long-lasting benefit in leg strength, the study showed. Even four years after the training, their leg strength was unaltered, whereas the moderate-intensity group did see a decrease \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t significant, the study showed. \u201cExercise is critically important across the life span. This study does show that even in those engaging in activity later in life around retirement can lead to marked benefits to one\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the School of Medicine (Geriatric Medicine) and in the Gillings School of Global Public Health (Nutrition). He was not involved in the research. What counts as resistance training? The umbrella of exercise includes aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance activities, Batsis said. \u201cEach of these have important consequences if one regularly performs them or does not on overall health (including cognition) and physical function,\u201d Batsis\ufeff said in an email. You can think of resistance training as \u201cexercises that improve strength by making muscles work against a force,\u201d said CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a mind-body coach for professional athletes. That force can include weights, resistance bands or your own body weight\u2014like with pushups or squats, she added. \u201cFor older adults, resistance training is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, and mobility,\u201d she said. According to the recent study, adding heavier weight seems to be important, Bloch-Ibenfeldt said. What you can do at home One limitation of the exercise proposed in the recent study is that the weighted exercises were done at a gym, which is something not everyone has the time, money or transportation to do, Batsis said. While you should consult a certified trainer or physical therapist to ensure\ufeff you are exercising safely, there are things you can do from home, Santas said. For older adults, it is important to strengthen in ways that are important to functional movements of everyday living, she added. Santas recommends box squats, where you sit lightly on a chair seat and stand back up. If you don\u2019t need to hold the arms of the chair for support, add some dumbbells, Santas said. The added weight gives \u201cadditional resistance while also improving\u00a0grip strength, which is essential for functional independence and serves as (a) marker for heart health,\u201d she added. You can also increase strength in functional movements, protect your knee joints and prevent injury by placing a resistance band around both of your legs and doing side steps,\u00a0side lunging\u00a0or\u00a0reverse lunging, she said. Try to do two or three sets of eight to 12 of each activity at least a couple of times a week, Santas said. Regular maintenance of exercise and other health factors are important for independence later in life, Batsis said. \u201cThe basics of lifestyle changes, including nutrition and exercise are a major key to healthy aging,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/resistance-training-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_08_18_health_dengue-what-to-know-wellness", "text": "Dengue virus is the most common mosquito-spread virus globally, but generally relatively rare in the continental United States. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week about a higher-than-expected number of dengue cases among US travelers \u2014 745 cases through June 24 \u2014 as well as a public health emergency in Puerto Rico, where the virus is endemic. Global infections in 2024 have been the highest on record, with cases in the Americas already reaching 9.7 million \u2014\u00a0exceeding the highest number ever recorded\u00a0in a single year. What is dengue, and where is it common? Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is spread mainly via the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also known to carry several other viruses such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the CDC. Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to WHO. It\u2019s also endemic in the US territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and American Samoa. More than 34,000 locally acquired cases were reported in the US between 2010 and 2023, according to CDC data. A handful of outbreaks of locally transmitted cases have been reported in states with warmer climates, including Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona. California reported its first locally-transmitted case in Pasadena\u00a0last year. But almost all US cases are reported in Puerto Rico, says Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey, chief of the Dengue Branch in the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told CNN previously. And that\u2019s not a surprise. \u201cIt has the perfect climate for it. It\u2019s a tropical island,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are indeed efforts from the health department and other organizations like the Puerto Rico vector control unit to control dengue in the area.\u201d This includes public education and integrated mosquito management such as \u201cremoving places where the mosquitoes lay eggs, and that is done through community engagement, but also clean-up campaigns,\u201d Paz-Bailey said. Similar efforts are also recommended in the rest of the US and its territories, she noted. Dengue symptoms Only about 1 in 4 people infected with dengue will have symptoms. The most common symptom is fever, and it can also cause nausea, vomiting, rash or aches and pains \u2013 typically behind the eyes or muscle, joint or bone pain. There are four strains of the virus, or serotypes, according to the World Health Organization. Once someone catches one of the strains, it can\u2019t infect them again. But the more times someone is infected with different strains, the more likely they are to become severely ill. Severe dengue\u00a0is less common, with about 1 in 20 people developing it. But the symptoms are more troubling. It can cause shock, internal bleeding and even death. About 100 million people get sick and 40,000 die of severe dengue around the world each year, according to the CDC. Testing for dengue If you get sick and live in an area where dengue might be spreading or have traveled to a place where the virus is common, the CDC recommends consulting your doctor. The only definite way to know if you have the virus is through blood testing, which varies from place to place, Paz-Bailey said. The general recommendation is to do a PCR test, she says, if your symptoms started within a week or less. \u201cIf the person presents beyond the seven-day window, a serological test to measure IgM antibodies is recommended,\u201d Paz-Bailey said. It can take a day to a week to get those results, she says. Dengue vaccine and treatment The US Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine for dengue in 2019 and the CDC recommends it to children ages 9 to 16 who have laboratory-confirmed evidence of a dengue infection and who live in areas of the United States where dengue is endemic or regularly occurring. The vaccine requires three doses, given six months apart. However, Sanofi-Pasteur said it will stop manufacturing the vaccine, Dengvaxia, due to a lack of demand in the global market. There is no dengue vaccine available for adults in the US. The CDC said there are two other dengue vaccines approved or in development, but they are not currently available in the United States. There\u2019s also no specific medicine to treat dengue, the CDC says. Over-the-counter meds like acetaminophen can ease fever or pain, but experts say not to take aspirin or ibuprofen because they can increase the risk of hemorrhaging sometimes seen with dengue. Protecting yourself from dengue Preventing mosquito bites\u00a0and\u00a0controlling mosquitoes\u00a0in and around the home are the key ways to prevent dengue. If you\u2019re going outside, the CDC recommends US Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellents to prevent bites from mosquitoes that may be carrying dengue. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants is another option, along with treating your clothing with 0.5% permethrin, an insecticide. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which spreads dengue and other viruses, does not like to travel far and prefers to breed in our backyards, said Dr. Isik Unlu, acting director and operations manager of the Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control Division. \u201cThey prefer to be around people. That is the problem,\u201d she said, adding that the species is often found in containers that collect rainwater, especially during the summer months. Almost everything you see in a backyard can become a breeding ground, Unlu says, including birdbaths, plant saucers, tires, extension gutters and kiddie pools. Unlu and Paz-Bailey recommend removing standing water around your home as often as possible to prevent mosquitoes from gathering and breeding. Mosquito surveillance in the US In Florida, Unlu and her team are often called out to homes where mosquito infestations are reported. If they find a large population of adult mosquitoes, the team heads out in the middle of the night to spray the area with insecticide. Her county has hundreds of mosquito traps set. \u201cWhen we collect the mosquitos from these traps, especially if it\u2019s an area that we suspect dengue is circulating or we have confirmed cases, our research team assists us to process these mosquitos,\u201d Unlu said. The mosquitos are evaluated for sex, counted, put in test tubes and sent to a lab outside Orlando to be tested for dengue and other viruses. Dengue is not considered endemic to Florida, according to the CDC. Unlu says this is largely due to disease surveillance operations. But the virus is present in the southern part of the state because of people traveling to places where it is endemic, such as Cuba or Brazil. \u201cWe get residents who go on vacation or visit their family where dengue is endemic and more common, and they get bitten there, and then they travel back here,\u201d Unlu said. \u201cAnd since we have the vector, Aedes aegypti, here, when they get bit, the mosquitos then get infected, and then they bite another human being who never traveled outside Miami, and they get sick.\u201d The CDC\u2019s Paz-Bailey says climate change will also encourage the spread of dengue around the world. \u201cHigher temperatures will probably expand the range of places where a mosquito can survive. And then it can also facilitate transmission through other ways, like faster viral replication in the mosquito and increased survival of mosquitoes,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_health_birth-control-drops-after-abortion-bans", "text": "Women in states with the most restrictive abortion laws have also become less likely to access prescription birth control, a new study suggests. In a dozen states that have enacted near-total abortion bans, monthly prescription rates for birth control pills and emergency contraceptives were significantly lower in the second half of 2023 than they were before the US Supreme Court Dobbs decision that revoked the federal right to abortion, according to the study published Wednesday in the JAMA Network Open medical journal. The researchers point to the closures of some family planning clinics and broad public confusion about what options remain legal in the wake of the June 2022 Dobbs decision as key factors contributing to this trend. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to recognize that these issues all fall under the scope of reproductive health care,\u201d said Dr. Michael Belmonte, an Ob-Gyn and fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists focused on complex family planning. He was not involved in the new research. \u201cWhen something touches on abortion care, that will ultimately have ripple effects for miscarriage care, for contraception and emergency contraception, and, quite frankly, access to general medical health care for many women across the United States.\u201d For the new study, researchers tracked trends in monthly birth control prescription rates from March to November 2021 \u2013 a period before the Dobbs decision leaked \u2013 and after the decision, from July 2022 to October 2023. They compared rates in a group of 12 states that enacted the most restrictive policies to a group of 14 states where abortion policy remained relatively consistent. The use of birth control pills has been trending down in the US overall \u2013 and other research suggests that use of IUDs, a longer-acting form of birth control, has been growing for decades \u2013 but the prescription fill rate fell about 4% more than expected in states with the most restrictive laws post-Dobbs, according to the new research. States with abortion bans saw an even more significant drop in prescriptions for emergency contraception \u2013 including levonorgestrel, such as Plan B, and ulipristal, such as Ella. Both groups of states studied \u2013 those that enacted bans and those where abortion policies stayed more consistent \u2013 had a similar prescription fill rate pre-Dobbs and both and saw an initial spike following the decision.\u00a0But by the second half of 2023, the prescription rate for emergency contraception in the states with bans was less than half of what it was before the Dobbs decision \u2013 dropping from about 20 fills for every 100,000 women of reproductive age each month down to eight fills. In states where abortion policies stayed consistent, the rate actually ticked up in the same timeframe \u2013 from 20 to 21 fills. \u201cThese findings suggest that efforts to protect and improve access to oral contraceptives are needed, especially for emergency contraceptives in states where abortion is most strongly restricted,\u201d the study authors wrote. Emergency contraception has become enmeshed in the abortion debate, and survey data suggests that there was widespread public confusion around the legality of emergency contraception months after the Dobbs decision and how it differed from medication abortion. Nearly a third of adults were \u201cunsure\u201d if emergency contraceptive pills were legal in their state, according to a KFF survey from January 2023. The confusion was even greater in states with abortion bans, where half of women either incorrectly thought that it was illegal or were unsure. \u201cThis drives home the importance for proper and accurate patient education, consumer education, and the need to combat disinformation and misinformation about the conflation and confusion between (emergency contraception and abortion,\u201d said Karen Diep, a women\u2019s health policy analyst with KFF who was not involved in the new research. In December 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration adjusted the Plan B label to explicitly state that it \u201cdoes not terminate pregnancy.\u201d All while reproductive health care deserts are getting worse. About 1 in 9 women of reproductive age in the US \u2013 and closer to 1 in 5 Black and Hispanic women \u2013 rely on family planning clinics to get contraception, according to a KFF analysis from 2022. But dozens of clinics closed post-Dobbs \u2013 and the new study found that declines in emergency contraception prescriptions were greatest in states that saw more widespread closures of family planning clinics. And the landscape continues to change rapidly, adding to the confusion and challenges around access. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted to block a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to contraception nationwide. But the Biden administration has \u201credoubled\u201d commitments to protect access to reproductive health care, including support for Title X family planning clinics and work to ensure birth control remains accessible under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIn the two years since\u00a0Dobbs, we have witnessed the devastating impacts. Many women, especially those in states with stringent abortion\u00a0restrictions, have found themselves navigating care deserts, forced to travel great distances to\u00a0receive essential services. These barriers disproportionately affect marginalized communities,\u00a0exacerbating existing health disparities,\u201d US Department of Health and Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration stands firm in its commitment to defending reproductive rights. We believe that no woman should have fewer rights than her mother and that women must have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies without fear or interference from politicians,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/birth-control-drops-after-abortion-bans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness", "text": "Scientists have found microplastics in human penises for the first time, as concerns over the tiny particles\u2019 proliferation and potential health effects mount. Seven different kinds of microplastics were found in four out of five samples of penis tissue taken from five different men as part of a study published in IJIR: Your Sexual Medicine Journal on Wednesday. Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. They form when larger plastics break down,\u00a0either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. Some minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, and evidence is mounting that they are increasingly present in our bodies. Study lead author Ranjith Ramasamy, an expert in reproductive urology who conducted the research while working at the University of Miami, told CNN that he used a previous study that found evidence of microplastics in the human heart as a basis for his research. Ramasamy said he wasn\u2019t surprised to find microplastics in the penis, as it is a \u201cvery vascular organ,\u201d like the heart. The samples were taken from study participants who had been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction (ED) and were in the hospital to undergo surgery for penile implants to treat the condition at the University of Miami between August and September 2023. The samples were then analyzed using chemical imaging, which revealed that four of the five men had microplastics in their penile tissue. Seven different types of microplastics were detected, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) the most prevalent, according to the study.  Now their presence has been confirmed, more research is needed to investigate potential links to conditions such as ED, Ramasamy said. \u201cWe need to identify whether microplastics are linked to ED and if there is a level beyond which it causes pathology and what types of microplastics are pathologic,\u201d he said. As for the wider implications of the findings, Ramasamy said he hoped the study would \u201ccreate more awareness about the presence of foreign bodies within human organs and foster more research surrounding this topic.\u201d Prior research has found that one liter of bottled water \u2014 the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters \u2014 contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles. \u201cI think we need to be mindful about consuming water and food from plastic bottles and containers and try and limit the use until more research is done to identify levels that could cause pathology,\u201d Ramasamy said. Toxicologist Matthew J. Campen told CNN that this is \u201can interesting study that confirms the ubiquity of plastics in the body.\u201d \u201cAs we are trying to understand the potential health effects of plastics, this is another concerning paper,\u201d said Campen,\u00a0a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cPlastics are generally non-reactive with the cells and chemicals of our bodies, but they could be physically disruptive to the many processes our bodies undertake for normal function, including functions related to erection and sperm production.\u201d Campen coauthored a study published in May that found that human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas. The study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers of males who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said at the time the study was published. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d There are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to microplastics. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

Drinking a glass of\u00a0strong liquor\u00a0every day.\u00a0Bacon\u00a0for breakfast every morning.\u00a0Wine and chocolate. While a popular news story, this is a relatively meaningless question that doesn\u2019t help us understand why certain people have lived so long. Let me try to explain why, via beautiful buildings, fighter pilots and statistics. READ MORE: Why hypochondriacs die earlier than those who worry less about their health In the second world war, Allied statisticians were applying their skills to minimising the number of bombers being shot down by enemy fire. By studying the damage patterns of bombers returning from action, maps could be drawn up of the most frequently damaged parts of aeroplanes so that expensive, heavy armour could be added to these areas. Simple enough, right? Then, along comes statistician Abraham Wald who argues for the exact\u00a0opposite point. The planes that they\u2019re studying are all those that did return from combat with extensive damage, but what about those that didn\u2019t return? Wald argues that armour should be added to those places that are undamaged on all the returning planes, as any plane hit in these undamaged areas was shot down, never making it back to be surveyed. READ MORE: What the world\u2019s oldest dog can tell us about aging Survivorship bias This phenomenon is known as survivorship bias, or the cognitive and statistical bias introduced by only counting those that are around to count but ignoring those that haven\u2019t \u201csurvived.\u201d You can take these examples to the absurd. Imagine a group of 100 people, all of whom have smoked their entire life. As a group, the smokers would die earlier of cancers, lung disease or heart disease, but one or two might defy the odds and live to 100 years of age. Now imagine the intrepid journalist interviewing the lucky soul on their 100th birthday with that classic question: \u201cWhat do you attribute your successful ageing to?\u201d \u201cSmoking a pack a day,\u201d says the newly minted centenarian. It seems obvious but survivorship bias is everywhere in society. We can all think of that one famous actor or entrepreneur who succeeded despite adversity, who worked hard, believed in themselves and one day made it. But we never read about or hear about the countless examples of people who tried, gave it their all and never quite made it. READ MORE: Are you a rapid ager?\u00a0 That\u2019s not a good media story. But this creates a bias, we primarily hear the successes, never the failures. This bias applies to our perceptions of architecture (mostly great buildings from a given period \u201csurvive\u201d), to finances (we often hear examples of people who have succeeded in risky investments, those who fail don\u2019t sell books or self-help plans) and to career plans (\u201cIf you work hard, and drop out of college now, you can be a successful athlete like me,\u201d say those who have succeeded). I work with a variety of older people and often include extreme outliers who have lived to extreme ages. We\u2019re currently studying over 65-year-olds who have maintained unusually high levels of exercise into older age and have maintained excellent health. They\u2019re phenomenal examples of older humans, many of them are faster, fitter and stronger than me by many of the measures we perform in the lab, despite being almost twice my age. READ MORE: Why married people live longer\u00a0 While we know that their lifelong exercise is associated with their unusually good health into older age, we can\u2019t directly say one causes the other yet. It could be that highly active people are protected against chronic diseases such as cancers, diabetes and heart disease. But it also could be that these people are still active into older age as they\u2019ve not been afflicted by cancers, diabetes or heart disease earlier in their lives. Conversely, there could be some unknown third factor that we\u2019ve not yet identified about these people that both keeps them healthy and separately keeps them exercising. For clarity, there are things that scientists like me will say in carefully caveated, scientific language that will probably help you to live longer. Being very physically active, not eating too much and not smoking are all on that list, along with generally having a positive outlook in life, and of course, picking the right parents and grandparents. Correlation does not equal causation. That point is hammered home relentlessly to students in science degrees. It\u2019s how our brain works, we see a pattern between two variables, and assume they\u2019re linked in some way.

{"id": "2024_06_27_health_parents-kids-screen-time-wellness", "text": "Whether it\u2019s\u00a0lockboxes\u00a0or\u00a0control apps, parents have searched far and wide for ways to reduce their child\u2019s screen time. A new\u00a0study\u00a0suggests that the answer may lie in the parent\u2019s own screen habits. Using a phone in front of your child can have more of an effect than you might think. The study, published this month in\u00a0the journal Pediatric Research, shows that parents\u2019 screen use is associated with increased adolescent screen time \u2013 along with problematic social media, video game and mobile phone use. Problematic use can include addictive behaviors such as withdrawal, building tolerance, relapse and obsessive thoughts, which may disrupt daily functioning, according to the study. The researchers analyzed data from the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, involving over 10,000 families with 12- and 13-year-olds. The data revealed that\u00a072.9% of parents said they use screens around their adolescents. This is a huge predictor of a child\u2019s screen use, according to Dr. Jason Nagata, lead study author and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. When a child sees their parent using a screen, experts say, they are likely to mimic the behavior. Surveyed parents rated their agreement with statements such as \u201cWhen I am with my child, I use a screen-based device\u201d on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Each point increase was associated with a nearly 40-minute rise in their children\u2019s screen time. \u201cEven if parents think their kids are not paying attention, the data shows one of the biggest predictors of preteen screen use is what their parents do with screens in front of them,\u201d Nagata said. Dr. Ken Ginsburg, a professor of pediatrics at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who was not involved in the study, added that parents are role models for their children 24/7. \u201cOur actions can speak so loudly that kids can\u2019t hear the words we are saying. Practicing what we preach makes all the difference,\u201d he said. Using screen time as a reward or consequence might also be counterproductive, increasing usage.\u00a0Preteens, who may be increasingly turning to social media for support and identity exploration, can view these parenting practices as intrusive, leading to rejection of rules, according to the study. \u201cWhen parents are overly controlling, it backfires,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cKids watch what we do and don\u2019t like to be controlled. When kids perceive we set rules to control them, they always go around those rules.\u201d The screen age Children\u2019s average daily screen time more than doubled during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to\u00a0previous research, and some nations are grappling with how to curb the potential negative effects. Regulators in China have\u00a0proposed\u00a0a two-hour daily limit on phone time for minors. In the US, the surgeon general has\u00a0called\u00a0for warning labels on social media apps to mitigate \u201csignificant harms\u201d associated with their use. \u201cScreen use is on the rise for everyone,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cWhile screens in themselves are not inherently bad \u2026 teenagers are particularly vulnerable to excessive use.\u201d Specifically, screen overuse reduces the essential sleep time and quality needed for a kid\u2019s healthy development, according to Nagata and previous research. Beyond role modeling, open communication and creating a media plan are effective strategies for balanced screen use, according to the study and guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Family Media Plan. Dr. Susan Tomopoulos, co-developer of the plan and an associate professor of pediatrics at NYU\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine who was not part of the new study, said the increased pandemic screen times were an impetus for the academy to update its media recommendations. \u201cAfter the pandemic, parents were turning to doctors because they wanted to manage their family\u2019s media habits,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they were overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know where to start.\u201d Setting up healthy media practices begins with a family conversation to customize screen time guidelines and outline screen-free zones around the house, according to the academy. This is especially important in the bedroom and dining room, where screen presence is associated with higher adolescent screen time and problematic social, video game and mobile phone use, the study found. Prioritizing screen-free activities and face-to-face time is crucial for a child\u2019s healthy development, according to Tomopoulos. \u201cIt is so easy for adults, as well as kids, to get caught up in swiping and scrolling. We really want entire families to check their digital habits at home \u2026 and to talk early and often about technology media,\u201d she added. How to have a conversation with your child Initiating a productive discussion on media use starts with conveying to the child, \u201cI set rules because I care,\u201d according to Ginsburg, who is also co-founder and program director of the\u00a0Center for Parent and Teen Communication. \u201cOne of the biggest myths is that teenagers do not care what their parents say. When we set rules, it is important we communicate why,\u201d he said. \u201cThe baseline should be \u2018I care about you, and therefore blank,\u2019 instead of \u2018don\u2019t do blank.\u2019 \u201d The conversation may end with an agreement on certain principles such as establishing a \u201cone screen at a time\u201d rule and limiting screens at mealtime, bedtime and study time, as\u00a0recommended\u00a0by the American Academy of Pediatrics. As the ABCD Study continues to follow participants into adulthood, research into the long-term effects of excessive adolescent screen use is also unfolding. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot more guidance for parents to help their children navigate social media,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cThe goal is to give children the skills to develop healthy screen behaviors for their young adulthood and beyond.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story spelled Dr. Ken Ginsburg\u2019s name incorrectly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/parents-kids-screen-time-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}

We know that adults should aim for at least\u00a0150 minutes \u00a0of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly. This can include exercises such as brisk walking, biking, playing basketball, swimming and more vigorous household tasks like mowing the lawn and vacuuming, also called functional fitness.\u00a0But is that all safe to do at high temperatures? How hot is too hot for exercising outdoors? Is it safe to exercise outside at some times of the day? Should younger or older people take more precautions in the heat? What about people who have heart and kidney conditions or take certain medications? To help us stay fit and safe in the summer heat, I spoke with CNN wellness analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What precautions should people take before exercising during the summer? Wen:\u00a0Summer can be a fantastic time to get outside and become more active, but as temperatures rise to unsafe levels,\u00a0people should be aware of the risk of\u00a0heat-related illnesses. I\u2019d advise that people look at the weather forecast before exercising. If a\u00a0heat wave\u00a0is expected, avoid exercising in the hottest part of the day and instead go out in the morning or evening. If it\u2019s going to be very hot all day and into the night, don\u2019t do your workout outside. CNN: What can happen if people work or exercise too much outside in the heat? Wen:\u00a0Someone working or exercising outside for prolonged periods of time may experience symptoms of heat exhaustion, including headache, weakness, dizziness\u00a0and nausea. When this happens, get out of the sun and into a cool, air-conditioned space. If symptoms worsen and the person develops confusion and vomiting, for instance, they may have\u00a0heat stroke, which is an emergency and requires immediate medical attention. CNN: Which people are most at risk during a heat wave?\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0\u00a0People who are the most vulnerable include those who are very young and elderly, and those who have chronic medical conditions. Several underlying conditions, such as heart, lung and kidney problems, can be exacerbated by heat. CNN: Do any medications make people more vulnerable during a heat wave? Wen:\u00a0Several medications can increase risk during times of extreme heat. Common blood pressure medications, like calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics, can have effects such as increasing the likelihood of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances during extreme heat. There are medications used for some mental health conditions that can affect the body\u2019s normal response to regulate temperature. That includes some antidepressants and stimulants used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Over-the-counter medicines can also have these effects. Diphenhydramine, for instance, and doxylamine are common antihistamines that can make people sweat less and affect temperature regulation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/exercise-summer-heat-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness", "text": "When her daughter was 6 years old, Kelceymarie Warner began to notice her child\u2019s hesitation before bedtime. \u201cHer body would be a little more tense, and she would hyperventilate if you pushed the subject too soon, she really needed to be slowly moved into the cycle.\u201d Warner, who is a parent to four young daughters, believes that sticking to a nightly routine is the best way for her kids to have an easy transition to bedtime. But when her 6-year-old was experiencing bedtime anxiety, Warner had to make some additions to her routine. Warner is not the only one \u2014 many parents know all too well what can be a nightly struggle to get their young children to bed. A new C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health reinforces this common difficulty, revealing that 1 in 4 parents said their child has trouble getting to sleep because they are anxious or worried. Over one-third of parents reported that their child doesn\u2019t stay asleep throughout the night and often or occasionally wakes up upset or crying. \u201cFrom 1 year of age to 6 years of age, kids change a lot. The different phases that they go to are often pretty predictable: They\u2019re scared of the dark, or as kids develop and their imagination develops \u2026 now they\u2019re scared of monsters,\u201d said Sarah Clark, Mott poll co-director and a research scientist in pediatrics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt can be all sorts of things, and so often with kids, and I would argue adults too, some of those anxieties seem to come out at night.\u201d The Mott Poll was conducted in February with 781 parents who have at least one child age 1 to 6 years old. Almost half reported their child leaving their bed and moving to the parent\u2019s bed some or most nights, while 1 in 3 parents said their child often or occasionally insists that they stay in the room until the child falls asleep. But some of these habits may be causing more trouble than the temporary relief they provide, Clark said. While a child may feel safe knowing the parent is in the room, they could later wake up and not be able to go back to sleep on their own, she added. How to help an anxious child with bedtime Warner said her child\u2019s bedtime anxiety may have been caused by the major changes that happened when her youngest daughter was in the neonatal intensive care unit for three months. \u201cMy husband and I were gone for extended periods during the day and even during the night because we wanted to be with a new baby who was born three months early \u2014 but we also needed to be there with our other children. I think she really struggled with a major change in her routine, and it just kind of triggered this very difficult time for her especially.\u201d Warner began incorporating activities into her daughter\u2019s bedtime routine that would promote relaxation and reassurance, such as drinking herbal tea after bathtime, reading a story together and saying nightly affirmations like \u201cI am loved\u201d and \u201cI am important.\u201d The new routine took longer than usual, sometimes up to an hour, but now, a little over a year later, her daughter is able to go through some parts of the routine on her own, and is able to better self-soothe, Warner said. She had posted her advice for other parents that may be facing a similar scenario\u00a0on her TikTok\u00a0account in 2023. The most important factor in getting kids to bed is consistency and sticking with a bedtime routine, Mott Poll co-director Clark said. Ninety percent of polled parents reported having an established and consistent bedtime routine. But some 27% described getting their child to bed was difficult, and those parents were more likely to not have a bedtime routine, stay in the room until the child fell asleep and keep the television or a video on. \u201cWe know that young children really resonate with consistency and routine, and getting ready for bed helps their body and their brain know that this is the time to start winding down,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Hartstein, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. She studies sleep and circadian health in early childhood and was not involved in the Mott poll. Hartstein recommends limiting media use at night, especially avoiding exciting content that could stimulate the child\u2019s brain and make it harder to wind down. A\u00a0January 2022 study\u00a0that Hartstein led found that children around this age group were more sensitive to light at night than adults are, and it could interfere with a child\u2019s production of natural melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Parents could find it beneficial to dim the lights an hour before bed, which would trigger a mental cue that it\u2019s time to get ready to sleep soon, she added. As for staying in the child\u2019s bedroom until they fall asleep, Clark recommends leaving the room and returning to check in every few minutes, which lets the child know that someone will be making sure they are safe every so often, but not staying in the room indefinitely. It\u2019s common for young children to experience sleep issues, especially as preschool-age children begin to reduce or drop naptime, Hartstein said. If parents are especially worried or see their child struggling during the day because they are sleepy, they should talk with their pediatrician, she added. Giving melatonin to young children The poll also found 1 in 5 parents often or sometimes give their child melatonin before bedtime, which came as a surprise given the younger age range of 1 to 6 years old, Clark said. \u201cClearly, this is something that people are feeling the need to try with younger kids. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a signal of how disruptive sleep problems can be for the whole family.\u201d It isn\u2019t recommended to give melatonin to children younger than age of 3, since many sleep issues with children that age are behavioral, according to\u00a0Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0If a parent is considering giving melatonin to their child, they should speak with their pediatrician first, Hartstein said. \u201c(One) concern is that what you\u2019re teaching them is that if they can\u2019t sleep, they should just take a medication, at a time when they should really be developing these healthy sleep habits that will carry them through childhood,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_health_fda-bird-flu-flash-pasteurization", "text": "New test results released by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday found that bird flu virus is making its way from dairy farms and into milk processing plants but also confirmed that the commonly used flash pasteurization method fully neutralizes the virus. The FDA collected and tested 275 bulk samples of raw milk collected from farms in four states where herds had tested positive for H5N1, or bird flu. The samples were collected between April 18 and 27. Half of those samples were positive for traces of influenza. A quarter of those positive samples also proved to be infectious, meaning the virus grew when it was inoculated into fertilized chicken eggs, the gold-standard test for determining whether a virus is viable and could make someone sick. Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, noted that the milk the agency tested was bound for pasteurization and was not going directly to store shelves. But he says he is aware that some states allow the sale of raw milk for human or animal consumption. \u201cThat\u2019s why we put out the messaging that we have around raw milk, because it could be a potential route of exposure,\u201d Prater said. The FDA has long recommended against consuming raw milk because of potential contamination. It urged states this month to to\u00a0warn the public more strongly about the dangers of raw milk\u00a0and to\u00a0test\u00a0herds that produce it for sale. The\u00a0FDA\u00a0also recommended that states use their regulatory authorities to stop the sale of raw milk\u00a0within the state or\u00a0in areas where dairy herds have tested positive. Prater says the FDA tested the raw milk to get an idea of how much virus might be in milk that was making it to pasteurization plants. Based on the concentrations of virus in the samples they collected, FDA scientists next took uninfected raw milk from the University of Georgia dairy and laced it with live H5N1 virus. They ran it through a machine they built that replicated all steps of flash pasteurization, where milk is heated to 161 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 seconds. Their testing included a preheating step that was missing from earlier studies that had tested the same times and temperatures to kill live virus. In fact, the preheating step fully neutralized all the infectious virus, Prater said, proving that it was a critical element of the process. \u201cWe built an instrument so that we could sample milk as it goes through these different stages\u201d of the pasteurization process, Prater said, \u201cand what we found is that the virus was actually inactivated even before it got into the holding tube.\u201d Prater says the new study really helps explain earlier research that found that 1 in 5 dairy products pulled from store shelves contained inert fragments of the H5N1 virus. \u201cThis information really helps explain what\u2019s happening via commercial processing,\u201d Prater said, and confirms that pasteurized milk is safe to drink. The FDA has announced that it will do another round of sampling of dairy products purchased at grocery stores, including cheese made from raw milk, but has not released the results of that testing. The FDA released its latest study as a preprint, ahead of peer review, and said it had submitted the research to the Journal of Food Protection for publishing consideration.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/fda-bird-flu-flash-pasteurization/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_low-back-pain-walking-wellness", "text": "Low back pain affects at least 619 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to increase to 843 million people by 2050, according to research estimates. Unfortunately, nearly 70% of people who recover from an episode of low back pain have a recurrence within a year, experts say. In addition to acute physical discomfort and lost time at work, treatment often requires education, physical therapy and exercises such as Pilates that may require fees or specialized equipment. Yet there is an easy, free way to prevent low back pain, at least for a while, according to a new randomized clinical trial. People in the study who walked regularly after having at least one episode of low back pain were pain free nearly twice as long as those who did not. \u201cThe intervention group had fewer occurrences of activity-limiting pain compared to the control group, and a longer average period before they had a recurrence, with a median of 208 days compared to 112 days,\u201d said senior author Mark Hancock, a professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University in Sydney. \u201cWalking is a low-cost, widely accessible and simple exercise that almost anyone can engage in, regardless of geographic location, age or socio-economic status,\u201d Hancock said in a statement. Walking for at least 30 minutes The study, published Wednesday in The Lancet journal, followed 701 Australian adults, mostly women in their 50s, who had recently recovered from an episode of low back pain that derailed their ability to perform daily activities. Each person was randomly assigned to a control group with no intervention or an individualized walking and educational program. Those in the intervention group were asked to build up to 30 minutes of walking five times a week over a six-month period at speeds adjusted for age, physical capacity and individual preferences. Jogging was also allowed. \u201cAfter three months, most of the people who took part were walking three to five days a week for an average of 130 minutes in total,\u201d Hancock told CNN via email. Participants were asked to wear pedometers to track their daily steps and keep a walking diary. At three months into the program, they also wore an accelerometer that objectively measured daily step count and the amount of brisk walking or other physical activity. The program also provided six physiotherapist-guided education sessions over six months, a more cost-effective model than typical treatment, Hancock said. \u201cWe included 3 standard sessions with a physiotherapist and 3 brief phone catch ups,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn the few previous studies of prevention exercise programs for back pain the intervention included approximately 20 group classes. \u201cWe also discussed simple strategies to reduce the risk of a recurrence of low back pain and instructions on how to self-manage any minor recurrences. The education was embedded in the same sessions as the walking prescription.\u201d Cost-effective intervention In addition to providing participants with longer pain-free periods, the walking program reduced the amount of time taken off work and medical visits by half, said lead study author\u00a0Natasha Pocovi, a postdoctoral fellow at Macquarie. \u201cThe exercise-based interventions to prevent back pain that have been explored previously are typically group-based and need close clinical supervision and expensive equipment, so they are much less accessible to the majority of patients,\u201d Pocovi said in a statement. \u201cOur study has shown that this effective and accessible means of exercise has the potential to be successfully implemented at a much larger scale than other forms of exercise.\u201d Due to the structure of the study, it was not possible to determine how much of the benefit was due to walking or the educational program provided by physiotherapists, Hancock said. \u201cWe believe it is likely the two components complement each other, with education helping to overcome avoidance and fear of movement, while the health coaching and walking program resulted in behavior change,\u201d he said. However, because the intervention appeared to be behavioral coaching, and not actual physical therapy, the act of walking may indeed have been the key reason for improvement, said A. Lynn Millar, a retired physical therapist\u00a0and former professor at Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was not involved in the study. \u201cThis is important, as many studies have shown that pain response is partially a behavioral response,\u201d Millar said in an email. \u201cThe coaching was limited in duration, thus they can suggest that the primary intervention of walking was the major contributor to the long term response.\u201d What walking does for the body What is it about walking that is so helpful for lower back pain? For one, exercise is good for every part of the body. \u201cFirst, the person is sitting less, and sitting is not the best posture for the back,\u201d Millar said. \u201cSecond, walking will improve general circulation,\u00a0and will improve blood circulation to the\u00a0muscles of the back that\u00a0are\u00a0actively supporting the individual during the motion. Movement of a joint also helps circulate the\u00a0joint fluids,\u00a0thus the\u00a0joints of the\u00a0spine may be benefiting from the motion.\u201d Walking improves metabolism and the amount of calories burned, experts say. Lower weight can ease the load on the back and legs, ensuring better spinal health. Taking a brisk stroll also improves the strength of core muscles around the spine and in the legs, all of which can improve posture and provide better support to the spine. Walking also increases muscle endurance, assuring muscles are less susceptible to fatigue and injury. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking increase bone density, protecting against injury while stimulating the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good hormones that reduce pain and stress. When starting a walking program, good shoes and arch supports are necessary,\u00a0and potential problems may be offset by exercise programs such as resistance training and stretching, Millar said. \u201cI also think it is important to have varied paces and distances throughout the week. Some problems are caused by progressing too rapidly, and not paying attention to initial\u00a0aches,\u201d she said. \u201cI also used to see people that were walking in shoes that did not have good support, or they had become so worn, the support was gone,\u201d she added. If your \u201cback goes out\u201d during walking, activity modification such as cycling or swimming may be necessary, Millar said.\u00a0 Taking a day or two off from walking and doing some back exercises and stretching can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/low-back-pain-walking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_er-visits-heat-related-illnesses-wellness", "text": "As heat blankets much of the US, hospitals in many states are seeing extremely high rates of heat-related emergencies, according to data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and forecasters say more abnormally warm weather is on the way later this summer. According to the CDC\u2019s map, the regions hardest hit by heat illnesses are not always the ones seeing the highest temperatures. While temperatures have soared to 100 degrees and even beyond across much of the South and Southwest, the states seeing the highest numbers of heat-related ER visits are in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Mountain west, where temperatures have been in the 80s and 90s. But the heat is much more unusual, especially in mid-June, for these locations,\u00a0trending well above historical averages. On Saturday, for example, when the heat was reaching a climax in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, hospitals in more than two dozen states across six regions reported \u201cextremely high\u201d rates of heat-related emergencies despite temperatures hovering in that lower range. The CDC defines \u201cextremely high\u201d as being in the top 5% of busiest days for heat-related illnesses over the last five years, from 2018 through 2023. Hot buildings, inexperience put people at risk CDC health scientist Claudia Brown says that\u2019s because built environments in those areas aren\u2019t designed to deal with heat and people\u2019s bodies aren\u2019t as used to handling high temperatures. \u201cSo in these more northern regions, for example, there tends to be less prevalence of air conditioning in the homes,\u201d said Brown,\u00a0who works in the Climate and Health Program at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health.\u00a0\u201cSo you may not have as high of temperatures as you have in, say, Arizona, but you have a higher health impact because they don\u2019t have, necessarily, the infrastructure in place to deal with that heat.\u201d With climate change increasing both the number and intensity of heat waves, the CDC earlier this year launched a new heat risk tool where people can look up their ZIP code and see a heat forecast and recommendations to stay safe. Dr. Cheyenne Falat works in the emergency department at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, a city that declared a code red heat alert over the weekend and opened cooling stations for residents. \u201cWe have seen some pretty significant cases of heat stroke and other heat illnesses coming in over the past few weeks, not just the past few days,\u201d said Falat, who also specializes in environmental medicine.\u00a0 She\u2019s bracing for more. In Baltimore, where there are high rates of substance use disorders, people can get into trouble if they take drugs and pass out in a car with no one around.\u00a0 Other patients have been older adults who live in homes without air conditioning, outdoor workers, and people who underestimate the heat when they head outside for a workout. Falat said heat is a serious health threat Americans are just learning how to grapple with.  \u201cHeat waves as a natural phenomenon kill more people, on average, than any other extreme weather event,\u201d she said. Staying safe in extreme heat Dr. William Brady, who works in the emergency department at the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville said he thinks inexperience has a lot to do with it, too. \u201cYou know, if you live in New Hampshire, you\u2019re used to really not dealing with terribly high periods of heat,\u201d Brady said. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that way, that I have to be careful with the heat.\u201d Brady said their ER is seeing an uptick in cases of heat exhaustion, usually in people who work or exercise outdoors.\u00a0 They come in with \u201cnausea, vomiting, headache, that sort of thing.\u201d So far, he says, he hasn\u2019t seen any cases of heat stroke, which can be life-threatening. Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, where patients have a throbbing headache, a rapid heart rate, high fever, as well as neurological symptoms like confusion. They may also faint or pass out. Brady said he\u2019s also seeing more people with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk from climbing temperatures such as emphysema, heart failure and diabetes. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more patients that are coming in just not tolerating the heat,\u201d he said. With climate change driving longer, ever hotter waves of high temperatures, Americans are on a steep learning curve when it comes to heat. \u201cWe know that heat is uncomfortable when temperatures and humidity reach a certain height,\u201d Brady said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not really used to being threatened by it the way other parts of the world have had been.\u201d Brady recently attended a medical conference in Taiwan and took a class to learn how to manage large crowds and mass gatherings during periods of high heat, to cut down on the risk of heat injury. \u201cThis is a potentially new issue that were beginning to face,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAnd we need to pay attention to it because it is exceedingly dangerous.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/er-visits-heat-related-illnesses-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_health_covid-summer-wave", "text": "Covid-19 levels have been rising in the United States for weeks as new variants drive what\u2019s become an annual summer surge. Covid-19 surveillance has been scaled back significantly since the US public health emergency ended more than a year ago \u2014 individual cases are no longer counted, and severe outcomes are based on representative samples of the population \u2014 but the data that is available is showing a consistent upward trend. Infections are probably growing in at least 38 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wastewater surveillance suggests that viral activity is still relatively low, but hospitalizations and deaths are also ticking up. Covid-19 levels are especially high in the West, where viral levels are back to what they were in February, and in the South, according to the CDC. \u201cThe virus tends to replicate well and to stay alive in an environment with warm and moist conditions. That fits with what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, a nonprofit public health organization. \u201cThe South and the West are steamy and hot right now.\u201d The summer bump has become a familiar seasonal pattern, but experts warn that the coronavirus can still be quite unpredictable. \u201cI think it\u2019s still a bit early to say what the pattern is,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cA large portion of the population has had some exposure to the virus, the peaks have been a little bit less high, and we have tended to see a summer bump as well as a winter increase. But whether that pattern is going to continue or whether it will become an all-year-round disease or whether it will stay in one particular time \u2014 I think it\u2019s a little early to say.\u201d Data from WastewaterSCAN, a nationwide sewage surveillance network based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, suggests that this summer wave started weeks earlier than last summer\u2019s wave and has reached levels similar to last summer\u2019s peak. \u201cIt remains to be seen if this will be a peak level for this surge,\u201d said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, assistant professor of environmental health at Emory and program director for WastewaterSCAN. \u201cWe are always trying to unpack what is potential seasonality with Covid and also what are the impacts of new variants that may be coming through that drive these surges that we see more regularly, more frequently than we do for influenza and RSV,\u201d she said. Over the past few months, the JN.1 virus variant that drove this winter\u2019s surge has been overtaken by newer offshoots. These so-called FLiRT variants \u2014 an acronym that refers to the locations of the amino acid\u00a0mutations that the virus has picked up \u2014 have changes in some places that help them evade the body\u2019s immune response and others that help them become more transmissible. Two of them \u2014 KP.3 and KP.2 \u2014 now account for more than half of the new Covid infections in the US, according to CDC data. Expect an updated vaccine this fall Because of manufacturing timelines, experts have to make predictions now if they want a new vaccine for fall. Earlier this month, the FDA endorsed a plan to update the Covid-19 shots to be more effective against the JN.1 lineage of the coronavirus. But the agency later updated its own recommendation. Vaccine manufacturers were advised to target the KP.2 strain if possible, in part because of the \u201crecent rise in cases.\u201d \u201cJN.1 has continued to evolve, and it makes it somewhat difficult to pick the particular specific strain to be used,\u201d Dr. Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told an independent advisory committee ahead of the initial recommendation. The new vaccines \u2014 some that will make the switch to target KP.2 \u2014 are anticipated to become available between mid-August and late September. That\u2019s enough time to offer protection during the winter respiratory virus season but probably after this summer\u2019s wave has ebbed. On Thursday, the CDC recommended that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated Covid-19 vaccine for the 2024-25 season. The recommendation echoes the vote of that agency\u2019s independent advisory committee. \u201cIt makes sense to do that vaccine at the same time that you\u2019re expecting flu and RSV, because you just want to reduce the overall incidence of disease,\u201d Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told CNN. Protection from Covid-19 vaccines wanes, and the timing of the shot prioritizes maximum protection when there have typically been higher and more sustained peaks, Plescia said. Unlike flu and RSV, Covid-19 is constantly circulating; it doesn\u2019t offer a reprieve. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever get a break,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do get a break from flu and RSV. You get through the season, and then you\u2019re done. You can prepare for the next one. [Covid] is just kind of always there.\u201d Flu and RSV levels now remain low in the US, according to the latest CDC update. But vaccination rates for all three major respiratory viruses lagged during the winter season, and the CDC advisers also looked ahead to the upcoming season with discussions around vaccine coverage recommendations for flu and RSV. On Wednesday, the CDC updated its recommendations on who should get the RSV vaccine. For the upcoming respiratory virus season, everyone 75 and older is urged to get an RSV vaccine, as well as those ages 60 to 74 who are at higher risk of severe illness. The changes are meant to \u201csimplify RSV vaccine decision-making for clinicians and the public,\u201d the agency said. When it comes to infectious respiratory diseases, Plescia said, \u201cpeople need to remember that there are things you can do to reduce your risk. And getting vaccinated is the main one.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/covid-summer-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_cancer-drug-shortages-continue", "text": "While a shortage of the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and carboplatin has improved in the United States, some of the nation\u2019s largest cancer centers now report additional concerns related to drug shortages, a new report finds. Among 28 large cancer centers across the country, 89% reported last month that at least one drug used to either treat cancer, its symptoms or the side effects of treatment was in short supply at their center, according to new survey results released Wednesday by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. That percentage has not changed much from last year, when about 86% of surveyed centers reported a shortage of at least one type of anti-cancer drug. But what has changed is specifically which cancer drugs are impacted. The new NCCN survey, conducted from May 28 to June 11 of this year, found that among 28 of the network\u2019s 33 cancer centers, more than half \u2014 57% \u2014 reported a short supply of the chemotherapy drug vinblastine, which is often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to treat Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and cancer of the testicles. The centers that participated in the survey also reported that several other key cancer medications are currently in short supply, with 46% reporting a shortage of the chemotherapy drug etoposide and 43% reporting a shortage of the chemotherapy drug topotecan. Dr. Crystal Denlinger, chief executive officer of the NCCN, said in an email that she was not surprised by the new survey results. \u201cSadly, as a practicing oncologist, I am well aware of and understand the challenges facing my patients and colleagues regarding oncology drug shortages, which have been going on for years. On the bright side, we have seen a new enthusiasm for both short- and long-term solutions since last year\u2019s survey came out. Our new survey shows the short-term solutions were fairly effective at meeting immediate needs,\u201d Denlinger said. However, long-term solutions are still needed, she said. \u201cThe current presidential administration and Congress have put forth various proposals. However, people with cancer don\u2019t always have the luxury of time. Given the results of this most recent survey, it is imperative to keep this issue top of mind as this is an urgent issue that requires sustained attention and solutions.\u201d Last year, 21% of surveyed centers reported a shortage of vinblastine, and etoposide and topotecan were not mentioned by name in the previous survey. But in that previous survey, 72% of centers reported a\u00a0shortage of the chemotherapy medication carboplatin, and 59% reported a\u00a0shortage of cisplatin. Carboplatin and cisplatin are\u00a0used in combination to treat many types of cancer. Cisplatin\u00a0and other similar platinum-based drugs are prescribed for an estimated 10% to 20% of all cancer patients,\u00a0according to the\u00a0National Cancer Institute. The new survey results suggest that the shortage of carboplatin and cisplatin has improved, as only 11% of surveyed centers reported a short supply of carboplatin and 7% reported a shortage of cisplatin. \u201cThanks to policymakers, patient advocates, healthcare professionals and health systems who went to extraordinary efforts to collaborate and mitigate harm, the shortages for carboplatin and cisplatin are mostly resolved at this time,\u201d Denlinger said. \u2018A significant and ongoing problem\u2019 The new survey also indicated that the current shortage of cancer drugs has not significantly disrupted patient care or clinical trials. But additional administrative work has been needed to ensure these things are not disrupted, according to NCCN. Among the centers reporting drug shortages, more than half \u2013 56% \u2013 indicated that their center still was able to treat patients who were receiving those medications by enacting \u201cmitigation strategies,\u201d such as limiting the use of medications that were in stock, adjusting doses, and implementing waste management strategies. Meanwhile, 37% of the centers with shortages reported still treating patients without mitigation strategies. But among the surveyed centers that reported drug shortages, 43% indicated that the shortages have impacted clinical trials at their center, leading to greater administrative burdens, reductions in trial enrollments, reductions in open trials, and budget changes, among other disruptions. It\u2019s not just the large cancer centers that are part of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network that are experiencing these drug shortages. Dr. Carolyn Hendricks, an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) board member, who was not involved in the NCCN report, said that smaller community cancer centers also are experiencing short supplies of critical cancer medications. \u201cI\u2019m in a community oncology practice. We in the community are experiencing the same types of shortages that the NCCN cancer centers are experiencing, and this survey data, which is an update of some prior surveys, really speaks to the fact that this is really a significant and ongoing problem, both in the cancer center environment and also in the community,\u201d Hendricks said. In Hendricks\u2019 practice in Maryland, she said that the center is currently experiencing a significant shortage of the chemotherapy drug etoposide, which was named in the new NCCN report. She added that the center received an alert Tuesday about the shortage. \u201cIt\u2019s more used for thoracic oncology, lung cancer \u2013 and the drugs that are incorporated in the lung cancer regimens are very important \u2013 and some testicular cancers and some other types of solid tumors,\u201d Hendricks said about etoposide. \u201cCancer care is complicated, but the vast majority of all cancer patients are treated with combination regimens, and so therefore it\u2019s critical that if one drug is in shortage, it becomes a challenge to administer the entire regimen to the patient and to afford either the highest chance of cure or the best quality of life in patients who have advanced disease,\u201d she said. In February, the chief medical officer and executive vice president of ASCO, Dr. Julie Gralow, testified before the US House Committee on Ways & Means about chronic drug shortages in the United States, calling the shortage a crisis. \u201cEvery day we hear from oncologists around the country about the challenges cancer patients and their providers are facing amid some of the worst oncology drug shortages to date,\u201d Gralow said at the time. \u201cThis crisis is forcing providers to make impossible choices, including having to decide which patients receive lifesaving and life-prolonging oncology drugs on schedule and in the established doses \u2014 and which ones won\u2019t.\u201d What needs to change The issue of cancer drug shortages continues to be driven by a combination of supply chain and economics, Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the new NCCN report, said in an email. He added that he was not surprised by the report\u2019s findings. \u201cMost older chemotherapy agents, particularly sterile injectable ones are produced in just a few settings, often times overseas. There is very little incentive financially for production. Therefore there is little redundancy and significant vulnerability if there is a manufacturing or supply chain issue,\u201d Dahut said. \u201cThe regulatory bodies can help signal the potential for shortages as well as help oversee the manufacturing, but without a change in the economic model shortages are likely to continue.\u201d Hendricks said that she thinks the way drugs are developed and then maintained in the supply chain are among the factors driving the ongoing drug shortage crisis. \u201cThe problem is the medications that are transitioned from a blockbuster drug into generic status,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cIn the United States, when new drugs come in development, they\u2019re under patent. They\u2019re usually blockbuster drugs \u2014 big in the news, high chance of cure \u2014 but mixed in amongst them are drugs that have come off the patent system and are classified as generics. The price goes down, which is good for the patients, but that means the supply chain of these generic medications is so vulnerable. They\u2019re not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t create a way to get pharmaceutical companies to want to make both the phenomenal blockbuster drugs we have and the generics then this problem will be chronic, and we won\u2019t be able to dig our way out or see a clear solution.\u201d Several generic cancer drug manufacturers have discontinued products over time for economic reasons, according to a White House statement last year. A Senate Finance Committee white paper from this year notes generics make up anywhere between 66-84% of drug shortages. In the new NCCN report, the surveyed centers called for solutions and noted concerns about how the marketplace currently operates. For instance, when asked what policy solutions they would like to see enacted to address oncology drug shortages, 75% of centers reported \u201ceconomic incentives to encourage high quality manufacturing of generics\u201d and 64% reported \u201cbetter information systems\u201d to accredit or rate generics suppliers so hospitals can contract with those using high-quality practices. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a marketplace that was designed in an unsustainable way. Generic medication manufacturers currently operate on very narrow margins, which are continually being squeezed. This may result in de-prioritization of generic drug manufacturing in favor of newer, and more expensive agents that remain on patent. This results in a fragile supply chain for older, but still critical, generic medications that can and does break frequently and recovers slowly,\u201d Denlinger said about the ongoing shortage. \u201cIt has also led to fewer companies in the generic market and demands extreme efficiency from those companies still in the market. When a supply issue occurs, it is difficult to ramp up additional capacity in the system. We need to invest in economic incentives for the generic drug market \u2014 which is distinctly different from the brand name drug market \u2014 to encourage the stable manufacturing of quality generic drugs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also need better systems to communicate information about impending shortages and other supply concerns with health care systems and providers so that health care providers can prepare in advance for anticipated shortages before it becomes a crisis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/cancer-drug-shortages-continue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn", "text": "Do you yearn for long days and short nights? Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers. The summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It\u2019s the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It\u2019s also the first official day of summer. Our ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion.\u00a0Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge). Pagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe. The mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility \u2013 both the plant and human variety \u2013 in destinations worldwide. The science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia. Summer solstice science Is it summer solstice all over the world? No. It\u2019s only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world\u2019s population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there. When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on\u00a0June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that\u2019s 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool. Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador\u2019s capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight. But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn\u2019t get that dark.\u00a0 The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They\u2019ll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order. Why don\u2019t we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night\u00a0back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That\u2019s because the Earth is aligned on an\u00a0axis, an imaginary pole\u00a0going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts \u2013 at\u00a0an angle of 23.5 degrees. \u201cAs Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun\u2019s direct rays,\u201d explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that\u2019s the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox. Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it\u2019s not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US. \u201cOn average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\u201d says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward. \u201cTemperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night \u2013 so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\u201d says Ward. \u201cThe only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\u201d\u00a0because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August. The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe. How to celebrate summer solstice What does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically. The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at\u00a0summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times. The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise. What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day. In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night \u2013 a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires. In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations\u2019 International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_health_multiple-alarms-wake-up-sleep-wellness", "text": "Let\u2019s say you need to wake up by 7 a.m. to get to work on time. So you set your first smartphone alarm for 6:30 a.m., your second at 6:45 a.m. and your third at 6:55 a.m. to avoid the snooze button. And you throw in 7:05 a.m. just to be cautious. Does this sound familiar? If you are clogging your clock app with all those morning alarms, you\u2019re setting yourself up for a groggy morning, experts say. Hitting the snooze button for increments of nine minutes of sleep at a time does the same thing, said Dr. Brandon Peters, a neurologist and sleep medicine physician with Virginia Mason Franciscan Health in Seattle. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying in the moment to hit the snooze and delay getting out of bed and starting the day, but it does actually fragment and undermine that sleep quality,\u201d Peters said. For the last hours of sleep, people usually go in and out of the fourth and last stage of the sleep cycle, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This stage is particularly important for memory processing and creative thinking, he added. Having that stage of sleep fragmented could impact that brain function. He recommends setting one alarm, allowing for deep sleep to continue uninterrupted until you need to wake up in the morning. Here\u2019s how to train your mind and body to get out of bed after that first alarm goes off. Why do I have trouble getting up in the morning? Certain sleep disorders could be causing someone to have trouble waking up in the morning to one alarm, such as sleep inertia, which causes a difficult transition out of sleep, said Dr. Cathy Goldstein, a sleep medicine physician at the Michigan Medicine Sleep Disorders Centers. That may result in someone unknowingly turning off and snoozing alarms when first woken up. Most of the time, however,\u00a0someone who needs multiple alarms to wake up in the morning is sleep deprived, she said. First, try to get to any underlying issues that could be causing this problem, Goldstein noted. \u201cNumber one: are you actually getting the sleep you need? Not the amount of sleep you think you should get or that you want to get, but the amount of sleep that you actually need. And are you getting that on a nightly basis?\u201d asked Goldstein, who is also a clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Most adults need around\u00a0seven to nine hours\u00a0of sleep a night, but it does take time to figure out how much sleep you need. Goldstein recommends students use summer break to find how many hours of sleep they get naturally after a few weeks. For others, a long vacation could provide some helpful answers. Another reason someone may battle the alarm clock every morning is that they\u2019re naturally a night owl, but their work schedule calls for an early bird, said Dr. Alicia Roth, a clinician at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Sleep Disorders Center in Ohio. \u201cIn an ideal world, we would go to bed when we\u2019re sleepy, and we would wake up when we wake up. That is not the world we live in.\u201d But\u00a0there are ways to gradually shift your body clock and\u00a0make early mornings easier, she added. How to wake up to one alarm If you have to wake up at 7 a.m., and the alarm starts at 6 a.m., you are getting an hour of bad-quality sleep, instead of just sleeping through until 7 a.m, Roth said. While setting just one alarm is best, it might be hard to wake up to only one after using multiple alarms as your safety net, she added. Roth recommends testing out different alarm clocks, such as one that utilizes light or an alarm that makes you get out of bed to turn it off. Getting 15 to 30 minutes of sunlight in the morning can also help shift the internal body clock and is particularly important for those who are natural night owls, said Peters, author of the new book \u201cThe Sleep Apnea Hypothesis.\u201d It is also important to wake up and go to sleep around the same times each day, Goldstein said. \u201cIf you\u2019re somebody who sleeps really well from 3 a.m. to noon, and that\u2019s how you sleep on the weekends, but on Monday morning, you have to wake up at 6 a.m. to commute,\u201d that will be hard, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s earlier than your biology is prepared to wake up, and it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get up.\u201d Goldstein recommends shifting bedtime 30 minutes earlier every few days, or an hour earlier once a week for those looking to change their biological clocks. Avoiding harsh lights and limiting screen time up to four hours before bed can also help promote the body\u2019s natural melatonin production, she added. If someone finds they have woken up before their alarm goes off, Peters doesn\u2019t recommend checking the time, because doing so could make it difficult to fall back asleep if they start to worry about the sleep time they have left or the day ahead of them. Instead, Peters recommends trying to fall back asleep until it feels as though 15 to 20 minutes have passed. If you\u2019re still awake, then you can check the time and decide if you want to get up for the day, he added. \u201cIf it\u2019s close to your normal wake time, you might start your day a little early. If it\u2019s in the middle of the night, you might go off and do something quiet, like read, and then come back to bed when you\u2019re feeling more drowsy or sleepy.\u201d While some may be able to naturally wake up without using an alarm, it is not a realistic goal for everyone, particularly those who experience sleep inertia, or have naturally later biological clocks, Goldstein said. \u201cWe never want to sleep shame people,\u201d she said. \u201cIn medicine, and in public health we operate on averages a lot of the time, what\u2019s best for the most. But there are these biological differences, and we want to make sure that everybody is optimizing their sleep the best that they can.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/multiple-alarms-wake-up-sleep-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_health_child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness", "text": "Chicago native Jeffrey Odwazny\u00a0says he has been addicted to ultraprocessed food since he was a child. \u201cI was driven to eat and eat and eat, and while I would overeat healthy food, what really got me were the candies, the cakes, the pies, the ice cream,\u201d said the 54-year-old former warehouse supervisor. \u201cI really gravitated towards the sugary ultraprocessed foods \u2014 it was like a physical drive, I had to have it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents would find hefty bags full of candy wrappers hidden in my closet. I would steal things from stores as a kid and later as an adult.\u201d Some 12% of the nearly 73 million children and adolescents in the United States today struggle with a similar food addiction, according to research. To be diagnosed, children must meet Yale Food Addiction Scale criteria as stringent as any for alcohol use disorder or other addictions. \u201cKids are losing control and eating to the point where they feel physically ill,\u201d said Ashley Gearhardt, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who conducted the research and developed the Yale addiction scale. \u201cThey have intense cravings and may be sneaking, stealing or hiding ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cThey may stop going out with friends or doing other activities they used to enjoy in order to stay at home and eat, or they feel too sluggish from overeating to participate in other activities.\u201d Her research also shows about 14% of adults are clinically addicted to food, predominantly ultraprocessed foods with higher levels of sugar, salt, fat and additives. For comparison, 10.5% of Americans age 12 or older were diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in 2022, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. While many people addicted to food will say that their symptoms began to worsen significantly in adolescence, some recall a childhood focused on ultraprocessed food. \u201cBy age 2 or 3, children are likely eating more ultraprocessed foods in any given day than a fruit or vegetable, especially if they\u2019re poor and don\u2019t have enough money in their family to have enough quality food to eat,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are cheap and literally everywhere, so this is also a social justice issue.\u201d An addiction to ultraprocessed foods can highjack a young brain\u2019s reward circuitry, putting the primitive \u201creptilian brain,\u201d or amygdala, in charge \u2014 thus bypassing the prefrontal cortex where rational decision-making occurs, said Los Angeles registered dietitian nutritionist\u00a0David Wiss, who specializes in treating food addiction. \u201cUltraprocessed food addiction also teaches the young brain what to expect from food, like how much sugar reward one should get from eating a snack,\u201d said Wiss, which makes healthier options less appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s almost virtually impossible for a child, or even a 14- or 15-year-old, to be able to override all of this biology for very long,\u201d he added. The Institute of Food Technologists, an association of food professionals and technologists, does not agree with the research on ultraprocessed food addiction. \u201cWhile there is growing concern that some foods may be addictive for certain sub-populations including children, there is currently no scientific consensus to support that concern,\u201d said IFT\u2019s chief science and technology officer, Bryan Hitchcock, in an email. Food addiction is also not recognized by the World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Diseases and is a subject of debate in the scientific community, according to the International Food and Beverage Alliance, an industry association. \u201cSome believe markers of food addiction indicate eating disorders rather than substance use disorders,\u201d said IFBA\u2019s secretary-general, Rocco Renaldi, in an email. \u2018This disorder has almost killed me\u2019 Traumatic experiences in early childhood helped to trigger and nurture his addiction to ultraprocessed foods, Odwazny said. \u201cOne of my earliest memories is being in a high chair with ashtrays going over my head and plates smashing into the walls,\u201d Odwazny said. \u201cInstead of saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 or showing love, my family would feed me.\u201d At first, he said his parents thought his overeating was funny and began calling him names such as \u201cthe creeper\u201d when he would escape from his crib in the night to raid the refrigerator. As he grew, however, Odwazny\u2019s parents began to put locks on the refrigerator and kitchen cabinets. He was often ashamed of his eating. \u201cThere was a lot of name-calling. I was nicknamed everything from butterball to fat ass and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know the dads of some kids would call, \u2018Hey, buddy or pal,\u2019 but my dad used to call me \u2018the Orca.\u2019\u201d Despite his preoccupation with food, Odwazny was careful not to overeat in front of strangers as he grew up. Instead, when faced at a party with trigger foods such as chocolate-covered peanut butter cups, he would leave to buy that specific food. \u201cI would go to one store until I bought it all out, and then I would have to travel to another store,\u201d he said. \u201cI would buy two or three family-size bags, and I would eat so much in one sitting that I would be in a fog. Sugary food is a drug for me.\u201d The disorder took over his life. Before one meal of highly processed food was over, he was thinking about where to find the next. By 2016, his food addiction was at its worst. \u201cI would steal food or eat things that were burnt or spoiled,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve often gotten sick and had to go to the hospital. In fact, this disorder has almost killed me several times.\u201d The food-addicted brain Eating\u00a0higher amounts\u00a0of\u00a0ultraprocessed food raises the risk of obesity and the development of chronic conditions including\u00a0cancer,\u00a0cardiovascular disease,\u00a0obesity,\u00a0type 2 diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0depression. Still, many people find it hard to stop eating overly processed convenience foods such as hot dogs, French fries, crackers, frozen pizza, sausages, sodas, doughnuts, candy and ice cream. Ultraprocessed foods often contain flavors, different textures and \u201cadditives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Such foods are designed to maximize levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain, experts say. Added fats increase calories and improve the \u201cmouthfeel\u201d that makes food pleasing. Texture plays a role as well. \u201cFoods that melt in the mouth and are smooth or creamy, or alternatively, foods with crunch, can create an immediate neurochemical reward,\u201d Wiss said. \u201cA lot of food science goes into this and lot of research and development by manufacturers.\u201d Copious amounts of salt improve flavor. Sugar is so powerful that it\u2019s used as a replacement for pain medication for minor surgeries in babies: \u201cFor circumcisions or shots, they\u2019ll give babies a dose of sugar because it releases opioids in the brain and dulls pain,\u201d Gearhardt said. In fact, animal studies suggest sugar levels in ultraprocessed foods may be as addictive to the brain as alcohol or tobacco, she said. \u201cThese are really invasive studies, with wires in the brain,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cSugar creates the same amount of dopamine release that mimics what you see with nicotine and ethanol \u2014 around 150% to 200% above baseline. \u201cCocaine is much more addictive, between 1,000% and 2,000% above baseline,\u201d she said. \u201cBut animals still often choose a sweet taste over cocaine.\u201d The makers of ultraprocessed food strive to meet this dopamine \u201cbliss point\u201d via secret, proprietary mixtures of sugar, fat, salt and flavor additives that experts say trigger the basest of our animal instincts \u2014 the need for survival. \u201cIf there is a really high value meal in front of you, something rich and fatty that has a lot of calories in it, the brain is set up to say, \u2018Go ahead and eat it,\u2019 even if you are full because our ancestors had no guarantee they would find food the next day,\u201d said appetite specialist Alexandra DiFeliceantonio, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. The brain is also wired to remember and crave the pleasurable flavor of a food and its lifesaving calories in a process similar to Pavlovian, or classical conditioning, said DiFeliceantonio, who is also associate director of the Center for Health Behaviors Research at Virginia Tech. \u201cIt\u2019s what we all learned in Psychology 101, right?\u00a0 Light comes on; food drops; dog salivates,\u201d she said. Food processing plays a role How ultraprocessed foods are made may also contribute to addiction, experts say. Due to manufacturing methods that break down cell structures within foods \u2014 in essence predigesting the food \u2014 many ultraprocessed foods pass rapidly through the human gastrointestinal tract. That\u2019s confusing to a digestive system designed to slowly break down whole foods that have been torn and chewed, and to a brain that\u2019s used to getting a slow trickle of reward. With ultraprocessed foods, the brain receives surges of delight almost as quickly as the food is eaten, DiFeliceantonio said. \u201cThe majority of usable calories, boosted by intense flavors from whatever additives are in there, are quickly dumped into the upper intestine, sending signals to the brain all at once,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening really rapidly, and it\u2019s happening really strongly.\u201d The result, experts say, is a brain that fails to recognize ultraprocessed calories as filling. That, along with the rush of dopamine, may be a reason the brain has trouble saying, \u201cHalt!\u201d to ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThese foods appear to leave our brain in a state of perpetual vulnerability to rewarding substances and never feeling nourished or satiated,\u201d Gearhardt said. Nutrition is another issue. Ultraprocessed foods are often missing critical nutrients the body needs, which are especially important during childhood when the brain and body are growing. \u201cWhat is left after all the high heat and manipulation needed to create the ultraprocessed foods are the macronutrients \u2014 the calories, the carbohydrates, the fats and sometimes a little protein,\u201d Wiss said. \u201cMicronutrients are typically destroyed, which include the vitamins, minerals and antioxidant compounds that are known to confer health benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren who eat a lot of ultraprocessed foods could well be malnourished.\u201d According to the International Food and Beverage Alliance, however, there is no clear, objective, reliable or scientifically validated definition for \u201cultraprocessed\u201d food. \u201cIt is a catch-all, non-scientific concept that doesn\u2019t adequately account for nutritional differences in products:\u00a0the scientific evidence to date, and agreed upon by many authorities internationally, is that it is ultimately\u00a0the nutritional composition of foods, and of an individual\u2019s diet, that matters,\u201d said the IFBA\u2019s Renaldi. \u2018Our disease wants us to be separate\u2019 Overcoming his addiction to food \u2014 and later alcohol \u2014 has been a difficult journey for Odwazny. In an attempt to control his eating, he underwent two bariatric surgeries that typically have a high success rate. \u201cEach time I would pray, \u2018Please be it, please make this the answer.\u2019 But I would ultimately start binging on ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Odwazny said. \u201cThose surgeries were operating on the wrong part of my body, my stomach, but my eating disorder is right here,\u201d he said, tapping his head. Miserable and so overweight he could no longer do his job, Odwazny went on short-term disability and checked into rehab for a binge-eating disorder. That treatment plan didn\u2019t work, so he tried another, then another. Finally, he found a program that combined traditional treatment for binge-eating disorder with one for food addiction. Listening to other patients and staff speak about their own issues with food was life-changing, Odwazny said. \u201cOur disease wants us to be separate,\u201d he said. \u201cOur disease wants us to be not part of something else, because we want to isolate and think that we\u2019re the only ones. But when I heard the staff and some of the doctors talk about their own addictions, I knew the people that were treating me finally understood.\u201d A program that incorporates interventions for food addiction with treatment for restrictive eating disorders is relatively new and somewhat controversial, said food addiction specialist Dr. Kimberly Dennis, who is cofounder, CEO and chief medical officer at SunCloud Health in Chicago, where Odwazny\u00a0is in treatment. \u201cTreatment for a restrictive eating disorder, like binge eating or bulimia, focuses on helping the person overcome any aversion to food,\u201d said Dennis, who is also a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Medicine. \u201cAs soon as a person says, \u2018I can\u2019t safely eat that candy,\u201d the eating disorder therapist says, \u2018That\u2019s just the eating disorder talking, all foods are fine, and nothing is off-limits.\u2019\u201d Such treatment is a gold standard for someone who is avoiding food and malnourished, said Dennis, who is in recovery for food addiction and binge-eating disorder. \u201cSo a doughnut for breakfast, cupcake with lunch, and cookies as an afternoon snack would be a really good challenge for that person.\u201d However, if that person also has a food addiction, the approach may cause them to quit treatment, she said. \u201cTheir experience with eating that cupcake would be more like, \u2018I feel really triggered and worried that if I did this at home, I would be through the whole box of cupcakes by now.\u2019\u201d Today, Odwazny\u00a0is in recovery and is studying to become a certified alcohol and drug counselor in the Chicago area. He credits much of his success to his wife, Kimmy, whom he met during the Covid-19 pandemic while attending support groups at SunCloud. \u201cMy wife is also in the program, so we both know our food plans. My wife and I have our meals together \u2014 there\u2019s no sneaking, there\u2019s no hiding. I don\u2019t binge, but there are also certain foods that I don\u2019t eat,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I was in recovery, I never could imagine I would have such a beautiful wife that loves me, because no one loved me.

The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state\u2019s law where it conflicts with federal law. With Thursday\u2019s decision, the state would not be allowed to deny an emergency abortion to a pregnant person whose health is in danger, at least while the case makes its way through the courts.

The final opinion on Thursday was a sigh of relief, but doctors and legal experts acknowledged it\u2019s a temporary reprieve. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a separate opinion. \u201cIt is a delay.\u201d \u201cStorm clouds loom ahead,\u201d she wrote. Idaho\u2019s strict ban criminalizes performing most abortions and does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion if the patient\u2019s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself in most circumstances. The Biden administration argued that the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also known as EMTALA. EMTALA requires all US hospitals that have received Medicare money \u2014 essentially nearly all of them \u2014 to screen everyone who comes into their emergency rooms to determine whether the person has an emergency medical condition without regard for their ability to pay for those services. The 1986 law requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or to transfer them to another facility that has that capacity. The hospitals must also treat these patients\u00a0\u201cuntil the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.\u201d Pregnant people were singled out in the law\u00a0in 1989, after reports that some hospitals were refusing to care for uninsured women in labor. Congress expanded EMTALA to specify how it included people who were pregnant and having contractions. In 2021, the Biden administration released the\u00a0Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor\u2019s duty to provide stabilizing treatment \u201cpreempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,\u201d although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided. In July 2022, the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0guidance\u00a0clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision means a hospital must provide an abortion if it\u2019s medically indicated in an emergency situation, even in states that have abortion bans or restrictions that don\u2019t provide an exception to protect the health of the mother \u2013 at least as the case makes it way through the courts. But the move would only delay the issue, says Molly Meegan, chief legal officer for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a professional organization that represents the majority of practitioners in the United States. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem at all. In fact, pregnant patients are still trying to obtain care and unable to get it, and physicians are trying to provide care without clear parameters and with draconian criminal penalties hanging over their heads if they get the question wrong,\u201d she said. Dr. Stella Dantas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision shows exactly why clinicians need to be protected from outside interference in their relationship with patients, particularly when they need emergency care. Dantas said a law created by politicians that restricts a doctor\u2019s ability to provide care in an emergency is like having someone who has never flown a plane create restrictions on what a pilot could do during a flight emergency. \u201cIf that person couldn\u2019t do x, y, or z, when they were trained, in a split-second, if something flew into the engine, you wouldn\u2019t feel safe, and it wouldn\u2019t be the best for any of those people flying on a plane,\u201d Dantas said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cThis case has illustrated for many how critical abortion care is for all of us. For clinicians who care about their patients, for patients who may someday need an abortion and for the people that love them. \u201cDepriving patients of evidence-based care is unacceptable.\u201d Idaho\u2019s abortion law had an immediate effect on hospitals in the state.\u00a0On January 5, the Supreme Court lifted an injunction so Idaho no longer had EMTALA protections for pregnancy complications. St. Luke\u2019s, the state\u2019s largest provider of emergency services, said in April it had to send six pregnant patients from its emergency department out of state via air transport to protect their health. The year before, when the injunction was in effect, the hospital had to do this only once. Meegan said the law hasn\u2019t just hurt patient care. Physicians have told the group that they are leaving the state because they don\u2019t feel that they can practice medicine in a way that\u2019s consistent with their ethical obligations, training and judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s an untenable situation,\u201d Meegan said. Dr. Kara Cadwallader, a doctor who works in Idaho and is a member of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, said that even last week, her hospital had to send a pregnant person out of state for care even though they typically could have treated her. She said Wednesday she was \u201cvery excited\u201d about the ruling, even if it is a \u201csmall step.\u201d \u201cBeyond all the political reasons, it\u2019s incredibly important for pregnant patients here in Idaho, who now will be able to access emergency care appropriately,\u201d Cadwallader said. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said that with this decision, the Biden administration will continue to uphold the law and the right to emergency care. The administration also plans to make it easier for someone who is denied care to be able to file a complaint. \u201cWhen the Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it unleashed an unprecedented assault on reproductive rights, and every day we see the consequences,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cUnder President Biden\u2019s leadership, we have worked directly with providers, hospitals, and community leaders across the country to navigate the chaos that the decision introduced.\u201d Still, abortion regulations around the country are murky. Professor Elizabeth Sepper, of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that \u201cin every other state with an abortion ban, confusion will continue to reign.\u201d \u201cEven where states have \u2018health\u2019 exceptions in their laws, they typically are narrower than what EMTALA requires,\u201d Sepper wrote in an email. Forty-one states have abortion bans in effect with only limited exceptions, and 14 states have total bans. Around the country, doctors are confused about what they are allowed to do, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a privately owned health care company that provides abortion care. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t only about Idaho. This is really something that all eyes and ears are watching from multiple states across the country to try to figure out what we\u2019re able to do to provide basic health care, even if abortion has been restricted,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cAbortion saves lives. Abortion is absolutely necessary, oftentimes in emergency room settings to protect the health of the pregnant person. I think providers really understand that their hands have been tied post-Roe here, since the Dobbs decision, in numerous states and numerous parts of the country. Standard care for a woman who needs an emergency abortion does not vary from state to state, said Dr. Nisha Verma, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Emory University in Georgia. However, she said, the kind of care a patient will receive is totally dependent on where she lives. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case did not address the medical complexities this kind of care requires, and it will lead to confusion, fear and delays in what can be life-saving care, she said. \u201cWhat we had really hoped for is the Supreme Court to come down very firmly that doctors should be able to provide care for patients, including in emergency situations where abortion care can often be needed to stabilize patients. I think that working here in Georgia, we are constantly in a state of confusion trying to navigate incredibly confusing laws with exceptions that just don\u2019t make sense on the ground, that don\u2019t take into consideration all of the complexity that we deal with every day,\u201d Verma said. The ruling does not change the situation in Texas, reproductive legal advocates say. Texas sued the US government over EMTALA guidance, and in 2022 a federal judge allowed the EMTALA to be blocked. The federal government has asked the Supreme Court to review the law. That case could potentially go before the Supreme Court next term. \u201cWe should have never been in a place where states like Idaho, Texas, and others across the country could have state bans that seek to ignore federal law, forcing providers to forfeit their best medical judgment and second guess the care they can provide out of fear of criminalization and other penalties,\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood said at a news conference Thursday. She called Thursday\u2019s decision \u201csupreme gaslighting\u201d that will allow the court to come back to the decisions down the road, \u201cperhaps leaving it for when it\u2019s more politically convenient.\u201d \u201cOur bodies, lives and futures are still under deliberation,\u201d McGill said. Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, said she sees Idaho as a \u201cvery cruel case study\u201d of what happens when the law strips pregnant people of their right to emergency abortion care. She said Wednesday that she was disappointed in the ruling because the court had the opportunity to uphold a law that gives everyone access to care \u2014 but failed to do so. \u201cThe right to emergency care is perhaps one of the most basic rights there is,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cWe were fighting for scraps in this case, and even with that, a majority of the Supreme Court was not willing to recognize the humanity of pregnant people, that they would be entitled to this basic right to emergency care.\u201d CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Carma Hassan, Jamie Gumbrecht and John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/emtala-emergency-care-scotus/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_study-infant-mortality-texas-invs", "text": "A new study has drawn\u00a0a possible\u00a0link between rising infant mortality in Texas and the state\u2019s abortion restrictions, which, when they took effect in 2021, were the strictest in the nation. The\u00a0study, published today in JAMA Pediatrics \u2013 a publication\u00a0of\u00a0the Journal of the American Medical Association \u2013 cited an\u00a0investigative report\u00a0by CNN last year that revealed a sudden spike in infant deaths in the wake of the law\u2019s passage. \u201cA report from the media found an increase in infant deaths in Texas between 2021 and 2022, suggesting that Texas\u2019 abortion policy could be responsible,\u201d according to the study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Michigan State University. \u201cHowever, to our knowledge, no studies have conducted a systematic evaluation of infant mortality after the passage of Texas\u2019 (law).\u201d The authors say their study is the first attempt to do so, and their conclusions echo the findings of CNN\u2019s story. In\u00a0September\u00a02021, Texas banned nearly all abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy. When the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother. The study looks at the effects of the\u00a02021\u00a0law, called Senate Bill 8, which made no exceptions for rape or incest, forcing women to carry a pregnancy to term even under traumatic circumstances. It also made no exceptions for congenital anomalies, also known as birth defects. The only exception that allowed for an abortion to be obtained after six weeks was \u201cif a physician believes that a medical emergency exists,\u201d according to the language of the bill. The new JAMA Pediatrics study found that, between 2021 and 2022, infant deaths in Texas surged 12.9%, compared with a much smaller increase\u00a0in the rest of the US\u00a0of 1.8%. It also found a significant jump in the rate of infant mortality in Texas \u2013 or the number of deaths per thousand live births \u2013 relative to\u00a0the rest of the country, suggesting that the increase in the number of infant deaths was not solely the byproduct of a rise in births. In that same time period, infant mortality rates rose 8.3% in Texas, compared with an increase of 2.2% in the rest of the nation. The neonatal mortality rate \u2013 or the death rates of babies younger than 28 days \u2013 also increased in Texas by 5.8% but decreased in the rest of the US, the study found. \u201cThis study provides some of the first empirical evidence on the association of restrictive abortion policies with infant deaths by using population-based data and a rigorous causal inference technique,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAlthough replication and further analyses are needed to understand the mechanisms behind these findings, our results indicate that restrictive abortion policies may have important unintended consequences in terms of trauma to families and medical cost.\u201d The study \u2013 whose lead author, Dr. Alison Gemmill, is a demographer and perinatal epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University \u2013\u00a0was published alongside a critique\u00a0of the Texas law by three unaffiliated medical experts in an editorial. \u201cIn the coming years, as more people continue to be harmed by abortion bans across the country, we anticipate that more research will illuminate what Texans already know to be true: abortion bans harm everyone,\u201d wrote Ghazaleh Moayedi and Aketch Osamba, both of the  Pegasus Health Justice Center in Dallas, and Atsuko Koyama, of the University of Arizona, in the editorial. \u201cFuture scholarship should focus on best practices and implementation strategies for collective action against and resistance to the increasing trend of extremist ideologies influencing the practice of medicine,\u201d the authors wrote. The study also found that\u00a0the number of\u00a0congenital anomalies increased in Texas\u00a0from 2021 to 2022\u00a0but not\u00a0in\u00a0the rest of the US. The authors based their study on publicly available death-certificate data and looked at infant and neonatal deaths across the country from January 2018 to December 2022.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/study-infant-mortality-texas-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_fda-menthol-vapes-response", "text": "Four menthol vaping products were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday, the first non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products to get the agency\u2019s sign-off. The decision drew harsh criticism from pediatricians and anti-tobacco groups, which called it \u201ca blow to public health\u201d and warned of potential for \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d to children. The products, made by NJOY, an Altria company, are disposable e-cigarettes and nonrefillable pods that are used with the company\u2019s reusable vaping device. Nicotine levels in the products range from 2.4% to 6%. The company did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Friday\u2019s authorizations do \u201cnot mean these tobacco products are safe nor are they \u2018FDA approved,\u2019\u201d the agency said, but evidence submitted by the company showed that the products could be beneficial to adult smokers to help them make a switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes. The agency said there was sufficient evidence that the products would be \u201cappropriate for the protection of public health.\u201d \u201cBased upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,\u201d Dr. Matthew Farrelly, director of the Office of Science in the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in a news release. E-cigarettes were created to be a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes and were advertised by tobacco companies as a way to help people quit smoking, with flavored vapes being most popular. Massive advertising campaigns targeted children, helping lead to a vaping epidemic among young people \u2014 and eventually an FDA crackdown on flavors. Still, many flavored products remain available for purchase while the agency reviews marketing applications. An FDA official told the US Senate Judiciary Committee last week that regulation of e-cigarettes was a \u201ctop priority.\u201d However, the agency missed a September 2021 deadline to complete its review of e-cigarette makers\u2019 applications to sell their products; a federal court had ruled that the FDA was violating the Tobacco Control Act by allowing e-cigarette products that did not have agency pre-authorization to stay on the market. The FDA has been making its way through 27 million applications from companies seeking marketing authorization for e-cigarette products. Only 27 have gotten the FDA\u2019s green light, and until now, tobacco was the only flavor to do so. Anti-tobacco groups and doctors were quick to criticize Friday\u2019s decision as short-sighted and risky, especially for young people. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is hard to understand in light of the FDA\u2019s own repeated conclusions that flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products, appeal to kids and have fueled the youth e-cigarette epidemic. What has changed?\u201d Yolonda C. Richardson, president and CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in an email. \u201cThis decision is especially troubling given the FDA\u2019s failure to do its job and clear the market of unauthorized, illegal e-cigarette products. Rather than authorizing the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, the FDA should be stepping up its enforcement efforts against the illegal products that are addicting our kids.\u201d The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said in an email that the FDA decision had \u201cdealt a blow to public health,\u201d even as the Biden White House continues to hold up a long-awaited ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. \u201cOn the heels of the administration refusing to finalize rules to prohibit menthol in cigarettes and all flavors in cigars, this decision is a missed opportunity for the FDA to do the right thing,\u201d said Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \u201cBy authorizing the sale of menthol flavored e-cigarettes, including two disposable menthol e-cigarettes, the agency is continuing to allow Big Tobacco to addict yet another generation of youth to their products. Authorizing the sale of any flavored e-cigarette flies in the face of public health and fails to protect young people from a lifetime of addiction.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics said it is also \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d by the FDA decision. \u201cPrevious decisions by FDA to allow the marketing of flavored e-cigarettes had disastrous consequences for children that we are still working to overcome,\u201d President Dr. Benjamin Hoffman said. \u201cThese products will inevitably end up in the backpacks of middle schoolers. Once that happens, FDA will have an obligation to immediately reverse this deeply unwise decision.\u201d Erika Sward, assistant vice president of nationwide advocacy for the American Lung Association, said it \u201copposes any flavored products being on the market. But what is most troubling is the fact that these are so highly addictive with 5% and 6% nicotine. And that is a recipe for more addiction, particularly among kids.\u201d \u201cMenthol-flavored e-cigarettes are highly attractive to kids. And this is a one-two combination of a flavor plus such high levels of nicotine, and that\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\u201d Sward said. About 10% of high school-age adolescents and nearly 5% of middle school students use e-cigarettes,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, according to the FDA. But when they do vape, teens and young adults are much more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. According to the to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey, more than 23% of high school e-cigarette users nationwide use menthol-flavored products. The FDA said it has put \u201cstringent marketing restrictions\u201d on the newly authorized products in an effort to prevent youth access and exposure. The agency also said it will closely monitor how the products are marketed, and if the company fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the agency may suspend or withdraw authorization. \u201cAll tobacco products are harmful and potentially addictive,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cThose who do not use tobacco products shouldn\u2019t start.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/fda-menthol-vapes-response/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness", "text": "There\u2019s a crack of light shining through the dark clouds of America\u2019s battle with poor nutrition and subsequent health issues, according to a new study that analyzed two decades of nutritional data. \u201cThere is good news. Americans are starting to hear the message about nutrition, and some companies and restaurants are starting to make healthier products. It\u2019s a little bit of an improvement,\u201d said senior study author and cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston. However, he added, the majority of the improvement occurred between 1999 and 2010, with no advances in nutrition after that. \u201cWe have stalled as a nation \u2014 and that does not bode well for our health,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIf I was grading America on its diet, I\u2019d give it a D\u2014just up from an F.\u201d An upward trend, but more is needed The number of adults in the United States who ate a poor diet decreased from about 49% to just over 37% between 1999 and 2020 \u2014 a drop of 11.4%, while those who ate somewhat better nutritionally rose by 10.5%, the study found. A poor diet was defined as one with too many refined grains, processed meat and sugary beverages, including fruit juice, as well as ultraprocessed foods full of added sugar, salt and fat.\u00a0Healthy choices such as fruits and vegetables are extremely low in this eating style. \u201cIntake of fruits and vegetables didn\u2019t increase at all over this 20-year period, which is pretty striking,\u201d Mozaffarian said. An ideal diet included at least the daily recommended servings of fruits and vegetables, as well as more beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Dietary guidelines such as those from the American Heart Association suggest eating 4 to 5 cups a day of canned, fresh or frozen fruits and the same amount for vegetables. The nutritionally ideal diet also contained few sugary beverages, processed meats, refined grains and ultraprocessed food, which is often high in added sugars, fat and salt, the study said. Unfortunately, the number of people who ate an ideal diet \u2013\u2014 which included those 9 cups of fruits and vegetables \u2014 rose less than 1%, the study found. \u201cPeople often ask me, \u2018Well, if the diet\u2019s slowly improving, why is obesity and diabetes still going up?\u2019 It\u2019s still going up because only 1.58% of Americans have an ideal diet. We still have a long way to go,\u201d Mozaffarian said. More than a million Americans die each year from diet-related diseases such as obesity, cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes,\u00a0according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the United States an\u00a0estimated $1.1 trillion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity annually. \u201cI think it is correct to emphasize that diet quality remains dismal in the US. There is no secret why Americans are experiencing epidemics of obesity and diabetes and declining life expectancy,\u201d said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, in an email. He was not involved in the study. Food insecurity is a major issue The study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed dietary information on nearly 52,000 US adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. Nutritional advances were highest among women, younger adults, Hispanic adults, and people with more education and higher incomes who had access to private health care insurance. Fewer gains were seen in men, Black or older adults and people with less income, lower educational levels, non-private health insurance, and food insecurity issues. \u201cDisparities in the population by education and income and race and ethnicity are the same or sometimes getting worse,\u201d Mozaffarian said. The study found that people with lower income saw a 5% improvement in nutritional quality, while those with higher incomes improved their nutritional score by 16%. \u201cWe do need to avoid just blaming the victims of the dysfunctional US food system for the terrible diets documented in the survey,\u201d Willett said. \u201cWe fail to educate students about nutrition in our schools and feed them unhealthy diets. \u201cOur health care system is missing in action almost completely, we allow advertising to seduce children into junk foods and beverages that kill them prematurely, and we indirectly subsidize unhealthy foods in many ways that make healthier options relatively more expensive and less available to low-income Americans,\u201d he said. How to improve your nutrition There are easy steps you can take to boost the nutritional quality of your diet, experts say. Cook at home as often as possible: \u201cMy top suggestion is to shop at the grocery store as much as you can, rather than getting your food at a coffee shop, sandwich shop or quick-serve restaurant,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Even eating at a full-service restaurant should be limited, he added. Prior research by Mozaffarian and his team found about 80% of all food consumed by Americans from restaurants was of poor diet quality. \u201cShockingly, even when we compared fast food versus sit-down restaurants, there wasn\u2019t a dramatic difference in quality,\u201d he said. Instead, try to choose minimally-processed foods to cook at home and avoid the ready-to-heat-and-eat convenience foods so prevalent at the grocery store. Bring your lunch and snacks to work. Don\u2019t drink your sugar. Americans are beginning to get the idea that sugary sodas are unhealthy, but they have not yet made the connection that energy, sports and caffeinated drinks can be equally sugar laden, Mozaffarian said. \u201cEnergy drinks, pre-sweetened iced teas, and specialty coffee drinks can have more sugar than soda,\u201d he said. \u201cI see people walking out of the coffee shop with drinks with whipped cream on top. Don\u2019t drink your sugar.\u201d However, once sugary beverages are removed from the equation, only \u201c6% of calories in the country come from added sugar in foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIn contrast, about 35% of calories in the country come from refined grains and starches.\u201d Limit refined grains.\u00a0Overall, the biggest contributor to the poor quality diet of Americans is refined grains, at 5.2 servings per day \u2014 \u201calmost two servings a meal of refined grains such as refined bread, refined rice, crackers, chips, and other ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Whole grains still contain the bran and germ, which is a nutritional powerhouse full of healthy fats, antioxidants, minerals and E and B vitamins. Whole grains take longer to digest, don\u2019t raise blood sugar as quickly as refined grains and contain more fiber, which can reduce the risk of chronic disease, promote weight loss, and improve digestion. \u201cSome examples of whole grains include barley, bulgur, farro, millet, quinoa, black rice, brown rice, red rice, wild rice, oatmeal and popcorn,\u201d according to My Plate, the US Department of Agriculture website. Refined grains such as white flour, corn grits, white bread and white rice have been milled, removing the bran and germ, to give them a finer texture and longer shelf life. Milling also removes nutrients like dietary fiber, iron and vitamins.\u00a0Refined grains are found in nearly all ultraprocessed foods, including breakfast cereals, desserts, pastries, bread and crackers. Replace refined grains. Instead, nourish your gut microbiome with fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds and minimally-processed whole grains,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi can also help the microbiome, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}

At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_ketamine-pill-depression-fewer-side-effects", "text": "A new ketamine pill may help hard-to-treat depression with fewer side effects than other forms of the treatment, early research suggests. Technically, no form of ketamine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat any psychiatric disorder, including depression. A derivative of ketamine, called esketamine, was approved in 2019 to treat depression. It\u2019s a nasal spray called Spravato. There\u2019s also FDA-approved injected ketamine, brand-named Ketalar, which can be prescribed off-label. Both can be a fast-acting lifeline for people living with depression that hasn\u2019t been relieved by other types of treatments.\u00a0Getting the drug, or a derivative of it, through a vein or as a squirt up the nose requires close medical supervision in a clinic, however, making these options hard for some people to access or even to do. \u201cIt\u2019s very logistically involved. You have to come in and be observed for a couple hours,\u201d said Dr. Brian Barnett, clinical director of the Psychiatric Treatment Resistance Program at the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the study.\u00a0\u201cThe field has really been looking for a way to take advantage of ketamine for depression but let patients take this at home in the form of a pill.\u201d To confuse matters even further, compounded ketamine lozenges and pills are available through online pharmacies and can be obtained with a prescription, but the FDA warned patients and providers about using compounded ketamine last fall because these products have not been evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Some doctors who prescribe ketamine for depression say they are wary of the oral forms because it\u2019s not clear how much of the drug actually makes it to a patient\u2019s bloodstream. Patients need to be monitored closely because ketamine, which was originally used to dull pain in surgery, can cause feelings of disconnection or disassociation from their bodies and the world around them. It also distorts thinking and decision-making.\u00a0Some find this hallucinogenic experience beneficial and even pleasant, but others have described it as terrifying.\u00a0These forms of the drug can also cause a person\u2019s blood pressure to go up, which may make them off-limits for those with heart conditions. The clinic setting limits who can get the treatment as well, Barnett said.\u00a0Not all areas have clinics that can do this kind of intensive monitoring, and patients aren\u2019t allowed to drive until the morning after an infusion, so treatments may be out-of-reach if they can\u2019t get a ride or afford a hotel stay. From a public health standpoint, Barnett said, you can serve more people with a pill than with clinic-based treatments.\u00a0A 2021 study estimated that in any given year, 2.8 million American adults have treatment-resistant depression. \u201cIt would be very beneficial for many people to have this available as a medication that they could take at home. But obviously, we want a medication like that to have very minimal dissociative side effects,\u201d Barnett said. That\u2019s where slow-release ketamine pills come in. Studying drug withdrawal to see if it works For the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in New Zealand enrolled 231 adults who had been diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, meaning they had tried at least two different antidepressants to lift their mood without success. The study participants scored an average of 30 points on a clinical scale that measures depressive symptoms, a score that\u2019s considered moderate depression, and on average, they\u2019d tried nearly five different treatments without relief. For the first five days of the study, all of the participants took a daily dose of 120 milligrams of ketamine in the form of a slow-release pill.\u00a0On day eight, the researchers assessed who had responded to the drug.\u00a0Slightly more than half the group \u2013 132 \u2013 had remission of their symptoms, meaning they scored under 10 on the clinical scale. Overall, 168 had some degree of benefit and were considered responders to the pill. People who had not responded to the drug were not eligible to continue with the research. Those 168 adults were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups;\u00a037 people got a  placebo, or dummy pill, while roughly equal-size groups took one of four daily doses of ketamine that ranged from 30 milligrams to 180 milligrams. By 14 weeks, everyone taking ketamine still continued to see some relief from their depression, but for most groups, the differences compared with placebo were not statistically significant, meaning they could have been observed due to chance alone. Researchers did see what\u2019s called a dose response, however, meaning the higher the dose of the drug, the more relief participants had in their depressive symptoms, which is usually a sign that the drug is having a real effect. People who took the highest dose, 180 milligrams a day, did see a statistically significant benefit, a reduction in their depression score of about six points compared with the placebo group. \u201cThe results here, they look encouraging,\u201d Barnett said, noting that a two-point drop in the clinical rating scale the researchers used is considered meaningful to patients. A six-point drop is \u201csimilar to what we\u2019ve seen in recent clinical trials of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression,\u201d Barnett said, referring to a chemical in certain mushrooms that\u2019s currently being studied. During the first five days of the study, when everyone was taking the drug, the most common side effects reported were dizziness, headache, dissociation, fatigue, feeling abnormal and nausea. About 11% of people taking the 120 milligram ketamine pill at the beginning of the study said they experienced dissociation or feeling disconnected.\u00a0But this appeared to be much milder than the dissociation reported by people who get ketamine infusions.\u00a0On a commonly used rating scale, people taking the ketamine pill ranked below a score of 3 in the first phase of the study, but another study found that people getting IV ketamine rated their dissociation around a 7. Effects on blood pressure were also minimal with the slow-release pill. Weighing study biases Experts agree that the study was an important first step. \u201cThe report is important since it is the first large placebo-controlled study to be published attempting to explore the benefits of oral ketamine,\u201d Dr. Gerard Sanacora, director of the Yale Depression Research Program, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. But Sanacora said the design of the study, which is known as a randomized withdrawal trial, probably biased the results in favor of making the drug look more effective than it might be in the real world, something the study authors acknowledge, too. By studying only people who responded to the drug, the study authors noted that they hoped to avoid the high failure rates of many antidepressants tested in a general population, where as many as 50% of trials fail to show an effect compared with a placebo. Sanacora said it\u2019s very likely that the study participants could have known they were getting ketamine, rather than the placebo, and therefore expected it to work. \u201cIt is usually easier to guess correctly once you have been exposed to the active treatment and then receive the inactive treatment,\u201d he wrote. Therefore, he said, it would be really important for the pills to be retested in a larger population to get an idea of how well they might work in the real world. He noted that there\u2019s a \u201ctremendous tension\u201d between wanting the important benefits of a drug like ketamine to be more available to people and making sure the treatment can be given safely and responsibly. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction, but we clearly need more high-quality data before we can say much more about the overall efficacy and safety of the new form of treatment and especially the safety of doing this at home,\u201d Sanacora wrote. Challenges of oral dosing Perhaps unsurprisingly, the study, which led to withdrawal and depression relapse for many, had a high drop-out rate.\u00a0Of the 168 people who initially saw benefit from the pills, 100 didn\u2019t complete the trial.\u00a0Ninety-four left because they stopped being helped by their treatment.\u00a0One person left because of an adverse event. Four others left for unspecified reasons.\u00a0A 65-year-old man died as a result of suicide. The researchers say the study\u2019s independent review committee judged that the death was a result of the patient\u2019s depression rather than the treatment. \u201cAttempted and completed suicide is a sad reality of treatment trials in patients with depression,\u201d noted study author Dr. Paul Glue, a professor in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, in an email. Both Barnett and Sanacora agreed that it was difficult to know whether the drug played any role in a study this size and said that larger studies were needed to tease out any serious safety signals. Among the participants, women and younger adults tended to have stronger treatment effects than men and older adults. That may have something to do with the way the pills are metabolized, Barnett said. \u201cOne of the challenges with oral ketamine, one of the reasons that we haven\u2019t used as much for depression as IV, is that it can be sort of unpredictable, and how much is getting into the bloodstream?\u201d he said. However, he thought the slow-release form of the pill probably helped with maintaining a steadier dose.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/ketamine-pill-depression-fewer-side-effects/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_health_exercise-mental-health-happiness-wellness", "text": "Think back to when you were a kid and movement was instinctive \u2014 and often infused with pure joy. Maybe it was racing your sister and dad to the front door. Or jumping on the bed with friends during a sleepover. Or playing a team sport. Or riding your bike around the park. For many, the link between movement and joy was severed and forgotten somewhere along the road to adulthood, displaced by the realities and responsibilities of daily life. Movement might have been transformed into something more obligatory \u2014 we must do it to optimize our health or get in shape. Or it might have become too time-consuming. For some, it might even have become painful due to injury, disease or the passage of time. But we abandon movement at our own peril and at risk of our well-being. Studies have found that movement \u2014 and its more challenging and intentional cousin, exercise \u2014 is not only beneficial for physical health but is also closely associated with mental status and mood. \u201cI always say that exercise is like an intravenous dose of hope,\u201d psychologist Kelly McGonigal told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently. \u201cAnd it\u2019s any form of movement that you\u2019re willing to do with any part of your body that you can still move.\u201d McGonigal is the author of \u201cThe Joy of Movement: How Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage.\u201d A group fitness instructor and a lecturer at Stanford University, she has used movement and exercise throughout her life to manage her own anxiety and depression. McGonigal\u00a0said exercise allows for the creation and release of \u201chope\u201d molecules, technically called myokines, during muscle contractions \u2014 for example, when we work out or even just move around. Some of these myokines can have antidepressant effects. \u201cOur muscles do more than just move our bones around or stabilize our skeleton,\u201d she said. \u201cOur muscles are almost like endocrine organs. They manufacture these molecules that they can release into the bloodstream that then travel around and affect all of our organs.\u00a0And some of them can cross the blood-brain barrier and affect your brain, including your mood and your mental health and your brain health.\u201d Exercise enables you to see your body as an ally, according to McGonigal. \u201cI think this is one of the coolest bits of the science of movement and exercise, particularly because of how it allows us to feel like our body is our friend,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our partner, not something we\u2019re trying to fix or control through movement.\u201d McGonigal said many other brain chemicals get released during exercise that can affect someone\u2019s state of mind, resulting in, for example, a runner\u2019s high, a flow state and even euphoria. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a lot of different kind of brain states you could experience in movement; it\u2019s not one \u2018thing,\u2019\u201d she said. You can listen to the full discussion here. What can you do to tap into joy during exercise and movement? McGonigal has these five tips. Take your workout on the road Head out into nature. \u201cWe know that mindful forms of movement, as well as moving outdoors in nature, tends to put the brain in a state of this heightened awareness to the present moment that feels like vitality and connection to life,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cPeople often feel a relief from inner chatter and stress and worrying. \u2026 It\u2019s changing which systems of the brain are most active and putting you in a state that\u2019s like meditation.\u201d Pump up the volume Queue up your favorite playlist and get moving. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a workout where you\u2019re listening to music you love that\u2019s high energy, you\u2019re moving to the beat, and you\u2019re doing things that really get your heart rate up \u2026 it often is more like euphoria,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel incredible, and you\u2019ve got those endorphins, and that brain chemistry also really helps you feel connected to other people.\u201d Join the group Being social helps you exercise. \u201cMake movement social. We know that people form friendships and communities of support through movement, whether it\u2019s strength training or running,\u201d McGonigal said. These days, who couldn\u2019t use another friend or source of support? Exercise also helps you be more social. \u201cPeople who exercise, they report being less lonely, they report having better relationships with others and \u2014 for reasons that range from the biochemical and how the brain chemistry of exercise primes you to be more social \u2014 to be able to connect with others better,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIf you are socially anxious and you exercise, by the end of that workout, you\u2019re going to be almost like a more extroverted version of yourself.\u201d Get back to basics Find something you really like doing. \u201cThink about positive experiences you\u2019ve had with movement in your life,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cMaybe go back to something that you miss or find a new way to do it.\u201d Change your mindset to one of gratitude While you are moving, find ways to appreciate your body for being able to move, as opposed to monitoring it. Adopt a \u201cmindset switch of, \u2018Wow, body \u2014 that was incredible!\u2019 Or \u2018Thank you, body, for having the energy to let me do this,\u2019\u201d McGonigal said. We hope these five tips help you tap into joy through movement. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week on the Chasing Life podcast when Dr. Gabor Mat\u00e9 speaks about how past trauma affects present-day health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/health/exercise-mental-health-happiness-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "health"}}
