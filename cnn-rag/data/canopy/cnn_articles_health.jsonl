The celebration happened in summer 2022, according to the account in the latest edition of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. An extended family \u2013 unnamed in the report \u2013 came from across the country for a reunion in South Dakota. One family member, a hunter, brought some black bear meat that he had harvested in northern Saskatchewan in May 2022. The hunter said that the hunting outfitter had recommended freezing the meat to kill any potential parasites. The meat had been frozen for 45 days before it was thawed, and the family grilled it with some vegetables and served it as kebabs. Freezing can kill some parasites commonly found in black bears, but according to the World Organisation for Animal Health, some species of parasites are freeze-tolerant. Bears and other wildlife including wild boar, wolves and squirrels can often get sick with trichinellosis, a serious disease caused by parasitic roundworms of the genus Trichinella, but they will often appear perfectly healthy. When butchering the meat, it would be difficult to tell if it was contaminated because there are few signs of the parasite. Many wildlife experts tell bear hunters to consider all bear meat infected, and the CDC recommends cooking the meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill the parasites. Smoking, salting, drying and microwaving do not always kill them, experts say. The meat at the family reunion was initially served rare, but that was not the chef\u2019s intention, the CDC said. Rather, it was \u201cdifficult for the family members to visually ascertain the level of doneness\u201d because the meat was dark in color. After some of the family noticed that it was undercooked, they put it back on the grill before it was served again. It wasn\u2019t until after people had gone home that some started to get sick. The first illness was in a 29-year-old man who had to be hospitalized twice over a\u00a0three-week period. He reported symptoms of severe muscle pain and a fever, and his eyes became swollen. Blood tests showed that he had eosinophilia, a condition involving too many eosinophils in the body, a signal to doctors that someone could have allergies, cancer or parasites. It wasn\u2019t until his second trip to the hospital that doctors learned the man had eaten bear meat and suspected that he may have trichinellosis. Tests soon confirmed that that was the case, and tests were recommended for the other family members. Trichinellosis can be a light or severe infection, and the symptoms can depend on where the larvae migrate to in the body. Light infections may not have noticeable symptoms, according to the CDC. If the parasite moves into the gastrointestinal tract, it can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea or vomiting. In muscle, it can cause a fever, rashes, conjunctivitis and facial puffiness. Occasionally, there may be life-threatening symptoms including heart problems, trouble with the central nervous symptom and breathing issues. Among the eight family members whom investigators interviewed, six had symptoms that were consistent with trichinellosis. Four had eaten bear meat and vegetables, but the other two had eaten only vegetables cooked with the meat. Three family members had to be hospitalized. The hospitalized people got trichinellosis-directed treatment with albendazole, an antiparasitic drug. Those who were not hospitalized received only supportive care since their symptoms had resolved before it was determined they had the infection. Everyone has since recovered. In the course of the investigation, CDC labs received samples of the frozen bear meat and found Trichinella larvae, and the hunter was advised to discard any remaining meat. The CDC also informed the Public Health Agency of Canada about the outbreak since the bear had come from that country. The CDC says it\u2019s important that game meat \u2013 particularly wild game harvested in northern latitudes \u2013 be cooked thoroughly. Since meat that is contaminated with Trichinella can cross-contaminate other foods, raw meat should be stored and prepared separately from other foods.\u00a0The CDC also recommends that government agencies and private groups that organize or oversee hunting should educate hunters about these risks and how to protect themselves.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/black-bear-kabobs-trichinellosis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_crows-can-count-study-scn", "text": "Perhaps \u201cbirdbrained\u201d isn\u2019t such an insult after all \u2013\u2013 crows, the ubiquitous urban bird, can vocally count up to four, the latest research has found. Not only can the inquisitive creatures count, but they can match the number of calls they make when shown a numeral, according to a new study, led by a team of researchers with the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2019s animal physiology lab in Germany. The way the birds recognize and react to numbers is similar to a process we humans use, both to learn to count as toddlers and quickly recognize how many objects we\u2019re looking at. The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, deepen our growing understanding of crow intelligence. \u201cHumans do not have a monopoly on skills such as numerical thinking, abstraction, tool manufacture, and planning ahead,\u201d said animal cognition expert Heather Williams via email. \u201cNo one should be surprised that crows are \u2018smart.\u2019\u201d Williams, a professor of biology at Williams College in Massachusetts, was not involved in the study. In the animal kingdom, counting isn\u2019t limited to crows. Chimpanzees have been taught to count in numerical order and understand the value of numerals, much like young children. In attempting to woo mates, some male frogs count the number of calls from competing males to match or even one-up that number when it\u2019s their turn to croak at a female. Scientists have even theorized that ants retrace their paths back to their colonies by counting their steps, though the method isn\u2019t always accurate. What this latest study showed is that crows, like young humans, can learn to associate numerals with values \u2013\u2013 and count out loud accordingly. Can crows count much like toddlers do? The research was inspired by toddlers learning to count, said lead study author Diana Liao, a neurobiologist and senior researcher at the T\u00fcbingen lab. Toddlers use the words of numbers to tally the number of objects in front of them: If they see three toys in front of them, their counting could sound like \u201cone, two, three\u201d or \u201cone, one, one.\u201d Maybe crows could do the same, Liao thought. She was inspired, too, by a June 2005 study on chickadees tailoring their alarm calls to a predator\u2019s size. The larger a predator\u2019s wingspan or body length, the fewer \u201cdee\u201d sounds the chickadees used in their alarm call, the study found. The opposite was true for smaller predators \u2013\u2013 the songbirds would use more \u201cdee\u201d sounds if they encountered a smaller bird, which could be greater threats to chickadees since they are more agile, Liao said. The authors of the chickadee study couldn\u2019t confirm whether the small songbirds had control over the number of sounds they made or if the number of sounds were an involuntary response. But the possibility piqued Liao\u2019s curiosity \u2013\u2013 could crows, whose intelligence has been well-documented over decades of research, show control over their ability to produce a certain number of sounds, effectively \u201ccounting\u201d like toddlers do? The crows planned their number of caws Liao and her colleagues trained three carrion crows, a European species closely related to the American crow, over more than 160 sessions. During the trainings, the birds had to learn associations between a series of visual and auditory cues from 1 to 4 and produce the corresponding number of caws. In the example researchers provided, a visual cue might look like a bright blue numeral, and its corresponding audio could be the half-second song of a drumroll. The crows were expected to perform the same number of caws as the number represented by the cue \u2013\u2013 three caws for the cue with the numeral 3 \u2013\u2013 within 10 seconds of seeing and hearing the cue. When the birds had stopped counting and cawing, they would peck at an \u201center\u201d key on the touchscreen that presented their cues to confirm that they were done. If the birds had counted correctly, they\u2019d receive a treat. It appeared that as the cues continued, the crows took longer to react to each cue. Their reaction times grew as \u201cmore vocalizations were impending,\u201d Liao wrote, suggesting that the crows planned the number of caws they were going to make before they opened their beaks. The researchers could even tell how many calls the birds planned to make by the way their first call sounded \u2013\u2013 subtle acoustic differences that showed that the crows knew how many numbers they were looking at and had synthesized the information. \u201cThey understand abstract numbers \u2026 and then plan ahead as they match their behavior to match that number,\u201d Williams said. Even the mistakes the crows made were somewhat advanced: If the crows had cawed one too many times, stuttered over the same number or submitted their responses with their beak prematurely, Liao and her researchers could detect from the sound of the first call where they went wrong. These are the \u201csame kinds of errors humans make,\u201d Williams said. We\u2019re still learning how smart crows are Birds and many other animals were previously thought to make only on-the-spot decisions based on stimuli in their immediate environments, a theory popularized by the 20th century animal behaviorist B.F. Skinner. But the latest research by Liao and her colleagues provides more evidence about crows\u2019 ability to synthesize numbers to produce a sound and suggests that the skill is within their control. The study team\u2019s findings are highly specific but still significant \u2013\u2013 they challenge the once common belief that all animals are merely stimulus-response machines, said Kevin McGowan, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, who has spent more than two decades studying wild crows in their habitats. McGowan wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study, McGowan told CNN, demonstrated that \u201ccrows aren\u2019t just simple nonthinking machines out there reacting to their environment \u2013\u2013 they\u2019re actually thinking ahead and have the ability to communicate in a structured, preplanned way. It\u2019s sort of a necessary precursor for having a language.\u201d Crow intelligence has been studied for decades. Scientists have investigated New Caledonian crows creating their own compound tools to access food. The birds appear to establish rules, according to a November 2013 study coauthored by the University of T\u00fcbingen lab\u2019s lead researcher, Andreas Nieder. Crow language has confounded scientists for decades, too, with its widely varying tones and expressions, McGowan said. The study by Liao and her colleagues isn\u2019t even the first to consider whether crows can count. That research began with Nicholas Thompson in 1968, animal cognition expert Irene Pepperberg noted. A research professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Pepperberg is best known for her work with an African grey parrot named Alex. Thompson hypothesized that crows could count based on their caws, the duration and number of which the birds appeared to control in a given burst of sound. The crows\u2019 counting abilities \u201cseem to exceed the demands which survival makes for such abilities,\u201d he wrote. Another University of T\u00fcbingen study on crows\u2019 counting abilities from September 2015 trained the birds to recognize groupings of dots and recorded the activity of neurons in the part of the crows\u2019 brains that receives and makes sense of visual stimuli. The researchers found that the crows\u2019 neurons \u201cignore the dots\u2019 size, shape and arrangement and only extract their number,\u201d the university said in a statement at the time. \u201cSo, crows\u2019 brains can represent different quantities, and crows can quickly learn to match Arabic numerals to those quantities \u2013\u2013 something humans usually explicitly teach their children,\u201d Williams said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/crows-can-count-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn", "text": "Maybe you spotted one crawling up your leg after a hike through tall grass or felt one on your dog\u2019s back as you ran your hand through its fur. If you\u2019re unlucky, maybe you found one already burrowing into your skin, engorged with your blood. Ticks are parasitic bloodsuckers, capable of spreading deadly disease, and they\u2019re becoming increasingly common. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. Ticks 101 Ticks are arachnids, close cousins of mites and more distant cousins of spiders. There are\u00a0more than 800 species of ticks found around the world, and 84 that have been documented in the United States. However, only a handful in the US bite and transmit diseases to humans. The most common ones are blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks, but they feed on lots of animals besides deer), lone star ticks, American dog ticks and brown dog ticks. After a tick egg hatches, it goes through three life stages: larva, nymph and adult. Both male and female ticks feed on blood by inserting their barbed, straw-like mouthparts into the skin of their host (unlike mosquitoes, which only bite if they\u2019re females preparing to lay eggs). However, only female ticks drink to the point that they become engorged. \u201cWhen you see a super big and engorged female, that means she\u2019s going to be laying eggs and starting that life cycle process over again,\u201d said Kait Chapman, an extension educator and urban entomologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These arachnids change dramatically in size and appearance based on how old they are and how much blood they\u2019ve drunk. \u201cThe nymph blacklegged tick, if you put these unfed ones on a poppy seed bagel, they blend in quite nicely,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island and director of that school\u2019s Center for Vector-Borne Disease and its TickEncounter Resource Center. Meanwhile, an engorged adult female of the same species can swell to the size of a pea. Tick bites and diseases While there are some months when different species and life stages are more active, it\u2019s possible to get bitten by a tick any time of year. If you find a tick attached to you (or your pet), you should remove it carefully. \u201cThe recommendation is that you use a pair of tweezers, get the tick by its head as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to twist, because we could leave part of that mouthpart embedded in the skin. And we don\u2019t want to grab the body because if you squeeze the body the tick could regurgitate more, which means that you\u2019re increasing your chance of getting tick-borne illness.\u201d Your impulse might be to squash the freshly removed tick, but it\u2019s better if you drown it with hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol and keep it to show to an expert or at least take a photo. That way, you can identify what kind of tick it is and how long it\u2019s been feeding; the University of Rhode Island\u2019s\u00a0TickEncounter website has tools\u00a0based on coloration, size and geographic location. It\u2019s important to identify the tick because certain species carry different diseases. They pick up bacteria, viruses and other microbes from the blood of infected hosts, and when they bite a new victim, they can pass those pathogens along. Blacklegged tick larvae and nymphs, for instance, often feed on white-footed mice,\u00a0which can carry a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. When a tick that\u2019s fed on one of these infected mice then feeds on a human, it can pass along that bacterium, which causes Lyme disease. Lone star ticks, on the other hand, don\u2019t feed on white-footed mice and consequently aren\u2019t carriers of Lyme. (They do carry other disease-causing microbes, though, and their bites can introduce a sugar molecule into the bloodstream that\u00a0makes people allergic to red meat.) In\u00a0a September 2023 study, researchers identified a protein that appears to play a big part in how some ticks \u2014 including the deer tick and the Western blacklegged tick \u2014 get infected by the harmful bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum before spreading it to human hosts and causing anaplasmosis, which is different from Lyme disease. Anaplasmosis can cause severe headaches, fever and chills, vomiting, and fatigue,\u00a0according to Cedars-Sinai. Understanding this protein may give scientists a better sense of how to stop the spread of the disease through ticks, the study said. But there is still a lot of research ahead before they get there. Preventing tick bites The diseases carried by ticks can be debilitating or even life-threatening, and the risk of infection increases the longer a tick has been on you. While there are some treatments available, it\u2019s best to avoid getting bitten in the first place. Various studies have suggested factors that could play a role in tick attraction, including a recent paper showing a\u00a0connection between tick attraction and static electricity\u00a0in a laboratory setting. And while ticks are attracted to cues such as the carbon dioxide exhaled by animals, they tend to lie in wait rather than actively seeking out their prey. \u201cContrary to popular belief, they don\u2019t fall from trees. They simply sit at the edge of a tall blade of grass, for example, that\u2019s maybe hanging over someplace, and they\u2019ll put their front leg out. We call that questing,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey will wait for that host to brush right by them, and so that\u2019s primarily how people get ticks: They brush by it; it attaches to their leg or their clothes.\u201d Insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus have been\u00a0approved by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0to protect against ticks. However, these chemicals work differently against ticks than they do against mosquitoes. For instance, DEET \u201cburns the feet of ticks, and they fall off because their feet are burning,\u201d as opposed to interfering with the tick\u2019s ability to find its prey the way DEET affects mosquitoes, Mather said. What\u2019s more, \u201cas soon as the product is dried, it doesn\u2019t burn as much, so it really doesn\u2019t last very long for ticks.\u201d Instead, Chapman recommends preventing tick bites by covering your skin and tucking the bottoms of your pants into your socks. Ticks also are killed by half an hour in the dryer, so toss your clothes in as soon as you get home, even before you wash them. What\u2019s more, \u201cwe favor\u00a0wearing treated clothes with permethrin\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s far, far more effective\u201d than bug spray, Mather said. \u201cIt blocks nerve conduction in ticks, and it makes them hyper-excited and then they just lose function pretty quickly, and it actually ends up killing them.\u201d Depending on where you live, he said, it might also make sense to investigate exterminating ticks living in your yard. These precautions might seem extreme, but to Mather, they\u2019re the way of the future, because \u201cwe live in a \u2018more ticks in more places\u2019 world, and more people are being exposed.\u201d Climate change may play some role\u00a0in the spread of ticks, but Mather said he believes that the influx of the parasites has more to do with white-tailed deer becoming more common in areas where higher densities of people live. As a result, he said, \u201cMore people are being exposed to the ticks that are reproducing on white-tailed deer.\u201d Despite the spread of ticks and the severity of illnesses that they can cause, Chapman stressed that with proper precautions (for you and your pets \u2014 ask your vet for tick preventatives), they shouldn\u2019t hold you hostage inside your home. \u201cYes, ticks exist. Yes, they can be a public health concern, but we don\u2019t want you to let ticks keep you indoors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should still be able to go outside and enjoy nature, but you just have to, once again, perform those tick checks. So take a little bit of time. Do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_tattoo-lymphoma-cancer-study", "text": "A Swedish study has found a potential link between tattoos and a type of cancer called malignant lymphoma, but it ultimately calls for more research on the topic, and cancer experts say the possible link is overblown. The researchers, from Lund University, said they wanted to do the study because so little is known about the long-term health effects of tattooing, despite its continuing popularity. In the US alone, nearly a third of people have at least one tattoo, a 2023 Pew Research Center survey found. The study, published in the most recent edition of the journal eClinicalMedicine, involved nearly 12,000 people in Sweden. From population registries, researchers identified everyone diagnosed with malignant lymphoma between 2007 and 2017 \u2013 nearly 3,000 people \u2013 and matched them with a group of the same age and gender mix who didn\u2019t have cancer. Malignant lymphoma is cancer of the lymphatic system, the part of the body that helps fight off germs and disease. Known risk factors include a weakened immune system caused by illness or immune disorders like AIDS, infections such as Epstein-Barr, age and a family history of the disease. Some exposure to chemicals like pesticides and herbicides can also increase the risk of lymphoma, in addition to secondhand smoke. In 2021, the study authors sent questionnaires to the people they had identified, asking about certain lifestyle factors that may increase the risk of this kind of cancer and about whether they had any tattoos. Even after the researchers factored in things that are known to affect cancer risk like smoking and age, they found that the risk of malignant lymphoma was 21% higher among those who had at least one tattoo. The finding is only an association, not a direct link, but the study authors emphasized that more research will be needed to flesh out this conclusion. To the researchers\u2019 surprise, they found no evidence to suggest that the risk increased as the person\u2019s skin was covered in more tattoos. \u201cWe do not yet know why this was the case. One can only speculate that a tattoo, regardless of size, triggers a low-grade inflammation in the body, which in turn can trigger cancer,\u201d said co-author Christel Nielsen, an associate professor in the\u00a0Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Lund University, in a news release. \u201cThe picture is thus more complex than we initially thought.\u201d The study was not set up to determine what the link between cancer and tattoos may be, if any, but experts are skeptical. The conclusion is \u201creally overstated,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved with the research. \u201cIf I were writing that paper, if I were the editor, I would have said the conclusion is, there is no evidence for a strong association,\u201d he said. The data is solid, he said, but the main risk factors for lymphomas are not found in tattooing. \u201cI would say the message here should be, we really didn\u2019t learn a lot about whether tattoos are associated with cancer with this, and if I had to make a conclusion, I would say the data suggests there is no association,\u201d Rebbeck said, noting that a smaller 2023 study on a connection between tattooing and lymphomas or hematologic cancer also found no increased risk. The 21% estimate of added risk comes from the models in the new study, but it is not statistically significant, he said. Dr. Catherine Diefenbach, director of the Clinical Lymphoma Program at the NYU Langone Health Perlmutter Cancer Center, said some things about the study don\u2019t add up. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make sense to me is why there\u2019s no correlation with the size of the tattoo. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to me that if there is an immune or toxic response, that the bigger tattoo didn\u2019t have any impact at all on the association,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of questions I have from this study.\u201d Diefenbach said she\u2019s never been asked about a connection between tattooing and cancer, but she has seen news reports about the new research. \u201cI think people are getting very nervous about something that is an early study that has to be validated,\u201d she said. The study authors speculate that if tattoos do increase the risk of a malignant lymphoma, one reason may be because of a problem with the ink itself. Tattoo ink can often have chemicals that are considered carcinogens, including metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Earlier studies have shown that the ink can sometimes travel through the body, and tiny particles can get stuck in the lymph nodes, which could lead to health problems. Another study found that tattoo ink could slightly alter parts of blood cells that communicate with others, but it is unclear whether that has an effect on health. Even infections are rare after tattooing, studies show. In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration issued draft guidance to the makers of tattoo ink and its distributors to help them recognize when ink may be contaminated, after the agency received reports about contaminated inks and some companies recalled those inks. The FDA will log and investigate complaints against the industry, but it doesn\u2019t regulate the practice or the inks used in tattooing because it\u2019s considered a cosmetic procedure. Nielsen said her group will look into whether tattoos are associated with other types of cancer or inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, lupus, high blood pressure and heart disease. Rebbeck notes that these types of research can be tricky for the public to interpret. He helps run cancerfactfinder.org, which aims to help people understand what does and does not cause cancer. Some have asked about tattoos, but the research doesn\u2019t really show a connection, he says. \u201cI would say we really don\u2019t know very much, but there\u2019s no strong evidence that having a tattoo is going to cause cancer,\u201d Rebbeck said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/tattoo-lymphoma-cancer-study/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}

Exposure to those toxins during pregnancy can create serious health issues in elementary school children that can affect their lives for years to come, a new study found. Children born to European mothers exposed to four families of chemicals that disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine (hormone) system had elevated levels of metabolic syndrome at ages 6 to 11. Metabolic syndrome can include obesity, elevated blood pressure, and abnormally high cholesterol and insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Within the group of children exposed to the highest levels of chemicals, 62% were overweight or obese, compared with 16% of children within the low-risk group, said first author Nuria Gu\u0308il-Oumrait, a Fulbright scholar at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cMoreover, the levels of blood insulin and triglycerides, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group,\u201d G\u00fcil-Oumrait said in an email. \u201cIn contrast, HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group.\u201d HDL cholesterol is considered a \u201cgood\u201d blood fat as it helps clear ateries. Metabolic syndrome is typically associated with adult cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, but the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has seen symptoms appearing in kids at younger and younger ages. Having metabolic syndrome as a child is highly predictive of chronic disease as an adult, experts say. \u201cThis research stands out as one of the most comprehensive endeavors delving into early-life environmental origins of metabolic risk, further bolstering prior toxicological and epidemiological evidence in this area,\u201d said Vicente Mustieles, Mariana Ferna\u0301ndez and Carmen Messerlian in an editorial published with the study that appeared Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Mustieles and Fern\u00e1ndez are investigators at the Biomedical Research Center at the University of Granada, Spain. Messerlian is an assistant professor of environmental reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. CNN reached out to the International Council for Chemical Associations for comment but did not hear back before publication. A spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, however, provided the following statement. \u201cWe will review the details of this study once it\u2019s released. ACC\u2019s members are serious about their responsibility to produce chemistries that offer important safety, product performance and durability benefits and that can be used safely. Our members undertake extensive scientific analyses to evaluate potential risk of their chemicals, from development through use and safe disposal.\u201d Dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals The research team behind the new study performed blood and urine tests on 1,134 mothers during their pregnancies and later repeated those tests on their children between the ages of 6 and 11. The tests were looking for mixtures of nine chemical classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly found in the environment. Endrocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants with the \u201cability to cross the blood-placenta barrier and interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance,\u201d the study said. These and other chemicals \u201cend up in the blood, tissue, and organs of fetuses and infants through maternal transplacental and breastfeeding pathways in a never-ending cycle,\u201d Mustieles, Fern\u00e1ndez and Messerlian wrote. The study tested for pesticides; heavy metals; flame retardants; plasticizers such as phthalates and phenols; and PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are found in surface and groundwaters around the world at levels much higher than many international regulators allow. Called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because\u00a0they fail to break down fully in the environment, PFAS have been used since the 1950s to make consumer products nonstick, oil- and water-repellent, and resistant to temperature change. Some of the most studied PFAS, such as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone disruption,\u00a0according to the EPA. Toxic heavy metals in the soil and water include lead and arsenic  \u2014 studies have found alarming levels in manufactured baby food. There is no safe level of lead, while arsenic, mercury and other heavy metals can harm the body and brain at relatively low doses, experts say. A December 2014 meta-analysis of studies on arsenic\u00a0found that a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15. Flame retardants have been linked to a 300% higher risk of cancer. These chemical toxins are the greatest contributor to intellectual disability in children worldwide, resulting in a total loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability, according to an\u00a0August 2020 study. Phthalates, found in hundreds of consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys, have been connected to premature death among people ages 55 to 64\u00a0in the United States. Prior research has connected phthalates with\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and\u00a0undescended testicles in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and testosterone levels in adult males. Phthalates are also linked in studies to\u00a0childhood obesity,\u00a0asthma,\u00a0cardiovascular issues\u00a0and\u00a0cancer. In the study, phthalates were the only group of chemicals that were associated with a lower level of metabolic syndrome. All of the other chemical families increased risk. People are exposed to a mixture of chemicals daily Chemicals may vary in their impact on the body. For example, certain PFAS compounds tend to accumulate in the liver, contributing to fatty liver disease and high cholesterol. And flame retardants and other chemicals may be stored in body fat, contributing to obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, according to the editorial. Since people are exposed to numerous types of potentially toxic substances each day, designing a study that could capture the cumulative impact on different parts of the body would provide a more realistic picture of any potential health impact. By focusing on metabolic syndrome, which combines measurements of blood sugars, lipids such as cholesterol, the existence of fat tissue and the impact on the heart, the current study was one of the first to accomplish this goal, the editorial said. \u201cWe almost always consider health risks from single chemicals, one at a time, as if we are exposed to just one chemical at a time,\u201d said Jane Houlihan, the national director of science and health for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies\u2019 exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. \u201cHere the research team shows that children\u2019s risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life can be driven by the complex mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the body at any moment and it highlights the particular risk of chemical exposures during pregnancy,\u201d she said. Healthy Babies Bright Futures\u00a0published a report in 2019\u00a0that found toxic metals in 95% of the baby foods randomly pulled off supermarket shelves, which led to the introduction of The Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, a bill that would allow the US Food and Drug Administration to set stricter standards and allow the FDA to monitor these standards through access to the records of food suppliers and manufacturers. \u201cGiven the steep rise in metabolic syndrome in the US, health officials and companies should be doing all they can to tighten safety standards and to get these chemicals out of commerce and out of our everyday products,\u201d Houlihan said. How to limit exposure There are ways to minimize exposure to plastics and other toxins, which is especially critical during pregnancy and childhood as developing fetuses and small bodies are more easily damaged, Houlihan said. Reduce rice intake for infants and children, and be sure to rinse grains well before using as this removes up to 60% of the arsenic, she said. Limit juice and be sure to carefully wash and peel vegetables and fruits, and if possible, buy organic. Stay away from stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and don\u2019t use waterproofing sprays. Check your local area for levels of PFAS and other chemicals in your drinking water. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy nonprofit, has created a national tap water database\u00a0searchable by zip code\u00a0that lists PFAS and other concerning chemicals, as well as a\u00a0national map\u00a0that illustrates where PFAS has been detected in the US. If your drinking water is of concern, consider purchasing a reverse osmosis filter, the most effective kind, EWG said. NSF, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, has\u00a0a list of recommended filters. Tap water is often a better choice than bottled water, however, which is packed with nanoplastics that can invade cells and tissues and leach toxic chemicals into the body. At home, one easy change is to use glass or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones when heating food. If possible, try to cook with ceramic, cast iron, or stainless-steel pans and avoid cookware treated with chemicals to avoid food sticking. Another good choice is to use stainless steel or glass bottles instead of plastic ones. \u201cChoose cosmetics that are free from endocrine disruptors such as parabens, benzophenone, triclosan, and phthalates,\u201d Gu\u0308il-Oumrait suggested. Consider the same for food, sunscreens, household cleaners and other everyday products encased in plastic. The EWG has several consumer databases that provides links to consumer products with fewer chemicals, including food scores, personal care products, sunscreen recommendations and a healthy living app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added. Other finds at the site, which sits on the slope of a valley, include buildings, pits, ditches and a road that archaeologists dated to the late 5th and early 6th centuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/europe/horses-remains-graves-france-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness", "text": "It\u2019s a true blessing to have great friends who frequently get together. At times, however, those blessings may overflow, according to \u201cB,\u201d a 43-year-old Atlantan who CNN is not identifying for privacy reasons. \u201cI love Champagne bubbles and having Champagne on a patio on Sunday with friends \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0it\u2019s an ideal day,\u201d B said. \u201cBut my friends hang out all the time, and even on a weeknight, it would end up being bottles of wine. I felt like I should have invested in box wine, especially during the pandemic.\u201d Today, B has given up alcohol, turning instead to marijuana gummies when she wants a buzz. The use of weed to replace alcohol is a growing trend in the United States. In fact, a recent study found \u2014 for the first time ever \u2014 the daily use of cannabis of any kind among Americans surpassed the daily use of alcohol. In sheer numbers, of course, many more people still drink alcohol on occasion than use marijuana, which is now legal for recreational use in\u00a024 states and Washington, DC, and for medical use in\u00a038 states\u00a0and DC. Still, nearly 18 million people age 12 and older reported using marijuana daily or near daily in 2022, compared with about 15 million who said they used alcohol with the same frequency, according to the study\u2019s analysis of the most recent data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual government survey. \u2018My heart was racing\u2019 For B, giving up alcohol was a necessity. Her periodic binge drinking with friends was taking a toll. Hangovers and an increasing sense of anxiety on the mornings after affected her work performance and her ability to exercise, an enjoyable part of her life. \u201cI\u2019m really healthy, I eat clean and work out all the time, and I just was not feeling good anymore,\u201d B said. \u201cThen one day I was laying on my couch, and my heart was racing like it was coming out of my chest.\u201d Both alcoholism and heart disease ran in B\u2019s family: \u201cI\u2019ve had relatives that have dropped dead of a heart attack in their driveway.\u201d Simply drinking less wasn\u2019t an option for her. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to moderate in the past, but it\u2019s hard to do that when you\u2019re around people who are drinking,\u201d B said. \u201cSo I decided to quit alcohol completely. My friends were really supportive, and it was easier than I thought it would be.\u201d After a few months of total sobriety, however, B began to experiment with cannabis gummies and found them easy to incorporate with a nonalcoholic drink or two. \u201cI don\u2019t like getting super high,\u201d B said. \u201cI\u2019ll just cut off a fourth of a gummy to take the edge off after a long day at work. If I\u2019m with friends at a party where I know I\u2019ll be there awhile, I might take a half or even a whole one.\u201d Weed or alcohol: Which is better? Is replacing alcohol with weed a healthier option? It depends, experts say. \u201cQuestioning one\u2019s relationship with alcohol is a very healthy trend,\u201d said Carol Boyd, founding director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was not involved in the analysis. \u201cWe know that moderate alcohol consumption has health risks, and risk increases as alcohol consumption increases,\u201d Boyd said in an email. Just one drink a day can raise blood pressure, trigger a dangerous irregular heartbeat or even shrink your brain, studies have found. Those are just a few of the many pitfalls of alcohol use, including the risk of cancer. Binge drinking, defined as consuming four or more drinks in two hours for women (five or more for men) was on the rise during the pandemic. Binging was higher in women, sending twice as many to the emergency room during the pandemic than before. In fact, the alcohol-induced death rate for both sexes jumped 26% between 2019 and 2020, the first year of the pandemic. At first glance, the harms of marijuana appear equally worrisome. By using cannabis before the age of 25, young people can permanently damage their brains, wreaking havoc with their ability to learn, remember, solve problems and pay attention, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Any level of marijuana use\u00a0raises the risk of stroke by 42%\u00a0and heart attack by 25%, even if there is no prior history of heart disease and the person has never smoked or vaped tobacco, according to a February 2024 study. Weed has\u00a0also been linked\u00a0to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation; myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle;\u00a0spasms of the heart\u2019s arteries\u00a0and a higher risk of\u00a0heart failure. However, many participants in those cardiovascular studies are smoking or vaping marijuana instead of ingesting it, said Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician and cannabis specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who authored \u201cSeeing\u00a0 Through the Smoke: A Cannabis Specialist Untangles the Truth About Marijuana.\u201d \u201cNo doctor recommends smoking marijuana, unless someone is in acute pain or has cancer and is on chemotherapy, when they might want the faster pain relief that comes from inhaling,\u201d Grinspoon said. Burning anything, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, creates\u00a0toxic compounds that are harmful to health when inhaled, said marijuana reseracher Dr. Beth Cohen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cCannabis smoke contains toxins, carcinogens, and particulate matter that have been linked to cancer, lung damage, and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cWith potential harms for any substance, we would expect to see a dose response. So, I\u2019m particularly concerned about the increases in daily or near daily use of cannabis.\u201d In fact, marijuana smoke may even be more harmful than tobacco because users hold the hot smoke in their lungs longer to maximize their high. A March 2021 study by Boyd found teens twice as likely to report \u201cwheezing or whistling\u201d in the chest after vaping marijuana than after smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes. \u201cNew data is beginning to show\u00a0that secondhand marijuana smoke may be just as dangerous as the primary smoke,\u201d Robert Page II, a\u00a0professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora, told CNN in a prior interview. However, there are many other options than inhaling marijuana smoke, Grinspoon said, including \u201cusing topicals like oils, lotions or a skin patch, or a suppository, or a tincture put under the tongue or in tea, or an edible. You don\u2019t have to smoke the cannabis.\u201d There is a problem, however. Research on edibles, such as baked goods, candies and beverages, and other methods of using cannabis is in its infancy. Whether there are longer-term impacts on human health than ingesting too much at one sitting and getting an uncomfortable high are unknown. \u201cWe do not yet know risks of daily use of edibles \u2014 thus, I cannot say whether the trend will end up as a healthy one,\u201d Boyd said in email. \u201cRegulation is uneven, products vary, and use is still illegal under federal law. We need better data!\u201d \u2018Like the Wild West\u2019 B lives in Georgia, a state where only medical marijuana is allowed. Therefore, B began using hemp-based gummies laced with delta-9, the most abundant form of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the part of the cannabis plant that creates a high. The synthetic form used in edibles is called delta-9 THC-O acetate. With the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which removed the hemp plant from the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s schedule of controlled substances, B can buy numerous brands of hemp gummies nearly everywhere, including her local gas station. \u201cFirst, I want to commend her for giving up alcohol,\u201d said Grinspoon, who is on the board of the advocacy group Doctors for Drug Policy Reform, which addresses cannabis, psychedelic and drug regulation in general. \u201cBut the hemp products she buys at the gas station or liquor store or the like are completely unregulated, sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids like delta-8, delta-9 and delta 10 that are pretty cheap to make. \u201cThat\u2019s really dangerous for a million reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in these new synthetic cannabinoids. You can get all kinds of industrial byproducts, a mixture of all kinds of synthetics, or an extremely high or low dose of the synthetic. It\u2019s like the Wild West out there.\u201d \u201cPotentially harmful chemicals \u201care needed to convert cannabinoids in hemp into synthetic products like delta 8, according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while manufacturing may \u201coccur in uncontrolled or unsanitary settings.\u201d Of the nearly 2,400 calls about delta 8 to the National Poison Center in one year from 2021 to 2022, 70% required a doctor\u2019s care and 8% were admitted, the FDA said. One child died. A June 2018 review of existing literature on synthetic versions of cannabis found they may cause more severe adverse effects, which could include breathing problems, a spike in blood pressure, chest pain and a rapidly beating heart, cognitive impairment. anxiety, agitation, suicidal ideation, and even death. \u201cIn and of itself, it\u2019s not good that more people are using cannabis,\u201d Grinspoon said. However, If they are going to use it to replace alcohol, he added, \u201cpeople should be buying marijuana and hemp cannabis products at a legal, regulated dispensary in a state where the product is tracked from beginning to end and tested along the way.\u201d If a person chooses to buy weed or hemp online or at a smoke shop, be sure to choose a product with a label that shows they have paid an independent outside company to assure the purity of their products, he said. \u201cMy other advice for people who want to use weed is to get educated,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t smoke it. Start at a very low dose and go slow. Don\u2019t use it before driving. And get it from a medical marijuana dispensary or well-regulated legal shop, as that is much safer than these hemp-derived products that are unregulated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_microplastics-testicles-study-wellness", "text": "Human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas, a new small study found. \u201cThese plastics are often nano-scale, typically less than half a micron in length and maybe like 20 to 200 nanometers in width,\u201d said toxicologist Matthew Campen, coauthor of the study that published May 15 in the journal Toxicological Sciences. \u201cThey look like little shards, tiny broken bits from very, very old plastics,\u201d said Campen, a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Such minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, interrupting cellular processes and potentially depositing\u00a0endocrine-disrupting chemicals\u00a0such as\u00a0bisphenols,\u00a0phthalates,\u00a0flame retardants,\u00a0per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and\u00a0heavy metals. Endocrine disruptors interfere with the human reproductive system, leading to genital and reproductive malformations as well as female infertility and a decline in sperm count, according to the Endocrine Society. In fact, sperm counts in parts of the world, including the United States, have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, the society stated on its website. \u201cThis is an eyes wide open situation right now,\u201d Campen said. \u201cWe\u2019re just now realizing how much plastic is in our bodies. We need a surge of research around this topic to confirm or deny a role for microplastics in driving infertility, testicular cancer and other cancers.\u201d \u2018Action is desperately needed now\u2019 The new study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d Polyethylene, one of the most widely used plastics in the world, was the predominant type of polymer in both species, followed by PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, another commonly used chemical that can contain chemical additives and heavy metals including phthalates, cadmium and lead. Phthalates, called\u00a0 \u201ceverywhere chemicals\u201d because they are so common, are added to consumer products to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break. Researchers expected to find more plastic shards in the testicles of older men in the study, but that wasn\u2019t the case, Campen said. \u201cIt seems that in peak reproductive years for men, which is from 20 to 45, there are higher levels of plastics, which then begin to decline after the age of 55,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests the human body can eliminate these plastics.\u201d But there is a downside. The finding also suggests that the increased energy needs of a younger testicle may \u201calso pull more plastic into that organ,\u201d Campen said. \u201cAdd to that the fact that the number of plastics we\u2019re exposed to is doubling at a rate of every 10 to 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen in 15 years when we are exposed to twice the amount or 30 years when we are exposed to four times the amount? That is why action is desperately needed now.\u201d The American Chemistry Council, an industry association, told CNN in a previous interview that plastics \u201chelp protect us, improve healthcare outcomes, and contribute to a more sustainable world.\u201d \u201cPlastic makers have a\u00a0goal\u00a0for all US plastic packaging to be reused, recycled, or recovered by 2040,\u201d said Dr. Kimberly Wise White, the council\u2019s vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs. More plastics than placentas Researchers also compared the testes results with microplastic levels found in an earlier study on 62 human placentas, the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to a developing fetus in the womb. In that February study, led by Campen, researchers found microplastics at levels of 6.5 to 790 micrograms per gram of tissue in all the placenta samples studied. \u201cIn testes, the levels of plastic was three times as much as we saw in placentas,\u201d Campen said. \u201cBut you have to consider that the placenta only has a life of about eight months.\u201d The latest study isn\u2019t the first report to find plastics in reproductive tissue. A team of Beijing-based researchers found microplastics in six human testes and 30 semen samples in a June 2023 study, while animal studies have shown tiny plastics can impact sperm count and contribute to hormone and other disruptions in male sexual organs. In studies of pregnant mice, researchers have found plastic chemicals in the brain, heart, liver, kidney and lungs of the developing fetus 24 hours after the pregnant mother ingested or breathed in plastic particles. Other\u00a0research\u00a0has shown that micro- and nanoplastics may cause oxidative stress, tissue damage and inflammation in cells, while animal studies have shown such particles may alter heart rate and impede cardiac function. How to limit plastic in your life There are steps one can take to reduce exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in food and food packaging products, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cLook at the recycling code on the bottom of products to find the plastic type, and avoid plastics with recycling codes 3, which typically contain phthalates,\u201d he added. Cut down on the use of disposable plastics, suggests the\u00a0Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Other suggestions include bringing reusable bags to the grocery store. Invest in a zippered fabric bag and ask the dry cleaner to return your clothes in that instead of those thin sheets of plastic. Bring a travel mug to the local coffee store for takeout and silverware to the office and cut back on plastic cups and utensils.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/microplastics-testicles-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2016_07_18_health_zika-virus-infection-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at Zika virus, an illness spread through mosquito bites that can cause birth defects and other neurological defects.  Facts Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO) and CNN Zika virus is a flavivirus, part of the same family as yellow fever, West Nile, chikungunya and dengue fever. Zika is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. It becomes infected from biting an infected human and then transmits the virus to another person. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is an aggressive species, active day and night and usually bites when it is light out. The virus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sexual contact, blood transfusion or by needle. The FDA approved the first human trial of a Zika vaccine in June 2016. As of May 2022, there is still no available vaccine or medication.  Cases including confirmed, probable or suspected cases of Zika in US states and territories updated by the CDC. Symptoms Most people infected with Zika virus won\u2019t have symptoms. If there are symptoms, they will last for a few days to a week. Fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis (red eyes) are the most common symptoms. Some patients may also experience muscle pain or headaches. Zika and Pregnancy Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly, a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. Microcephaly can cause severe developmental issues and sometimes death. A Zika infection may cause other birth defects, including eye problems, hearing loss and impaired growth. Miscarriage can also occur. An August 2018 report published by the CDC estimates that nearly one in seven babies born to women infected with the Zika virus while pregnant had one or more health problems possibly caused by the virus, including microcephaly.     According to the CDC, there is no evidence that previous infection will affect future pregnancies. Timeline (Sources: WHO, CDC and CNN) 1947 - The Zika virus is first discovered in a monkey by scientists studying yellow fever in Uganda\u2019s Zika forest. 1948 - The virus is isolated from Aedes africanus mosquito samples in the Zika forest. 1964 - First active case of Zika virus found in humans. While researchers had found antibodies in the blood of people in both Uganda and in Tanzania as far back as 1952, this is the first known case of the active virus in humans. The infected man developed a pinkish rash over most of his body but reported the illness as \u201cmild,\u201d with none of the pain associated with dengue and chikungunya. 1960s-1980s - A small number of countries in West Africa and Asia find Zika in mosquitoes, and isolated, rare cases are reported in humans. April-July 2007 - The first major outbreak in humans occurs on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia. Of the suspected 185 cases reported, 49 are confirmed, and 59 are considered probable. There are an additional 77 suspected cases. No deaths are reported. 2008 - Two American researchers studying in Senegal become ill with the Zika virus after returning to the United States. Subsequently, one of the researchers transmits the virus to his wife.  2013-2014 - A large outbreak of Zika occurs in French Polynesia, with about 32,000 suspected cases. There are also outbreaks in the Pacific Islands during this time. An uptick in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome during the same period suggests a possible link between the Zika virus and the rare neurological syndrome. However, it was not proven because the islands were also experiencing an outbreak of dengue fever at the time. March 2015 - Brazil alerts the WHO to an illness with skin rash that is present in the northeastern region of the country. From February 2015 to April 29, 2015, nearly 7,000 cases of illness with a skin rash are reported. Later in the month, Brazil provides additional information to WHO on the illnesses. April 29, 2015 - A state laboratory in Brazil informs the WHO that preliminary samples have tested positive for the Zika virus.  May 7, 2015 - The outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil prompts the WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to issue an epidemiological alert. October 30, 2015 - Brazil reports an increase in the cases of microcephaly, babies born with abnormally small heads: 54 cases between August and October 30.

{"id": "2024_05_21_health_nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness", "text": "The nightmares are intense and often horrifying, sometimes lasting well into the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a serial killer after me and the last few years I have the same one,\u201d according to a Canadian patient. \u201cHe\u2019s got my legs or something I can still feel something on my legs even when I\u2019m then awake.\u201d Another English patient described nightmares \u201cwhere I can\u2019t breathe and where someone is sitting on my chest.\u201d Yet another shared stories of \u201creally nasty\u201d violent visions in their sleep. \u201cHorrific, like murders, like skin coming off people,\u201d said one Irish patient about his nightmares. \u201cI think it\u2019s like when I\u2019m overwhelmed which could be the lupus being bad \u2026 so I think the more stress my body is under then the more vivid and bad the dreaming would be.\u201d Nightmares and \u201cdaymares,\u201d dreamlike hallucinations that appear when awake, may be little-known signs of the onset of lupus and other systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to a new study published Monday in the journal eClinicalMedicine. Such unusual symptoms may also be a signal that an established disease may be about to intensely worsen or \u201cflare\u201d and require medical treatment, said lead study author Melanie Sloan, a researcher in the department of public health and primary care at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. \u201cThis is particularly the case in a disease like lupus, which is well known for affecting multiple organs including the brain, but we also found these patterns of symptoms in the other rheumatological diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and systemic sclerosis,\u201d Sloan said in an email. Lupus is a long-term disease in which the body\u2019s immune system goes haywire, attacking healthy tissue and causing inflammation and pain in any part of the body, including blood cells, the brain, heart, joints and muscles, kidneys, liver, and lungs. \u201cCognitive problems and many of these other neuropsychiatric symptoms we studied can have a huge influence on people\u2019s lives, ability to work, to socialize, and just to have as much of a normal life as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThese symptoms are often invisible and (currently) untestable but that shouldn\u2019t make them any less important to be considered for treatment and support.\u201d Jennifer Mundt, an assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who was not involved in the study, said in an email she was pleased the study focused on nightmares. \u201cAlthough nightmares are a very distressing problem in many medical and psychiatric conditions, they rarely get focused on except in the context of PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome),\u201d Mundt said. \u201cA\u00a0recent study\u00a0showed that 18% of people with long-COVID have (frequent) nightmares, and this compares to a general population prevalence of about 5%,\u201d she said. \u201cHearing the patient perspective is critical so that research and clinical care can be guided by what is most important to patients themselves.\u201d Doctors and patients need to know While research in the field is rather new, a March 2019 study found patients with inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases also experienced nightmares and other REM sleep disorders such as sleep paralysis. REM is short for rapid eye movement, the stage of sleep in which people dream and information and information and experiences are consolidated and stored in memory. In that study, one 57-year-old man recalled being \u201cthreatened by feral birds of prey\u201d in his nightmares, while a 70-year-old woman dreamed her nephew was in grave danger but she could do nothing to help him. The new study surveyed 400 doctors and 676 people living with lupus and also conducted detailed interviews with 50 clinicians and 69 people living with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including lupus. Researchers found 3 in 5 lupus patients, and 1 in 3 patients with other rheumatology-related diseases, had increasingly vivid and distressing nightmares just before their hallucinations. These nightmares often involved falling or being attacked, trapped, or crushed or committing murder. \u201cI\u2019d be riding a horse, going around cutting people out with my sword. One of them was somebody attacking me and I ended up slitting their throat,\u201d the English patient said. \u201cI\u2019m not a violent person at all. I don\u2019t even kill an insect,\u201d the patient continued. \u201cAnd I came to the conclusion that\u2019s probably me fighting my own (autoimmune) system. \u2026 I\u2019m probably attacking myself, that\u2019s the only thing I can logically make sense out of it. Systemic autoimmune diseases often have a range of symptoms, called prodromes, that appear as signs of a sudden and possibly dangerous worsening of the condition. In lupus, for example, headaches, an increase in fatigue, painful, swollen joints, rashes, dizziness and a fever without an infection are well-known signs of an upcoming flare. Recognizing these warning signs are important, Sloan said, because they allow \u201cearlier detection and therefore treatment of flares, some of which can be organ damaging and even fatal in lupus patients.\u201d However, unique warning symptoms such as nightmares and daymares are not in the diagnostic criteria for lupus or other diseases, Sloan said. The study found doctors infrequently ask about such experiences, and patients often avoid talking about them to their physicians. \u201cWe are strongly encouraging more doctors to ask about nightmares and other neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 thought to be unusual, but actually very common in systemic autoimmunity \u2014 to help us detect disease flares earlier,\u201d said senior study author David D\u2019Cruz, a consultant rheumatologist at Guy\u2019s Hospital and Kings College London. Connect the dots to autoimmune disease On first glance, it would make sense that such neurological manifestations as nightmares would occur if the autoimmune disease impacts the brain, which lupus often does, Sloan said. But that\u2019s not what the study uncovered. \u201cInterestingly, we found that lupus patients who were classified as having organ involvement other than the brain, such as kidneys or lungs, often also reported a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the lead up to their kidney/lung flare,\u201d Sloan said via email. \u201cThis suggests that monitoring these symptoms \u2014 such as nightmares and changing mood \u2014 as well as the usual rashes and protein in the urine (due to inflammation in the kidneys), etc., may help with earlier flare detection in many patients, not just those who go on to develop major brain involvement,\u201d she said. However, there is no reason for people with occasional nightmares or daytime dreams to be worried they may have an inflammatory autoimmune disease, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. \u201cThis study could alarm the general public into believing or worrying\u00a0about whether they have lupus or a related autoimmune disorder if they have nightmares or hallucinations, which are what doctors call \u2018nonspecific symptoms,\u2019 meaning that a variety of conditions (medical and psychiatric) can manifest with these symptoms,\u201d Schenck said in an email. It is indeed \u201cperfectly normal\u201d to have occasional nightmares and even daymares, or hallucinations, which \u201care also more common than we think,\u201d Sloan said. However, if those are intense, upsetting and occur around other symptoms such as extreme fatigue, headaches and other signs of autoimmune disorders, they \u201cshould be discussed with a doctor,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be afraid or embarrassed to talk about these symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases, reporting these symptoms earlier, even if they seem strange and unconnected, may lead to the doctor being able to \u2018join the dot\u2019s\u2019 to diagnose an autoimmune disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_belly-button-health-indicator-partner-content-wellness", "text": "Navels, belly buttons, innies or outies \u2026 whatever term you use, your umbilicus may have plenty to tell you about the state of your health. For some, they are the thing of nightmares \u2013\u00a0omphalophobia\u00a0(the fear of belly buttons) is a real condition. For others, they are a fashion accessory to be shown off in a crop top, or decorated with a body piercing. Whatever your feelings about belly buttons, one thing\u2019s for sure - it once joined you to your mother. The umbilical cord is severed at birth to leave just a small clamped stump that progressively withers and falls away a week or two later. What you\u2019re left with, in most cases, is a small wrinkled depression. That\u2019s if you have an \u201cinnie\u201d, as most of us \u2013\u00a090% apparently\u00a0\u2013 do. From this point, the belly button seems to become redundant \u2013 other than to gather dust and fluff. But that\u2019s not the whole story \u2013 your navel has more depth to it than just a few millimetres. READ MORE: What your hair can tell you about your health\u00a0 The umbilicus is an access point for the vessels carrying blood to and from the fetus. These have come from the placenta and run through the\u00a0umbilical cord, coated in\u00a0Wharton\u2019s jelly\u00a0\u2013 a gelatinous connective tissue contained in the cord that insulates and protects them. There are normally three vessels within the cord. The one carrying oxygen and nutrients to the foetus is the\u00a0umbilical vein. It passes through the umbilicus and feeds into the developing foetal circulation. There are also\u00a0two umbilical arteries, though these carry deoxygenated blood and waste products, flowing in the other direction back to the placenta. This circulation is not needed after the baby is born, and once disconnected from the placenta the umbilical vessels naturally close up. But the little stump of cut cord left clinging on can still be of use for a short time, especially in newborn babies who are poorly. The vessels can have\u00a0drip lines inserted\u00a0and be used for infusions of medicine, or have blood samples taken from them for testing. READ MORE: What your skin can tell you about your health The umbilicus is a portal in the wall of the abdomen - it\u2019s a little-known fact that during your embryonic development your intestines actually have to\u00a0leave your abdominal cavity\u00a0because of limited space, but return a few weeks later. They do so via the umbilicus, passing into the cord. As a result the umbilicus is not just an access point, but a point of weakness. An\u00a0umbilical hernia\u00a0occurs if a section of intestine pokes through any gap. This may require an operation to correct it. The nun and the navel Poor\u00a0Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey. She was a nun who devoted much of her life to the care of patients in a hospital in Minnesota. She trained as a nurse, later becoming a surgical assistant to the doctor William Mayo. It was during this tenure that she highlighted an interesting observation. At the time (the late 19th century), cancers of the abdomen and pelvis were typically diagnosed much later, and unfortunately were often more extensive. We call this process\u00a0metastasis, where a cancer starts in one organ or location, then spreads to another. Mary Joseph noted that some patients with metastatic cancer had a new palpable swelling or nodule in their umbilicus. She did the noble deed of reporting this to Mayo, who fairly evidently hadn\u2019t noted it himself. He went on to rather\u00a0ignominiously publish these findings\u00a0under his own name, without giving due credit to his esteemed colleague. It was only after the deaths of Dempsey and Mayo - both in 1939 - that another doctor, Hamilton Bailey, rightly named the finding\u00a0Sister Mary Joseph\u2019s nodule. The\u00a0nodule\u00a0is firm, of variable colouring, and actually arises from spread of the cancer to the umbilical tissue. It\u2019s not seen as commonly these days, since more cancers are now diagnosed earlier before extensive spreading occurs. READ MORE: What your earwax and tears can tell you about your health\u00a0 Medusa\u2019s head Other signs can be observed in the navel that have a footing in mythology. One example allows us to draw a connection between the liver and the umbilicus. The skin around the navel has beds of\u00a0superficial veins\u00a0that feed back towards the deeper circulation. They actually drain blood into the hepatic portal vein, a large vessel that is heading into the liver, chock-full of nutrients absorbed from the gut. If the\u00a0pressure in the portal vein becomes too high\u00a0(mostly as a result of liver diseases, like alcohol cirrhosis) pressure builds in the connecting vessels too. Veins have thinner walls than arteries and tend to\u00a0balloon under pressure. As a result, the normally small veins around the navel dilate in size and become visible beneath the skin, fanning in all directions. This sign, like a head replete with snakes for hair, is named\u00a0caput medusae, or Medusa\u2019s head. In Greek mythology,\u00a0the gorgon Medusa\u00a0whose head was severed by the hero Perseus, had the ability to turn anyone who beheld her gaze to stone. READ MORE: 7 navel-gazing questions about belly buttons answered And on that topic, all that dirt, debris and dead skin in our navels should also get an honourable (or maybe dishonourable) mention - prolonged accumulation of this material within the cavity can make it harden over time, forming a stony mass. We call this an\u00a0omphalolith, or umbilical stone. So, the umbilicus is something of a reliable crystal ball in diagnosing internal illnesses. But as to whether you regard it as an attractive part of your own anatomy, one has to ask the question: are you innie or outie?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/belly-button-health-indicator-partner-content-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_health_florida-c-section-clinics", "text": "Florida has become the first state to allow doctors to perform cesarean sections outside of hospitals, siding with a private equity-owned physicians group that says the change will lower costs and give pregnant women the homier birthing atmosphere that many desire. But the hospital industry and the nation\u2019s leading obstetricians\u2019 association say that even though some Florida hospitals have closed their maternity wards in recent years, performing C-sections in doctor-run clinics will increase the risks for women and babies when complications arise. \u201cA pregnant patient that is considered low-risk in one moment can suddenly need lifesaving care in the next,\u201d Cole Greves, an Orlando perinatologist who chairs the Florida chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in an email to KFF Health News. The new birth clinics, \u201ceven with increased regulation, cannot guarantee the level of safety patients would receive within a hospital.\u201d This spring,\u00a0a law\u00a0was enacted allowing \u201cadvanced birth centers,\u201d where physicians can deliver babies vaginally or by C-section to women deemed at low risk of complications. Women would be able to stay overnight at the clinics. Women\u2019s Care Enterprises,\u00a0a private equity-owned physicians group\u00a0with locations mostly in Florida along with California and Kentucky, lobbied the state legislature to make the change. BC Partners, a London-based investment firm, bought Women\u2019s Care in 2020. \u201cWe have patients who don\u2019t want to deliver in a hospital, and that breaks our heart,\u201d said Stephen Snow, who recently retired as an OB-GYN with Women\u2019s Care and testified before the Florida Legislature advocating for the change in 2018. Brittany Miller, vice president of strategic initiatives with Women\u2019s Care, said the group would not comment on the issue. Health experts are leery. \u201cWhat this looks like is a poor substitute for quality obstetrical care effectively being billed as something that gives people more choices,\u201d said Alice Abernathy, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. \u201cThis feels like a bad band-aid on a chronic issue that will make outcomes worse rather than better,\u201d Abernathy said. Nearly one-third of U.S. births occur via C-section, the surgical delivery of a baby through an incision in the mother\u2019s abdomen and uterus. Generally, doctors use the procedure when they believe it is safer than vaginal delivery for the parent, the baby, or both. Such medical decisions can take place months before birth, or in an emergency. Florida state Sen. Gayle Harrell, the Republican who sponsored the birth center bill, said having a C-section outside of a hospital may seem like a radical change, but so was the opening of outpatient surgery centers in the late 1980s. Harrell, who managed her husband\u2019s OB-GYN practice, said birth centers will have to meet the same high standards for staffing, infection control, and other aspects as those at outpatient surgery centers. \u201cGiven where we are with the need, and maternity deserts across the state, this is something that will help us and help moms get the best care,\u201d she said. Seventeen hospitals in the state have closed their maternity units since 2019, with many citing low insurance reimbursement and high malpractice costs, according to the Florida Hospital Association. Mary Mayhew, CEO of the Florida Hospital Association, said it is wrong to compare birth centers to ambulatory surgery centers because of the many risks associated with C-sections, such as hemorrhaging. The Florida law requires advanced birth centers to have a transfer agreement with a hospital, but it does not dictate where the facilities can open nor their proximity to a hospital. \u201cWe have serious concerns about the impact this model has on our collective efforts to improve maternal and infant health,\u201d Mayhew said. \u201cOur hospitals do not see this in the best interest of providing quality and safety in labor and delivery.\u201d Despite its opposition to the new birth centers, the Florida Hospital Association did not fight passage of the overall bill because it also included a major increase in the amount Medicaid pays hospitals for maternity care. Mayhew said it is unlikely that the birth centers would help address care shortages. Hospitals are already struggling with a shortage of OB-GYNs, she said, and it is unrealistic to expect advanced birth centers to open in rural areas with a large proportion of people on Medicaid, which pays the lowest reimbursement for labor and delivery care. It is unclear whether insurers will cover the advanced birth centers, though most insurers and Medicaid cover care at midwife-run birth centers. The advanced birth centers will not accept emergency walk-ins and will treat only patients whose insurance contracts with the facilities, making them in-network. Snow, the retired OB-GYN with Women\u2019s Care, said the group plans to open an advanced birth center in the Tampa or Orlando area. The advanced birth center concept is an improvement on midwife care that enables deliveries outside of hospitals, he said, as the centers allow women to stay overnight and, if necessary, offer anesthesia and C-sections. Snow acknowledged that, with a private equity firm invested in Women\u2019s Care, the birth center idea is also about making money. But he said hospitals have the same profit incentive and, like midwives, likely oppose the idea of centers that can provide C-sections because they could cut into hospital revenue. \u201cWe are trying to reduce the cost of medicine, and this would be more cost-effective and more pleasant for patients,\u201d he said. Kate Bauer, executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers, said patients could confuse advanced birth centers with the existing, free-standing birth centers for low-risk births that have been run by midwives for decades. There are currently 31 licensed birth centers in Florida and 411 free-standing birth centers in the United States, she said. \u201cThis is a radical departure from the standard of care,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d she said, because it could increase risks to mom and baby. No other state allows C-sections outside of hospitals. The only facility that offers similar care is a birth clinic in Wichita, Kansas, which is connected by a short walkway to a hospital, Wesley Medical Center. The clinic provides \u201chotel-like\u201d maternity suites where staffers deliver about 100 babies a month, compared with 500 per month in the hospital itself. Morgan Tracy, a maternity nurse navigator at the center, said the concept works largely because the hospital and birthing suites can share staff and pharmacy access, plus patients can be quickly transferred to the main hospital if complications arise. \u201cThe beauty is there are team members on both sides of the street,\u201d Tracy said.

{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

{"id": "2022_07_18_health_how-to-stay-cool-without-air-conditioning-wellness", "text": "Whether you\u2019re without power, enduring extreme heat or trying to save money, there are ways to feel comfortable without artificial cooling.  Heat can foster fun summer activities, but the body shouldn\u2019t be too hot for too long, as too much heat can harm your brain and other organs, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Sweating is the body\u2019s natural cooling system, but when that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s increased risk for developing the heat-related illness hyperthermia \u2014 signs of which include heat cramps, heat edema and heat stroke. Heat combined with high humidity exacerbates this risk, since the air\u2019s saturation level makes sweat accumulate on the skin, preventing the body from cooling naturally.     Staying cool can be done by using some basic supplies and knowing how to manipulate your home to control its temperatures. Here are 14 methods for doing so.   Stay hydrated When you\u2019re hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer emeritus in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.  The temperature of the water doesn\u2019t matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can\u2019t do that without enough moisture, since the body cools itself by sweating.  Take a cold shower or bath Taking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature, Porter said. For an extra cool blast, try peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that tell your body something you\u2019re eating or feeling is cold.  Use cold washrags on your neck or wrists  Place a cold washrag or ice bags (packs) on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you\u2019ll cool down more quickly.  Use box fans  Place box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you\u2019re spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.  If the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, opening the windows on both sides of the house during those times can facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. If you do this, you can opt to use or not use the fans, but the fans would help cool the house faster, Porter said. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again. Just resting near a fan would reduce your body temperature as well.  Close your curtains or blinds If you have windows that face the sun\u2019s direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to \u201ckeep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up (the) inside,\u201d Porter said.  You could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.  If you do turn the air conditioning on, don\u2019t set it below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, founder of Spaces Alive, an Australia-based design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.  \u201cIt just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,\u201d she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.  Sleep in breathable linens Cotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.  The lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That\u2019s because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.  Sleep in the basement  If you can\u2019t sleep through the night because you\u2019re too hot, try sleeping somewhere besides your bedroom, if that\u2019s an option. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.  Don\u2019t refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing  Common advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out to wear while you sleep. But this isn\u2019t a good idea, Porter said.  Because of \u201cthe amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019d have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d  Close the doors of unused rooms  If no one\u2019s using a room that doesn\u2019t have vents or registers, close the door to that area to keep the cool air confined to only occupied areas of the house.  Use the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom  Flip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.  Install energy-efficient light bulbs Incandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs, then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.  Switching light bulbs can save money but won\u2019t reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. However, if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you\u2019re sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.  Cook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside Oven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.  Enjoy frozen treats Eating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don\u2019t go overboard on the sugar if you\u2019re overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.  \u201cSugar would run your metabolism up and you\u2019d start feeling internally hot,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.\u201d  Research what your state offers If you\u2019ve tried everything and still can\u2019t beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.  Depending on your state, some cooling centers \u2014 air-conditioned public facilities where people might go for relief during extremely hot weather \u2014 may be open and taking precautions to ensure they\u2019re as safe as possible. You could start by checking with your local utility offices, as they would know who is offering certain programs, Porter recommended.

{"id": "2013_10_14_health_autism-fast-facts", "text": "Here is a look at autism. Autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) incorporates a group of neurodevelopmental disorders causing impaired communication skills and social skills. ASD generally starts before three years of age and lasts a lifetime, but early intervention plays a role in treatment and progress. ASD is about four times more common among boys than girls, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ASD can be found among all races, ethnicities and socioeconomic groups. The prevalence of ASD in the United States is about one in 36 8-year-olds, according to a 2023 CDC report. Health care costs for children with autism are four to six times greater than medical costs for children without autism, according to research published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. April 2 is World Autism Day. Diagnosis There is no definitive medical test to diagnose autism. Instead, the disorder is diagnosed by observing a child\u2019s development. According to the CDC, signs of autism may include deficits in social communication and interaction in a variety of contexts, difficulty engaging in back-and-forth conversation and an absence of interest in forming friendships with peers. Vaccines and Autism The debate over whether autism spectrum disorders are caused by vaccines started in 1998 when the medical journal The Lancet published a now-retracted study by researcher Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine to autism. Most of Wakefield\u2019s co-authors withdrew their names from the study when they learned he had been compensated by a law firm intending to sue manufacturers of the vaccine in question. In 2010, Wakefield lost his medical license. In 2011, the Lancet retracted the study after an investigation found Wakefield altered or misrepresented information on the 12 children who were the basis for the conclusion of the study. Other researchers have not been able to replicate Wakefield\u2019s findings. Several subsequent studies trying to reproduce the results have found no link between vaccines and autism, including several reviews by the Institute of Medicine. Timeline Early 1900s - Autistic characteristics are studied as symptoms of schizophrenia. 1938 - Donald Gray Triplett of Mississippi is first examined by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner of Johns Hopkins Hospital and later becomes the first person diagnosed with autism symptoms. 1943 - Triplett is identified as \u201cDonald T.\u201d in the paper \u201cAutistic Disturbances of Affective Contact\u201d by Kanner. The paper elaborates on the idea that autism is related to lack of parental warmth; this is later dubbed the \u201crefrigerator mother\u201d theory. 1944 - Hans Asperger, an Austrian physician, publishes a paper about autistic syndrome. The paper gains wider recognition when it is translated into English in the early 1990s. 1964 - Bernard Rimland, a research psychologist, publishes \u201cInfantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior,\u201d which contradicts the \u201crefrigerator mother\u201d hypothesis. Kanner is the author of the foreword. 1965 - Rimland founds the National Society for Autistic Children (now the Autism Society). He later establishes the Autism Research Institute. 1980 - Autism is classified separately from schizophrenia in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). December 18, 2007 - The United Nations adopts a resolution declaring April 2 World Autism Awareness Day. October 29, 2014 - The medical journal Nature reports that scientists have identified 60 genes with a greater than 90% chance of increasing a child\u2019s autism risk. December 17, 2015 - Scientists at Harvard and MIT announce they have found, for the first time, a link between autistic behavior and reduced activity of a key neurotransmitter, a type of brain chemical that enables the transmission of signals across neurons, allowing the brain to communicate with other organs. April 21, 2016 - The Simons Foundation announces that it is launching an autism research project called SPARK. The study, which involves scientists at 21 hospitals and university clinics, will focus on the possible connection between genetics and autism. Parents of children with autism are invited to sign up online and participate in the study. The group also works with Autism Speaks and the Autism Science Foundation to run the Autism BrainNet network, which is an autism brain bank that collects postmortem donations. February 2017 - Researchers find that monitoring MRI brain scans of infants may help predict whether they will develop autism, according to a study published in the journal, Nature. The researchers found a possible link between brain enlargement during the first year of life and an autism diagnosis at age 2. This builds on previous similar research. March 19, 2017 - CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d profiles \u201cSesame Street\u2019s\u201d newest Muppet character, a girl named Julia who has autism. April 11, 2017 - A study published in the American Journal of Public Health finds that people with autism are three times more likely than the general population to die because of preventable injuries, and children and young teens with autism are 40 times more likely to die from preventable injury than the general child population. Suffocation, asphyxiation and drowning are the leading causes of fatal injuries among people with autism. March 26, 2018 - According to a study published in JAMA Pediatrics, children with autism spectrum disorder and their younger siblings are less likely to be fully vaccinated than children unaffected by autism. March 4, 2019 - A study of over 650,000 children published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine shows that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine does not increase the risk of autism and does not trigger autism in children who are at risk. April 29, 2019 - A study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children can be screened for autism spectrum disorder at 14 months of age with high accuracy (instead of 18 to 24 months of age, as is currently recommended). January 23, 2020 - A study in the journal Cell identifies 102 genes that are associated with an autism risk. Previously, researchers were only aware of 65. May 10, 2020 - In a report published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, the CDC estimates that 2.2% of Americans adults have autism spectrum disorder. The report, which is the first US study of autism in adults, indicates that up to 5.4 million people age 18 and older, or about 1 in 45 people, have an autism spectrum condition. February 14, 2022 - A meta-analysis published in JAMA Pediatrics finds that early mortality, due to natural or unnatural causes, is more than two times more likely for people with autism spectrum disorder than the general population.

{"id": "2024_05_24_health_new-experiments-milk-h5n1-infected-cows-raise-questions-flash-pasteurization", "text": "New lab experiments with milk from cows infected by H5N1 influenza,\u00a0known as\u00a0bird flu, confirm that it is infectious, especially when left raw, or untreated, and\u00a0potentially even when\u00a0flash pasteurized. The researchers, from the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, are part of a federally funded program called the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response, or CEIRR.\u00a0This network has been conducting rapid research to answer pressing questions in the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle. In a research letter posted online on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers describe the results of experiments using milk from four infected cows \u2014 two from New Mexico and two from Kansas. Because H5N1 virus is considered a select agent, it was handled in a high-security Biosafety Level 3 lab at the University of Wisconsin, using strict safety protocols. First, they confirmed the raw milk was chock-full of H5N1 virus.\u00a0 Then, they stored some of the raw milk at refrigerator temperature to see if levels of the virus in milk would drop off over time.\u00a0 Over 5 weeks, viral levels in raw milk dropped a bit, but not much. \u201cThat it wasn\u2019t decaying over time is concerning,\u201d said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Emory University who is also part of the CEIRR network but was not involved in the study. In another series of tests, the researchers checked to see what types of pasteurization might work best for inactivating the virus. They heated small samples of the milk at times and temperatures used in two types of pasteurization: low-temperature, long-time, or vat pasteurization; and high-temperature short-time, or flash pasteurization, which is the most common method used in the US today,\u00a0according to\u00a0the International Dairy Foods Association. Heating the milk to 63 degrees Celsius, or 145 degrees Fahrenheit, for intervals between 5 and 30 minutes \u2014 the vat pasteurization method \u2014 reduced the virus to undetectable levels. Heating the milk to 72 degrees Celsius, or 181 degrees Fahrenheit, for 15 or 20 seconds \u2014 conditions that approximated flash pasteurization \u2014 greatly reduced levels of the virus in the milk, but it didn\u2019t inactivate it completely. Milk samples heated for 15 or 20 seconds were still able to infect incubated chicken eggs, a test the US Food and Drug Administration has called the gold-standard for determining whether viruses remain infectious in milk. \u201cBut, we emphasize that the conditions used in our laboratory study are not identical to the large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,\u201d senior study author Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist who specializes in the study of flu and Ebola, said in an email. That\u2019s a good reason not to panic over the study findings, said Lakdawala. Lakdawala said that commercial flash pasteurization involves a preheating step, which wasn\u2019t done here.\u00a0It also involves homogenization, a process that emulsifies the fat globules in milk so the cream won\u2019t separate.\u00a0Both of those steps would probably make it harder for the virus to survive, but she adds that the results of this study suggest full process of commercial flash pasteurization should be done \u201cwith all the steps in place.\u201d Recent tests of\u00a0297 dairy products\u00a0purchased at retail stores by the FDA found traces\u00a0of\u00a0genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 of 5 milk samples, and further testing confirmed the viral fragments were inert and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to the general public is low, but people\u00a0should not eat or drink\u00a0raw milk or products made from it. To date, H5N1 influenza has been found in\u00a058 dairy herds in nine states.\u00a0 Michigan has now surpassed Texas as the state with the greatest number of infected herds. To test whether the raw milk could infect other animals, researchers also squirted\u00a0some of the milk\u00a0into the mouths of mice.\u00a0 The animals showed signs of illness the next day. On day four, the mice hadn\u2019t died of their infections, but they were euthanized so that researchers could see what parts of their bodies had become infected. Scientists found the virus all over their bodies, with high viral loads in the lungs and respiratory tract.\u00a0 They also found virus in the mammary glands of the mice, even though they weren\u2019t producing milk at the time. Taken together, their findings confirm that raw milk can infect susceptible animals, the researchers said\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and that could also indicate a risk to humans. In a recent news briefing, officials with the US Department of Agriculture said that to their knowledge, none of the raw milk from farms known to have H5N1 infections was being sold to consumers. Not all dairy farms are testing their cows, however, and some of the infected cows in the current outbreak have not shown any symptoms. \u201cRaw milk is unsafe at any speed, and the notion that you could protect yourself against H5 infection by consuming it is erroneous. There are there are much safer ways to protect oneself namely avoiding raw milk,\u201d CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah said in a briefing. Asked if the\u00a0raw\u00a0milk\u00a0in the new experiments\u00a0looked different than normal, Kawaoka said the researchers only got a small number of samples but some had more debris than milk from healthy cows. That would get filtered out prior to sale, he said.\u00a0Some of the milk looked yellow-ish, but he points out that milk from healthy and infected cows would likely be mixed together in a big vat, making it look normal \u2014 and\u00a0impossible to tell whether milk is safe to drink just by looking at it. \u201cThis is good quality research with conclusions backed up by solid data,\u201d said Dr. Ruth Harvey, deputy director of the Worldwide Influenza Center at the Francis Crick Institute in London, in a comment on the study given to the nonprofit Science Media Centre. \u201cThe limitations of the experimental set-up for the heat inactivation part of the research are clearly stated: that the conditions used are not identical to large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThe findings that viable virus was found in the milk samples after 5 weeks of storage at (4 degrees Celsius), and that mice could be infected through drinking milk containing the virus, back up the conclusions that drinking raw milk could pose a risk,\u201d Harvey added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/new-experiments-milk-h5n1-infected-cows-raise-questions-flash-pasteurization/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_health_happiness-rewire-brain-gupta-podcast-wellness", "text": "Happiness is an idea that has been woven into the fabric of humanity, going back to ancient civilizations. Roughly 250 years ago, it made its way into this country\u2019s Declaration of Independence as an unalienable right: \u201cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Although we\u2019ve grappled with it for millennia, the concept of happiness and how to attain it remains pretty elusive. Some might see it as having a sense of general well-being. For others, it might be feeling a spark of unadulterated joy. Yet others might find happiness chasing a dream and reaching it. It might be some combination of these \u2013 or something else entirely. I like to think of myself as a pretty happy guy. I have three wonderful teenage daughters and a wife, Rebecca, with whom I just celebrated a 20th anniversary; I\u2019m close to my parents, my \u201cbaby\u201d brother and his family. I have moments of complete contentment and a career that feels meaningful to me as a practicing neurosurgeon and CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent. But I also realize it\u2019s not that simple. There are other layers to happiness and a lot of nuance within those layers. The pursuit of happiness A challenging question is, what are the best ways to pursue happiness? Are we born with a stable, set level, or is it something we can cultivate, increase and strengthen? If it\u2019s the latter, how can we successfully go about it? Even though \u201cthe pursuit of Happiness\u201d is built into the country\u2019s founding, it seems that many Americans are just not that good at it. In the most recent World Happiness Report, the United States dropped to No. 23 (from No. 15 the previous year), marking the first time in the report\u2019s 12-year history that the US was not in the top 20 happiest countries. A separate Gallup poll, also from 2024, found that less than half (47%) of Americans are \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their personal lives. It\u2019s not just Americans. As it turns out, humans as a species may not excel at happiness. This may surprise you, but happiness is not necessarily something that we are genetically primed to attain. We have to really work at it. \u201cIf anything, natural selection kind of doesn\u2019t really care about our happiness that much. I mean, natural selection\u2019s job is just to keep us alive and keep us around to reproduce. And I think it does that not by making us feel these moments of contentment but maybe just the opposite,\u201d cognitive scientist Dr. Laurie Santos told me recently. \u201cIt does that by building in a negativity bias. So we\u2019re just a little bit worried that there could be a tiger around the corner, that we could get shunned at work. And we\u2019re kind of constantly on the alert for that,\u201d she said. Santos, who has a doctorate in psychology, is at Yale University, where she teaches Psychology and the Good Life, the most popular course in the university\u2019s history, and is the host of \u201cThe Happiness Lab\u201d podcast. She is also the first guest on the 10th season of my podcast, \u201cChasing Life,\u201d which kicked off this week. During this season, I talk to experts across a variety of disciplines about the scientific underpinnings of happiness \u2014 defining it, attaining it, maintaining it and increasing it \u2014 and its effects on our minds and bodies. Listen to more of my conversation with Santos here. I\u2019m happy but \u2018constructively dissatisfied\u2019 The fact that we haven\u2019t evolved to prioritize happiness may be why, despite being a generally happy person, I am also \u201cconstructively dissatisfied.\u201d It\u2019s a term I came up with on the fly while talking to Santos. And here, I\u2019m making a distinction between happiness and satisfaction. I\u2019m still happy overall, but I think if I ever became satisfied, that might erode my happiness. That\u2019s because, in my mind, satisfaction leads to complacency, which leads to stagnation. So, I seemingly have one of those personalities that needs \u2013 maybe even thrives on \u2013 dissatisfaction; being satisfied or complacent dampens my energy and enthusiasm. The times when I feel happiest are when my constructive dissatisfaction propels me into motion, contributing to the betterment of a situation, whether it\u2019s removing a brain tumor, finishing a documentary, working in my garden or even making dinner with my family. Another guest this season of the podcast, health psychologist and author Kelly McGonigal, said the term made perfect sense to her. \u201cBecause dissatisfaction often is the soil in which growth and positive change happens,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd dissatisfaction doesn\u2019t actually have to be a lack of appreciation or gratitude. If you can envision a better future for yourself or others, it requires feeling a gap between how things are and how things could be.\u201d The \u201cconstructive\u201d modifier before \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d is really important to me because I don\u2019t want to just wallow in dissatisfaction; I want it to be useful. And as long as I don\u2019t let the dissatisfaction grow too much, where it overpowers my emotional well-being, it works for me. But I have to admit, it can sometimes be a source of tension and a regular struggle. \u201cIt strikes me that you\u2019ve kind of gotten something out of the journey, gotten something out of that struggle,\u201d Santos told me. But she also warned about going overboard. \u201cWe can push ourselves and engage in challenges; those can be some of the happiest, most flow-inducing moments of our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need to make sure we\u2019re doing that in balance.\u201d She said that if we lose sleep, ignore friendships and make ourselves miserable, \u201cmaybe think about pushing yourself in a different way.\u201d Or find a way to mitigate the negative feelings. \u201cThe antidote to that would be to think what are ways that I could be on that important, purposeful journey but also bring a few more moments of true happiness into my life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, maybe I need a little bit more laughter or some breaks, or I need to engage in that purposeful pursuit with a bit more social connection, or something like that.\u201d Tried and true strategies It is true, according to Santos, that most of us have a set point of happiness. Mine is probably a little lower than my brother\u2019s, for example; he is more outgoing and outwardly cheerful, even though we have very similar nature and nurture. Winning the lottery may raise your level of happiness for a while, and a tragedy may lower it, but most people will eventually settle back to their baseline after some time. Santos believes, however, that with some diligent and intentional practice, you can start to turn up your thermostat of happiness. It is what she teaches her students, as well. For example, she not only lectures her students about the behavior and mindset shifts that are known to nudge up happiness, she makes her students practice them as homework. Instead of course requirements, she calls them course rewirements, because performing them on a regular basis actually can rewire you. Among the low-hanging fruit, Santos recommends making sure you\u2019re paying attention to healthy practices, like getting enough sleep and exercise and eating right. Also on the list: become a bit more \u201cother\u201d-oriented and try to develop an attitude of both gratitude and compassion outside yourself and internally, as well. But my favorite bit of advice is to cultivate and nurture your social connections. \u201cEvery available study of happy people suggests that happy people are more social,\u201d Santos said. And I would gather the opposite is also true: Social people are happier. \u201cSo we just need to make time for our friends and family members and loved ones.\u201d She\u2019s not the only one to preach this. Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist who runs the Harvard Study of Adult Development \u2014 the longest study of adult life, running 85-plus years and counting \u2014 said the secret of both happiness and health boils down to good relationships. How could that be? According to Waldinger, warm relationships (even just one) generally keep people\u2019s bodies stronger and brains sharper, most likely because they help buffer us against the vicissitudes of life. This reduces our exposure to circulating stress hormones (which, when they are constantly high, wreak havoc on the body and mind) as well as dials down resulting inflammation, thought to be at the root of many chronic modern diseases. So \u2014 again, for most of us \u2014 the diseases of aging are mitigated, in part, by our happiness. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to become an extrovert or the life of a party, and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend hour upon hour enduring superficial banter. But, Waldinger said, you should put some effort into consistently nurturing your relationships. To do that, he recommends a few things: Be proactive and reach out to friends; establish routines like a weekly phone call; liven up longstanding relationships by doing new things; make new friends by connecting around shared interests; and get more comfortable striking up conversations with strangers. The recipe is going to vary from person to person and depend on what amount of social interaction feels right for you. Having meaningful relationships really resonates with me. I know from my own life too that good, strong connections to family and friends are really important. And they are what ultimately make me happiest of all. Listen to the full episode with happiness professor Laurie Santos here, and join us next week on the podcast when we explore the surprising link between happiness and anxiety. Find out why it\u2019s a misunderstood emotion.

{"id": "2013_08_23_health_anthrax-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at the 2001 anthrax attacks, also referred to as Amerithrax. Facts about anthrax There are four types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin), inhalation (through the lungs; the most deadly), gastrointestinal (through digestion) and injection anthrax. Injection anthrax is common in heroin-injecting users in northern Europe. This has never been reported in the United States. Anthrax can be contracted by handling products from infected animals or by breathing in anthrax spores and by eating undercooked meat from infected animals.  It has been blamed for several plagues over the ages that killed both humans and livestock. It emerged in World War I as a biological weapon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizes anthrax as a Category A agent: one that poses the greatest possible threat for a negative impact on public health; one that may spread across a large area or need public awareness and requires planning to protect the public\u2019s health. Read more: America\u2019s long and frightening history of attacks by mail Amerithrax Five people died and 17 people were sickened during anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001; outbreak is often referred to as Amerithrax.  Anthrax was sent via anonymous letters to news agencies in Florida and New York and a congressional office building in Washington, DC. Of the five victims who died of inhalation anthrax, two were postal workers. The other three victims were an elderly woman from rural Connecticut, a Manhattan hospital worker from the Bronx and an employee at a Florida tabloid magazine who may have contracted anthrax through cross-contamination. The letters were sent to NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, Sen. Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Sen. Patrick Leahy, and the New York Post offices. The letters were postmarked Trenton, New Jersey. No arrests were made in the attacks.

{"id": "2024_05_28_health_peanut-allergy-infants-adolescents-wellness", "text": "Reassuring new evidence suggests that feeding children smooth peanut butter during infancy and early childhood can help reduce their risk of developing a peanut allergy even years later. Compared with avoiding peanuts, starting peanut consumption in infancy \u2013 as early as around 4 months of age, as a soft pureed paste, for instance \u2013 and continuing regularly to around 5 years old was associated with a 71% reduced rate of peanut allergy among adolescents in the United Kingdom, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal NEJM Evidence. \u201cI was not entirely surprised because infants in Israel are exposed to peanuts very early and allergy does not appear to emerge in adolescence or adults. This suggests the protection is long-term,\u201d Gideon Lack, professor of pediatric allergy at King\u2019s College London and an author of the study, said in an email. \u201cPeanut allergy develops very early in most children between six and 12 months of life. If you want to prevent a disease this needs to be done before the disease develops,\u201d Lack said of exposing children to peanuts. \u201cThis biological\u00a0phenomenon is based on an immunological principle known as oral tolerance induction. We have known for many decades that young mice or other experimental animals who are fed foods such as egg or milk or peanut cannot develop these allergies later.\u201d Starting in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended delaying the introduction of peanuts until 3 years, but it ended that recommendation in 2008. About a decade later, in 2019, the AAP updated its guidance to say that delaying the introduction of allergenic foods doesn\u2019t prevent disease and that \u201cthere is now evidence that early introduction of peanuts may prevent peanut allergy.\u201d Food allergies have become a growing public health concern in the United States, and peanut allergy is estimated to affect about 2% of children in the United States, or nearly 1.5 million people younger than 18. Peanuts are among the food types that can cause the most serious allergic reactions, including the risk of the life-threatening reaction anaphylaxis. \u201cToday\u2019s findings should reinforce parents\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 confidence that feeding their young children peanut products beginning in infancy according to established guidelines can provide lasting protection from peanut allergy,\u201d Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a news release Tuesday. \u201cIf widely implemented, this safe, simple strategy could prevent tens of thousands of cases of peanut allergy among the 3.6 million children born in the United States each year.\u201d The new study, called the LEAP-Trio trial, included data on children in the United Kingdom who participated as babies in a peanut allergy study called the LEAP trial. That previous study included infants with eczema and egg allergy who were followed through age 5, and it found that at that age, the prevalence of peanut allergy was about 17% in the group of children who avoided peanuts, compared with about 3% in the group that ate peanut products, representing an 81% relative reduction in peanut allergy. The LEAP-Trio trial set out to examine whether that reduced risk of peanut allergy would last into adolescence. About 500 children were assessed again for the LEAP-Trio trial, which looked at the rate of peanut allergy at around age 12. At that age, peanut allergy remained \u201csignificantly more prevalent\u201d among the children who originally avoided peanuts, with about 15% having a peanut allergy. Among those who originally consumed peanuts, about 4% had a peanut allergy, the researchers found. They wrote that represents \u201ca 71% reduction in the prevalence of peanut allergy at the LEAP-Trio time point.\u201d But overall, when children started to consume peanuts in infancy and continued to around age 5, this appeared to provide \u201clasting tolerance\u201d to peanuts into adolescence, according to the researchers, based in the United Kingdom and the United States. The new findings are \u201ca great reassurance\u201d that not only did early introduction of peanuts reduce peanut allergies from developing, but the protection lasted until adolescence even when children stopped eating peanuts consistently after age 5, Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist and immunologist at NYU Langone in New York and a spokesperson for the\u00a0Allergy & Asthma Network, who was not involved in the new research, said in an email Tuesday. \u201cSo ideally if there\u2019s no other risk factors we should continue to introduce these allergens early\u00a0at 4-6\u00a0months and continue them consistently until age 5 but after that we don\u2019t need to be as consistent,\u201d Parikh said. She added that introducing peanuts for children at low risk for allergies can be done around 4 to 6 months old under the guidance of a pediatrician, but children with severe eczema and egg allergy should see an allergist before early introduction. \u201cSince babies cannot have solids yet it is recommended for it to be a thin consistency similar to breast milk or formula and can be mixed into it to avoid any choking and can start with a small amount and slowly increase as tolerated every 3-4 days,\u201d Parikh said. When introducing peanuts into an infant\u2019s diet, it\u2019s recommended to use smooth peanut butter mixed into a puree and avoid chunks of peanuts that could pose choking hazards. \u201cIt can generally be said \u2018the sooner the better\u2019 for parents, especially in babies with eczema,\u201d Lack said, adding that babies with eczema are at much higher risk of developing food allergies and develop these allergies much earlier in the first year of life. \u201cHowever, the child needs to be developmentally and neurologically ready to eat solid foods and be able to coordinate chewing and swallowing without a risk of choking. Most babies will be able to start weaning between four and six months of age but each baby is an individual and needs to be assessed individually,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the foods\u00a0should be given as a soft puree to facilitate swallowing and reduce the risk of choking.\u00a0We do not recommend introducing solids before three months of age.\u201d The finding that early peanut introduction induces tolerance has been supported by previous studies too, but introducing your child to peanuts should be a shared decision with your pediatrician, according to Dr. Daniel DiGiacomo, a pediatric immunologist at K. Hovnanian Children\u2019s Hospital at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cThe current expert opinion is to utilize a shared-decision making approach for food introduction once the infant is developmentally ready, and has tolerated a couple of other complementary foods without issue,\u201d DiGiacomo said in an email Tuesday. \u201cI usually start off slowly introducing a pea sized amount, doubling the amount every day until you get to an age appropriate serving size (or at least 2 teaspoons). Then continue this in the diet several times per week,\u201d he said. \u201cI typically have the family mix the nut butter in a tolerated puree to the correct consistency, they can also dissolve peanut puffs (if doing peanut) in water, or make a peanut sauce out of powdered peanut butter or peanut flour. Again, we review the proper consistency and start slow with instructions to stop and contact your allergist if there are any concerns.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/health/peanut-allergy-infants-adolescents-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_fish-oil-supplement-dangers-study-wellness", "text": "As an excellent source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, daily fish oil supplements are a popular way to keep the risk of cardiovascular disease at bay. About 20% of adults older than age 60 in the United States frequently use these products with the aim of supporting heart health. However, a new study finds regular use of fish oil supplements may increase, not reduce, the risk of first-time stroke and atrial fibrillation among people in good cardiovascular health. Atrial fibrillation, also called AFib or AF, is a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat,\u00a0that people often describe as a flutter or pounding in their chests. \u201cI can see the headline for this study as \u2018Fish oil supplements: Is it time to dump them or not?\u2019\u201d said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cI say that because over-the-counter fish oil is very seldom recommended, is in none of the guidelines from professional medical societies, and yet that\u2019s what most people take,\u201d said Freeman, who was not involved in the study. Fish oil only helped people with existing heart disease The study analyzed data on over 415,000 people ages 40 to 69 participating in the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study of the health of people in the United Kingdom. Nearly one-third of those people, who were followed for an average of 12 years, said they regularly used fish oil supplements. For people without heart issues, regular use of fish oil supplements was associated with a 13% higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation and a 5% heightened risk of having a stroke, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Medicine. Over-the-counter fish oil suffers from a lack of purity and consistency, as well as the potential contaminants and heavy metals such as mercury that come with fish, Freeman said. \u201cIn addition, studies over the last 10 years have not been very positive for over-the-counter fish oil,\u201d he added. \u201cFish oil was either having no benefit or in some cases it may harm, such as with stroke and AFib. So that\u2019s not new.\u201d In fact, the new study found that people with existing heart disease at the beginning of the research had a 15% lower risk of progressing from atrial fibrillation to a heart attack and a 9% lower risk of progressing from heart failure to death when they regularly used fish oil. Instead, prescription versions of fish oil, such as Vascepa and Lovaza, are used to counter such risk factors such as high triglycerides, a type of blood fat, in people with cardiovascular disease risk, Freeman said. \u201cBut even in the prescription strength, highly purified versions of fish oil, the risk for AFib and sometimes stroke has also been present and doctors are cautious about that,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cOverall, I would say that the days where people just go to the store and buy buckets of fish oil pills to keep them well should be over, but fish oil may still have a role in people who are already sick.\u201d Try to use food sources for omega-3s When it comes to fish oil, \u201cthe devil is in the details,\u201d said Alzheimer\u2019s preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. He was not involved in the study. \u201cFirst, we recommend testing for omega-3 fatty acid levels \u2014 there are finger-prick tests you can buy online which are accurate \u2014 and then you should continue to test. You don\u2019t want to take fish oil if you don\u2019t need it,\u201d he said. Isaacson recommends trying to get your omega-3 fatty acids from food sources and says sardines and wild-caught salmon are the best sources, as they are high in these healthy unsaturated fats and lower in mercury. Farm-raised salmon is not the best choice, he said, due to impurities in the water in which they are raised. Lake trout, mackerel, herring and albacore tuna are also good sources, he said. However, due to the mercury levels in large fish such as tuna, he recommends consumption of albacore tuna should be kept to twice a week. Algae and seaweed are decent nonfish sources of omega 3s as well. Chia seeds, edamame (soy beans), flaxseed, hempseeds and walnuts are other plant-based options that are high in omega-3s. But the fatty acids are a different form than those found in fish.  Studies have found plant-based omega-3s may be harder to metabolize in people with higher levels of omega-6s, another kind of unsaturated fats that\u2019s found primarily in vegetable oils. If supplements are needed Prescription omega-3 fatty acids are superior to over-the counter options, experts say, due to their pureness and quality. But prescribed supplements can be expensive. For people who decide they want to purchase over-the-counter omega-3s, Isaacson provides these tips to his patients. First, freshness of the fish oil is key, he said, adding that \u201cbuying from an online or retail superstore, such as Amazon or Costco, isn\u2019t the best idea.\u201d \u201cWe recommend buying it from only a handful of reputable companies, and from their specific website,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cThe difference in quality between fish oil stored in a hot warehouse that\u2019s close to expiration and fish oil that\u2019s recently been produced, sent directly from the company, and kept in the home refrigerator is night and day.\u201d The US Food and Drug Administration doesn\u2019t monitor the supplement industry to assure each vitamin or mineral actually contains what it says on the label, nor does the federal agency test to see whether the ingredients are contaminated with bacteria, heavy metals, pesticides, plastic residues and other impurities. However, there are some companies that have stepped into that role by testing various supplements and even some pharmaceuticals, so look for their labels on the supplements before purchase. The nonprofit organization US Pharmacopeia, or USP, sets the most widely accepted standards for supplements, experts say, but ConsumerLab.com and NSF International also do third-party testing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/fish-oil-supplement-dangers-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_weekly-insulin-fda-committee", "text": "Most types of insulin therapy, an important part of diabetes treatment for many people, are given as daily injections to help manage blood sugar levels. Now, the maker of a once-weekly insulin injection is seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but a committee of agency advisers is divided on whether the benefits of the product may outweigh the risks. In a meeting Friday, the FDA\u2019s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee weighed whether the benefits of Novo Nordisk\u2019s weekly product, called insulin icodec, outweigh its risks. If the agency signs off, the treatment will be the first weekly insulin available in the United States. The committee\u2019s discussions focused on the safety and efficacy of insulin icodec, specifically in people with type 1 diabetes. The advisers were asked to answer a question of, based on the available data, whether Novo Nordisk has demonstrated that the benefits of insulin icodec outweigh its risks for improving glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Four voted yes. Seven voted no. The advisory committee\u2019s discussions and voting outcomes will be shared with the FDA, which takes into consideration but does not have to follow the committee\u2019s advice when deciding whether to approve the treatment. An analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials found that once-weekly insulin icodec was better at reducing high blood glucose levels in comparison with the once-daily therapy insulin degludec, but insulin icodec was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia, also known as low blood glucose, which can lead to a loss of consciousness or seizures. \u201cInsulin icodec was associated with 50 to 80% more clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia compared to insulin degludec at Week 52, depending on the method of analysis,\u201d the committee\u2019s meeting materials say. If the product is approved by the FDA, some panel members said, there should be guidance on ways to mitigate and treat the risk of hypoglycemia. Committee member Dr. Barbara Onumah, a endocrinology in Largo, Maryland, voted yes on the benefits of insulin icodec outweighing its risks. \u201cThis would add a tool to the toolbox for clinicians,\u201d Onumah said. \u201cIt will not be beneficial for every person, but it might be useful for some persons,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a few risk mitigation things that need to be ironed out clearly so that for the general provider or practitioner who would be writing this prescription, should it be approved, will be doing it correctly and safely \u2013 because safety would be very important.\u201d Committee member Dr. Matthew Drake, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, voted no. Drake said his rationale was based on comparing insulin icodec with the current gold standard of insulin degludec, \u201cwhich has a good safety profile in my experience,\u201d he said. Committee member Erica Brittain also voted no but called it a hard decision. \u201cI agree that there\u2019s theoretical benefits, and anyone could understand wanting to have fewer injections, and that\u2019s very important,\u201d said Brittain, a biostatistician at the National Institutes of Health. \u201cUnfortunately, within the trial data, we don\u2019t see the benefit of better glycemic control, which I think was promised in terms of adherence. I understand that that would be hard to show in this clinical trial population, but things kind of go the other way,\u201d she said. The committee also discussed how a weekly insulin injection might be an easier treatment regimen to follow than daily injections. Studies suggest that about 53% of adults with type 1 diabetes adhere to existing insulin therapy schedules, \u201cwith approximately 22% of patients missing at least one basal insulin dose over any 14-day period,\u201d according to the FDA advisory committee\u2019s meeting materials. \u201cNonadherence to insulin therapy is a precipitating factor for diabetic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.\u201d Novo Nordisk isn\u2019t the only company developing a weekly insulin therapy for diabetes patients. Last week, Eli Lilly announced that its once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa was \u201cequally safe and effective\u201d in Phase 3 trials involving adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin for the first time and those who require multiple daily insulin injections. However, Lilly has not yet requested FDA approval.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/weekly-insulin-fda-committee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_06_08_health_pets-air-quality-wildfire-smoke-safety-wellness-climate", "text": "More than 100 fires are burning across Canada, with some wildfires forcing evacuations and affecting air quality in Canada and the northern tier of the United States \u2014 and experts have noted that pets could be at risk, too. Dr. Gabrielle Fadl of the Bond Vet Clinic in New York City told CNN last year that her practice has had a \u201csignificant influx of calls\u201d from concerned clients seeking guidance on how to protect their animals from the poor air quality outside. It also received a few calls from patients, particularly pregnant and older people, requesting to reschedule appointments. \u201cExposure to polluted air can have a profound impact on our pets\u2019 health, leading to respiratory issues, allergies, and even exacerbating existing conditions such as asthma,\u201d Fadl said. To ensure pets\u2019 well-being, Fadl advised considering the following precautions. Limit outdoor activities Reduce the time your pets spend outdoors as much as possible, especially during periods of unhealthy air quality. Doing so can help minimize their exposure to harmful pollutants and allergens, Fadl said. You also shouldn\u2019t run with your dog outdoors, said Dr. Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the department of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIf you can, just walk a little bit more slowly so you\u2019re not breathing as deeply,\u201d he added. \u201cThat can help.\u201d Avoiding strenuous activity is important for pets as well since they can\u2019t breathe as deeply as humans, said Dr. Jessica Bell, an assistant professor in the college of veterinary medicine at Washington State University. Animals also can experience difficulty breathing, asthma-like symptoms and bronchitis. If you must take pets outside, do so when air quality is best, Bell said. \u201cThat might be early in the morning before the air quality changes with settling of moisture.\u201d New York City\u2019s Emergency Management advised wiping your pet\u2019s muzzle, feet and coat with a damp cloth after being outside. Create a safe environment indoors Even pets kept indoors can be affected by the air quality outside, Bell said, so make sure you have proper ventilation in your home. Keep the windows closed to prevent outdoor pollutants, such as fine particulate matter, from entering. These particles are the tiniest, yet most dangerous, of pollutants, and have been linked to health problems such as heart disease, asthma and other respiratory illnesses. \u201cA major difference between wildfires and, for example, a fire that you might burn in a backyard bonfire is that often there are synthetic materials being burned that produce compounds that can be dangerous like hydrogen cyanide,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Kornreich, director of the Cornell Feline Health Center in Ithaca, New York. \u201cCarbon monoxide can also get into the bloodstream, and those two interfere with the delivery of oxygen to organs,\u201d Kornreich added. \u201cIn some cases, these fires can also produce chemical irritants. So the chemicals can actually trigger inflammation in the airways.\u201d Additionally, use air purifiers or filters to improve air quality inside. When keeping pets indoors, activities for them can be important, Bell said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of puzzle games that dogs and cats can do,\u201d she said. \u201cFill the puzzles (with) their treats or their dog food and hide it in the house. They have to hunt for them or have to roll them around or they knock all the kibbles out.\u201d Also ensure pets have access to clean water both indoors and outdoors so it\u2019s not tainted with smoke, Bell added. Monitor animals\u2019 symptoms Be on the lookout for any signs of respiratory distress or discomfort in your pets such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing or trouble breathing. Pay attention to any changes to their normal behavior, such as wanting to play fetch for 10 minutes instead of an hour as usual, Bell said. \u201cThat decrease in activity \u2014 we just have to pay attention to (it) and not force them to be active when their body says not to be.\u201d Indoor cats should be monitored for these same symptoms, she added. \u201cIf you notice any concerning symptoms, seek prompt veterinary care,\u201d Fadl said. Consult with a veterinarian Reach out to a trusted veterinarian for expert guidance catered to your pet\u2019s needs.

{"id": "2024_05_30_health_bird-flu-michigan-third-human-case", "text": "A\u00a0third person in the US\u00a0has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle, the\u00a0Michigan Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0said Thursday.\u00a0This is the second human case reported in the state and the fourth ever in the US. This time, in addition to some of the eye symptoms seen with previous H5N1 cases, the farmworker\u00a0reported a cough and other respiratory symptoms\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0more typical of human influenza infections, the health department said. \u201cThis individual had respiratory symptoms, including a cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes,\u201d Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday. \u201cWhat the respiratory symptoms tell us, more than anything, is that this virus, like many viruses, can present in more than one way, and for that reason, we should remain alert, not be alarmed,\u201d he added. Experts said that the addition of respiratory symptoms doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the virus has become more dangerous or that it may transmit more easily from person to person.\u00a0Instead, they say, the person probably developed lung symptoms because of the route of infection, perhaps by breathing in infectious aerosols in the milking parlor instead of rubbing their eyes with contaminated hands. \u201cWith the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye. With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,\u201d Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief\u00a0medical\u00a0executive for Michigan, said in a news release. \u201cNeither individual was wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important toolin preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.\u201d About 220 people are being monitored in Michigan because of potential exposure to the virus, Shah said. Michigan, the state with the highest number of dairy herds reported to be infected, is also beginning to conduct blood testing to see how many workers may have antibodies to the H5N1 virus, which would reflect past infections or exposures. The CDC agreed that the risk to the general public remains low. But this case highlights the elevated risk to those who work with infected animals. The CDC has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. \u201cPreviously, we focused on the importance of eye protection, given the conjunctivitis in the first two cases, but this case also underscores the importance of barrier protection, things like masks and other forms of protection for dairy workers, particularly those who are working with affected cows,\u201d Shah said. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. This is the third human infection known to be caused by this highly pathogenic form of avian influenza that\u2019s currently infecting dairy cattle in the US. None of the three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission. The other two cases involved eye infections, or conjunctivitis. The most recent worker had some mild eye symptoms but was not diagnosed with conjunctivitis. The person had direct contact with infected cattle\u00a0and notified local health officials that they were feeling sick.\u00a0Their symptoms are described as mild. The patient has been given the antiviral medication oseltamivir, the same active ingredient as Tamiflu, and they are isolating at home. Their family members have not developed symptoms, but they have also been offered antiviral medication as a precaution. None of the other workers at the dairy farm has gotten sick, and they are being monitored, the CDC said. \u201cGiven the high magnitude of interactions between people and dairy cows as well as with contaminated milking equipment, it is unsurprising that there are more human infections,\u201d said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University who is studying how the virus is transmitting in dairy barns. \u201cEvery time the virus is able to replicate in a person, there is the potential for the virus to adapt to humans and gain molecular features for replication in the respiratory tract and to spread person-to-person,\u201d Lakdawala said. Flu viruses are classified by two of the proteins that sit on their outer envelopes: H, or hemagglutinin, proteins and N, neuraminidase, proteins. CDC testing has confirmed that this third person carries a flu virus with an H5 protein, and the agency will do further sequencing to determine whether the N portion of the virus is N1, as is suspected. It expects to have those results in the next few days. The CDC confirmed Wednesday night that the person had an H5 influenza infection and forwarded the results to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that it was moving forward with a plan to repackage 4.8 million doses of a vaccine against H5N1 that is stored in bulk form in the Strategic National Stockpile. The bulk supplies would be put into multidose vials so they could be distributed and administered more easily. Officials said Thursday that before the vaccine would be given, it would need to go through certain regulatory steps. They also said there\u2019s not currently a plan to offer or recommend the doses to any specific  group of people. The fill-and-finish process to repackage the vaccines will take at least a couple of months, officials said in the news briefing. In the meantime, Michigan\u2019s health department is advising people working on poultry or dairy farms to get a seasonal flu vaccine. \u201cIt will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu viruses,\u201d the department said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/bird-flu-michigan-third-human-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_world_boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn", "text": "A Saturday launch for the highly anticipated crewed maiden voyage of Boeing\u2019s Starliner is off the table \u2014 and NASA has announced a new target date. Starliner\u2019s first flight carrying astronauts is now expected to lift off no earlier than June 1 at 12:25 p.m. ET, with several backup opportunities in the days following, according to a statement from NASA late Wednesday. \u201cMission managers from NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) continue to evaluate a path forward toward launching the agency\u2019s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station,\u201d the space agency said in the statement. The update comes after several previous delays this month, and a week after Starliner mission teams\u00a0reported a small helium leak\u00a0in the service module of the spacecraft. They traced the leak to a part called a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. Last week, NASA announced that teams were aiming to launch no earlier than May 25, saying the additional time before launch would give specialists more time to evaluate the issue. The agency said tests have found that the leak doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the mission. However, while studying the leak, mission teams also spotted a \u201cdesign vulnerability\u201d in the propulsion system \u2014 essentially identifying a remote scenario in which certain thrusters might fail as the vehicle was leaving Earth\u2019s orbit, without a backup method of getting home safely. NASA and Boeing have since worked with the vendor of the thruster to come up with a backup way to perform the deorbit burn, should that situation arise, said Steve Stich, manager of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, in a Friday news conference. \u201cWe have restored that redundancy for the backup capability in a very remote set of failures for the direct burn,\u201d Stich said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a (Delta-Agency\u00a0Flight\u00a0Test\u00a0Readiness Review) on May 29 to review both the leak and the changes to the way we would execute a deorbit burn in a remote set of failures.\u201d This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The historic crewed flight was about two hours from liftoff on May 6 when it was scrubbed due to\u00a0an issue with the a valve\u00a0on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families, Boeing said last week. They remain in pre-flight quarantine and continue to practice in Starliner simulators, the space agency said.  Boeing\u2019s historic goals The Crew Flight Test is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand US options for ferrying astronauts to the space station. A rocky start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. Williams and Wilmore were already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule May 6 when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the latest issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket caused\u00a0further delay. \u201cThere has been a great deal of exceptional analysis and testing over the last two weeks by the joint NASA, Boeing, and ULA teams to replace the Centaur Self Regulating Valve and troubleshoot the Starliner Service Module helium manifold leak,\u201d\u00a0Stich said. \u201cIt has been important that we take our time to understand all the complexities of each issue including the redundant capabilities of the Starliner propulsion system and any implications to our Interim Human Rating Certification,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will launch Butch and Suni on this test mission after the entire community has reviewed the teams progress and flight rationale at the upcoming Delta Agency Flight Test Readiness Review.\u201d If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit, as Starliner begins firing its own engines. The vehicle will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The history-making crew will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness", "text": "A new report details the role social media plays in the lives of young people, and how they manage the various pros and cons \u2014 including in the context of being a person of color or LGBTQ+, or having depression. Those benefits and drawbacks include valuing online platforms for social connection, self-expression and information, while also feeling the brunt of social media\u2019s effects on their attention span, confidence and contentedness, according to the report released Tuesday by Common Sense Media and Hopelab, a social innovation lab and impact investor aiming to support the well-being of young people. READ MORE: How to know if you have \u2018phone addiction\u2019 \u2014 and 12 ways to address it \u201cMost conversations and headlines surrounding social media and youth mental (health) focus solely on the harms, portraying young people as passive consumers. This research shows that it\u2019s much more complex,\u201d said Amy Green, head of research at Hopelab, in a news release. \u201cIf we truly want to improve the well-being of young people, we need to listen to their experiences and ensure that we do not inadvertently remove access to crucial positive benefits.\u201d Also driving the research is the national youth mental health crisis, the authors said, marked by increasing rates of mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and antidepressant medications prescribed to youth. In conversations about these phenomena, social media has consistently been at the center, though mental health issues can have multiple contributing factors.\u00a0 Conducted by the NORC \u2014 previously called the National Opinion Research Center \u2014 at the University of Chicago, the research includes 1,274 teens (ages 14 to 17) and young adults (ages 18 to 22) recruited online between October and November 2023. The young people \u201cprovided direction and input regarding survey content\u201d and participated in focus groups and interviews to help the research team prioritize and interpret results, according to a news release. The report is the third in a series tracking the influence of social media on well-being among youth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The researchers found the rate of depressive symptoms among youth is about 10% down from pandemic highs but is still high and comparable to the elevated levels of 2018. Nearly half of young people reported experiencing any severity of depression, and nearly a third (28%) said they had moderate to severe symptoms. Additionally, about half of LGBTQ+ youth reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, compared to nearly one-quarter of their non-LGBTQ+ peers. Those with depression were more susceptible to social comparison and pressure to show their best selves on social media. But they were also more likely to find resources to support their well-being and curate their feeds for this purpose \u2014 done by selecting a \u201cnot interested\u201d button on content they don\u2019t like, flagging inappropriate or offensive content, or blocking someone whose content bothered them. These youth also positively curated feeds by \u201cliking\u201d and spending more time on content they did enjoy, since many social media algorithms work by giving you more content based on your level of engagement with certain topics. This was especially important for LGBTQ+ youth who, along with Black and Latinx young people, faced more exposure to harassment and stress online. \u201cIn focus groups, Black youth told us their experiences with in-person harassment lowered their tolerance for similar behavior on social media, and meant they were more willing to give up the benefits to protect themselves from hateful comments,\u201d said lead researcher Amanda Lenhart, head of research at Common Sense Media, via email. The findings confirm what many researchers have seen scientifically and anecdotally, said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association, via email. Prinstein wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Social media and mental health Many participants also revealed the positives they gain from social media, citing online platforms as a place to seek support and advice; decompress; connect with loved ones and others who share their experiences, interests or identities; stay informed; and keep up with their favorite influencers or content creators. \u201cAnother important finding is the importance of social media as a space of connection, creativity and professional opportunities for Black youth,\u201d Lenhart said. Dr. Douglas Gentile, distinguished professor of psychology at Iowa State University, encouraged being \u201ccareful about interpreting (self-reported) data like these,\u201d he said via email. \u201cPeople are surprisingly bad at actually knowing what the effects of media use are on themselves,\u201d Gentile, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, added. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that anyone is lying. Just that we only see little pieces of how the media influence us.\u201d Nearly one-fourth of participants reported using social media almost constantly throughout the day, up 7% from the rate the authors found in their 2018 report, the authors found. Many young people reported an inability to control their use, social media distracting from other activities and unconsciously reaching for social media when bored. To counteract these behaviors, on top of customizing their feeds, many have also taken breaks from social media to avoid the temptation or deleted their accounts permanently. \u201cSocial media could offer (more) benefits to youth if it was designed with a primary focus on youth well-being rather than a focus on keeping kids engaged for as long as possible to make a profit from their data,\u201d Prinstein said. While, or after, using social media, try doing an emotional check-in, Lenhart said. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018How am I feeling right now? Did I see anything that made me feel sad?\u2019\u201d Taking a temporary or permanent break from the content causing the most distress could be helpful, Lenhart added, especially if you already struggle with depression. If you\u2019re a parent or guardian wondering how to best manage your teen\u2019s social media use, one of the most important things you can do is \u201ckeep communication channels open,\u201d Lenhart said. Parental involvement is important, as young adults have expressed regret that their parents allowed them to use social media so young, wishing they could go back and tell their parents to not give in to their demands, Prinstein said. Ask the teens in your life what they like about these platforms and what types of connections or activities support their mental health, Lenhart said. Let them know you\u2019re there to help figure out a solution if social media is upsetting them or interfering with other responsibilities. Respect \u201cthat each young person is an expert in their own lived experience,\u201d Lenhart said. \u201cYoung people are valuable teachers in their own right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_menstruation-early-wellness", "text": "Younger generations are getting their first periods earlier, and the length of time it takes to become regular is changing \u2014 which could point to later health problems, according to a new study. \u201cAmong individuals born between 1950 and 2005, we found that younger generations were starting their first period (menarche) earlier, and the time it took for their periods to become regular also increased,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Zifan Wang, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an email. The study, which published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, looked at data from more than 70,000 participants who filled out surveys as part of the Apple Women\u2019s Health Study, which is a long-term research of menstrual cycles using data from the Apple Health mobile application. The data was collected digitally, relying on people to self-report the information based on their memories of early menstruation and thus limiting the results, Wang said. But other research has documented the trend in first menstrual cycles starting at earlier ages over time. In the latest study, researchers compared trends in the ages of first periods and how long it took for menstruation to become regular by age groups, Wang said. They found that the trends were even stronger in people from racial and ethnic minority groups and/or of lower socioeconomic status. \u201cThis is important because early menarche and irregular periods can signal physical and psychosocial problems later in life,\u201d Wang said, \u201cand these trends may contribute to the increase in adverse health outcomes and disparities in the US.\u201d A vital sign Menstruation is like a vital sign, said Dr. Eve Feinberg, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the research. \u201cYou want to make sure that the body is regulated,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cAnd when cycles are not regular, it\u2019s generally a sign that something else may be going on.\u201d Scientists and health care providers already know that early periods and a longer time for cycles to regulate are associated with poor effects on health, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, Wang said. The longer people have irregular menstrual cycles, the longer they may be exposed to an imbalance between two important hormones: estrogen and progesterone, Feinberg said. Estrogen signals growth, whereas progesterone signals for that growth to stop, she added. To prevent conditions\u00a0\u00a0 such as uterine cancer, you need to have the signals to both start and stop growth. Theoretically, longer exposures to estrogen without a good balance of progesterone could affect an increase in endometrial cancers and fertility problems in the future, she said. And an early period itself may pose problems, Feinberg added. For an 8-year-old to be going through puberty, there is often a disconnect between the age of the child\u2019s mind and body, she said. Where are these trends coming from? The next question is: Why are these menstrual trends changing? Earlier periods might be associated with high body mass index, or BMI, during childhood, Wang said. \u201cThis implies that childhood obesity, which has been increasing in the US, might be contributing to people getting their periods earlier,\u201d Wang added. The cause could also be other environmental factors such as nutrition or the prevalence\u00a0of microplastics, Feinberg said, adding that further investigation is needed. Additional research can help physicians counsel people better about their menstruation and recognize the impact on their patients\u2019 health, said one of the study\u2019s principal investigators, Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, assistant professor of environmental, \u00a0\u00a0reproductive and women\u2019s health at Harvard\u2019s T.H Chan School of Public Health. Physicians should evaluate children with early periods or a long duration of irregular cycles to make sure there isn\u2019t an underlying problem, Feinberg said. \u201cSometimes even using birth control pills at an earlier age to help give earlier exposure to progesterone \u2026 may give a little bit more cycle control and may possibly be protective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think the key is probably really understanding what\u2019s driving this and getting to the root cause.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/menstruation-early-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness", "text": "Eating more ultraprocessed foods is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline and stroke, even if a person is trying to adhere to a Mediterranean diet, the\u00a0DASH diet or the\u00a0MIND diet, a new study found. All three diets are plant-based, focused on consuming more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds while limiting sugar, red meat and ultraprocessed foods. \u201cIf you increased your ultraprocessed food intake by 10% in the study, it increased your risk of cognitive impairment by 16%,\u201d said cardiologist\u00a0Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the study. \u201cYou can always extrapolate and say, \u2018Well, if someone increases their ultraprocessed food consumption by 100%, then they have 160% chance of cognitive impairment,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, this study can only show an association, not a direct cause and effect.\u201d On the flip side, eating more unprocessed or minimally processed foods was linked with a 12% lower risk of cognitive impairment, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology. Unprocessed foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs and milk. Minimally processed foods include culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils and foods such as canned goods and frozen vegetables that combine culinary ingredients with unprocessed foods. Ultraprocessed foods include prepackaged soups, sauces, frozen pizza, ready-to-eat meals and pleasure foods such as hot dogs, sausages, French fries, sodas, store-bought cookies, cakes, candies, doughnuts, ice cream and many more. Such foods are typically high in calories, added sugar and salt and low in fiber, all of which can contribute to cardiometabolic health problems, weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, experts say. An increased risk of stroke The study analyzed data on 30,000 people participating in the REGARD, or REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study, made up of 50% Whites and 50% Blacks in a nationally diverse group of people who have been followed for up to 20 years. The risk of stroke was 8% higher for people who added the most ultraprocessed foods to their diet as compared with those who ate minimally processed foods, said study author and neurologist Dr. W. Taylor Kimberly, chief\u00a0of the division of neurocritical care at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. That risk rose to 15% for Black participants, likely due to the impact of ultraprocessed foods on high blood pressure in that population, Kimberly said. However, if a person ate more unprocessed or minimally processed foods, the risk of stroke dropped by 9%, the study found. What is it about ultraprocessed foods that may allow them to sabotage efforts to follow a healthy diet? It could be their poor nutrient composition and tendency to spike blood sugars, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, obesity, elevated blood pressure and high cholesterol, said Peipei Gao and Zhendong Mei in an editorial published with the study. Mei is a research fellow in medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s\u00a0Hospital in Boston, while Gao is a graduate student in nutrition visiting Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also in Boston. Neither was involved in the study. Type 2 diabetes, obesity, elevated blood pressure and high cholesterol are all key risk factors for vascular disease in the heart and brain, they wrote. The impact on blood vessels that leads to stroke and cognitive decline may also be due \u201cto the presence of additives including emulsifiers, colorants, sweeteners, and nitrates/nitrites, which have been associated with disruptions in the gut microbial ecosystem and inflammation,\u201d they added. Growing dangers of ultraprocessed foods Studies on the dangers of eating ultraprocessed foods are piling up. According to a February review of 45 meta-analyses\u00a0on almost 10 million people, eating 10% more\u00a0ultraprocessed foods\u00a0raised the risk of developing or dying from dozens of adverse health conditions. That 10% increase was considered \u201cbaseline,\u201d and adding even more ultraprocessed foods might increase the risk, experts say. There was strong evidence that a higher intake of ultraprocessed foods was associated with about a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders, according to the review. Researchers also found highly suggestive evidence that eating more ultraprocessed foods raised the risk of obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression by 20%. \u201cWe really need to put a sign in the ultraprocessed food section, or on the packaging like they do on cigarettes, saying, \u2018Warning, this food may be detrimental to your health,\u2019\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWhat we think of as \u2018convenient food\u2019 really needs to change from a package of chips to an apple or carrot that is also shelf-stable and can travel in your purse or backpack,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to make that kind of stuff more readily available, especially to our kids and in food deserts where often all the available food is ultraprocessed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_07_02_health_tuberculosis-tb-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at Tuberculosis (also known as TB), an infection, caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that usually affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain.  About TB Two types of TB exist - Latent TB infection (non-infectious) and TB disease (infectious). Latent TB infection:- A person infected with latent TB shows no symptoms and may not feel sick.- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.- It is not possible to spread TB bacteria from the infected person to others.- Individuals with a latent TB infection may never develop the disease, as bacteria remains dormant. In other cases, especially involving people with a weak immune system, the bacteria may become active and cause TB disease.- Treatment is required to ensure the infected person does not develop active TB disease but in some cases preventative treatment may not be an option. - Without treatment, about 5-10% of individuals infected with latent TB will develop the disease.  TB disease:- Symptoms of TB of the lungs include coughing up blood and chest pain.- Other symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills and fatigue.- It is possible to spread TB bacteria from the infected person to others.- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.- Treatment typically involves a combination of drugs taken for six months. - Persons with a weak immune system, such as those with HIV or diabetes, are more prone to catching TB disease.  Facts TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings. Germs can stay in the air for hours.  In 2022, about 10.6 million people worldwide became ill with TB, and 1.3 million died (including 167,000 with HIV). In 2022, a total of 8,331 new TB cases were reported in the United States. Up to 13 million people in the United States are living with latent TB. Timeline 1546 - Italian scientist Girolamo Fracastoro hypothesizes that TB is contagious.  1679 - Dutch scientist Francis Sylvius details the impact of TB on patients.  1865 - French military doctor Jean-Antoine Villemin proves the illness can transmit from human to animal or from animal to animal.  1882 - German doctor Robert Koch identifies the bacterial strain as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 1800s - Tuberculosis causes as much as one-quarter of all deaths in Europe during the 19th century. Famous people who die from tuberculosis include John Keats, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte, Anton Chekhov and Franz Kafka.   1921 - After years of trials involving animal testing, French bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin successfully administer a vaccine called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in an infant whose mother died of TB. 1930 - In Germany, more than 70 infants who received the BCG vaccine die of TB. It is later concluded that the vaccine was contaminated in the lab.  1944 - Microbiologist Selman A. Waksman and his associates at Rutgers University report the discovery of a new antibiotic called streptomycin. 1944 - Physicians H. Corwin Hinshaw, Karl H. Pfuetze and William H. Feldman successfully use streptomycin to treat a patient with TB. 1952 - A scientific journal publishes studies heralding the success of a breakthrough treatment called isoniazid.   1985-1992 - Tuberculosis makes a resurgence. Scientists attribute this to several factors, including the spread of HIV.  1994 - The World Health Organization declares tuberculosis a global emergency.  1995 - The WHO launches Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course (DOTS). It is a treatment plan containing five components, including standardized recording and reporting.   2008 - The WHO reports the highest rates of MDR-TB worldwide.  December 8, 2010 - The WHO endorses a new test that diagnoses tuberculosis within hours instead of months. 2018 - A promising new vaccine called M72/AS01E is shown to be effective in many people already infected with TB.  2021 - A study concludes that a four-month multidrug regimen to treat TB is as effective as a six-month regimen.

Whether it\u2019s due to past or current injury, arthritis or simply the wear and tear of aging, the discomfort can be debilitating. In most cases, proactive ways can help you soothe and strengthen your knees. As a mobility coach, I teach people how to use movement as medicine. In the case of knee pain, there\u2019s one simple yet effective exercise I favor to help alleviate pain and strengthen the muscles around your knees: the reverse lunge. Unlike traditional lunges, the reverse lunge is gentler on your joints. This lunge variation not only has the power to strengthen your knee function but also enhances overall lower body strength and stability. Read on to learn how incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness regimen can help you move past the pain and build a stronger foundation for knee health. Understanding your knee pain Knee pain is hard to ignore as it affects your ability to perform everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs and even sitting and standing. The knee joint is a complex structure made up of bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons, all working together to provide stability and movement. When any of these components are compromised, pain can ensue. It may be experienced as a constant or intermittent ache, throbbing or even stabbing pain that may or may not come with swelling. Common causes of knee pain include: \u2022\u00a0 Osteoarthritis: a degenerative joint disease that results in the breakdown of cartilage. \u2022\u00a0 Patellar tendinitis: inflammation of the tendons connecting the kneecap to the shinbone. \u2022\u00a0 Meniscus tears: injuries to the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee. \u2022\u00a0 Ligament injuries: tears or strains to any of the four main knee ligaments (ACL, MCL, PCL and LCL). \u2022\u00a0 Bursitis: Inflammation of the bursae, small sacs of fluid that cushion the knee joint. It\u2019s important to determine the cause of your knee pain before attempting any specific rehab plan. Addressing knee pain often requires a multifaceted approach that may include physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, medication and targeted exercises such as the reverse lunge. Before adding reverse lunges to your fitness regimen or beginning any new exercises or therapies, check with your doctor or other health care professionals you are seeing for help with your knees. Benefits of the reverse lunge The reverse lunge is a basic yet powerful exercise that strengthens the muscles around your knees, improves your core strength and enhances overall lower body strength, mobility and stability. Here are some key benefits: \u2022\u00a0 Reverse lunging strengthens muscles that support your knees. Building stabilizing muscles around the knee joints improves movement quality and reduces pain and injury risk. \u2022\u00a0 The dynamic movement of reverse lunging increases joint lubrication by stimulating the production of synovial fluid. Lubricating the knee joint reduces friction and promotes smoother, pain-free motion. \u2022\u00a0 Unlike forward lunging and other forward stepping exercises, the backward motion of reverse lunges puts less strain on the knees and emphasizes more stability, making them an ideal choice for individuals with knee pain. \u2022\u00a0 Practicing reverse lunges improves balance and stability. Because reverse lunges are unilateral, they are a balance training exercise that strengthens your core and stabilizing\u00a0 muscles to reduce the risk of injury by \u201cmoving wrong.\u201d \u2022\u00a0 They enhance mobility. Regularly practicing reverse lunges improves hip, knee and ankle mobility. \u2022\u00a0 They aid in functional activities. The movement mimics everyday activities, such as kneeling down to tie your shoes or picking something up off the floor. How to perform a reverse lunge Performing a reverse lunge correctly is crucial to reaping its benefits and avoiding injury. Follow these steps for proper form: 1.\u00a0 Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, shoulders relaxed, and arms at your sides or on your hips. Engage your core to maintain balance. 2.\u00a0 Take a step backward with your right foot, landing on the ball of your foot. Your left foot should remain in place, fully connected with the floor. 3.\u00a0 Bend both knees to lower your body until your left thigh is parallel to the ground and your right knee is either lightly touching or nearly touching the floor. 4.\u00a0 Keep most of your weight in your front foot and leg and ensure that your left knee is aligned over your left ankle, not pushed too far forward beyond your toes. 5.\u00a0 Maintain good upper-body posture with your shoulders back and chest open. Avoid leaning forward. 6.\u00a0You do not need to hold the lunge position for any specified length. Go at your own pace, returning to the starting position by pushing through your left heel to lift your body back to standing. Repeat the movement with the opposite leg. Aim for two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions on each leg, depending on your fitness level. Need to modify or want to progress? The intensity of reverse lunging can be varied to accommodate different fitness levels. Beginners or anyone struggling with balance should place one hand on a stable support, such as a chair or wall. For those wanting an advanced variation, hold dumbbells at your sides or a kettlebell at your chest or in one hand at your side or overhead to add resistance and increase the intensity. Use an appropriate weight for your fitness level and goals. To get the most out of practicing reverse lunges, keep these tips in mind: Consistency is key. Regular practice yields the best results. Aim to include reverse lunges in your routine at least two to three times per week. Focus on form. Quality over quantity. Proper form maximizes effectiveness while preventing injury. Listen to your body. If you experience any painful sensation beyond normal muscle fatigue, stop and reassess your form. Consult a health care professional if necessary. Knee pain doesn\u2019t have to sideline you from staying active and enjoying life. By incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness routine, you can take proactive steps toward healthier, pain-free knees. So, step back, lunge and move forward with stronger, more resilient knees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_health_liver-transplant-policy-change-debate", "text": "Changes to the policy that governs how liver transplants are allocated in the United States were meant to increase the number of transplants and make the process more equitable, but a new study raises concerns that it\u2019s putting certain underserved communities at a greater disadvantage. The new liver allocation policy changed the geographic parameters that guide which people receive donated organs. Instead of operating within defined regional service areas, the new policy prioritizes the sickest liver candidates who are listed at transplant hospitals that are within a 500-nautical-mile radius of the donor hospital. It was implemented in February 2020 by the United Network for Organ Sharing, which is contracted by the federal government\u2019s Organ Procurement and Transplant Network. In a study published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Surgery, researchers assessed outcomes during the first year under the new policy for 22 transplant centers that represent about a quarter of the national volume. They found that liver transplant costs were about 11% higher than they were the year before, largely due to costs associated with increased air travel to transport donor livers. For this sample of transplant centers \u2013 which were not identified in the study \u2013 the overall number of liver transplants decreased 6%, and the change in transplants relative to donors suggests higher discard rates, according to the study. \u201cTransplant centers from low-income states, those serving populations with more racial and ethnic minority individuals, and centers from states with poorer-performing health systems are facing greater costs, despite fewer patients having transplants since the policy implementation,\u201d the study authors wrote. Geographic disparities have long been a challenge facing the transplant system, and the issue is particularly inherent to liver transplants because they cannot remain viable between donor and transplant as long as some other organs. Rural areas face broad disadvantages when it comes to organ transplants, but the study suggests that the new liver allocation policy may create even more disproportionate burdens. Researchers found that rural centers had significantly greater drops in the number of liver transplants, increases in imported livers and larger increases in hospital and flight costs. For the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the new 500-nautical-mile radius might mean that staffers travel to Chicago, Houston or Nashville to get a donor liver to bring back to a transplant patient in Little Rock. \u201cThat\u2019s expensive, but if it\u2019s the best thing to get people to transplanted \u2013 time will tell \u2013 we just want to do what\u2019s right to honor those gifts by donors,\u201d said Dr. Lyle Burdine, director of the medical center\u2019s solid organ transplant program. The center prepared for the change in liver transplant policy by adding staff to help with the increased logistical burden and by developing a program that preserves the organ longer during the transition between donor and transplant recipient. \u201cThe only thing that we haven\u2019t then been able to do \u2013 and no transplant center has been able to do \u2013 is change reimbursement rates by hospital payers for this increased cost. That\u2019s still stuck in probably the late 1990s,\u201d Burdine said. \u201cAnd the financial pressures in health care are really felt at the fringes.\u201d A related commentary, also published in JAMA Surgery on Wednesday, suggests that broader and longer-term analysis is important before making a judgement on how the new policy is working. While it\u2019s clear that not all transplant centers are \u201cequally resilient in responding to changes in national allocation policy,\u201d the sample of centers used in the new analysis might not be nationally representative, wrote the authors, led by Dr. Daniela Ladner, founding director of the Northwestern University Transplant Outcomes Research Collaborative. Federal data suggests that liver transplants did increase in the US overall, despite the decrease observed in the sample of 22 centers. The new policy was implemented at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, which could have skewed outcomes and findings. And the \u201cfield is changing rapidly,\u201d they wrote, especially with emergence of new technologies like normothermic perfusion pumps that allow donor livers to travel longer distances. At the University of Kansas Medical Center, liver transplant volume fell about 40% in the first two years under the new allocation policy, costs increased about 15% per transplant, and the number of livers that came from the local donors fell from about 90% to about 15%, said Dr. Timothy Schmitt, the director of transplantation for the health system. Some of these changes were expected based on models that forecasted how the new policy would play out, he said. But it also created a situation where people who get a liver transplant are quite a bit sicker than they would have been under the old policy. \u201cThat has really caused us to have a difference in practice,\u201d Schmitt said. Now, some people who would have been considered good candidates for liver transplant might not even be put on the waitlist because they won\u2019t survive the wait time. \u201cThere are more difficult conversations to be hard because people are going to be waiting a lot longer.\u201d However, the United Network for Organ Sharing assessed national outcomes after one year under the new policy and found promising results. \u201cAlthough we look at regional effects and center effects, the most important thing is that we focus on the patients and what\u2019s happening nationally,\u201d said Dr. Scott Biggins, chair of the federal government\u2019s liver transplantation committee. \u201cThis policy did lower waitlist mortality, did increase access to liver transplant nationally and didn\u2019t have much of any detrimental effect on the outcome after transplant in terms of post-transplant survival.\u201d In the four years since the latest liver transplant policy was implemented, the committee has also started work on another update to the policy that would make the allocation process more \u201ccontinuous\u201d instead of \u201ccategorical,\u201d Biggins said. Right now, liver allocations are predominantly concerned with reaching the sickest patients soonest based on individual patient scores on a model for end-stage liver disease. But the new model would also focus on improving efficiency in the system instead of relying completely on urgency, he said. This update could address some of the concerns that Schmitt has; he would appreciate a more \u201cmatrixed allocation scheme\u201d that allows for flexibility that accounts for travel costs in some way. Projections for the potential update to transplant policy are still being worked through, and it will be years before they\u2019re finalized after seeking input from the public and other stakeholders. \u201cAs we move forward, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity here to focus on the patients rather than bottom lines,\u201d Biggins said. \u201cHealth care is a business but our focus is on improving the lives and health of our patients, and the best way we can get organs to people who are in need is should be the North Star here.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/health/liver-transplant-policy-change-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "health"}}
