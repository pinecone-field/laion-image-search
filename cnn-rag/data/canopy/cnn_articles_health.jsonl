But the bright orb could still turn heads Friday night with an appearance that is bigger and more colorful than the average moon. The full moon \u2014 which will reach the crest of its fullness\u00a0at 9:08\u00a0p.m. ET Friday\u00a0\u2014 comes one day after the\u00a0summer solstice, the day of the year when the sun appears the highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. Since a full moon is opposite the sun, this strawberry moon will shine lower in the sky than usual, according to\u00a0NASA. Because of this \u201clower than average path across the sky,\u201d the full moon could have an \u201corange- or amber-colored appearance, for the same reason sunsets appear orange or reddish,\u201d said Preston Dyches, a science communicator with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. Dyches said the effect is the result of the moon\u2019s reflected light having to travel a longer distance throughout Earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering away most blue wavelengths (which are shorter than red wavelengths). Native American tribes across North America gave the strawberry moon its name to mark the in-season ripeness of strawberries, according to\u00a0The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The moon\u2019s low placement in the sky could also cause the orb to appear bigger than usual, according to\u00a0NASA,\u00a0due to an effect dubbed the moon illusion. Scientists don\u2019t really know why this optical illusion happens, but it\u2019s believed to be a combination of how our brain processes visual information and the moon\u2019s size in comparison with smaller objects near the horizon, such as trees or the roofs of houses. For optimal viewing, Dyches recommends looking when the moon is rising or setting to see the effects of the moon illusion. No equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features, according to\u00a0NASA\u2019s Moon Viewing Guide. \u201cWhenever something beautiful about the natural world can be experienced from your doorstep, it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time,\u201d Dyches said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to marvel at the sight of another giant world. \u2026 I like to gaze up and think of it as a place people will live and work someday.\u201d How to see the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019 in the night sky Because the moon appears full for three days a month surrounding its peak, the strawberry moon will be visible to almost everyone worldwide. However, it will be more difficult to observe for those farther north, such as in Alaska or Denmark, where the low-traversing moon will only briefly rise above the horizon, Dyches said. Besides the full moon, those in the Northern Hemisphere can spot the \u201cSummer Triangle,\u201d an arrangement of three bright stars whose presence in the sky symbolizes summertime in the north, said Dyches, who also produces the space agency\u2019s monthly sky-watching highlights video called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up.\u201d To find the triangular pattern, it is easiest to look for the brightest of the three stars, Vega, which will be near the east in the sky, according to EarthSky. The second brightest, Altair, will be to the lower right, and the star Deneb, to the lower left of Vega, will finish off the sides of the triangle. Those away from bright city lights can spot the center of the Milky Way as a \u201chazy band of dim clouds arching across the sky,\u201d and the constellation Scorpius can be seen as it \u201cpoints the way to the galaxy\u2019s core,\u201d Dyches added. Remaining moons of 2024 There are six more full moons set to shine bright in the sky this year,\u00a0according to EarthSky. Here are the remaining full moons of 2024 and their peak dates: July 21: Buck moon August 19: Sturgeon moon September 17: Harvest moon October 17: Hunter\u2019s moon November 15: Beaver moon December 15: Cold moon", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/science/strawberry-full-moon-june-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_sex-gender-child-brain", "text": "Sex and gender are often conflated or equated in everyday conversations, and most American adults believe a person\u2019s gender is determined by sex assigned at birth. But a new study of nearly 5,000 9- and 10-year-olds found that sex and gender map onto largely distinct parts of the brain. The research gives a first insight into how sex and gender may have \u201cmeasurable and unique influences\u201d on the brain, study authors said, just as other experiences have been shown to shape the brain. \u201cMoving forward, we really need to consider both sexes and genders separately if we better want to understand the brain,\u201d said Dr. Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and the Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, California, and a co-author of the study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances. The researchers on the new study defined sex as what was assigned to the child at birth. In the US, clinicians make this assignment based on genitalia. Most people are assigned either female or male, according to the research; the rest are intersex, a person whose sexual or reproductive anatomy doesn\u2019t fit this male/female binary. The researchers defined gender as an individual\u2019s attitude, feelings and behaviors, as well as socially constructed roles. They noted specifically that gender is not binary, meaning not all people identify as either female or male. Both sex and gender are a core part of human experience. They\u2019re key to how people perceive others and how they understand themselves. Both can influence behavior as well as health, the study authors say. The researchers looked at brain imaging data from 4,757 children in the United States, 2,315 assigned female at birth and 2,442 assigned male at birth, who were ages 9 and 10 and were a subset of the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. Over a period of 10 years, the children in the ABCD study underwent comprehensive neuroimaging, behavioral, developmental and psychiatric assessments. Beyond tests such as MRIs, the scientists did surveys of the children and their parents that were focused on gender, both at the beginning of the research and then a year later. The children were asked about how they expressed their gender and how they felt about it. The parents were asked about a child\u2019s sex-typed behavior during play and whether the child had any gender dysphoria, a term that mental health professionals use to describe clinically significant distress felt because a person\u2019s sense of their gender does not match their sex the assigned at birth. Parents were a key part of the study, said study co-author Dr. Dani S. Bassett, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania with appointments in the Departments of Bioengineering, Electrical & Systems Engineering, Physics & Astronomy, Neurology, and Psychiatry. \u201cWhen kids have a particular kind of gender behavior or gender expression, that will influence how their parents and also other caregivers and friends and family \u2026 et cetera interact with them,\u201d Bassett said. Information about a parent\u2019s perception of a child\u2019s gender gives researchers a better sense of the child\u2019s social environment and how it may affect their brain development. The authors used a kind of artificial intelligence called machine learning that built a model that could predict a child\u2019s sex and reported gender from their brain scan.  When the researchers looked the children\u2019s brain scans, the results seemed to show that sex influenced different regions of the brain that are involved in visual processing, sensory processing and motor control and some regions involved in executive function, which lets an individual organize and integrate information across time. Gender seems to influence some of the more sensory-specific networks that are associated with sex, but it also seems to have a broader influence and can be detected on different brain networks involved in executive function, including things like attention, social cognition and emotional processing. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re able to capture how gender maps onto the brain basically just tells us that gender is influencing our brain,\u201d Dhamala said. The structure of the human brain can be shaped by expertise and experiences. Research on London taxi drivers \u2014 who must take extensive tests to show that they can navigate the city\u2019s streets without maps or GPS \u2014 seems to show that they have significantly larger posterior hippocampi, the part of the brain related to spatial memory and navigation, than in people who aren\u2019t taxi drivers. \u201cSimilarly, as individuals and as humans, we are experts about ourselves and our genders. So it makes sense that gender will also be mapped within our brains,\u201d Dhamala said. What the new study cannot do is predict what gender a person may identify with beyond one limited snapshot in time captured by the scans and surveys. Gender, the authors note, is not something that is necessarily static, and a person\u2019s understanding of their gender can change throughout their lifetime. The study also can\u2019t determine what things in someone\u2019s environment will influence their brain function in terms of sex or gender, nor can it identify what a person\u2019s sexual orientation might be. \u201cSexual orientation is independent from gender and from sex,\u201d Bassett said, and it may be differently mapped in the brain. The researchers say they hope to someday learn more about how sex and gender interact in a person\u2019s life and how they influence one another and the brain throughout a lifetime. They also hope to see how different cultures affect a person\u2019s gender and their brain development. A 2022 poll showed that most American adults \u2014 and the vast majority of conservatives \u2014 believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. The distinction is key to gender-affirming care, medical treatment for people who identify as a gender that is different from the one they were assigned at birth. Conservative politicians have pushed for a record number of bans on such care, and nearly half of US states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care for minors. The study did not look at whether sex or gender were congruent or incongruent in any study participant. Rather, it looked at the child\u2019s binary sex and gender across self- and parent-reported measures. The study couldn\u2019t provide any specific findings if sex and gender were incongruent. \u201cGoing forward, the hope is that we can motivate other scientists to consider science and gender in their analyses in the data collections in their programs and research,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Avram Holmes, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers University. The field of neuroscience has only just begun to acknowledge and address the presence of biases and barriers to inclusivity within research, Holmes said. A fuller understanding of the way the brain works in terms of sex and gender could also have practical implications and potentially help scientists find better ways to treat people with brain-related illnesses. For instance, the study pointed to how people assigned male at birth are more likely to be diagnosed with substance use and attention deficit disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that sex and gender necessarily drive illness rates, but the cultures people are embedded in can also influence the likelihood they may or may not develop a particular illness,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cSo the types of environmental pressures a child undergoes across development could increase or decrease their risk for experiencing illness, independent of their initial brain biology.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/sex-gender-child-brain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_health_summer-food-safety-wellness", "text": "This Independence Day holiday takes place as\u00a0record-breaking heat waves\u00a0have spread across many parts of the US and the world, and the temperatures could be deadly. There\u2019s potential for record-breaking heat and extreme heat risk for portions of the South and Southwest. California is likely to be especially hard hit, with highs passing 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) in many areas. At the same time, the avian influenza outbreak has spread to cows, raising questions about whether certain foods like milk, eggs and hamburgers remain safe. As I drank lots of water and perspired through high temperatures and humidity at an outdoor concert this week, I thought about safely celebrating the Fourth of July holiday. What about all the grilled meat, burgers and potato salad sitting outside in the heat?\u00a0How can we stay cool while attending picnics and barbecues during this holiday weekend? Are there additional food safety precautions we should take, given the predicted high temperatures? And are there other health factors to consider this holiday, such as keeping cool and well-hydrated? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: Can you remind us why food safety is important? Dr. Leana Wen: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are around 9 million episodes of foodborne illness annually. These illnesses primarily occur when people ingest food or drink that has been contaminated with bacteria, viruses or parasites. Most episodes are mild, though even mild illnesses are unpleasant\u2014they are generally characterized by nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Some people can become very sick and require hospitalization, and unfortunately, some can die. Those at highest risk for severe illness include older individuals, children under 5, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems. CNN: What food precautions should people take for barbecues and other outdoor gatherings? Wen: Undercooked meat contains a lot of infectious organisms. The best way to make sure meat is cooked thoroughly is to use an internal thermometer. I recommend this US government food safety website to check the internal temperature that different types of meat should be cooked to. For instance, chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit, and ground beef should be cooked to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the meat is cooked, keep it at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or above until serving to prevent germs from developing. Prior to cooking, refrigerate raw meat rather than keeping it at room temperature. It should be removed just before being placed on a barbeque. CNN: Given how hot the weather might be this week, are there other specific factors to consider? Wen: Yes. Under normal weather circumstances, the advice from the US Department of Agriculture is that perishable food can be unrefrigerated for up to two hours. However, if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, that\u2019s reduced to one hour. That applies to cooked meat like hamburgers as well as perishable salads like potato salad and cole slaw. In hot weather, these items should be eaten right away; if not, they should be refrigerated within an hour. CNN: What about people who are having barbecues at parks or other places without refrigerators? Wen: They should have a well-insulated cooler with lots of ice. Raw, uncooked meat should be kept at 40-degrees Fahrenheit or lower until it is ready to go on the grill. I also recommend keeping uncooked meat in tightly sealed bags so that it does not contaminate other items that are served raw, like veggies and fruit. Another precaution for barbeques is to keep an eye on what utensils and plates you use for raw meat versus other food. Label the utensils, plates and containers that come into contact with raw meat. Keep them separate from plates that contain salad items, fruit, chips, buns and other items. CNN: And make sure to wash your hands after touching raw meat? Wen: Yes, absolutely. You don\u2019t want to go right from handling raw hamburger meat to making a salad. Make sure to wash your hands well with soap and water each time after handling raw meat. CNN: Let\u2019s talk about bird flu for a moment. Has the avian flu outbreak affected how we should think about eating products like hamburgers and chicken wings? Is it still safe to eat eggs and drink milk? Wen: According to federal health officials, it is safe to continue eating these products as long as meat and eggs are cooked to the recommended temperatures. It is also safe to keep drinking milk, though it\u2019s crucial to emphasize that the milk needs to be pasteurized. Raw milk is not safe to drink. Not only can raw milk harbor bacteria, but it is also possible that raw milk can transmit the bird flu. It wasn\u2019t advisable for people to drink raw milk or consume products made from raw milk prior to the bird flu outbreak, and it certainly is not advisable now. CNN: We\u2019ve talked a lot about food safety. What are other health issues to consider this Fourth of July? Wen: If you will be in hot weather, be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Watch out for those who are most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, specifically children, older adults and people with chronic medical conditions. Watch out for your pets as well. They can get overheated, too. Never leave pets or children unattended and in a car by themselves; the inside of the car overheats rapidly and these high temperatures can be fatal. Everyone should try to stay in the shade when possible. Keep well-hydrated. Water is the best form of hydration, and be aware that excessive caffeine and alcohol can be dangerous during heat waves. Wear clothing that protects you from the sun, and make sure to apply and re-apply sunscreen often.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/health/summer-food-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_ozempic-wegovy-blindness-rare-risk", "text": "People who take Ozempic or Wegovy may have a higher risk of developing a rare form of blindness, a new study suggests. Still, doctors say it shouldn\u2019t deter patients from using the medicines to treat diabetes or obesity. Last summer, doctors at Mass Eye and Ear noticed an unusually high number of patients with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, a type of eye stroke that causes sudden, painless vision loss in one eye. The condition is relatively rare \u2014 up to 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population may experience it \u2014 but the doctors noted three cases in one week, and each of those patients was taking semaglutide medications. A look back at six years of medical records showed that people with diabetes were more than four times more likely to be diagnosed NAION if they were taking a prescription semaglutide, and those who were overweight or obese were more than seven\u00a0times more likely to experience the condition if they were taking the medication. The risk was found to be greatest within the first year of receiving a prescription for semaglutide. The study, published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Ophthalmology, cannot prove that semaglutide medications cause NAION. And the small number of patients \u2014 an average of about 100 cases were identified each year \u2014 from one specialized medical center may not apply to a broader population. Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of the only semaglutide medications in the US, emphasized that the data in the new study is not sufficient to establish a causal association between the use of semaglutide medications and NAION. \u201cPatient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from the use of our medicines very seriously,\u201d a company spokesperson wrote in an email to CNN. Semaglutide prescriptions have soared in the US, which could raise the number of people at risk for a potential side effect. And NAION is the second-leading cause of optic nerve blindness after glaucoma. But even with an increased risk, the condition remains relatively uncommon. \u201cThe use of these drugs has exploded throughout industrialized countries and they have provided very significant benefits in many ways, but future discussions between a patient and their physician should include NAION as a potential risk,\u201d lead researcher Dr. Joseph Rizzo, director of the neuro-ophthalmology at Mass Eye and Ear and a professor at Harvard Medical School, said in a news release. \u201cOur findings should be viewed as being significant but tentative, as future studies are needed to examine these questions in a much larger and more diverse population.\u201d Experts agree that the potential risk of NAION should not deter the use of semaglutide medications to treat diabetes or obesity. \u201cIn the ever-changing landscape of systemic therapies, being vigilant for potential new disease associations is a duty we all share on behalf of patients,\u201d Susan Mollan, an ophthalmologist with the University Hospitals Birmingham in the UK wrote in a related commentary. But the large number of people who are taking semaglutide should raise confidence that the absolute risk of developing NAION as a result is rare. The ways that semaglutides interact with the eyes are not entirely understood. And the exact cause of NAION is not known either. The condition causes damage to the optic nerve, but there is often no warning before vision loss. Changes in blood sugar levels can affect the shape of an eye\u2019s lens and may affect vision, said Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist and director of obesity medicine at Endeavor Health in Chicago. She was not involved in the new study. And the use of semaglutides, which prompt the body to create more insulin to reduce blood sugar, has been previously linked to temporary vision changes \u2014 new or worsening cases of diabetic retinopathy, or damage to blood vessels at the back of the eye \u2014 likely related to the rapid improvement of blood sugars. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved labels for both Ozempic and Wegovy include vision changes among potential side effects, and Novo Nordisk is exploring the link between semaglutide use and diabetic retinopathy in a trial which they expect to complete 2027. \u201cPatient safety is paramount at the FDA and we continuously review available sources of data and new information on potential risks of drugs, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, and update labeling as needed to communicate new information on potential risks to healthcare providers and to patients as soon as possible,\u201d Chanapa Tantibanchachai, a press officer with the FDA, told CNN over email. While there is a \u201cbiologically plausible mechanism\u201d for a potential interaction, \u201c\u2018association is not causation\u2019 and diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for NAION,\u201d Dr. Andrew Lee, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and neuro-ophthalmologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, told CNN in an email. He was not involved in the new study. For now, patients who are taking semaglutide or considering treatment should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors, especially those who have other known optic nerve problems such as glaucoma or preexisting visual loss, experts say \u201cIt is important to consult with ophthalmology if patients experience visual changes,\u201d Narang said. \u201cIt is important to make sure patients are consulting with physicians who are also comfortable prescribing semaglutide and talking through what may be clinically relevant versus irrelevant, and discussing benefits versus risks of long-term therapy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/ozempic-wegovy-blindness-rare-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_bird-flu-fourth-human-case-in-us", "text": "A fourth person in the United States has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak among dairy cattle across the country. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Wednesday that it has identified the state\u2019s first human case of H5 avian influenza associated with the multistate outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle. This case is the fourth identified nationally in connection to the outbreak; two other human cases have been reported in Michigan and one in Texas. More than a quarter of dairy herds in Colorado have reported cases of bird flu, according to data from the state health department. As of Wednesday, federal\u00a0data\u00a0shows that seven states have confirmed cases in the past 30 days, and 40% of them are in Colorado \u2014 more than any other state. The infected person in Colorado had mild symptoms, reporting only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as a symptom, according to state health officials. He worked at a dairy farm in northeast Colorado and had direct exposure to dairy cattle infected with avian flu. After testing positive,\u00a0the man was treated immediately with the antiviral medication oseltamivir, and he has recovered, according to the state health department. \u201cThe risk to most people remains low. Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,\u201d Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist at the CDPHE, said in Wednesday\u2019s announcement. The last human case of\u00a0H5N1 in Colorado was in 2022\u00a0in a person who was exposed to infected poultry. In the current outbreak connected to infected dairy cattle, the first two human cases identified in the United States also reported eye-related symptoms and eye infections or conjunctivitis. The third human case in the US reported more respiratory symptoms, such as cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes. None of those three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission of the virus. On the national level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that it continues to monitor the situation carefully, using its flu surveillance systems to watch for H5N1 activity in people. The agency said Wednesday that the human case in Colorado \u201cdoes not change CDC\u2019s current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.\u201d However, the case \u201cunderscores the importance of\u00a0recommended precautions\u00a0in people with exposure to infected animals,\u201d according to the CDC. \u201cPeople with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.\u201d The CDC repeatedly\u00a0has recommended\u00a0that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. CDC officials said Tuesday that the United States has enough H5 bird flu tests to respond to the outbreak. \u201cWe have an ample number of H5-specific tests in the public health system for the current outbreak. As of right now, there are roughly 750,000 H5-specific tests available today and another 1.2 million such tests coming online in the next two to three months,\u201d Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cThis is on top of a robust supply of influenza A tests, the general tests that are available at doctor\u2019s offices around the country,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThe way that our system works is such that if someone tests positive for influenza A at the doctor\u2019s office, their specimen is sent to a public health laboratory for what\u2019s called subtyping. That tells us if the influenza A virus is a common seasonal one, or a rarer version like H5N1.

{"id": "2024_07_11_health_ecigarettes-nicotine-exposure-children-wellness", "text": "Children who live in homes where adults use e-cigarettes are exposed to significantly less nicotine through secondhand aerosols than children in homes where adults use traditional cigarettes, a new study shows. But vaping still exposes kids to nicotine and may present other risks, too. To keep children completely nicotine-free, according to the researchers, people shouldn\u2019t smoke or vape around kids at all. The researchers said they did the study in part because of the perception that e-cigarettes were safer than traditional cigarettes and because people are using them more than regular cigarettes inside the home. The study published Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Vaping has been promoted to adults as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes and as a potential smoking cessation device, although experts say more research is needed. One reason some doctors prefer that their patients use e-cigarettes is because they expose users to fewer toxic chemicals such as tobacco and the dozens of other carcinogens found in cigarettes, like N-nitrosamines and aldehydes, that can cause cancer and other serious health problems. But what the new study shows, experts say, is that harm reduction for the user is not necessarily the same as harm removal for everyone around them \u2014 and this could be a significant issue for children, whose lungs are still developing. The study looked at the lives of 1,777 children who were were part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a racially diverse government study designed to continuously assess US child and adult health and nutrition. Tobacco use in the home was reported by parents or guardians. More than 270 of the kids were exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke at home, 45 were exposed to secondhand e-cigarette vapor only, and 1,476 had neither kind of user in their home. Scientists included children between the ages of 3 and 11 because they were less likely than older kids to use nicotine products. The researchers determined children\u2019s nicotine levels using blood samples taken between 2017 and 2020. Although new vaping devices have been introduced to the US since that time and exposure levels may be different depending on device, the authors say their study can provide a good general understanding of nicotine exposure in the home. Exposure levels in the study are generally considered an undercount, they said. The children in the study who had the most nicotine exposure by far were those who lived with people who smoked traditional tobacco products like cigarettes. With these products, kids have two chances to be exposed to nicotine: when the user exhales and in between puffs, when a lit cigarette or cigar sits in an ashtray. E-cigarette users are believed to absorb 99% of the nicotine they inhale, but some of it gets released when they exhale after taking a drag on their device. The children in the study with the lowest nicotine levels were those who had no exposure to secondhand aerosols of any kind at home. Kids who were exposed to e-cigarettes had some nicotine in their bodies, but they had absorbed 84% less than those who lived in homes with people who smoked only tobacco. The takeaway from the research, the authors said, is that people need to stop any kind of vaping or smoking\u00a0at home. \u201cVaping inside the home around children should be avoided given that, even though nicotine itself has a limited risk profile, the increased absorption of nicotine from secondhand vapor suggests that the children were also exposed to other potentially harmful excipients from e-cigarettes,\u201d the study says. Earlier studies have found similar nicotine exposure among children in homes with cigarette and e-cigarette users. Dr. Terry Gordon, a professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU\u2019s Langone Health who has done nicotine exposure research, said he was surprised that nicotine levels weren\u2019t higher in households with e-cigarette users. Some of his research has shown much higher nicotine levels in e-cigarette households than in the new study. Either way, he said, all of these studies should be a good reminder to vape users that they need to be careful around others, especially kids. \u201cMost of us toxicologists, we believe e-cigs are safer, but no one is ready to say they are safe because of the primary users of the devices as well as those who are exposed to secondary aerosols,\u201d said Gordon, who was not involved in the latest study. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how harmful secondhand vape aerosols can be. It took years to understand this with cigarettes, said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonologist and volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association. Secondhand smoke from cigarettes has done real damage, said Galiatsatos, who was not involved in the new study. He said he has treated an entire generation of people who have developed cancer and other lung problems not because they smoked but because they grew up around adults who did. In 2020, Galiatsatos published what is believed to be the first study to document significant injury in an adult with secondhand e-cigarette exposure. He says adults shouldn\u2019t take a chance with a child\u2019s health by vaping around them. \u201cA child who is growing, their lungs are so vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t completely know the effect it\u2019s going to have on the next generation, just like we didn\u2019t know what secondhand smoke did, but why even put your child in a position of becoming a future patient?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/ecigarettes-nicotine-exposure-children-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_ftc-report-pbm-pharmacy-healthcare", "text": "Pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate the terms for prescription drug access for hundreds of millions of Americans, are racking up profits while squeezing patients and independent pharmacies, according to an interim staff report released Tuesday by the Federal Trade Commission. The commission, which launched an inquiry into the opaque pharmacy benefit manager or PBM industry in 2022, found that a handful of dominant players \u201cwield enormous power over patients\u2019 ability to access and afford their prescription drugs, allowing PBMs to significantly influence what drugs are available and at what price.\u201d Also, \u201cPBMs hold substantial influence over independent pharmacies by imposing unfair, arbitrary, and harmful contractual terms that can impact independent pharmacies\u2019 ability to stay in business and serve their communities,\u201d according to the agency. The six largest managers handle nearly 95% of the prescriptions filled in the US. Most of them, including the three largest \u2013 CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx \u2013 are owned by or connected to health insurers, as well as affiliated with pharmacies. PBMs, which serve as middlemen in the drug supply chain by negotiating rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and others, could be steering patients to their own pharmacies and away from independent pharmacies, the report found. Pharmacy benefit managers have been in the spotlight in recent years, with the Biden administration and Congress seeking to increase transparency into the industry\u2019s operations. PBMs, which keep an undisclosed amount of the rebates they negotiate, are among the players in the drug industry blamed for the rising cost of medications, which plagues many Americans. The PBM industry\u2019s trade group blasted the commission\u2019s report, saying that it \u201cfalls far short of being a definitive, fact-based assessment of PBMs or the prescription drug market\u201d and that it \u201cis based on anecdotes and comments from anonymous sources and self-interested parties, and supported only by two cherry-picked case studies that are implied to be representative of the entire market.\u201d \u201cThe report completely overlooks the volumes of data that demonstrate the value that PBMs provide to America\u2019s health care system by reducing prescription drug costs and increasing access to medications,\u201d Pharmaceutical Care Management Association CEO JC Scott said in a statement. One of the agency\u2019s own commissioners also took issue with the report, saying it failed to live up to the FTC\u2019s rigorous standard. The report was plagued by process irregularities and concerns over the substance, Commissioner Melissa Holyoak wrote in her dissent. CVS Caremark, which handles about one-third of the market, said it stands by \u201cour record of protecting American businesses, unions, and patients from rising prescription drug prices.\u201d \u201cOur efforts have resulted in members on average paying less than $8 per 30-day supply of medication,\u201d CVS Caremark said in a statement. \u201cIndependent analyses show net brand drug prices have declined six years in a row despite significant inflation across the U.S. economy and egregious list price increases from drug makers.\u201d The pharmaceutical industry\u2019s main trade group, on the other hand, said the commission\u2019s report shows how PBMs are driving up costs. \u201cThe veil continues to lift exposing the ugly truth that PBMs put profits before patients at every turn,\u201d PhRMA spokesperson Alex Schriver said in a statement. \u201cThe FTC report makes it clear: PBMs have outsized control over what medicines people can get and the price they pay\u202fat the pharmacy counter.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/ftc-report-pbm-pharmacy-healthcare/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_travel_van-life-travel-cec-wellness", "text": "Home is where you are. Home is where you make it. Home on the range. Home is \u2026 in a camper van? Absolutely! When I tried camper van life for the first time, I went all in. For three weeks, my husband and I drove a kitted-out, circa 2012 Ford Econoline van across North America, traveling from northern New Jersey to Los Angeles as we wound our way along the length of Route 66 in November 2019. It was a bold move, but I knew it was the most cost-efficient and efficient-efficient way to see as much of \u201cthe Mother Road\u201d as we could. My hope was that by renting a camper van, we\u2019d save money on purchased meals and hotel rooms and also feel more immersed in the journey and deeply connected to each town we visited. Our first night in the Bloomington, Illinois, Walmart parking lot was a little nerve-racking. I lay in my sleeping bag, listening to the activity beyond the van and wondering if we could handle this adventure. But after the first successful sleepover, we quickly settled into a routine. We\u2019d wake up each morning for a quick bathroom run and even shower at some of the surprisingly luxurious recreational vehicle parks we patronized. Then we\u2019d cook breakfast on our camp stove at the rear of the van and hit the road by 8:30 or 9 a.m. After a day covering roughly 130 miles and experiencing the historic sites, local museums, former filling stations and proudly kitschy roadside attractions along Route 66, we\u2019d make sure to arrive at our nightly destination by 4:30 p.m. \u2014 sundown in November comes early. By the time we dropped off the van near Los Angeles International Airport in late November, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a new but dear friend on the last day of summer camp. We\u2019d unwind, explore the sights of the town, treat ourselves to dinner away from the van, then bunk down in our sleeping bags and do it all again the next day. (We spent two-thirds of the trip sleeping in the van and the other third in historic lodgings along the route, such as Boots Court in Carthage, Missouri, and the El Rancho in Gallup, New Mexico.) The benefits of camper van travel Now, I\u2019m not saying you must spend weeks on an epic road trip to fully experience the joy of a camper van. And I\u2019m certainly not saying you need to sell all your possessions and become a full-time van lifer \u2014 I\u2019m grateful to return to my house and my cats after every trip. But even a few days of traveling and living in a camper van can give you a whole new perspective on yourself and the world around you. When you\u2019re in a camper van, everything you need is within reach \u2014 to an extent. I loved the challenge of condensing our lives into approximately 75 square feet and finding creative ways to live comfortably but efficiently. The morning coffee? It\u2019s right there. Your outfit for the day? Just reach behind you. If you need to change your shoes into hiking boots, grab a raincoat for an unexpected downpour, refuel with a quick snack or recharge with a 20-minute power nap, you don\u2019t need to go far. And you don\u2019t have to repack your bags to leave a hotel every morning. After the first night, I embraced the security and sanctuary of the van, knowing that whatever we had was around us. If we couldn\u2019t find it right away, it wasn\u2019t lost. We had exactly everything we needed \u2014 everything except, well, a bathroom, which brings me to the next life-changing aspect of a camper van. Camper van life makes you brave and gets you out there, interacting with others and connecting with the world. You\u2019re always in the environment, not separated by hotel corridors and lobbies. You\u2019re discovering creative places to stay for the night, looking forward to chatting with bartenders during the nightly dinner at a local restaurant or just fielding questions from strangers about the van and your trip. During our Route 66 adventure, our van prompted exchanges and allowed us to have moments we would likely have missed in a rental car. In Arcadia, Oklahoma, we stopped by Pops 66 Soda Ranch and struck up a conversation with a woman admiring our brightly painted camper van. She told us about one of the chairs at the nearby Oklahoma City National Memorial representing a boy named Zackary who loved collecting pennies. The next morning, we found Zackary\u2019s chair and placed a penny on it for him. Because the van functioned as a full campsite rig, we didn\u2019t have to figure out the logistics of bringing or renting equipment to camp in Joshua Tree National Park in California. We spent two nights in wonder among the granite boulders, with Cassiopeia shining brightly above, and two mornings waking up with the sun and the scent of high desert air. Tips for trying the van life Ready to try camper van travel? Companies rent vans that come fully equipped with mini kitchens and bedding, so it\u2019s almost as easy as booking an Airbnb. Some even come with toilets and showers, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a deal-breaker. Rent one for a quick round-trip weekend visit or explore further by taking a one-way jaunt to another rental hub and then flying home. If you\u2019re itching to have a new type of travel experience, you\u2019ll find it behind the rolling door of a camper van. As another well-loved saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey\u201d \u2014 but with a camper van, you\u2019ll get to appreciate both at once.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/travel/van-life-travel-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_health_lead-service-lines-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "With the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s latest \u2014 and strictest \u2014 plan to minimize the risk of Americans drinking lead-contaminated water on the horizon, the debate over whether the agency\u2019s proposed rules go too far or not nearly far enough is heating up. Although lead was banned from new water service lines in 1986, it\u2019s estimated that\u00a0more than 9 million such lines\u00a0still carry drinking water to homes and businesses throughout the country. Under the EPA\u2019s\u00a0Lead and Copper Rule Improvements\u00a0proposal, water utilities would be required to replace\u00a0all lead-containing lines\u00a0within 10 years. The proposal from the Biden administration differs from rules put out in the waning days of the Trump term that allow up to 30 years for service line replacement, triggered only when lead levels test higher than 15 parts per billion. The new proposal, which would largely supplant\u00a0the Trump rules, calls for stricter monitoring, enhanced public education, and the 10-year pipe replacement mandate regardless of lead levels. An October deadline looms for the new rules to be adopted; otherwise, enforcement of the less-stringent Trump administration rules will begin. And complicating matters more: November\u2019s election results could shake up whose rules the nation must follow. While many cities and states have begun to replace their lead pipes, some utilities and officials say the 10-year\u00a0time frame is unfeasible\u00a0and too expensive. They say it would be difficult for water utilities to follow the rules while also dealing with\u00a0new EPA limits on five PFAS\u00a0contaminants, known as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d and\u00a0failing pipes, among other issues. \u201cNobody will tell you that having lead in contact with water is a great idea,\u201d said Steve Via, director of federal relations for the\u00a0American Water Works Association, the country\u2019s largest nonprofit water utility industry group. \u201cThe question becomes: How urgent a matter is it, and at what pace does it need to be done?\u201d Already,\u00a015 Republican state attorneys general\u00a0have argued that the proposed rules infringe on states\u2019 rights and chase \u201cspeculative\u201d benefits. On the other side,\u00a014 Democratic attorneys general\u00a0said that the EPA should find more ways to ensure pipes are quickly replaced in low-income areas. Cost of replacement v. the health costs of lead To be sure,\u00a0no amount of lead is considered safe\u00a0to consume. Lead is a\u00a0neurotoxin known to cause\u00a0irreversible long-term organ damage, lower IQs, higher risk for miscarriage, asthma, cardiovascular disease, impotence, and elevated blood pressure. Public health advocates say societal costs \u2014 in health care, social services, and lost productivity \u2014 far outweigh the cost of replacement. They say corrosion controls that have limited lead exposure can and do fail, pointing to human and systemic errors that prompted the\u00a0water crisis in Flint, Mich., where thousands of people were exposed to high lead levels in their drinking water. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole thing about lead pipes: They unexpectedly release lead into drinking water,\u201d said\u00a0Roya Alkafaji, who manages an initiative focused on reducing lead exposure from water with the\u00a0Environmental Defense Fund, a national advocacy group. \u201cI don\u2019t think kicking the can down the road is the solution.\u201d A lead water service line from 1927 lays on the ground on a residential street after being removed on June 17, 2021, in Denver. According to a\u00a02023 analysis\u00a0by\u00a0Ronnie Levin, an environmental health researcher at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the benefit of replacing lead pipes outweighs the costs by a 35:1 ratio. The EPA estimated $335 million in annual costs to implement water sampling, corrosion control treatments, inventorying and replacement of lead service lines, and educational outreach for the Trump rules. Using that figure, Levin\u2019s analysis shows that $9 billion in annual health care costs could be avoided. An additional $2 billion in spending \u2014 through upgraded infrastructure and reduced corrosion damage to appliances \u2014 could be saved. The broad spectrum of health-related costs has historically been ignored in analyzing the actual costs of leaving lead service lines in place, said Levin, a former EPA scientist. Estimates of the cost to replace the nation\u2019s lead pipes range from\u00a0$46 billion\u00a0to more than\u00a0$90 billion, far higher than the\u00a0$15 billion\u00a0set aside in the\u00a0Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Biden administration has framed those funds as a down payment,\u00a049% of which will be grants\u00a0or principal forgiveness loans\u00a0allocated on the basis\u00a0of the estimated number of lead pipes per state. Other\u00a0funding programs\u00a0can also be tapped. Replacement costs vary widely by location, with average costs ranging from\u00a0the EPA\u2019s 2019 estimate of $4,700\u00a0per service line to\u00a0$12,500 from Via\u2019s utilities trade group. An unrealistic timeline? Carolyn Berndt, legislative director for sustainability at the National League of Cities, said funding challenges could render the EPA\u2019s 10-year timeline unrealistic. While her organization is encouraging local leaders to secure as much funding as possible, what\u2019s available won\u2019t be enough to cover replacement costs for some localities \u2014 especially low-income areas, which often have older infrastructure and more lead pipes. Some direct costs could fall to property owners, such as replacing the lines connecting their water meters to their homes. And people could face indirect costs if utilities increase customer rates to offset the expense. Still, some communities, such as Olathe, Kan., are finding ways to move forward with a patchwork of funding. Out of 37,000 service lines there, 266 galvanized pipes were found serving downtown properties, where many of the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents live. The coating for\u00a0galvanized pipes typically contains lead. Workers will replace the lines at no cost to property owners in the city of 147,000 people outside Kansas City, said Megan Spence, who is\u00a0overseeing the city project. It is expected to cost around $2.3 million, paid for with\u00a0a loan\u00a0from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and about $1.2 million in federal infrastructure funding. About $500,000 for lawn restoration is included. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking at this as an opportunity and another way to protect public health,\u201d said Spence. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any lead lines in any drinking water distribution systems.\u201d Elsewhere, some Republicans, such as Indiana state Sen.\u00a0Eric Koch, are leading the charge to replace the pipes despite historical pushback in conservative states against federal mandates. He said lawmakers should consider the harm \u2014 and long-term costs \u2014 caused by delaying the cleanup of lead from drinking water. In March, Indiana\u2019s Republican Gov.\u00a0Eric Holcomb\u00a0signed a\u00a0unanimously approved bill, which Koch authored, designed to lower costs for replacing customer-owned lead service lines. Under the law, landlords are required to enroll in a state-approved program to have their lead pipes removed at no cost by their water utility or pay for replacement themselves. Koch said estimates for replacing customer-owned service lines are around $8,000, though the cost could be significantly higher for some properties. But by starting the work now, Koch said, utilities can avoid price inflation and ultimately remove pipes more cost efficiently. Meanwhile, time is running out to publish the Biden administration\u2019s proposed rules in the\u00a0Federal Register. Water utilities will be required to comply with the Trump rules as of Oct. 16 unless the EPA publishes the newer rules before then, said\u00a0Erik Olson, a senior strategic director of the National Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. It remains unknown what the June 28 Supreme Court\u00a0ruling on agency rulemaking, known as the \u201cChevron deference\u201d decision, will mean for either set of rules. A deadline is also looming for the 60-day \u201clook-back\u201d period under the\u00a0Congressional Review Act, during which a regulation can be repealed. If control of Congress or the White House flips with the November election, the Biden administration\u2019s rules could be repealed under an emboldened Congress even before the January swearing in of new officeholders. \u201cDepending on how the election goes, it could become a hot issue,\u201d said\u00a0Tom Neltner, national director of the advocacy organization\u00a0Unleaded Kids.

{"id": "2024_07_10_health_cardiac-arrest-anxiety-depression-women-wellness", "text": "The care that comes after a cardiac arrest should include supporting mental health \u2014 especially for women, new research has found. In the five years that followed an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or OHCA, in which the heart suddenly stops beating, women were more likely than men to receive medication to treat anxiety or depression, according to a report published Monday in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. \u201cWe recommend monitoring of social and mental well being in individuals who survived an OHCA, not just directly after the event but also in the long-term,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author, Dr. Robin Smits, in an email. \u201cThis seems particularly relevant in women but will likely also benefit men.\u201d Researchers analyzed data from 259 women and 996 men in the Netherlands who survived at least 30 days after a cardiac arrest that took place outside a hospital between 2009 and 2015. The team compared the data on patients\u2019 socioeconomic status and mental health with those in the general population, according to the study. The amount of women taking anxiety or depression medications after cardiac arrest was also greater than in women in the general population, said Smits, a postdoctoral researcher at Amsterdam University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \u201cFurther investigation may shed light into which interventions are necessary for physicians to be able to help individuals thrive after OHCA,\u201d Smits said. Researchers have been learning more and more about how closely connected mental and cardiac health are, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. One in five people hospitalized for heart attack (a blockage of blood flow to the heart) or chest pain develop major depression \u2014 about four times the rate in the general population, according to the\u00a0American Heart Association. One in three\u00a0stroke survivors become depressed, along with\u00a0up to half\u00a0of those who undergo heart bypass surgery, past studies found. \u201cMental health and stress make cardiac events worse and more frequent, and we know that cardiac events make mental health worse,\u201d he said. Just the start delving into mental and cardiac health This new study investigates an important topic but it\u2019s just the beginning, Freeman said. While the authors did account for factors that might skew the results, there are a lot of them, he said. For example, the research was only able to look at the number of people prescribed medication \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they were the only people experiencing anxiety or depression, Smits said. \u201cThe results may also in part reflect that men may less often seek care for mental health and are perhaps less frequently assessed and prescribed medication,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cMoreover, the data do not fully reflect lived experience, such as forced changes in job responsibilities or effect in other areas of life.\u201d But this study highlights an important concept: that men and women often experience the world differently, and providers need to be conscious of that to give everyone their best care,\u00a0 Freeman said. Checking in on emotional well-being The biggest lesson of this latest research is for loved ones and health care providers to check in on people who have experienced cardiac arrest, Freeman said. \u201cIs there a strategy that we should be taking that\u2019s more proactive after people have a cardiac arrest, to sort of make sure that they\u2019re back on their feet, that they understand that they are amazing survivors in many cases?\u201d he said. Even if the doctor you are following up with isn\u2019t a psychiatrist, it is important to keep an open line of communication about your well-being \u2014 and then you may be referred to a mental health professional, he said. Fortunately, there are a lot of strategies to improve mental health. Past studies have shown cognitive behavioral therapy, regular exercise and proper sleep to be effective tools for managing emotional welfare. \u201cAs a physician, how do we help people avoid or treat these problems as they arise? Or even before they arise?\u201d Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/health/cardiac-arrest-anxiety-depression-women-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk", "text": "GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy may help lower the risk of certain cancers, a new study suggests. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting 13 types of cancer, and the risk increases the longer a person is overweight and the more excess weight they gain. About 40% of new cancer diagnoses are associated with excess weight, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, there were about 170 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people, CDC data shows. But a study published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with a class of GLP-1 drugs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with 10 of the 13 obesity-associated cancers than those who were taking insulin. The risk was cut by more than half for gallbladder cancer, meningioma, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, a kind of liver cancer. It was also significantly reduced for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and kidney cancer. Excess weight can cause changes in the body such as long-lasting inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones that can cause cancer, according to the CDC. And GLP-1 medications interact with systems related to insulin production. The new findings that link GLP-1 treatment to reduced risk of some cancers \u201ccompare favorably\u201d with similar effects linked to intensive lifestyle intervention and metabolic-bariatric surgery that have been found in other trials, the study authors wrote. However, the research found that GLP-1 treatment was not associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, which CDC data shows is the most common type of cancer associated with obesity. Risk was also not reduced for stomach cancer or thyroid cancer. In fact, other research has found that GLP-1s may interact with the body\u2019s insulin production in ways that negatively affect the thyroid, and the study authors note that patients should be aware of potential thyroid-related risks that are included on the medication\u2019s packaging. The new study also found that the risk of cancer diagnosis for people with type 2 diabetes was not different among those who were treated with GLP-1s compared with those where were being treated with metformin. In fact, the risk of diagnosis with kidney cancer was higher among those using GLP-1s than those on metformin. For this study, researchers from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and the MetroHealth System analyzed more than a decade of medical records for nearly 1.7 million people with type 2 diabetes. More information is needed about how reduced cancer risk may relate to the scale of weight loss, but the findings provide \u201cpreliminary evidence of the potential benefit of GLP-1RAs for cancer prevention in high-risk populations and support further preclinical and clinical studies,\u201d the study authors wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness", "text": "More water, please. Millions of Americans are experiencing a record-breaking heat wave that has continued for days on end. We know that keeping hydrated is important to staying healthy in the summer heat, but is water still the best drink during a heat wave? Or should people turn to sports drinks instead? What about soda, coffee and beer \u2014 is it advisable to keep drinking these beverages during extremely hot weather? To help guide us through drinks we should choose \u2014 and avoid \u2014 during hot weather events, I spoke with CNN wellness health expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: How much water should people normally drink, and does that change during extreme hot weather? Dr. Leana Wen: A quick rule of thumb that\u2019s often cited is the \u201c8 x 8 rule,\u201d which is eight 8-ounce glasses of water, or 64 ounces, of water per day for adults. That\u2019s half a gallon. This rule is not set in stone. There are many factors that influence how much water people need, including the type of food they eat, their body size and their physical activity. Other factors include air temperature and humidity, and, specifically, how much time you spend outdoors during hot weather. People working in the heat or otherwise engaging in physical activity should drink an 8-ounce cup of water every 15 to 20 minutes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This would total about 24 to 32 ounces per hour. People should also keep well hydrated before and after their outdoor time in the heat. CNN: Is it possible to drink too much water? Wen: Yes. The CDC guidance is that people should not drink more than 48 ounces (about 1.5 quarts) of water or other fluids in an hour. A large amount of fluid all at once can dilute the concentration of salts in our blood and be unsafe. CNN: When it\u2019s really hot outside, is water still the best fluid, or should people turn to sports drinks?  Wen: Sports drinks are beverages with added electrolytes. Their main purpose is to replenish water and electrolytes that are lost with sweating. These drinks contain electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Some have added sugars like fructose, glucose and sucrose.  Most people do not need drinks other than water. In general, adults engaging in mild to moderate physical activity and kids playing on the playground or doing recreational after-school sports do not need electrolyte replacement. The foods that we eat contain the electrolytes we need. People who could consider sports drinks are athletes who are engaging in vigorous exercise for at least an hour outdoors in hot weather. Again, though, not all these individuals will need electrolyte replacement beyond what they get from eating normally. Whether they do depends on factors such as how much they sweat, how hot and humid the environment is and how intensely they exercise. CNN: What\u2019s better, a sports drink that comes ready-made in a bottle or an electrolyte powder that you can add to make your own drink? Wen: Personally, I prefer the powder. There are also tablets that dissolve in water. These do-it-yourself options are cheaper, and I like to choose the brands that don\u2019t have much added sugar or chemicals. But this is a question of personal preference. Whatever you buy, make sure to look carefully at the ingredients. For instance, if you don\u2019t want added sugar or caffeine, make sure what you\u2019re drinking doesn\u2019t have these ingredients. CNN: What about energy drinks? Are these a good replacement for water? Wen: This is an important question. The short answer is no, energy drinks are not a replacement for water. They should be used with caution in adults, and children should not drink them. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which are meant to help you restore water and electrolytes. Energy drinks are not meant mainly to hydrate you. They often contain large amounts of caffeine and other legal stimulants such as L-carnitine and guarana. While caffeine can boost energy in the short term, it is also a diuretic, meaning that it causes someone to lose water. Too much caffeine also can cause jitteriness, anxiety and irregular heartbeats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against energy drinks for children and adolescents. In some studies, though, as many as 30% to 50% of adolescents report using energy drinks. I urge parents to be careful to distinguish between sports drinks and energy drinks. Neither are needed, but energy drinks, in particular, should be used with caution. CNN: What about other drinks with caffeine, like coffee? Is a cold brew or iced mocha a bad idea in hot weather? Wen: Not necessarily, though people should be aware that these caffeinated drinks may not hydrate you and may even dehydrate you further. This doesn\u2019t mean you should stop all coffee when it\u2019s hot outside. Just be aware of the effect of caffeine and consider drinking extra water while you are enjoying caffeinated beverages. CNN: What about sodas, punches and alcoholic beverages? Wen: Sodas and punches are considered ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to many adverse long-term health consequences, such as increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. Consumption should generally be kept at a minimum, and hot weather is no exception. Again, water is the preferred substance for hydration. Alcohol is best avoided when it\u2019s very hot outside. Be especially careful not to drink large amounts and become inebriated, as this could blunt your body\u2019s response to temperature regulation. You also may miss early signs of heat-related illnesses. Alcohol can be dehydrating as well. If you do choose to drink alcohol, limit your drinks, make sure there are people around you in case you get into trouble medically and be sure to drink plenty of additional nonalcoholic fluids. CNN: What about kids who are in all-day sports camps? Wen: It\u2019s hard to answer this without knowing exactly how the camp is structured. Many sports camps have indoor activities for at least a portion of the day, and even those that are predominantly outdoors should move their activities indoors during extreme heat warnings. When in doubt, it\u2019s advisable to speak with the camp director and ask about how much time will be spent outdoors. If the time is limited, there are regular breaks and much of the activity is low to moderate intensity, it\u2019s probably sufficient to hydrate with water and supplement with nutrient-dense snacks such as watermelon, coconut and avocado. Also focus on hydrating before and after camp. Sports drinks probably aren\u2019t needed, and, again, it\u2019s advisable for children to avoid energy drinks. CNN: What other precautions would you follow during extreme heat? Wen: Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Take extra care of children and the elderly, as well as people with chronic medical conditions that could be exacerbated by the heat. Be careful while exercising and try to move activities indoors or go in the early morning or late evening. And make sure to keep well-hydrated with the best substance for hydration \u2014 water!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death", "text": "Lisa Pisano, the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney, died Sunday,\u00a0according to\u00a0NYU Langone Health, where she had the surgery. Pisano\u00a0received the transplant on April 12, but the organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed May 29. Her case was the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the animal\u2019s thymus gland. Pisano\u00a0was brave and altruistic, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute,\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday. She had said\u00a0during a news conference after the procedure that even if the organ transplant didn\u2019t work for her, it might for the next person. \u201cAt least somebody is going to benefit from it,\u201d she said. Montgomery said Tuesday that \u201cLisa\u2019s contributions to medicine, surgery, and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. \u2026 Lisa helped bring us closer to realizing a future where someone does not have to die for another person to live.\u201d Every eight minutes, another person is added to the transplant waiting list, and 17 people from this list die each day waiting for an organ, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Xenotransplantation, which involves using organs from other species, is a potential solution to the shortage of available donor organs, experts say. Doctors in the US perform xenotransplants in rare cases, with permission from the US Food and Drug Administration. For Pisano, the permission came through the agency\u2019s expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policy, which allows terminally ill patients who have no other treatment options to access experimental medical products. Due to Pisano\u2019s heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, she couldn\u2019t have a standard transplant, NYU Langone said in a news release. Before the xenotransplant, Pisano\u00a0said,\u00a0she had \u201ctried everything else\u201d and, with the surgery, was hoping to spend time with her grandkids and play with them. The pig kidney she received was genetically altered to evade human antibodies, which typically detect and attack foreign organs. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed beneath the pig kidney\u2019s cover to further help Pisano\u2019s body accept the organ. However, the kidney was removed in May after it was determined that it was \u201cno longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen,\u201d Montgomery said at the time. Pisano\u2019s \u201cbravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs,\u201d he said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cHer legacy as a pioneer will live on and she will forever be remembered for her courage and good nature.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_weight-gain-antidepressants-wellness", "text": "Antidepressants can be lifesavers for many struggling with so many mental health diagnoses \u2014 anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet taking these mood-altering substances can lead to an unpleasant side effect for some \u2014 weight gain. While many people never add extra weight, doctors say concerns over additional pounds are a key reason people may be hesitant to start taking an antidepressant for their mental health. Weight gain is also a reason why some stop their medications despite feeling less depressed or anxious while using them. Now, a new study sheds light on just how much weight gain might occur \u2014 on average \u2014 while taking eight of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. One of the most widely prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, also known by brand names Zoloft and Lustral, was associated with an average gain of nearly 0.5 pounds (0.2 kilograms) at six months. That rose to 3.2 pounds (1.46 kilograms) at 24 months, according to the study. Using that as a comparison, researchers found people taking escitalopram, known by the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex, had an average 15% increased risk over sertraline of gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight at six months. The risk was 14% for paroxetine, sold under the names Paxil, Aropax, Pexeva, Seroxat, Sereupin and Brisdelle, the study found. Duloxetine, sold by the brand names Cymbalta, Loxentia and Yentreve, was associated with a 10% increased risk of a patient gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight compared to sertraline, the study said. A weight gain of 5% or more over baseline is considered clinically significant for health, said lead study author Joshua Petimar, an assistant professor of population medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The typical adult gains an average of 1 to 2 pounds per year, which over time, can contribute to obesity. This weight gain can be driven by physical inactivity, stress, poor sleep and poor food choices, such as eating too many ultraprocessed foods, as well as medications, experts say. Weight gain by pounds The study, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, used electronic health record prescription and body mass to compare weight gain among more than 183,000 people. Researchers looked at weight at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months for individuals between the ages of 18 and 80 who were starting an antidepressant for the first time. When analyzing the data by pounds and kilograms of weight gained, people on escitalopram and paroxetine added an average of 1.4 pounds (0.63 kilograms) by six months. By 24 months, weight had risen by 3.6 pounds (1.63 kilograms) for escitalopram and nearly 3 pounds (1.33 kilograms) for paroxetine. Duloxetine was associated with an average gain of 1.2 pounds (0.55 kilograms) at six months and 1.7 pounds (0.78 kilograms) at 24 months. \u201cIn our study, the average weight at baseline was 84 kg, or about 185 lb,\u201d Petimar said in an email. \u201cThis means that in our study, a 5% increase in weight translated on average to a weight gain of 4.2 kg, or about 9 lb.\u201d However, the study found no significantly higher or lower risk for citalopram, sold as Celexa; fluoxetine, sold as Prozac; or venlafaxine, sold as Effexor, Effexor XR, Vensir, Vencarm, Venlalix and Venlablue, when compared to sertraline. \u201cWe need to remember these are average values; many people won\u2019t gain any weight, while others could gain considerably more,\u201d said Dr. Roy Perlis, associate chief of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who conducted a similar study in 2014. He was not involved with the new research. \u201cStill, having average values to work with \u2014 and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies \u2014 at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,\u201d Perlis said in an email. Not all patients perceive weight gain negatively, although it is more common for patients to want to avoid weight gain than to seek it when taking an antidepressant, Petimar said. For example, mirtazapine is an antidepressant that is sometimes used in the treatment of eating disorders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t examine mirtazapine in our study because it\u2019s not considered a common front-line medication for new users of antidepressants,\u201d he said. Weight loss occurred with one drug One antidepressant contributed to a small amount of weight loss at six months, the study found. \u201cBupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) on average had a 15% lower risk of gaining a clinically meaningful amount of weight compared to sertraline,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cOur study didn\u2019t explore reasons why bupropion was associated with less weight gain than other antidepressants, but other studies have similarly concluded that it is associated with less weight gain than other common antidepressants,\u201d he added. When analyzed by pounds or kilograms lost, people who took bupropion dropped almost one quarter of a pound (0.01 kilograms) at six months, before gaining 1.2 pounds (0.56\u00a0kilograms) at 24 months, according to the research. Why do antidepressants contribute to weight gain? Science doesn\u2019t yet know, Perlis said. \u201cRemarkably, we don\u2019t know the precise mechanism by which antidepressants contribute to weight changes. Worse, we really don\u2019t know much about who is most\u00a0likely to gain or lose weight, so we can\u2019t make good predictions in advance,\u201d he said. One caution, Perlis said, is that some people lose weight when depressed and lose their appetite. \u201cSome of what we\u2019re seeing may be people regaining weight they\u2019d lost as their depression or anxiety improves.\u201d The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them, experts say. \u201cPatients who are concerned about weight gain should have an open and honest conversation with their clinician about their concerns,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cThere are many clinical factors that determine which medication is right for a given patient,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cThese include the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, their medical history, any other drugs that they are already taking, and possible side effects that the patient is concerned about.\u201d Clinicians have to weigh all of these factors when they decide which is the best course of treatment, he added, while patients can strive to avoid weight gain by following healthy eating habits and exercising regularly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/weight-gain-antidepressants-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_sleep-eating-disorder-wellness", "text": "Jill was in middle school when she began eating in her sleep. Despite carrying the food back to her bed to devour night after night, she didn\u2019t have a clue about what she had done until the next morning. \u201cI would wake up with these containers or wrappers from an entire box of crackers or cookies on my bed or by the side of my bed,\u201d said Jill, now 62, who lives an hour away from Minneapolis. Due to stigma and misunderstanding about sleep eating, CNN\u00a0agreed not to use her last name. \u201cA lot of people think this condition is, \u2018Oh, you get up and you have a snack and then you go back to bed.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not what this is. This is a whole other animal,\u201d Jill said of her unconscious nocturnal behaviors. \u201cI don\u2019t just get up once and take a bite of this or that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can eat a whole package of cookies, then get up again and have four bowls of cereal, then get up again and have an entire box of graham crackers. And it is always junky junk food, never, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have an apple.\u2019\u201d Over time, nights of poor nutrition and dysfunctional sleep can take a toll, Jill said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how sick you feel,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten up countless times during the night, so you\u2019re not rested, and you\u2019ve consumed enormous amounts of garbage food. Then you wake up and boom, you have to function the rest of the day. And that\u2019s what I did for years and years and years.\u201d Jill is living with sleep-related eating disorder, also known as sleep eating \u2014 an arousal condition in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Sleep eating is a parasomnia, an abnormal or unusual behavior during sleep, similar to sleepwalking, sleep talking, sleep terrors, and sleep sex, or sexsomnia. \u201cOf all the parasomnias, sleep-related eating disorder has the worst impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThese people have disinhibited eating almost every night. They gain weight. They feel miserable in the morning. It affects their whole life and is just horrendous,\u201d said Schenck, who specializes in treating parasomnias. While it may seem as if people are acting out their dreams, parasomnias most often occur during the slowest, deepest stage of sleep called delta sleep, he said. \u201cSomething triggers an alarm in the central nervous system, and your body is activated while your cognition is deeply asleep,\u201d he said. No control or restraint In the mixed state of sleep and wakefulness that is sleep eating, the ancient brain takes over, searching out foods that might satisfy the body\u2019s need for gratification. Ultraprocessed foods such as candy, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, chips and crackers are preferred choices during sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any control, you don\u2019t have any restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can consume foods they\u2019re allergic to and then have an allergic reaction. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. \u201cAnd because they choose foods like peanut butter, chocolate, leftover banana cream pie or pasta \u2014 fattening, overly processed comfort foods \u2014 they can develop or aggravate their diabetes or hypertension.\u201d Of all the parasomnias, sleep eating is the most challenging to treat, with a success rate of only two-thirds, Schenck said. In comparison, treatment success is more than 75% for patients with sexsomnia, sleepwalking or night terrors. \u201cYou can have someone who\u2019s been a sleepwalker for many years, but once they start eating during the night, before long, eating becomes the only sleepwalking behavior,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s something irresistible about consuming food during the night and sleepwalking \u2014 who wants to rearrange the furniture or just wander around the house when you can go eat?\u201d \u2018The doctors didn\u2019t understand it\u2019 Married in her early 20s, Jill continued to eat in bed at night alongside her new husband. Thankfully, she said, he was a heavy sleeper. \u201cHe would wake up in the morning to a bed full of crumbs and wrappers and say, \u2018What is wrong with you?\u2019 He thought I was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand. And I didn\u2019t understand because I wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose.\u201d Jill\u2019s health suffered. Not only did she gain weight from all the extra calories, but the quality of her diet dropped dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m a healthy eater, but I often felt so sick throughout the day, the last thing I wanted was food, even healthy food,\u201d Jill said. \u201cWho would when you ate the equivalent of six Thanksgiving dinners back-to-back every night?\u201d Embarrassed by her behavior, Jill kept her sleep habits to herself for decades. It wasn\u2019t until her son developed a disorder called idiopathic hypersomnolence, in which he would sleep for 18 or more hours at a time, that she began asking doctors about her own condition. Unfortunately, she said, broaching the topic didn\u2019t go well. \u201cMany doctors I spoke to had no idea what was wrong with me, or they just didn\u2019t get it. One doctor said, \u2018Well, maybe have a piece of bread before you go to bed.\u2019 Oh, right, that\u2019s sure to solve it,\u201d Jill said disdainfully. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this disorder or aren\u2019t living with it, you\u2019re not going to have a full understanding, but I really thought that doctors would know more,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the problem was then I felt alone, believing something was wrong with me \u2014 because the doctors didn\u2019t understand it, it must be my fault.\u201d Causes of sleep eating After years of disappointing doctor visits, Jill discovered Schenck\u2019s treatment center in Minneapolis. For the first time, she underwent a lab sleep study, which showed that she had restless legs syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes unpleasant sensations in the legs along with an irresistible urge to move them.\u00a0The sensations often begin in the evenings and can last throughout the night. \u201cIt\u2019s now become restless body syndrome,\u201d Jill said. \u201cIt\u2019s a twitching, almost like a bug is crawling inside that travels through my whole body.\u201d To ease the constant twitching during the evenings before sleep, Jill may walk around the house, flailing her arms and legs in a desperate bid to stop the sensation. \u201cYou just become so miserable, so uncomfortable, that you\u2019re swinging your body parts, kind of trying to tire them out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some nights that the twitching is just, oh, I can\u2019t even tell you, I\u2019m in tears it\u2019s so bad.\u201d Restless legs syndrome is one of four potential causes of sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou can develop sleep eating from sleepwalking, from sleep apnea, from certain insomnia medications, or like Jill, from restless legs syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those can be the ultimate causes of sleep-related eating disorder, and that\u2019s why in medicine, we call that a final common pathway disorder. All roads lead to Rome basically.\u201d Jill, however, was sleep eating long before restless legs syndrome became a key complaint. Research has shown sleep eating may occur first, Schenck said. \u201cWe studied a group of sleep-related eating patients in the lab, and they had periodic limb movements along with the sleep eating,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, lo and behold, five or 10 years later they developed classic restless legs syndrome. So sleep-related eating can be the first indicator of future restless legs syndrome.\u201d Other risk factors for sleep eating include a family history of eating disorders of any kind as well as the person\u2019s sex, Schenck said. \u201cSleep-related eating is like 70% female predominant, while sexsomnia, for example, is 80% male predominant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that society\u2019s emphasis on dieting may contribute; if someone restricts their eating during the daytime and doesn\u2019t get enough calories, that may drive more sleep-related eating.\u201d Jill\u2019s mother was always on a diet, she recalls, and wonders if that factor might have contributed to her behavior. \u201cYou know, the big thing was you had to be thin, and I wonder if as a kid I was picking up on it. But I really don\u2019t know,\u201d Jill said. Families may try to help their loved ones by waking them while they are sleep eating, Schenck said. At times, however, doing so can backfire. \u201cThe person may get irritable and angry and say, \u2018Don\u2019t stop me from doing what I have to do.\u2019 I once treated a single mother with three teenage kids who paid her three children to sleep in sleeping bags in the kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she would come into the kitchen during the night, her children would say, \u2018Stop, you paid us to have you stop!\u2019 Guess what happened? She got so frustrated she paid her children more money to go back to their own beds and let her eat in peace.\u201d \u2018Just don\u2019t give up\u2019 It has been more than 20 years since Jill first visited Schenck\u2019s clinic. Today, her restless legs syndrome and sleep-related eating disorder are mostly under control, she said, thanks to a cocktail of three medications Schenck prescribed. \u201cI take them early at night because it takes awhile for the meds to work \u2014 even Dr. Schenck was surprised I take them as early as I do to get my system to calm down by bedtime. \u201cThe medications work 95% of the time, but then I will have the occasional bad day and night,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t work, it\u2019s just exhausting.\u201d She does her best to keep overly processed trigger foods out of her home, a desire that is at times sabotaged by the treats she has on hand when her grandchildren visit. But life is enormously better than before she began treatment. \u201cI\u2019m very, very, very grateful that I finally found someone who understands what I am going through,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI know there are thousands of people out there suffering just like me, and my heart goes out to them. It is a tough journey to go through.\u201d Her advice to others? Be your own best advocate, she said. Do research and read what you can about the disorder so you know the right questions to ask the doctor. And above all, she said, request a prescription for a sleep study to find out what is triggering the behavior. \u201cDon\u2019t let doctors put you down, blow you off or make you feel bad,\u201d she said. \u201cOne doctor might not want to do a sleep study, so find another doctor that will. \u201cJust keep fighting until you get the right doctor. Get a second opinion, even a third opinion if you think you need to. Just don\u2019t give up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/sleep-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_how-to-do-hammer-curls-wellness", "text": "While there is no magic bullet for gaining strength, variety is key. To that end, although classic bicep curls often take center stage for building arm strength, another arm exercise deserves attention in your workouts: the hammer curl. This powerful movement not only builds impressive arm muscles but also enhances overall body strength, function, stability and resiliency. Hammer curls are a variation of regular bicep curls. Like their traditional counterpart, one of the primary muscles targeted by hammer curls include the biceps brachii, the muscle best known as \u201cthe bicep.\u201d However, hammer curls also emphasize two other arm muscles: the brachialis, a muscle beneath the biceps brachii that helps support the elbow joint, and the brachioradialis, a forearm muscle that enhances grip strength. Aptly named, hammer curls mimic the action of holding and using a hammer. Unlike regular bicep curls, which use a palms-up grip, hammer curls are performed with a neutral grip with palms facing each other. This simple adjustment shifts the muscle focus for more comprehensive strength development. This variation also decreases wrist and elbow strain, reducing the risk of overuse injuries and making it a safer option for those with joint concerns. The everyday functional benefits of hammer curls Despite their somewhat obscure reputation, hammer curls aren\u2019t just for gym enthusiasts. This exercise can benefit anyone wanting to improve their ability to perform the physical tasks of daily living. Here\u2019s a detailed list of benefits: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Because the neutral hand position needed to perform hammer curls boosts forearm and grip strength, it also boosts your ability to hold and lift heavier weights to make greater total-body strength gains in other exercises, as well as enhanced performance in other fitness and sport activities. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Hammer curls build arm and hand muscles needed for daily activities that require lifting, holding, and carrying, such as caring for children and performing household tasks and yard work. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Enhanced grip strength also helps with opening jars, using tools and completing basic household tasks, making hammer curls particularly beneficial for older adults trying to maintain functional independence. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 The controlled motion and neutral grip of hammer curls help strengthen the muscles and tendons around the elbow and wrist joints, reducing the risk of common injuries associated with weaker muscles and improper lifting techniques. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 With less wrist rotation than traditional curls, hammer curls minimize the risk of injury, especially for those people with previous wrist or elbow issues. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Performing hammer curls correctly involves significant core engagement, which improves balance and overall strength. \u2022\u00a0Bonus: For anyone wanting more visibly toned arms, hammer curls build up the brachialis muscle, which underlies the primary biceps brachii muscle and boosts muscle visibility even when your arms are not flexed. How to perform hammer curls To reap the full benefits of hammer curls, it is crucial to perform them with proper form and an appropriate weight for your fitness level. Use a weight that feels challenging but is light enough that you can comfortably perform at least eight repetitions of the exercise with good form. Be sure to mind the cues for how to breathe as you perform this exercise, exhaling as you lift the weights and inhaling as you lower them. Proper breathing mechanics help maintain and strengthen core stability to ensure correct form. 1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells at your sides with your palms facing inward in a neutral grip. Alternatively, you can be seated as long you can sit forward enough on the seat edge for the dumbbells to hang unobstructed at your sides. 2. Exhale as you slowly curl both dumbbells up toward your shoulders, keeping your elbows close to your torso and your core braced to remain stable. Pause slightly at the top of the movement. 3. Inhale as you lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent. Take your time, lowering your arms gradually, as the eccentric (lowering) phase is a crucial part of the exercise. 4. Repeat for 8 to 12 reps with good form. 5. Complete two to three sets of your desired number of repetitions, resting for at least one to two minutes in between sets. Optional variation: If you feel more comfortable lifting one arm at a time rather than both together, you can alternate right and left repetitions within each set to perform a total of 16 to 24 reps (8 to 12 reps on each arm) per set. To maintain proper form and decrease risk of injury, avoid these common mistakes: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swinging the dumbbells to use momentum to lift them rather than bracing through your core and relying on your arm strength \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Losing proper arm position and letting your elbows flare out \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using dumbbells that are too heavy or too light \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neglecting the eccentric (lowering) phase and dropping the weights too quickly \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Forgetting to breathe properly and maintain core stability As you begin feeling stronger in the exercise, you can progress by increasing the weight of your dumbbells or the number of repetitions within the 8 to 12 rep range. You may find that when you initially increase the weight, you need to decrease your reps to maintain good form. That is OK provided you can still perform a minimum of eight reps properly. Getting the most out of this new exercise To maximize the benefits of hammer curls, you need to integrate them into your fitness program a couple times per week. Hammer curls fit well into both arm-specific and full-body workout days. They can be alternated with other bicep and tricep exercises for a comprehensive arm workout or included in a circuit that features a mix of upper and lower body exercises. Remember, hammer curls are more than just an alternative to bicep curls. By incorporating this exercise into your routine, you can significantly enhance not only your arm strength but also your functional abilities essential for daily activities and overall improvement of total-body strength and resiliency for years to come.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/how-to-do-hammer-curls-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

Prophet Premium Blends issued a\u00a0recall\u00a0of Diamond Shruumz products last week, citing muscimol, a chemical from Amanita mushrooms, as the possible cause of the reported symptoms. The FDA is reviewing this information, and according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the cause of the reported illnesses is not known. The company says in a notice on the Diamond Shruumz website, \u201cAt Prophet Premium Blends, we prioritize the health and safety of our consumers above all else. Recently, we have been\u00a0made aware of reported incidents involving our product,\u00a0Diamond Shruumz. Due to consumers becoming ill after consuming the entire chocolate bar and some products containing higher levels of\u00a0Muscimol\u00a0than normal, it is crucial that all of our consumers refrain from ingesting this product while we, alongside the FDA,\u00a0continue our investigation as to what is the cause of the serious\u00a0adverse effects.\u201d The company has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for further comment. Reported symptoms have included\u00a0seizures, involuntary muscle contractions, loss of consciousness, confusion, vomiting and abnormal heart rates, according to the FDA. The FDA and the CDC are collaborating with partners including America\u2019s Poison Centers to assess the illnesses. The FDA is testing samples of Diamond Shruumz\u2019s products and said it noted the presence of synthetic psychedelic substances in the brand\u2019s Dark Chocolate Bar and Birthday Cake Chocolate Bar, including the hallucinogen psilacetin. The compound is structurally similar to psilocybin, psilocin, dimethyltryptamine and lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD, according to the CDC. Psilocybin and psilocin are the primary hallucinogenic compounds in magic mushrooms, according to the\u00a0European Union Drugs Agency. \u201cIndividuals who use these substances can experience hallucinations, visual illusions, and other sensory changes,\u201d the CDC said. \u201cSome patients may have adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, fast heart rate, anxiety, agitation, lightheadedness, or tremor.\u201d Additional testing on a wider range of Diamond Shruumz products and interpretations of the results and their health implications are underway, the FDA said. Diamond Shruumz Infused Cones, Chocolate Bars and Gummies (Micro- and Mega/Extreme-Dose) were distributed nationwide through retail stores and mail orders.

The case was flagged Friday from preliminary test results, and the potential source of the infection is still under investigation, the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment said in a\u00a0news release. The plague is an infectious disease caused by bacterium, Yersinia pestis, transmitted by fleas. Although it is best known for \u201cThe Black Death,\u201d an outbreak that killed millions of Europeans during the Middle Ages, the bacteria circulates naturally among wild rodents and\u00a0rarely\u00a0infects humans today, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Plague is transmitted to humans through bites from infected fleas, contact with infected animals or inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. Anyone who develops symptoms of plague should get medical attention immediately, the CDC says. Typical symptoms include sudden fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and, commonly, swollen lymph nodes with pain. \u201cPlague can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but an infected person must be treated promptly to avoid serious complications or death,\u201d said Alicia Solis, program manager of the Office of Communicable Disease and Emergency Preparedness at the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment, in the news release. \u201cWe advise all individuals to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\u201d the department says. One way to avoid infection is to eliminate places where wild rodents can exist around humans such as brush, rock piles, trash and piles of lumber around homes, garages, sheds and recreation areas, according to the department. Taking precautions around pets can also reduce risk of transmission. The department suggests treating dogs and cats for fleas, keeping pet food in rodent-proof containers and not letting pets roam in rodent areas or sleep in bed with you. From 1970 to 2022, there were 67 reported cases of plague in Colorado, according to the CDC. Worldwide, 3,248 human plague cases were reported from 2010 to 2015, most commonly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Peru, the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0found. \u201cA plague vaccine is no longer available in the United States,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cNew plague vaccines are in development but are not expected to be commercially available in the immediate future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/human-plague-case-colorado/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_science_fossil-chromosomes-woolly-mammoth-skin-discovery", "text": "A piece of woolly mammoth skin excavated from the Siberian permafrost has been found to contain fossil chromosomes in a first-of-its-kind discovery, according to a new study. Researchers unearthed the 52,000-year-old remains in 2018 near the village of Belaya Gora in northeastern Siberia, where freezing temperatures helped preserve the structure of the chromosomes \u2014 tiny threadlike structures that carry genetic material, or DNA \u2014 in fine detail. While ancient DNA samples have been found many times before, they are typically highly fragmented and contain only hundreds of letters of genetic code. The fossil chromosomes contain millions, offering a far more complete picture of an animal\u2019s genetic code. \u201cFossil chromosomes have never been found before,\u201d said Erez Lieberman Aiden, a professor of molecular and human genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine and co-corresponding author of the study published Thursday in the journal Cell. In prior findings, the fragments were also lacking an organized structure, Lieberman Aiden added. \u201cHere, the fragments are clearly arranged in 3D \u2014 essentially as they were in the original chromosomes in the living mammoth.\u201d The chromosomes, which the researchers point out are \u201cnon-mineralized fossils, or subfossils,\u201d are in a state of preservation good enough to assemble the genome, or the sum of all the genetic material, of an extinct species, according to Olga Dudchenko, an assistant professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor College of Medicine and co-first author of the study. \u201cWe strongly believe that this is not going to apply to just the mammoth or this particular mammoth,\u201d said Dudchenko, who is also a senior investigator at the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics at Rice University, \u201cbut is basically opening up a new field that has tremendous potential.\u201d DNA diffusion DNA within different cell types is laid out in distinct and specific 3D structures that give insight into the particular properties or traits of that cell type, said Kevin Campbell, a professor of environmental and evolutionary physiology at the University of Manitoba in Canada, who was not involved in the study. Upon death, body cells quickly degrade, and this 3D structure is lost within a few days or less, he added. In Arctic animals such as the woolly mammoth, the degradation is slower due to freezing temperatures, but the DNA still becomes damaged, and over long periods it is expected to lose the structure and the attributes that make up the species\u2019 biology. \u201cHowever, this study is the first to demonstrate that this is not necessarily always the case,\u201d Campbell said in an email. \u201cDNA is a very, very long molecule, and once it sits there after an animal dies, it starts to degrade and gets chopped into shorter pieces,\u201d Dudchenko said. \u201cWhat you normally expect is that all of these pieces will start shifting in respect to each other and just kind of float away, losing any organization that was there,\u201d Dudchenko said. \u201cBut clearly, in this particular sample, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d This loss of structure is called diffusion, and how to prevent it is well-known to food scientists \u2014 and not dissimilar from the making of beef jerky, she added. \u201cArresting diffusion is key to preserving foods, so if you want to have something that is shelf stable for a long time, you basically need a combination of dehydration and cooling,\u201d she said. \u201cAny shelf stable food that\u2019s not canned is probably in a state of arrest of diffusion.\u201d When the mammoth the skin sample came from died, conditions might have been just right to kick-start this process naturally. \u201c(The carcass) could have spontaneously undergone the same procedure that right now we use commercially all the time,\u201d Dudchenko said, \u201cremoving substantial amounts of water, arresting diffusion inside and locking those pieces of chromosomes in place, allowing us to read them off 52,000 years after the fact.\u201d But even though it was well preserved, the DNA was not completely intact. \u201cEach chromosome, originally one DNA molecule, has fragmented into millions of DNA molecules,\u201d Aiden said in an email. \u201cBut the molecules have otherwise not moved terribly much, even at the nanometer scale, which is why we call it a fossil chromosome.\u201d If this sample were a book, Lieberman Aiden said, the binding would be gone, leaving a large number of unbound pages, or DNA fragments. Diffusion is like the wind blowing the pages away, making it impossible to put them back in order. But in this sample, the pages never got blown away; they remained in a neat pile, just as they were before the binding was lost. Shooting beef jerky The researchers confirmed this theory of preservation by running some experiments on beef jerky to see how badly they could mistreat the meat snack before the chromosomes inside it lost their structure. \u201cWe decided to test how far this beautiful molecule can resist stress and harm by having one of the pitchers from the Houston Astros throw a fastball at it and firing a shotgun at it,\u201d said Dr. Cynthia P\u00e9rez Estrada, co-first author of the study and a researcher at the Center for Genome Architecture at Baylor and at Rice\u2019s Center for Theoretical Biological Physics. \u201cThe beef jerky was breaking more and more, but the DNA structure was still there, telling us that DNA is extremely resistant and even more so in this type of glass-like state (like in the sample), where the molecules are basically frozen and behaving like a crystal,\u201d P\u00e9rez Estrada added. With the newly discovered genetic information found in the skin samples, the researchers were able to determine for the first time that the woolly mammoth had 28 pairs of chromosomes, just like modern elephants. But the structure allowed them to go one step further and see which individual genes were active in the animal. \u201cEverybody wants to know what exactly made it woolly,\u201d Dudchenko said, \u201cand we have some ideas thanks to the way that these chromosomes were preserved.\u201d Mammoth dreams The researchers were able to compare individual genes from the mammoth sample with the equivalent ones in modern elephants, noting differences in the activity of genes that regulate hair follicles. But the DNA from elephants was also needed to assemble the mammoth genome. \u201cOur dream and hope was to assemble the mammoth genome completely, but right now, this is not quite where we are \u2014 we still used some information from its closest relatives to help, because the amount of data that we were able to get from the mammoth was lower than what you typically need,\u201d Dudchenko said. \u201cBut the fundamentals tell us that, as we continue working towards this, we will be able to do it (without the help of elephant DNA).\u201d Could fossil chromosomes make the dream of resurrecting the woolly mammoth a reality? \u201cThe fundamental biology that we learn from this is going to be useful, there is no question about it,\u201d Dudchenko said. \u201cAre we closer? One step closer, but there\u2019s still quite a few steps ahead and all sorts of other considerations that are beyond fundamental science.\u201d The researchers also hope that the same methodology used on the mammoth sample can be applied to samples from other species. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to find chromosome structures in museum specimens,\u201d said Marcela Sandoval-Velasco, a guest researcher at the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and co-first author of the study. \u201cNot only permafrost specimens, because that narrows it a lot, but also samples from museum collections. There\u2019s an enormous potential there,\u201d she added, citing the woolly rhino, extinct lions and the passenger pigeon as some of the extinct species that scientists might find out more about this way. That potential opens the door to further discoveries, according to P\u00e9rez Estrada. \u201cIt will take an immense effort to find suitable samples, so there will be a lot of work ahead \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we then discovered something new and completely different from what we have right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is also a really exciting open question: What else and what other physical attributes (of DNA) can be preserved?\u201d Exciting findings Researchers who were not involved with the study expressed enthusiasm about the findings. This study is the first to reconstruct the structure, or architecture, of a genome from an extinct species that lived during the last ice age, said Peter Heintzman, a paleogeneticist at Stockholm University in Sweden. \u201cThis structural information provides insights into functions of the woolly mammoth genome that were invisible using previous genomic methods,\u201d Heintzman said in an email. \u201cThis advance therefore helps to unlock a new and exciting frontier in paleogenomics, the study of ancient genomes, and will likely provide further insight into how extinct species evolved, lived, and died out.\u201d Because of how substantially degraded and fragmented DNA from ancient samples usually is, it was surprising to see the high-quality, chromosome-level reconstruction of the mammoth genome reported by this study, said Dmitry Filatov, a professor of biology at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. \u201cIt is even more surprising that the researchers managed to infer which genes were active and which were switched off in the mammoth sample and compare this with gene expression in elephants,\u201d Filatov said in an email. \u201cThis will certainly stimulate further paleo-genomic research in other species.\u201d Hendrik Poinar, director of the Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University in Ontario, called the paper \u201csuper exciting.\u201d Normally with fossil remains researchers can\u2019t do anything remotely close to assembling a genome, Poinar said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many tissue samples will have this level of preservation,\u201d he added in an email, \u201cbut I do think the method will make us think about novel ways to get DNA out of tissues in ways other than what we are used to.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/science/fossil-chromosomes-woolly-mammoth-skin-discovery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

Experiencing gratitude is beneficial for physical health and emotional well-being, past research has shown. Now, a new study has found those who experience more gratitude also have a lower risk of dying. The report is the first to examine the effects of gratefulness on longevity, experts say. The researchers used data from the\u00a0Nurses\u2019 Health Study,\u00a0which included nearly 50,000 women between ages 69 and 96 who completed a six-item\u00a0gratitude questionnaire\u00a0in 2016. By asking participants to rank how strongly they agreed with statements such as \u201cI have so much in life to be thankful for\u201d and \u201cI am grateful to a wide variety of people,\u201d the research team was able to determine the percentage of women who had the highest and lowest feelings of gratitude. When the researchers reviewed the data three years later, they found the women who had the highest levels of gratitude experienced a 9% lower risk of death of any cause, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disease, according to the study published July 3 in the\u00a0journal JAMA Psychiatry. \u201cGratitude is powerful: powerful for happiness, powerful for addressing at least more minor depressive symptoms, powerful for improving health, powerful for protecting against premature death \u2014 and it is something that anyone can do,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Tyler VanderWeele, who is the John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. During the three years of follow-up in the study, there were 4,608 deaths among participants \u2014 2,153 of those were women who reported experiencing the lowest amount of gratitude, while 1,273 deaths were of women who were in the middle tier. There were 1,182 deaths among women who reported the highest amount of gratitude. The study also found those who reported feeling more gratitude were more likely to be slightly younger, have a partner, participate in social or religious groups, or have overall better health. \u201cI think things that are going well in life, whether that\u2019s one\u2019s health or one\u2019s social relationships, (it\u2019s) going to make one more grateful,\u201d said VanderWeele, who is also director of the\u00a0Human Flourishing Program, which aims to study and promote human well-being, and codirector of the\u00a0Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion\u00a0at Harvard. For the analysis of longevity, researchers controlled the data group by comparing similar women who only differed in their gratitude scores, VanderWeele said.\u00a0The researchers controlled for factors such as psychological well-being, health issues and other demographics including social and religious participation. \u201cIt\u2019s still quite meaningful \u2014 even after controlling for social connectedness and other aspects of psychological well-being and a host of baseline health characteristics and money and income and so on \u2014 you\u2019re still finding those who are grateful versus those who are not with about a 10% reduced mortality risk,\u201d VanderWeele said. \u201cThose other things are important, but it doesn\u2019t explain away the whole of the effect of gratitude.\u201d The authors noted in the study that the participants were mostly White, older women in the United States, and future studies with a more representative sample would be needed to find out more on the effects of gratitude and longevity for other demographics. How to practice gratitude \u201cIt\u2019s not completely surprising to me, just given what we know on the health benefits\u00a0of positive emotions\u00a0more generally, that a person\u2019s disposition for gratitude might actually even lengthen their life,\u201d said Dr. Philip Watkins, a professor of psychology at Eastern Washington University and author of the book \u201cGratitude and the Good Life: Toward a Psychology of Appreciation.\u201d Research has found that gratitude benefits individuals\u2019 happiness and flourishing, added Watkins, who was not involved with the new study. Having more gratitude has been linked to improving\u00a0physical health, such as strengthening the\u00a0immune system, lowering blood pressure and benefiting the\u00a0heart. Those who are more grateful also tend to get a better night\u2019s sleep and have\u00a0increased self-esteem\u00a0and lower anxiety, stress and\u00a0depression\u00a0levels. While the new study looked at people who are naturally more grateful, there are ways to practice having more gratitude on a day-to-day basis, said Dr. Emiliana\u00a0Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center \u2014 a research institute that studies the psychology, sociology, and\u00a0neuroscience of well-being\u00a0\u2014 at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for each individual to start from a place of their own comfort zone,\u201d said Simon-Thomas, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cIt is unfair to demand gratitude from anyone if they\u2019re feeling particularly impoverished. But it\u2019s not unfair to point out some of the simple and easy immediate factors that are actually a source of goodness. \u201cIt could be (as simple as) the feeling of warm sun through a window on your shoulder \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of really noticing that there are things around you even in moments that are difficult,\u201d she added. There are three strategies Simon-Thomas recommends for those looking to implement more feelings of gratitude. First, keep a gratitude journal where you can write a few things you are grateful for, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a washing machine in your home, or electric light, or the opportunity to go on a camping trip with friends \u2014 the list could go on.\u201d Another way to practice gratitude is by writing letters to others who have had a positive impact on your life; the sense of gratitude is even more pronounced when those letters are delivered to the other person, Simon-Thomas said. A third way to feel more gratitude is to be more specific when giving out thanks \u2014 when someone gets you a coffee to start your day, instead of just saying, \u201cThank you,\u201d try to extend it to something like, \u201cI really appreciate that you brought me a coffee today, I know you have a lot of other things to do \u2026 and I got a lot of stuff done, because you brought me back coffee,\u201d Simon-Thomas said. There\u2019s no clear consensus on how often one should practice gratitude, Simon-Thomas said. She recommends trying out different methods for what feels right to you. Practicing gratitude is not only key for health and well-being, but it is also important to try to be more grateful because it is a good virtue and can positively affect your relationships, too, Watkins said. Having more gratitude has also been linked to being more optimistic in general, and people who express higher levels of gratitude tend to look more for the good in life, Watkins added. \u201cResearch shows we have a lot more good stuff happen to us than bad stuff, but we very easily focus on the bad stuff,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons gratitude \u2026 and being a grateful person is so important is because they help us have a more balanced view of life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/gratitude-benefits-longer-life-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_summer-body-image-wellness", "text": "Did you sculpt your \u201cbikini body\u201d? Is your skin soft and tan and free of body hair? Are you ready for your summer vacation? The pressures around how people\u2019s bodies look can feel particularly high in summer, and it can come from everywhere: advertisements, celebrities, influencers, your friends on social media and even that voice in your head when looking in the mirror. \u201cI see it impact people \u2026 whether it\u2019s a mom who doesn\u2019t let herself go in the pool with her kids because she\u2019s afraid of how she looks in a swimsuit, or people with eating disorders who will choose to not go out with friends because they\u2019re struggling particularly hard that day,\u201d said Rebecca Moravec, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Denver. \u201cThe way we\u2019re in relationship with our bodies directly impacts how we participate in our day-to-day life.\u201d Body image is the way you think and feel about your body, but it isn\u2019t influenced just by what you see in the mirror, said Bri Campos, a body image coach in Paramus, New Jersey. Messages from the culture around you and even your broader mental health can affect your relationship with your body, she said. In the thick of summer, here are the things that might be affecting your relationship with your body and what you can do about them \u2014 so you can enjoy the season with less stress. Comfort and connection In addition to all the messages about what people should look like, the physical sensations of summer often bring increased attention to people\u2019s bodies, Campos said. \u201cYou\u2019re being forced to feel your body when you\u2019re forced to feel that sweat, to feel that heat \u2014 it can be really uncomfortable,\u201d she said. But instead of acknowledging that heat, sweating, sticking and chafing are just part of the experience of summer, people often attribute it to a problem with themselves, Campos said. \u201cWhen we experience discomfort, our brain is automatically going to try to find whose fault is it. And for most of us, we\u2019re going to blame our body,\u201d she added. For a better relationship with your body this summer, Campos recommends finding ways to connect with yourself in more enjoyable ways. Wearing ill-fitting clothing \u2014 whether too large or too small \u2014 will make you feel uncomfortable and angry at your body all day, she said. Instead, put something on that feels good. And look for ways to connect with your body that aren\u2019t uncomfortable \u2014 such as focusing your attention on how it feels to dunk in a cool pool, take that first sip of coffee in the morning, cuddle with a pet or hug someone you love, she said. \u201cThat is a connected moment where I can say, \u2018This feels good in my body,\u2019\u201d Campos said. Instagram vs. reality Summer can look glamorous on social media \u2014 perfectly posed bathing suit pictures, luxurious vacations and radiant sunshine. It can feel as though everyone is having a better and more beautiful time than you, Moravec said. And many people think if they don\u2019t fit that image, everyone will notice, said Dr. Whitney Trotter, a doctor of nursing practice, psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner and registered dietitian in Austin, Texas. Campos\u2019 clients often share that they feel worried about going to cookouts and get-togethers over the summer because they think others will be eyeing the choices they make around food. \u201cMost people are worried about their own bodies, and they\u2019re worried about their own food choices, but yet the pressure is still there,\u201d she said. One helpful practice can be to go out into the world \u2014 parties, the beach, the pool or restaurants \u2014 and simply observe who is out there participating, Moravec said. It isn\u2019t just the curated images of social media. Instead you\u2019ll find people of all shapes, sizes and backgrounds who are getting together and having fun. \u201cThe reality is that life is happening with or without (the image management),\u201d she said. \u201cIf you were to focus on simply connecting with other people connecting with yourself, what would life look like?\u201d Looking for belonging Often, behind the efforts to achieve the socially ideal body are notions that you will have access to the more important things once you get it. \u201cWe all carry an underlying story about what we need or who we need to be to get love or belonging or safety,\u201d Moravec said. And bodies are an easy target. If only you looked different, then maybe you would also be staring at a sunset with someone you love, splashing in the waves happily with your kids or enjoying a vacation with a group of close friends, right? \u201cOur work is to really challenge that,\u201d Moravec said. \u201cWhen I think about the friends that I have the deepest friendships with, I\u2019m not thinking about how tan their skin is. I\u2019m not thinking about how they look in a bathing suit.\u201d The idea that a different image may help foster a sense of belonging in a season of vacationing may feel present for people of color, Trotter said. \u201cFor African Americans, (vacationing in popular locations) was not always available,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is kind of this pressure now \u2026 \u2018How do I vacation the right way?\u2019 \u201cAnd oftentimes, that leads to dieting and weight loss, because they want to have a thin body, or a body that appears more accessible,\u201d Trotter said. Moravec recommends shifting the focus away from how your body looks and striving toward those things you desire in your life. \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s having a hard body image day \u2026 I want them to check in about what else is going on,\u201d she said. \u201cAre they feeling lonely? Are they feeling disconnected? Are they not feeling good enough?\u201d Rarely, if ever, do we love people just because of how they look, so there are better ways than changing your body to get the connection you are looking for, Moravec said. Can you spend more quality time with your loved ones? Can you be more present by playing in the pool without worrying about what you look like? Be aware that changing your body doesn\u2019t always mean problems of connection and belonging will be fixed, Campos said. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a haircut after a breakup,\u201d she added. \u201cYou might feel better, but it doesn\u2019t actually change anything in your body. It is just in the temporary relief from a bigger, more systemic issue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/summer-body-image-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_voice-box-transplant", "text": "A Massachusetts man has regained his voice after surgeons removed his cancerous larynx and, in a pioneering move, replaced it with a donated one. Transplants of the so-called voice box are extremely rare, and normally aren\u2019t an option for people with active cancer. Marty Kedian is only the third person in the U.S. ever to undergo a total larynx transplant \u2013 the others, years ago, because of injuries \u2013 and one of a handful reported worldwide. Surgeons at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona offered Kedian the transplant as part of a new clinical trial aimed at opening the potentially lifechanging operation to more patients, including some with cancer, the most common way to lose a larynx. \u201cPeople need to keep their voice,\u201d Kedian, 59, told The Associated Press four months after his transplant \u2013 still hoarse but able to keep up an hourlong conversation. \u201cI want people to know this can be done.\u201d He became emotional recalling the first time he phoned his 82-year-old mother after the surgery \u201cand she could hear me. \u2026 That was important to me, to talk to my mother.\u201d The study is small \u2014 just nine more people will be enrolled. But it may teach scientists best practices for these complex transplants so that one day they could be offered to more people who can\u2019t breathe, swallow or speak on their own because of a damaged or surgically removed larynx. \u201cPatients become very reclusive, and very kind of walled off from the rest of the world,\u201d said Dr. David Lott, Mayo\u2019s chair of head and neck surgery in Phoenix. He started the study because \u201cmy patients tell me, \u2018Yeah I may be alive but I\u2019m not really living.\u2019\u201d Lott\u2019s team reported early results of the surgery Tuesday in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. The larynx may be best known as the voice box but it\u2019s also vital for breathing and swallowing. Muscular tissue flaps called vocal cords open to let air into the lungs, close to prevent food or drink from going the wrong way \u2013 and vibrate when air pushes past them to produce speech. The first two U.S. larynx transplant recipients \u2013 at the Cleveland Clinic in 1998 and the University of California, Davis, in 2010 \u2013 had lost their voices to injuries, one from a motorcycle accident and the other damaged by a hospital ventilator. But cancer is the biggest reason. The American Cancer Society estimates more than 12,600 people will be diagnosed with some form of laryngeal cancer this year. While today many undergo voice-preserving treatment, thousands of people have had their larynx completely removed, breathing through what\u2019s called a tracheostomy tube in their neck and struggling to communicate. Although the earlier U.S. recipients achieved near normal speech, doctors haven\u2019t embraced these transplants. Partly that\u2019s because people can survive without a larynx \u2013 while antirejection drugs that suppress the immune system could spark new or recurring tumors. \u201cWe want to be able to push those boundaries but do it as safely and ethically as we can,\u201d Lott said. Head-and-neck specialists say the Mayo trial is key to helping larynx transplants become a viable option. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a \u2018one-off,\u2019\u201d but an opportunity to finally learn from one patient before operating on the next, said Dr. Marshall Strome, who led the 1998 transplant in Cleveland. This first attempt in a cancer patient \u201cis the next important step,\u201d he said. Other options are being studied, noted Dr. Peter Belafsky of UC Davis, who helped perform the 2010 transplant. His patients at high risk of larynx loss record their voice in anticipation of next-generation speech devices that sound like them. But Belafsky said there\u2019s \u201cstill a shot\u201d for larynx transplants to become more common while cautioning it likely will take years more research. One hurdle has been achieving enough nerve regrowth to breathe without a trach tube. Kedian was diagnosed with a rare laryngeal cartilage cancer about a decade ago. The Haverhill, Massachusetts, man underwent more than a dozen surgeries, eventually needing a trach tube to help him breathe and swallow \u2014 and struggled even to muster a raspy whisper through it. He had to retire on disability. Still the once gregarious Kedian, known for long conversations with strangers, wouldn\u2019t let doctors remove his entire larynx to cure the cancer. He desperately wanted to read bedtime stories to his granddaughter, with his own voice rather than what he called robotic-sounding speech devices. Then Kedian\u2019s wife Gina tracked down the Mayo study. Lott decided he was a good candidate because his cancer wasn\u2019t fast-growing and \u2013 especially important \u2013 Kedian already was taking antirejection drugs for an earlier kidney transplant. It took 10 months to find a deceased donor with a healthy enough larynx just the right size. Then on Feb. 29, six surgeons operated for 21 hours. After removing Kedian\u2019s cancerous larynx, they transplanted the donated one plus necessary adjoining tissues \u2013 thyroid and parathyroid glands, the pharynx and upper part of the trachea \u2013 and tiny blood vessels to supply them. Finally, using new microsurgical techniques, they connected nerves critical for Kedian to feel when he needs to swallow and to move the vocal cords. About three weeks later, Kedian said \u201chello.\u201d Soon he\u2019d relearned to swallow, working up from applesauce to macaroni and cheese and hamburgers. He got to say hi to granddaughter Charlotte via video, part of his homework to just keep talking. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Kedian, who moves back to Massachusetts soon. His tracheostomy remains in place at least a few more months but \u201cI\u2019m pushing myself to make it go faster because I want these tubes out of me, to go back to a normal life.\u201d And just as Lott had assured him, Kedian retained his beloved Boston accent.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/voice-box-transplant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_geriatrician-healthy-aging-wellness", "text": "Longevity isn\u2019t just about living a long life but also about living well. More than 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 or older by 2040, the Department of Health and Human Services projects. And more than 56% of those turning 65 will need some sort of long-term service. Fortunately, there are things you can do at any age to ensure that you will maintain your health as the years go on, according to Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Batsis, an associate professor at UNC\u2019s School of Medicine and Gillings School of Global Public Health, spoke with CNN about what people should know about healthy aging. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: Some people may find it hard to relate their health behaviors now to outcomes in their later years. Why should people start to think about healthy aging early? Dr. John Batsis: There will be individuals who may become sick and frail. There will be individuals who are robust into their 90s. I have patients who are still extremely fit and active \u2014 they may not be as active as they were 20 years ago, but they are still doing the things that they want to do. You have to find a sense of self, a sense of purpose. You have to find a sense of what makes you happy, and it may be different at each stage of life. You can\u2019t change your genetics; you can\u2019t change your past. You can try to change your future with things that are modifiable. If it means altering what you\u2019re eating or how much you\u2019re exercising or engaging in the community, or stopping smoking or drinking \u2014 these are things that are in your control. And there are tools \u2014 like working with your health care team and community resources \u2014 that may be available to be able to help you achieve those. Part of it is really getting to a point that you\u2019re saying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m willing to change.\u201d You have to be willing to change to effect that change. CNN: What are the things you would like people to change earlier in their lives to impact how they age? Batsis: That\u2019s a really great question, and one that often is asked to me \u2014 not only by my patients but their children and by my own family and friends as well. There are a number of factors that have been shown time and time again to lead to healthy aging, but really you can kind of drill it down to kind of a couple. First is proper nutrition, and that really starts from infancy to childhood into adolescence and throughout even into old age. Secondly, regular physical activity and exercise are critically important. And then the third big category is social connections. We often think about these independently as silos, and really you need to be thinking about these jointly and together and synergistically. One can affect the other, but it\u2019s really kind of the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. CNN: What do you mean by proper nutrition? Batsis: We often think of healthy nutrition as having a balanced diet, a Mediterranean-type diet. The food environment often can be challenging, particularly in Western industrialized societies. The fast-food industry is very difficult to get away from. But home-cooked meals \u2014 cooking your own fresh fruit and vegetables, thinking about having these types of meals \u2014 is really, really important and nutritious. Really try to stay away from processed foods and think about more holistic type of foodstuffs. This is really thinking about it more consistently. Food is medicine, and I think this is a concept that is increasingly being sought and advocated by both health and nonhealth providers. And this kind of goes beyond aging. Start young, start early, get it into schools and start to engage individuals and children early on, so they develop skills and practices that are sustainable over their lives. It becomes part of the routine, and it\u2019s not thought to be a chore. CNN: What kind of exercise is most important? Batsis: Regular walking, regular activity. The 150 minutes of activity per week divided by 30 minutes over five days of moderate activity is what\u2019s really recommended. In addition to that, one should think about not only aerobic activity but resistance-based activities. This is more important as one ages to maintain muscle mass and muscle strength, because we know that you lose that capability to maintain that as you age. CNN: Why is social connection so important? Batsis: The importance of social connection in aging is often overlooked, understudied and underappreciated. One of the challenges here in our country is that a lot of us are spread out. And this is not seen as much in other countries that are geographically not as dispersed, or where family units are right next door or within the same neighborhood. It\u2019s not uncommon where I have patients whose children may be on opposite ends of the country, for instance, or their friends may be on opposite ends of the country. The social networking is really helpful to engage in stimulating conversations.

The definition of what constitutes healthy aging may differ, and it\u2019s really about asking what does it mean to you? What\u2019s important to you at this stage of life? How can we achieve what is important to you, and then coming up with a plan and strategies to help our individual patient achieve that? That is the key, and it shouldn\u2019t be a top-down approach.

{"id": "2024_07_11_health_cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness", "text": "About 40% of new cancer cases among adults ages 30 and older in the United States \u2014 and nearly half of deaths \u2014\u00a0could be attributed to preventable risk factors, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society. \u201cThese are things that people can practically change how they live every single day to reduce their risk of cancer,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Arif\u00a0Kamal, chief patient officer with the American Cancer Society. Smoking was the leading risk factor by far, the study found, contributing to nearly 1 in 5 cancer cases and nearly a third of cancer deaths. Other key risk factors included excess body weight, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, diet and infections such as HPV. Overall, researchers analyzed 18 modifiable risk factors across 30 types of cancer. In 2019, these lifestyle factors were linked to more than 700,000 new cancer cases and more than 262,000 deaths, the study found. Cancer grows because of DNA damage or because it has a fuel source, Kamal said. Other things \u2014 such as genetics or environmental factors \u2014 can also create these biological conditions, but modifiable risks explain a significantly larger share of cancer cases and deaths than any other known factors. Exposure to sunlight can damage DNA and lead to skin cancer, for example, while fat cells produce hormones that can feed certain cancers. \u201cWith cancer, it oftentimes feels like you have no control,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cPeople think about bad luck or bad genetics, but people need to feel a sense of control and agency.\u201d Certain cancers are more preventable than others, the new study suggests. But modifiable risk factors contributed to more than half of new cases for 19 of the 30 types of cancer evaluated. There were 10 types of cancer where modifiable risk factors could be attributed to at least 80% of new cases, including more than 90% of melanoma cases linked to ultraviolet radiation and nearly all cases of cervical cancer linked to HPV infection, which can be prevented with a vaccine. Lung cancer had the largest number of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors \u2014 more than 104,000 cases among men and 97,000 among women \u2014 and the vast majority were linked to smoking. After smoking, excess body weight was the second largest contributor to cancer cases, linked to about 5% of new cases in men and nearly 11% of cases in women. It was associated with more than\u00a0a third of deaths from cancer\u00a0of the endometrium, gallbladder, esophagus, liver and kidney, the new study found. Another recent study found that the risk for certain cancers was significantly reduced for people taking popular weight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy. \u201cObesity is emerging, in some ways, as just as potent of a risk for people as smoking is,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. He was not involved in the new study, but has prior experience working on cancer prevention initiatives. Intervening on a set of \u201ccore behavioral risk factors\u201d \u2014 quitting smoking, eating well and exercising, for example \u2014 can make a \u201cdramatic difference in the rates and outcomes of chronic diseases,\u201d Plescia said. And cancer is one of those chronic diseases, just like heart disease or diabetes. Policymakers and health officials should work to \u201ccreate environments where it\u2019s easier for people, where the healthy choice is the easy choice,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s particularly important for people who are living in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods, where it might not be safe to exercise or easy to get to a store with healthy food. As rates of early-onset cancer rise in the US, it\u2019s especially important to create healthy habits early, experts say. It\u2019s harder to quit smoking once you\u2019ve started or lose weight that you\u2019ve gained. But \u201cit\u2019s never too late to make these changes,\u201d Plescia said. \u201cTurning (health behaviors) around later in life can make a profound difference.\u201d And making lifestyle changes to minimize exposure to certain factors can reduce cancer risk relatively quickly, experts say. \u201cCancer is something your body fights every single day as your cells divide,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that you face every day, and that also means that the reduction of the risks can benefit you every day as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_health_worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness", "text": "Eating higher levels of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespans by more than 10%, according to a new, unpublished study of over 500,000 people whom researchers followed for nearly three decades. The risk went up to 15% for men and 14% for women once the data was adjusted, said study lead author Erikka Loftfield, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Asked about their consumption of 124 foods, people in the top 90th percentile of ultraprocessed food consumption said overly processed drinks topped their list. \u201cDiet soft drinks were the key contributor to ultraprocessed food consumption. The second one was sugary soft drinks,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cBeverages are a very important component of the diet and the contribution to ultraprocessed food.\u201d Refined grains such as ultraprocessed breads and baked goods ranked next in popularity, the study found. \u201cThis is one more large, long-duration cohort study confirming the association between UPF (ultraprocessed food) intake and all-cause mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Carlos Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health at Brazil\u2019s University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in an email. Monteiro coined the term ultraprocessed food and created the NOVA food classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made. Monteiro was not involved in the study, but several members of the NOVA classification system were coauthors. The NOVA classification system sorts foods from unprocessed or minimally processed \u2014 whole foods such as fruits and vegetables \u2014 to ultraprocessed foods such as deli meat and sausage. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food appetizing. Health risks linked to processed meats and soft drinks The preliminary study, presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago, analyzed dietary data gathered in 1995 from nearly 541,000 Americans ages 50 to 71 who were participating in the US National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. Researchers linked the dietary data to death rates over the next 20 to 30 years. Compared with those in the bottom 10% of ultraprocessed food consumption, people who ate the most overly processed food were more likely to die from heart disease or diabetes, according to the study. Unlike other studies, however, researchers found no rise in cancer-related death. Some ultraprocessed foods carried more of a risk than others, Loftfield said: \u201cHighly processed meat and soft drinks were a couple of the subgroups of ultraprocessed food most strongly associated with mortality risk.\u201d Diet drinks are considered ultraprocessed food because they contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium and stevia, and additional additives not found in whole foods. Diet beverages have been linked to a higher risk of dying early from cardiovascular disease as well as the onset of dementia,\u00a0type 2 diabetes,\u00a0obesity, stroke and\u00a0metabolic syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes. The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans already recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to premature death and the development of chronic disease. A March 2019 study found women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages\u00a0\u2014 defined as a standard glass, bottle or can \u2014 had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared with women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk. Processed meats such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, ham, corned beef, jerky and deli meats are also not recommended; studies have linked red and processed meats to bowel and stomach cancers, heart disease, diabetes and early death from any cause. \u201cThe evidence from this new study indicates that processed meat may be one of the most unhealthy foods, but people do not tend to view ham or chicken nuggets as UPF (ultraprocessed food),\u201d said Rosie Green,\u00a0a professor of environment, food and health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in a statement. She was not involved in the study. The study found that people who consumed the most ultraprocessed food were younger and heavier, and had an overall poorer quality of diet than those who ate fewer ultraprocessed foods. However, the increased health risk could not be explained by these differences, because even people with normal weight and better diets were also at some risk for early death from ultraprocessed foods, the study found. \u201cStudies which utilize food classification systems such as NOVA, which focus on the degree of processing, as opposed to the nutritional composition should be considered with caution,\u201d said Carla Saunders, president of the \u200eCalorie Control Council, an industry association, in an email. \u201cSuggesting the elimination of dietary tools like no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages, with proven benefits in the management of comorbidities like obesity and diabetes, is harmful and irresponsible,\u201d Saunders said. Results may underestimate risk One key limitation of the study was that the dietary data was gathered only once some 30 years ago, Green said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how dietary habits might have changed between then and now.\u201d Ultraprocessed food manufacturing has exploded since the mid-1990s, however, with estimates that as nearly 60% of the average American\u2019s daily calories come from ultraprocessed foods. That\u2019s not surprising, considering as much as 70% of the food in any grocery store may be ultraprocessed. \u201cIf anything, we are probably underestimating ultraprocessed food consumption in our study because we\u2019re being very conservative,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cThe intake is likely to have only grown over the years.\u201d In fact, a study published in May that found similar results \u2014 a higher risk of premature death and death from cardiovascular disease in over 100,000 health professionals who ate ultraprocessed foods \u2014 accessed ultraprocessed food intake every four years and found consumption doubled between the mid-1980s and 2018. \u201cFor example, the daily intake of packaged savory snacks and dairy-based desserts, such as ice cream, has essentially doubled since the \u201890s,\u201d said the lead author of the May study, Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIn our study, just as in this new one, the positive association was mainly driven by a few subgroups, including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d Song said. \u201cHowever, all categories of ultraprocessed food were associated with increased risk.\u201d Choosing more minimally processed foods is a one way to limit ultraprocessed foods in one\u2019s diet, Loftfield said. \u201cWe should really be focusing on eating diets that are rich in whole foods,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if the food is ultraprocessed, then look to see the levels of sodium and added sugars and try to make the best decision possible using the nutrition facts label.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2017_09_18_health_opioid-crisis-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at the opioid crisis.  Experts say the United States is in the throes of an opioid epidemic. An estimated 8.9 million Americans aged 12 and older misused opioids in 2022, including 8.5 million prescription pain reliever abusers and 1 million heroin users. Opioids are drugs formulated to replicate the pain-reducing properties of opium. Prescription painkillers like morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone are opioids. Illegal drugs like heroin and illicitly made fentanyl are also opioids. The word \u201copioid\u201d is derived from the word \u201copium.\u201d  Overdose deaths have been on the rise for years in the United States, but surged amid the Covid-19 pandemic: Annual deaths were nearly 50% higher in 2021 than in 2019, CDC data shows. Data on overdose deaths. Prescription opioid volumes peaked in 2011, with the equivalent of 240 billion milligrams of morphine prescribed, according to the market research firm, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee had the highest opioid dispensing rates in 2020. Common Opioids Opioids such as morphine and codeine are naturally derived from opium poppy plants more commonly grown in Asia, Central America and South America. Heroin is an illegal drug synthesized from morphine.  Hydrocodone and oxycodone are semi-synthetic opioids, manufactured in labs with natural and synthetic ingredients.  Fentanyl is a fully synthetic opioid, originally developed as a powerful anesthetic for surgery.  It is also administered to alleviate severe pain associated with terminal illnesses like cancer. The drug is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. Just a small dose can be deadly. Illicitly produced fentanyl has been a driving factor in the number of overdose deaths in recent years.  Methadone is another fully synthetic opioid. It is commonly dispensed to recovering heroin addicts to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.     Opioids bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting pain signals. They also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a \u201chigh.\u201d Addiction Opioid use disorder is the clinical term for opioid addiction or abuse. People who become dependent on opioids may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the medication. Dependence is often coupled with tolerance, meaning that users need to take increasingly larger doses for the same effect.  A drug called naloxone, available as an injection or a nasal spray, is used as a treatment for overdoses. It blocks or reverses the effects of opioids and is often carried by first responders.  Regulation and Funding The 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, allocated $1 billion over two years in opioid crisis grants to states, providing funding for expanded treatment and prevention programs. In April 2017, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price announced the distribution of the first round of $485 million in grants to all 50 states and US territories. In August 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the launch of an Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit within the Department of Justice. The unit\u2019s mission is to prosecute individuals who commit opioid-related health care fraud. The DOJ is also appointing US attorneys who will specialize in opioid health care fraud cases as part of a three-year pilot program in 12 jurisdictions nationwide.  On October 24, 2018, President Donald Trump signed opioid legislation into law. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes provisions aimed at promoting research to find new drugs for pain management that will not be addictive. It also expands access to treatment for substance use disorders for Medicaid patients. State legislatures have also introduced measures to regulate pain clinics and limit the quantity of opioids that doctors can dispense.  Timeline 1861-1865 - During the Civil War, medics use morphine as a battlefield anesthetic. Many soldiers become dependent on the drug.  1898 - Heroin is first produced commercially by the Bayer Company. At the time, heroin is believed to be less habit-forming than morphine, so it is dispensed to individuals who are addicted to morphine. 1914 - Congress passes the Harrison Narcotics Act, which requires that doctors write prescriptions for narcotic drugs like opioids and cocaine. Importers, manufacturers and distributors of narcotics must register with the Treasury Department and pay taxes on products   1924 - The Anti-Heroin Act bans the production and sale of heroin in the United States.  1970 - The Controlled Substances Act becomes law. It creates groupings (or schedules) of drugs based on the potential for abuse. Heroin is a Schedule I drug while morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone (Percocet) and methadone are Schedule II. Hydrocodone (Vicodin) is originally a Schedule III medication. It is later recategorized as a Schedule II drug.  January 10, 1980 - A letter titled \u201cAddiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics\u201d is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It looks at incidences of painkiller addiction in a very specific population of hospitalized patients who were closely monitored. It becomes widely cited as proof that narcotics are a safe treatment for chronic pain.  1995 - OxyContin, a long-acting version of oxycodone that slowly releases the drug over 12 hours, is introduced and aggressively marketed as a safer pain pill by manufacturer, Purdue Pharma.  May 10, 2007 - Purdue Pharma pleads guilty for misleadingly advertising OxyContin as safer and less addictive than other opioids. The company and three executives are charged with \u201cmisleading and defrauding physicians and consumers.\u201d Purdue and the executives agree to pay $634.5 million in criminal and civil fines.  2010 - FDA approves an \u201cabuse-deterrent\u201d formulation of OxyContin, to help curb abuse. However, people still find ways to abuse it.  May 20, 2015 - The DEA announces that it has arrested 280 people, including 22 doctors and pharmacists, after a 15-month sting operation centered on health care providers who dispense large amounts of opioids. The sting, dubbed Operation Pilluted, is the largest prescription drug bust in the history of the DEA.     March 18, 2016 - The CDC publishes guidelines for prescribing opioids for patients with chronic pain. Recommendations include prescribing over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen in lieu of opioids. Doctors are encouraged to promote exercise and behavioral treatments to help patients cope with pain.    March 29, 2017 - Trump signs an executive order calling for the establishment of the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is selected as the chairman of the group, with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an adviser. July 31, 2017 - After a delay, the White House panel examining the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic releases its interim report, asking Trump to declare a national public health emergency to combat the ongoing crisis    September 22, 2017 - The pharmacy chain CVS announces that it will implement new restrictions on filling prescriptions for opioids, dispensing a limited seven-day supply to patients who are new to pain therapy.  November 1, 2017 - The opioid commission releases its final report. Its 56 recommendations include a proposal to establish nationwide drug courts that would place opioid addicts in treatment facilities rather than prison.  February 9, 2018 - A budget agreement signed by Trump authorizes $6 billion for opioid programs, with $3 billion allocated for 2018 and $3 billion allocated for 2019.  February 27, 2018 - Sessions announces a new opioid initiative: The Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force. The mission of the task force is to support local jurisdictions that have filed lawsuits against prescription drugmakers and distributors. March 19, 2018 - The Trump administration outlines an initiative to stop opioid abuse. The three areas of concentration are law enforcement and interdiction; prevention and education via an ad campaign; and job-seeking assistance for individuals fighting addiction. April 9, 2018 - The US surgeon general issues an advisory recommending that Americans carry the opioid overdose-reversing drug, naloxone. A surgeon general advisory is a rarely used tool to convey an urgent message. The last advisory issued by the surgeon general, more than a decade ago, focused on drinking during pregnancy. May 1, 2018 - The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a study that finds synthetic opioids like fentanyl caused about 46% of opioid deaths in 2016. That\u2019s a three-fold increase compared with 2010, when synthetic opioids were involved in about 14% of opioid overdose deaths. It\u2019s the first time that synthetic opioids surpassed prescription opioids and heroin as the primary cause of overdose fatalities.   May 30, 2018 - The journal Medical Care publishes a study that estimates the cost of medical care and substance abuse treatment for opioid addiction was $78.5 billion in 2013.   June 7, 2018 - The White House announces a new multimillion dollar public awareness advertising campaign to combat opioid addiction. The first four ads of the campaign are all based on true stories illustrating the extreme lengths young adults have gone to obtain the powerful drugs. December 12, 2018 - According to the National Center for Health Statistics, fentanyl is now the most commonly used drug involved in drug overdoses. The rate of drug overdoses involving the synthetic opioid skyrocketed by about 113% each year from 2013 through 2016. January 14, 2019 - The National Safety Council finds that, for the first time on record, the odds of dying from an opioid overdose in the United States are now greater than those of dying in a vehicle crash. March 26, 2019 - Purdue Pharma agrees to pay a $270 million settlement to settle a historic lawsuit brought by the Oklahoma attorney general. The settlement will be used to fund addiction research and help cities and counties with the opioid crisis. July 17, 2019 - The CDC releases preliminary data showing a 5.1% decline in drug overdoses during 2018. If the preliminary number is accurate, it would mark the first annual drop in overdose deaths in more than two decades. August 26, 2019 - Oklahoma wins its case against Johnson & Johnson in the first major opioid lawsuit trial to be held in the United States. Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman orders Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million for its role in the state\u2019s opioid crisis. The penalty is later reduced to $465 million, due to a mathematical error made when calculating the judgment. In November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reverses the decision. September 15, 2019 - Purdue files for bankruptcy as part of a $10 billion agreement to settle opioid lawsuits. According to a statement from the chair of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, the money will be allocated to communities nationwide struggling to address the crisis. September 30, 2019 - The FDA and DEA announce that they sent warnings to four online networks, operating a total of 10 websites, which the agencies said are illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded versions of opioid medicines, including tramadol. February 25, 2020 - Mallinckrodt, a large opioid manufacturer, reaches a settlement agreement in principle worth $1.6 billion. Mallinckrodt says the proposed deal will resolve all opioid-related claims against the company and its subsidiaries if it moves forward. Plaintiffs would receive payments over an eight-year period to cover the costs of opioid-addition treatments and other needs. October 21, 2020 - The Justice Department announces that Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has agreed to plead guilty to three federal criminal charges for its role in creating the nation\u2019s opioid crisis. They agree to pay more than $8 billion and close down the company. The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. The Justice Department also reached a separate $225 million civil settlement with the former owners of Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family. In November 2020, Purdue Pharma board chairman Steve Miller formally pleads guilty on behalf of the company. March 15, 2021 - According to court documents, Purdue files a restructuring plan to dissolve itself and establish a new company dedicated to programs designed to combat the opioid crisis. As part of the proposed plan, the Sackler family agrees to pay an additional $4.2 billion over the next nine years to resolve various civil claims. September 1, 2021 - In federal bankruptcy court, Judge Robert Drain rules that Purdue Pharma will be dissolved. The settlement agreement resolves all civil litigation against the Sackler family members, Purdue Pharma and other related parties and entities, and awards them broad legal protection against future civil litigation. The Sacklers will relinquish control of family foundations with over $175 million in assets to the trustees of a National Opioid Abatement Trust. On December 16, 2021, a federal judge overturns the settlement.  February 25, 2022 - Johnson & Johnson and the three largest US drug distributors \u2013 McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and AmerisourceBergen Corp \u2013 finalize a $26 billion nationwide opioid settlement.  March 3, 2022 - The Sackler families reaches a settlement with a group of states the first week of March, according to court filings.

Facts Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common form of dementia, which is a general term for the loss of memory and intellectual abilities. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is fatal and there is no cure. It is a slow-moving disease that starts with memory loss and ends with severe brain damage. The disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, the neuropathologist did an autopsy on the brain of a woman who died after exhibiting language problems, unpredictable behavior and memory loss. Dr. Alzheimer discovered the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are considered the hallmarks of the disease. Contributing Factors:Age - The likelihood of developing Alzheimer\u2019s doubles every five years after the age of 65. For most people, symptoms first appear after the age of 60. Family history - Genetics play a role in an individual\u2019s risk of developing the disease. Head trauma - There is a possible link between the disease and repeated trauma or loss of consciousness. Heart health - The risk of vascular dementia increases with heart conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. Possible Symptoms:Memory lossRepeating questions and statementsPoor judgmentMisplacing itemsMood and personality changesConfusionDelusions and paranoiaImpulsivenessSeizures Difficulty swallowing  National Estimates According to the CDC, an estimated 6.5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is the fifth leading cause of death for adults in the United States aged 65 or older. The estimated cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementias in the United States in 2023 is $345 billion. Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s is an uncommon form of dementia that strikes people younger than age 65. Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease often runs in families. Research March 9, 2014 - In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers report they have developed a blood test that predicts with astonishing accuracy whether a healthy person will develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. September 2014 - The research journal Aging reports that in a small study at UCLA, nine out of the 10 patients involved, said their symptoms reversed after they participated in a rigorous program that included things like optimizing Vitamin D levels in the blood, using DHA supplements to bridge broken connections in the brain and strategic fasting to normalize insulin levels. September 11, 2015 - The Journal of Neurology publishes a study that suggests that the compound resveratrol, when taken in concentrated doses, may have benefit in slowing the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. November 23, 2016 - US drugmaker Eli Lilly announces it is ending the Phase 3 clinical trial of its Alzheimer\u2019s drug solanezumab. \u201cPatients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with placebo,\u201d the company says in a statement. February 2017 - The drug company Merck halts the late-stage trial of its Alzheimer\u2019s drug verubecestat, after an independent study found that it had \u201cvirtually no chance\u201d of working. July 25, 2018 - Additional results of an early clinical trial for an experimental drug, the antibody called BAN2401, shows that it improved cognition and reduced clinical signs of Alzheimer\u2019s in the brains of study participants. Details about the immunotherapy were announced at a news conference during the 2018 Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference. February 28, 2019 - The journal Nature Genetics publishes a study that reveals four new genetic variants that increase risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The genes appear to work in tandem to control bodily functions that affect disease development. March 21, 2019 - Pharmaceutical company Biogen announces that they are ending two Phase 3 clinical trials of a drug that targets the buildup in the brain of beta-amyloid, one of two proteins that researchers believe contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s. The drug, called aducanumab, was considered to be a promising candidate in improving cognitive function. In October, Biogen announces that it will apply for regulatory approval for aducanumab and begin new studies. \u201cThe decision to file is based on a new analysis, conducted by Biogen in consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), of a larger dataset from the Phase 3 clinical studies that were discontinued in March 2019 following a futility analysis.\u201d March 13, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine publishes a study indicating that Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s experimental intravenous drug donanemab could slow the cognitive decline of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, according to early clinical trial results.  June 7, 2021 - The FDA approves the use of the experimental drug aducanumab for early phases of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, despite an FDA advisory committee concluding last year that there is not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of the treatment. This is the first time since 2003 the FDA has approved a novel therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s. On January 31, 2024, Biogen announces it is discontinuing the drug aducanumab as it shifts resources to other Alzheimer\u2019s medication.  April 4, 2022 - A study that uncovered an additional 42 genes connected to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is published.  April 7, 2022 - The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announces it will restrict coverage of the controversial and costly Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm to those enrolled in qualifying clinical trials. May 4, 2022 - The FDA announces that it permitted marketing for a new diagnostic test for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is the first in vitro diagnostic test that could offer an alternative to tools like PET scans, which are currently used to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease. June 30, 2022 - Scientists identify a gene that appears to increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s in women, providing a potential new clue as to why more women than men are diagnosed with the disease. The gene, O6-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase, or MGMT, plays an important role in how the body repairs damage to DNA in both men and women. But researchers did not find an association between MGMT and Alzheimer\u2019s in men. January 6, 2023 - The FDA grants accelerated approval for the drug lecanemab, which will be marketed as Leqembi. It has shown \u201cpotential\u201d as an Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment by appearing to slow progression, according to Phase 3 trial results, but it has raised safety concerns due to its association with certain serious adverse events, including brain swelling and bleeding. July 6, 2023 - The FDA grants traditional full approval to Leqembi, the first medicine proven to slow the course of Alzheimer\u2019s. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that it will now expand coverage of the drug, broadening access for up to an estimated million people with early forms of the disease. January 22, 2024 - A new study in the JAMA Neurology journal suggests testing a person\u2019s blood for a type of protein called phosphorylated tau, or p-tau, can be used to screen for Alzheimer\u2019s disease with \u201chigh accuracy,\u201d even before symptoms begin to show. July 2, 2024 - The FDA approves donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Donanemab, made by Eli Lilly, works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2013/08/23/health/alzheimers-disease-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
