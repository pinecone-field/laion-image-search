Sarai Holguin, a 71-year-old woman originally from Mexico, has accepted the bullet lodged near her knee as her \u201ccompa\u201d \u2014 a close friend. Mireya Nelson, 15, was hit by a bullet that went through her jaw and broke her shoulder, where fragments remain. She\u2019ll live with them for now, while doctors monitor lead levels in her blood for at least two years. Nearly three months after the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting left at least 24 people injured, recovery from those wounds is intensely personal and includes a surprising gray area in medicine: whether the bullets should be removed. Medical protocol offers no clear answer. A 2016 survey of surgeons found that\u00a0only about 15%\u00a0of respondents worked at medical facilities that had policies on bullet removal. Doctors in the U.S. often leave bullets buried deep in a person\u2019s body, at least at first, so as not to cause further trauma. But as gun violence has emerged as a public health epidemic,\u00a0some researchers wonder\u00a0if that practice is best. Some of the wounded, like James Lemons, are left in a precarious place. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to get it out, and it\u2019s safely taken out, get it out of the person,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cMake that person feel more secure about themselves. And you\u2019re not walking around with that memory in you.\u201d Lemons, Holguin, and Nelson are coping in very different ways. Pain Became a Problem Three days after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Lemons drove the 37 miles from Harrisonville, Missouri, to downtown Kansas City to celebrate the victory. The warehouse worker was carrying his 5-year-old daughter, Kensley, on his shoulders when he felt a bullet enter the back of his right thigh. Gunfire erupted in the area packed with revelers,\u00a0prosecutors later said, after a \u201cverbal confrontation\u201d between two groups. Detectives found \u201cmultiple 9mm and .40 caliber spent shell casings\u201d at the scene. Lemons said he understood immediately what was happening. \u201cI know my city. We\u2019re not shooting off fireworks,\u201d he said. Lemons shielded Kensley\u2019s face as they fell to the ground so she wouldn\u2019t hit the concrete. His first thought was getting his family \u2014 also including his wife, Brandie; 17-year-old daughter, Kallie; and 10-year-old son, Jaxson \u2014 to safety. \u201cI\u2019m hit. But don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Lemons recalled telling Brandie. \u201cWe gotta go.\u201d He carried Kensley on his shoulders as the family walked a mile to their car. His leg bled through his pants at first then stopped, he said. It burned with pain. Brandie insisted on driving him to the hospital but traffic was at a standstill so she put on her hazard lights and drove on the wrong side of the road. \u201cShe\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m getting you to a hospital. I\u2019m tired of people being in my way,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen my wife like that. I\u2019m looking at her like, \u2018That\u2019s kinda sexy.\u2019\u201d Lemons clapped and smiled at his wife, he said, to which she replied, \u201cWhat are you smiling for? You just got shot.\u201d He stayed in quiet admiration until they were stopped by a sheriff, who summoned an ambulance, Lemons said. He was taken to the emergency room at University Health, which\u00a0admitted 12 patients\u00a0from the rally, including eight with gunshot wounds. Imaging showed the bullet barely missed an artery, Lemons said. Doctors cleansed the wound, put his leg in a brace, and told him to come back in a week. The bullet was still in his leg. \u201cI was a little baffled by it, but I was like, \u2018OK, whatever, I\u2019ll get out of here,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. When he returned, doctors removed the brace but explained they often leave bullets and fragments in the body \u2014 unless they grow too painful. \u201cI get it, but I don\u2019t like that,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you take it out if you could?\u201d University Health spokesperson Leslie Carto said the hospital can\u2019t comment on individual patient care because of federal privacy laws. Surgeons typically do remove bullets when they encounter them during surgery or they are in dangerous locations, like in the spinal canal or risking damage to an organ, said\u00a0Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children\u2019s. Campbell also chairs the Injury Prevention and Control Committee of the American College of Surgeons\u2019 Committee on Trauma, which works on firearm injury prevention. LJ Punch, a trauma surgeon by training and the founder of the\u00a0Bullet Related Injury Clinic\u00a0in St. Louis, said the origins of trauma care also help explain why bullets are so often left. \u201cTrauma care is war medicine,\u201d Punch said. \u201cIt is set to be ready at any moment and any time, every day, to save a life. It is not equipped to take care of the healing that needs to come after.\u201d In the survey of surgeons, the most common reasons given for removing a bullet were pain, a palpable bullet lodged near the skin, or an infection. Far less common were lead poisoning and mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. What patients wanted also affected their decisions, the surgeons said. Lemons wanted the bullet out. The pain it caused in his leg radiated up from his thigh, making it difficult to move for more than an hour or two. Working his warehouse job was impossible. \u201cI gotta lift 100 pounds every night,\u201d Lemons recalled telling his doctors. \u201cI gotta lift my child. I can\u2019t work like this.\u201d He has lost his income and his health insurance. Another stroke of bad luck: The family\u2019s landlord sold their rental home soon after the parade, and they had to find a new place to live. This house is smaller, but it was important to keep the kids in the same school district with their friends, Lemons said in an interview in Kensley\u2019s pink bedroom, the quietest spot to talk. They\u2019ve borrowed money and raised\u00a0$6,500 on GoFundMe\u00a0to help with the deposit and car repairs, but the parade shooting has left the family in a deep financial hole. Without insurance, Lemons worried he couldn\u2019t afford to have the bullet removed. Then he learned his surgery would be paid for by donations. He set up an appointment at a hospital north of the city, where a surgeon took measurements on his X-ray and explained the procedure. \u201cI need you to be involved as much as I\u2019m going to be involved,\u201d he remembered being told, \u201cbecause \u2014 guess what \u2014 this ain\u2019t my leg.\u201d The surgery is scheduled for this month. \u2018We Became Friends\u2019 Sarai Holguin isn\u2019t much of a Chiefs fan, but she agreed to go to the rally at Union Station to show her friend the best spot to see the players on stage. It was an unseasonably warm day, and they were standing near an entrance where lots of police were stationed. Parents had babies in strollers, kids were playing football, and she felt safe. A little before 2 p.m., Holguin heard what she thought were fireworks. People started running away from the stage. She turned to leave, trying to find her friend, but felt dizzy. She didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been shot. Three people quickly came to her aid and helped her to the ground, and a stranger took off his shirt and made a tourniquet to put on her left leg. Holguin, a native of Puebla, Mexico, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018, had never seen so much chaos, so many paramedics working under such pressure. They were \u201canonymous heroes,\u201d she said. She saw them working on Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a well-known DJ and 43-year-old mother of two. Lopez-Galvan died at the scene, and was the sole fatality at the parade. Holguin was rushed to University Health, about five minutes from Union Station. There doctors performed surgery, leaving the bullet in her leg. Holguin awoke to more chaos. She had lost her purse, along with her cellphone, so she couldn\u2019t call her husband, Cesar. She had been admitted to the hospital under an alias \u2014 a common practice at medical centers to begin immediate care. Her husband and daughter didn\u2019t find her until about 10 p.m. \u2014 roughly eight hours after she\u2019d been shot. \u201cIt has been a huge trauma for me,\u201d Holguin said through an interpreter. \u201cI was injured and at the hospital without doing anything wrong. [The rally] was a moment to play, to relax, to be together.\u201d Holguin was hospitalized for a week, and two more outpatient surgeries quickly followed, mostly to remove dead tissue around the wound. She wore a wound VAC, or vacuum-assisted closure device, for several weeks and had medical appointments every other day. Campbell, the trauma surgeon, said wound VACs are common when bullets damage tissue that isn\u2019t easily reconstructed in surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical injuries,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cMany times it\u2019s the emotional, psychological injuries, which many of these patients take away as well.\u201d The bullet remains near Holguin\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019m going to have it for the rest of my life,\u201d she said, saying she and the bullet became \u201ccompas,\u201d close friends. \u201cWe became friends so that she doesn\u2019t do any bad to me anymore,\u201d Holguin said with a smile. Punch, of the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis, said some people like Holguin are able to find a way to psychically live with bullets that remain. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to make a story around what that means for that bullet to be in your body, that gives you power; that gives you agency and choice,\u201d Punch said. Holguin\u2019s life changed in an instant: She\u2019s using a walker to get around. Her foot, she said, acts \u201clike it had a stroke\u201d \u2014 it dangles, and it\u2019s difficult to move her toes. The most frustrating consequence is that she cannot travel to see her 102-year-old father, still in Mexico. She has a live camera feed on her phone to see him, but that doesn\u2019t offer much comfort, she said, and thinking about him brings tears. She was told at the hospital that her medical bills would be taken care of, but then lots of them came in the mail. She tried to get victim assistance from the state of Missouri, but all the forms she had were in English, which made them difficult to comprehend. Renting the wound VAC alone cost $800 a month. Finally she heard that the Mexican Consulate in Kansas City could help, and the consul pointed her to the Jackson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, with which she registered as an official victim. Now all of her bills are being paid, she said. Holguin isn\u2019t going to seek mental health treatment, as she believes one must learn to live with a given situation or it will become a burden. \u201cI have processed this new chapter in my life,\u201d Holguin said. \u201cI have never given up and I will move on with God\u2019s help.\u201d \u2018I Saw Blood on My Hands\u2019 Mireya Nelson was late to the parade. Her mother, Erika, told her she should leave early, given traffic and the million people expected to crowd into downtown Kansas City, but she and her teenage friends ignored that advice. The Nelsons live in Belton, Missouri, about a half hour south of the city. Mireya wanted to hold the Super Bowl trophy. When she and her three friends arrived, the parade that had moved through downtown was over and the rally at Union Station had begun. They were stuck in the large crowd and quickly grew bored, Mireya said. Getting ready to leave, Mireya and one of her friends were trying to call the driver of their group, but they couldn\u2019t get cell service in the large crowd. Amid the chaos of people and noise, Mireya suddenly fell. \u201cI saw blood on my hands. So then I knew I got shot. Yeah, and I just crawled to a tree,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know where I got shot at, at first. I just saw blood on my hands.\u201d The bullet grazed Mireya\u2019s chin, shot through her jaw, broke her shoulder, and left through her arm. Bullet fragments remain in her shoulder. Doctors decided to leave them because Mireya had already suffered so much damage. Mireya\u2019s mother supports that decision, for now, noting they were just \u201cfragments.\u201d \u201cI think if it\u2019s not going to harm her the rest of her life,\u201d Erika said, \u201cI don\u2019t want her to keep going back in the hospital and getting surgery. That\u2019s more trauma to her and more recovery time, more physical therapy and stuff like that.\u201d Bullet fragments, particularly ones only skin-deep, often push their way out like splinters, according to Punch, although patients aren\u2019t always told about that. Moreover, Punch said, injuries caused by bullets extend beyond those with damaged tissue to the people around them, like Erika. He called for a holistic approach to recover from all the trauma. \u201cWhen people stay in their trauma, that trauma can change them for a lifetime,\u201d Punch said. Mireya will be tested for\u00a0lead levels in her blood\u00a0for at least the next two years. Her levels are fine now, doctors told the family, but if they get worse she will need surgery to remove the fragments, her mother said. Campbell, the pediatric surgeon, said lead is particularly concerning for young children, whose developing brains make them especially vulnerable to\u00a0its harmful effects.\u00a0Even a tiny amount\u00a0of lead \u2014 3.5 micrograms per deciliter \u2014 is enough to report to state health officials, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mireya talks about cute teenage boys\u2019 being \u201cfine\u201d but also still wears Cookie Monster pajamas. She appears confused by the shootings, by all the attention at home, at school, from reporters. Asked how she feels about the fragments in her arm, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care for them.\u201d Mireya was on antibiotics for 10 days after her hospital stay because doctors feared there was bacteria in the wound. She has had physical therapy, but it\u2019s painful to do the exercises. She has a scar on her chin. \u201cA dent,\u201d she said, that\u2019s \u201cbumpy.\u201d \u201cThey said she was lucky because if she wouldn\u2019t have turned her head in a certain way, she could be gone,\u201d Erika said. Mireya faces a psychiatric evaluation and therapy appointments, though she doesn\u2019t like to talk about her feelings. So far, Erika\u2019s insurance is paying the medical bills, though she hopes to get some help from the United Way\u2019s\u00a0#KCStrong fund, which raised nearly $1.9 million, or a faith-based organization called\u00a0Unite KC. Erika doesn\u2019t want a handout. She has a job in health care and just got a promotion. The bullet has changed the family\u2019s life in big ways. It is part of their conversation now. They talk about how they wish they knew what kind of ammunition it was, or what it looked like. \u201cLike, I wanted to keep the bullet that went through my arm,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI want to know what kind of bullet it was.\u201d That brought a sigh from her mom, who said her daughter had watched too many episodes of \u201cForensic Files.\u201d Erika beats herself up about the wound, because she couldn\u2019t protect her daughter at the parade. \u201cIt hits me hard because I feel bad because she begged me to get off work and I didn\u2019t go there because when you have a new position, you can\u2019t just take off work,\u201d Erika said. \u201cBecause I would have took the bullet. Because I would do anything. It\u2019s mom mode.\u201d This story was produced as part of a reporting partnership\u00a0between\u00a0KCUR\u00a0and\u00a0KFF Health News,\u00a0a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/super-bowl-parade-survivors-bullets-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_skin-cancer-screening-wellness", "text": "Skin cancer is by far the most common form of cancer in the United States, according to the\u00a0American Cancer Society. With summer coming in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s time to check in with CNN wellness expert and emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen about the dangers of skin cancer and the need for safe sun exposure. As we head into summer, what do we need to know about the chance of developing skin cancer? And how can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration needs to be checked out? Which health care provider should be contacted if there is a concern? Should people get full-body skin cancer screening exams? Are self-exams useful? Wen has some answers for us, as well as steps everyone can take to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.\u00a0An emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University, she previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: I was surprised to learn that skin cancer is so common. What are the major forms of skin cancer? Dr. Leana Wen: There are\u00a0three main forms\u00a0of skin cancer. The most common type is called basal cell carcinoma. These cancers can look like an elevated transparent bump on the skin and most frequently occur on the head, neck and other areas most exposed to the sun. Although these cancers generally develop slowly, they can grow deep and damage nerves and bones. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer. These often resemble a red bump and may manifest as a sore or wound that heals and then opens up again. These, too, tend to appear in areas with frequent sun exposure\u00a0and can also appear on the lip and ear. They can grow deep and spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is the third type that is critical to know. That\u2019s because while it only accounts for 1% of total cancers, it is the\u00a0cause of the majority of deaths\u00a0from skin cancer. In the United States in 2024, more than 8,000 people will die annually from this cancer. Melanoma can develop within a mole that already exists or as a new dark spot on the skin. There is also an association with sun exposure and melanoma. According to the American Cancer Society, though melanoma risk increases with age, it is\u00a0one of the most common cancers\u00a0in young adults. CNN: How can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration should be checked out by a medical professional? Wen:\u00a0There is an\u00a0\u201cABCDE\u201d rule\u00a0that describes warning features that could signify a melanoma. A is for asymmetry, if the shape of\u00a0one half\u00a0of the mole does not match the other. B is for border. A mole with blurred, irregular edges could be concerning. C is for color, meaning a mole that has multiple colors and shades. D is for diameter. Some melanomas can be very small, but most are over 6 millimeters, about \u00bc inch, wide. E is for evolving, meaning that the mole has changed over the past weeks or months. Anyone who notices these features of a mole should get it checked out. In addition, people who notice a new growth, a spot or bump that is increasing in size over time, a skin discoloration that is causing discomfort\u00a0or a sore that doesn\u2019t\u00a0get better\u00a0should also seek medical attention. CNN: Should people make an appointment with a dermatologist? What if they don\u2019t have one? Wen:\u00a0Those who have a dermatologist should contact that person first. Sometimes, a referral from a primary care provider may be necessary. People who have concerning signs that could point to melanoma should clearly state this as a reason \u2014 that they have a change in size or color of a mole, for example, and they are concerned about skin cancer. CNN: Is it recommended for everyone to receive regular skin cancer screening tests? Wen: The influential\u00a0US\u00a0Preventive Services Task Force issued a\u00a0recommendation\u00a0in 2023 that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus risks\u00a0of regular visual skin examination as a method to screen for skin cancer. It\u2019s important to note that this is the general recommendation for people at average risk for skin cancer\u00a0who\u00a0have\u00a0no suspicious moles or spots. People who do see concerning new skin changes should be sure to contact their physician right away. In addition, those who are at increased risk for skin cancer should ask a dermatologist if they should receive regular skin exams. These are done via visual inspection by the physician, meaning that the doctor looks over the entire body. Certain moles may be removed for biopsy to see if they are cancerous. CNN: What are factors that put someone at higher risk for skin cancer? Wen:\u00a0One main factor is ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. People who have extensive sun exposure, history of sunburns and tanning bed use are at elevated risk. Age is also a risk factor; the longer someone has UV exposure, the higher their risk. Those with 50 or more moles are also at higher risk, as are people with fair complexions. There are also specific risk factors related to personal and family medical history. These include personal or family history of skin cancer, history of precancerous lesions such as actinic keratoses, certain genetic disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum and history of immunosuppression. Individuals with risk factors, or who are not certain about them, should contact their physician to come up with a plan for screening. CNN: What about self-exams? Can these be helpful? Wen: Yes. It is a good idea for everyone to check their skin for moles. Look for the ABCDE warning signs as well as any new spots or sores that are itchy, tender\u00a0or painful. People should also remember to check everywhere on their bodies. While skin cancer is most likely in sun-exposed areas, other places are possible, too, including the palms of your hands, soles of your feet and genital areas. A good time to check is when you shower,\u00a0bathe, change clothes\u00a0or apply lotion. You could also ask for help from a family member or friend, especially in hard-to-see areas like the scalp. CNN: What are steps to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer? Wen:\ufeff Reducing UV exposure is a crucial step that everyone can take. That means, when possible, staying in the shade; wearing clothing that covers arms and legs; wearing a hat that covers the face, head, ears\u00a0and neck; and\u00a0regularly\u00a0using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. You can turn to the\u00a0excellent Environmental Working Group\u2019s resource on choosing sunscreens\u00a0that I use and that I recommend to everyone to find an effective sunscreen that works for your lifestyle, budget\u00a0and personal preferences. People should keep in mind that UV rays penetrate and can cause harm not just during the summer but year-round. Also, UV is not just present when it\u2019s sunny but also on cloudy days, and\u00a0the rays\u00a0can reflect off surfaces like snow, sand and water. And it\u2019s not only people who are fair-skinned who can have skin cancer;\u00a0individuals of all colors, including those with brown and Black skin, can develop skin cancer. Finally, I strongly urge people not to use indoor tanning beds. These expose users to high levels of UV rays and increase the risk of developing skin cancer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/skin-cancer-screening-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_overdose-deaths-decrease-2023", "text": "After a steep rise during the Covid-19 pandemic, preliminary data shows that drug overdose deaths in the United States ticked down in 2023 for the first time in five years. About 107,500 people died from a drug overdose in 2023, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics \u2014 about 3,500 fewer than in 2022. Last year\u2019s decrease is the first since 2018, but the 3% drop is far less substantial than the surges that pushed overdose deaths to record levels in recent years. Overdose deaths\u00a0spiked\u00a030% between 2019 and 2020 and rose another 15% between 2020 and 2021, CDC data shows. Preliminary data is subject to change as death certificates are reviewed and records are assessed, but estimates suggest that, despite the decline, overdose deaths in 2023 were still almost twice as high as they were five years ago, according to the CDC data. \u201cIt is a hopeful trend in some ways,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Keyes, a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health whose research focuses on substance use epidemiology. \u201cWe know that this drug epidemic is dynamic and changes quite quickly, so any time you see a leveling off or a slight decrease, it is promising. It is certainly not a sign that we need to take the foot off the gas of overdose prevention.\u201d The US Department of Health and Human Services launched a coordinated national strategy to prevent overdoses two years ago. \u201cThis progress over the last 12 months should make us want to reinvigorate our efforts knowing that our strategies are making a difference,\u201d CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry\u00a0said in a statement, but \u201cthere are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses at staggering numbers.\u201d \u201cOur thoughts remain with those who have lost loved ones and those who are struggling with addiction or know someone who is.\u00a0Our country is committed to ending this epidemic and preventing unnecessary death and suffering,\u201d she said. Fentanyl has been driving the latest wave of overdose deaths, with synthetic opioids involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths. These highly potent narcotics continue to play an outsized role: they were involved in nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023. However, there were about 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023 than in 2022, the new data shows. Still, the deadly threat of fentanyl \u2014 which is about 50 times more potent than heroin \u2014 remains. In one indicator of its pervasiveness, a study published Monday shows that law enforcement seizures of illicit fentanyl have surged in recent years. More than 115 million pills containing illicit fentanyl were seized by law enforcement in 2023, compared with about 71 million in 2022 and less than 50,000 in 2017. \u201cFentanyl has continued to infiltrate the drug supply in communities across the United States and it is a very dangerous time to use drugs, even just occasionally,\u201d Dr. Nora Volkow, director of National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a statement. She was not directly involved in the new study, but the research was funded by the federal agency. \u201cIllicit pills are made to look identical to real prescription pills, but can actually contain fentanyl. It is urgently important that people know that any pills given to someone by a friend, purchased on social media, or received from any source other than a pharmacy could be potentially deadly \u2014 even after a single ingestion.\u201d The number of deaths due to fentanyl remains \u201calarmingly high,\u201d Keyes said. But the more promising trends reflect significant, multi-pronged efforts from many different sectors, she said, including use of treatments for opioid use disorder, expanded access to naloxone and other harm reduction programs and reducing opioid prescribing. \u201cI think that has been a real success story for public health,\u201d she said. While overdose deaths involving opioids declined, those involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamine increased, according to the preliminary data from the CDC. There were more than 36,000 deaths involving psychostimulants in 2023, a 2% increase from the year before. And deaths involving cocaine rose 5%, to nearly 30,000. About a third of all overdose deaths in 2023 involved psychostimulants, and cocaine was involved in more than a quarter. Much of this increase is likely due to the proliferation of fentanyl throughout the drug supply, Keyes said. \u201cWe know that when stimulants mix with opioids, it\u2019s particularly lethal,\u201d she said. But expanded surveillance can help those who are working to address the overdose crisis understand its rapidly changing epidemiology and adapt their efforts in real-time. Vast disparities in overdose deaths remain, including state-level differences; the latest CDC data shows \u201cnotable\u201d increases in some Western states such as Washington and Oregon, with overdose deaths increasing at least 27% year-over-year. In other states, including Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana and Maine, overdose deaths dropped by at least 15%. \u201cState-to-state differences point to the need for continued expansion of these efforts,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cBut I think the trends you see nationally are indicative of how it can work. We can address the opioid epidemic. This is not inevitable.\u201d For many state and local governments, funds from opioid settlements have been \u201cinstrumental\u201d to overdose prevention efforts and increased access to treatment and recovery support, Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, jurisdictions will continue to prioritize investments in harm reduction, prevention, and addressing the social determinants of health across communities that have been hardest hit by the overdose crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, state and territorial health agencies will continue to coordinate with partners to build a comprehensive response to this complex public health issue. Lastly, jurisdictions will continue to monitor and prepare to respond to changes in overdose rates and emerging threats within the drug supply.\u201d Recent surveys suggest that drug use among teens in the US has been relatively low and trending down. But overdose deaths have been rising in this age group and millions of adults and adolescents have a drug use disorder. \u201cResearch has shown that delaying the start of substance use among young people, even by one year, can decrease substance use for the rest of their lives. We may be seeing this play out in real time,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cThis trend is reassuring. Though, it remains crucial to continue to educate young people about the risks and harms of substance use in an open and honest way, emphasizing that illicit pills and other substances may contain deadly fentanyl.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/overdose-deaths-decrease-2023/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}

Along the way, researchers also identified the longest hummingbird migration journey, which spans a 5,200-mile (8,368-kilometer) round trip, or about the distance between New York City and Buenos Aires. Questions around the giant hummingbird of South America have persisted since naturalist Charles Darwin first observed them in 1834 during his expedition aboard the HMS Beagle. Darwin observed the birds, which are about eight times the size of typical hummingbirds, breeding along the Pacific coast of Chile, but then they seemed to completely vanish after breeding. He speculated that the giant hummingbirds migrated to the Atacama Desert region, located in northern Chile. Now, new research has revealed that there are two distinct species of giant hummingbird in South America \u2014 the northern giant hummingbird that lives year-round in the Andes, and the migratory southern giant hummingbird \u2014 and they have been evolving separately for millions of years. A new study describing the birds appeared Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many animal migrations of large, charismatic species that are still totally unknown, but that was the case for southern giant hummingbirds,\u201d said lead study author Jessie Williamson, a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow and Rose Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York. \u201cWe wanted to finally solve this mystery.\u201d Designing backpacks for hummingbirds Giant hummingbirds differ from hundreds of other hummingbird species in many other ways. \u201cEverything about the giants is anomalous \u2014 they are not only far larger (two times or more) than the second largest hummingbird \u2014 but their wingbeats and heartbeats are far slower,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAnd their wings are proportionately longer, so they have a completely unique appearance in flight \u2014 almost like a hovering swift.\u201d Swifts are medium-size fast-flying birds included in the family Apodidae, which also includes hummingbirds. But studying hummingbirds, no matter their size, is an arduous task. The team worked with local landowners and residents of villages across Peru and Chile during fieldwork. \u201cCapturing Giant Hummingbirds is very challenging,\u201d said study coauthor Emil Bautista, researcher at the Centro de Ornitolog\u00eda y Biodiversidad in Lima, in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThey watch everything, and they know their territories well. We had to be strategic in choosing sites for our nets. If Giant Hummingbirds see something unusual, they won\u2019t visit that spot. They are more observant than other birds.\u201d The research team spent nine months camping in rural parts of Chile and Peru, working from sea level to the steep, cactus-strewn slopes of the Andes and going without electricity or running water for weeks at a time, Williamson said. Williamson designed a backpack harness, using a type of jewelry cord to attach a microtracking device to 57 hummingbirds in Chile. \u201cDesigning appropriate backpack harnesses for giant hummingbirds took two field seasons of trial and error, including practicing the harness design on a stuffed hummingbird finger puppet \u2026 with a paper mach\u00e9 mock-up geolocator device, plus lots of consultation with colleagues who have experience tracking small migratory birds,\u201d Williamson said. The geolocator backpacks weighed 0.3 grams and were designed to be small and light enough so they didn\u2019t interfere with the birds\u2019 style of flight. Williamson published a paper describing her design and how to safely attach it to hummingbirds in the Journal of Avian Biology in June 2021. \u201cHummingbirds are challenging to work with because they are lightweight with long wings and short legs. They\u2019re nature\u2019s tiny acrobats,\u201d she said. But it wasn\u2019t enough to catch the birds, attach the backpacks and release them \u2014 the birds had to be recaptured for the team to collect the data. The researchers were able to retrieve data from eight of the geolocators by recapturing the birds using fine mesh nets called \u201cmist nets,\u201d commonly used by ornithologists, Williamson said. What the team discovered was that migratory southern giant hummingbirds are like human mountaineers. High-altitude bird flights The geolocator data revealed that migratory giant hummingbirds can ascend from sea level to more than 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) in elevation, and their travels brought them as far north as the Peruvian Andes. But the birds don\u2019t just fly directly to these towering altitudes. Instead, like mountaineers, they pause during their ascent for days at a time to allow their blood and lungs to acclimate to lower oxygen levels. By tracking the birds\u2019 migration with geolocators and satellite transmitters, the scientists discovered what they believe to be the longest known hummingbird migration, spanning 5,200 miles (8,368 kilometers) from the Chilean coast up to the Andes in Peru and back. As the researchers studied the birds and compared them with genetic data from museum specimens, they realized there were two types of giant hummingbirds. \u201cNobody had figured out where migratory giant hummingbirds go because they were hiding among the non-migratory giant hummingbirds,\u201d said senior study author Christopher Witt, professor of biology and director of the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico, in a statement. \u201cThe two forms of giant hummingbird look almost identical \u2014 for centuries, ornithologists and birders never noticed that they were different. We couldn\u2019t have figured this out without the miniaturized trackers.\u201d A shift in migratory behavior likely drove the difference between the two species. By studying museum species, including a 154-year-old specimen, the researchers realized that the two types of giant hummingbird had been evolving separately for about 3 million years. \u201cThey are as different from each other as chimpanzees are from bonobos,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThe two species do overlap on their high elevation wintering grounds. It\u2019s mind-boggling that until now nobody figured out the Giant Hummingbird mystery, yet these two species have been separate for millions of years.\u201d The northern giant hummingbird, which lives in the high Andes year-round, has a different lung and blood capacity compared with the southern giant hummingbird. After realizing the two birds were entirely different species, the study team named the northern giant hummingbird Patagona chaski, a nod to chaskis, the Quecha word for messengers, of the Inca Empire. Quecha is a group of indigenous languages used across Peru and neighboring countries. \u201cChaski runners were surefooted sprinters, capable of speed and endurance on steep slopes, in part due to high-capacity lungs and rigorous aerobic training at high elevations,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. New bird mysteries emerge The researchers reported that both populations of giant hummingbirds are stable, and some can even be seen enjoying nectar from backyard feeders. Now that the two distinct species have been confirmed, the team wants to better understand how the populations interact, especially when they live in the same parts of the Andes during the winter. \u201cWe have to figure out where these two forms come together and how they interact,\u201d Witt said. \u201cDo they compete, is one dominant over the other, how might they partition resources, and do they mix or spatially segregate within the winter range? Lots of interesting questions to pursue!\u201d Williamson also wants to work with botanists to understand how the birds\u2019 migration patterns may have coevolved with the flowering plants the birds use for sustenance on their journeys. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in how Southern Giant Hummingbirds make such dramatic shifts in elevation during migration,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThey\u2019re like miniature mountain climbers. How do they change their physiology to facilitate these movements?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/world/giant-hummingbirds-new-species-backpacks-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}

The agency also proposed the group be blocked from receiving federal funds in the future, possibly\u00a0for\u00a0years. Before Covid-19 emerged, a US government grant to EcoHealth had funded studies into bat coronaviruses at the lab in Wuhan, China. Although US-funded research at the lab has not been linked to the pandemic, the US suspended funding\u00a0to EcoHealth in 2020. The grant was later reinstated it. US funding to the Wuhan lab has since been blocked. In a new\u00a0letter\u00a0to EcoHealth Alliance and its president, Dr. Peter Daszak, HHS lists 30 pieces of information, some dating back to 2013\u00a0to support its decision.\u00a0HHS said in a\u00a0memo\u00a0that EcoHealth failed to \u201cadequately monitor\u201d virus growth in experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, notify the National Institutes of Health that viruses studied there \u201cappeared to grow beyond permissible thresholds\u201d laid out in a grant or provide requested information in a timely manner. \u201cHHS believes there is adequate evidence in the record\u00a0for\u00a0this debarment cause and that immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest,\u201d Henrietta Brisbon, an HHS suspension and debarment official, wrote in the letter. In a statement, a spokeperson for EcoHealth Alliance said the organization is \u201cdisappointed by HHS\u2019 decision today and we will be contesting the proposed debarment. We disagree strongly with the decision and will present evidence to refute each of these allegations and to show that NIH\u2019s continued support of\u00a0EcoHealth\u00a0Alliance is in the public interest.\u201d An\u00a0HHS Office of the Inspector General\u00a0report last year found that despite\u00a0potential risks from research performed through the EcoHealth grant, the group was late to report information and the NIH failed to follow up. EcoHealth Alliance has said it was\u00a0unable to access the NIH reporting system because of technical problems, but in a new HHS action memo, it says a forensic report found the group was \u201cnever locked out of the system.\u201d Earlier this month, House lawmakers questioned Daszak about EcoHealth\u2019s record on research and safety, including at the Wuhan lab. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Wednesday, Brad Wenstrup, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Oversight Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, said its investigation into EcoHealth and the origins of Covid-19 is \u201cfar from over.\u201d The origin of the virus that caused Covid-19 continues to drive research and investigations by scientists, intelligence officials and lawmakers.\u00a0Previous scientific studies\u00a0have suggested the virus that causes Covid-19 likely emerged naturally in a Wuhan seafood market, but they have not identified a specific origin.

{"id": "2024_05_10_health_bird-flu-government-farm-incentives", "text": "Newly announced financial incentives to farms to help stem the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle drew mixed reviews Friday, as some farmers said they were grateful for money to help buffer the economic impact but advocates for farm workers questioned whether the money paid to workers would be enough to encourage more testing for the H5N1 virus. As part of the plan, announced Friday by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, the government will pay up to $28,000 per farm over the next four months to support specific steps to prevent the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle.\u00a0About $98 million will be funneled to the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to fund the program. The USDA confirmed the first bird flu infection in cows in late March.\u00a0Since then, more than 40 herds have tested positive in nine states. Right now, health officials say, the virus doesn\u2019t transmit efficiently from person to person, making the risk to humans low.\u00a0But scientists have said that having the infection spreading in domesticated animals like cattle is risky because it puts the virus in closer proximity to people, where it could adapt and evolve to become a fully human pathogen.\u00a0If that happens, researchers say, it could spark another pandemic. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our top priority at USDA, given our mission, is to contain this as an animal health event,\u201d Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said Friday. \u201cUltimately, we want to eliminate the virus in the industry and develop over time a vaccine to prevent another emergency of H5N1 in cattle.\u201d The USDA has acknowledged that some dairy producers have been wary of letting the government come onto their farms to test livestock. Farm workers with symptoms have also reportedly been reluctant to be tested for H5N1 influenza, since most are not compensated if they need to take time off for illness. As part of the plan announced Friday, the USDA will\u00a0provide financial support \u2014 up to $2,000 per affected farm per month \u2014 for producers who supply personal protective equipment to their workers or help them wash their uniforms.\u00a0Financial support is also available to farmers who allow their workers to participate in\u00a0a study through the USDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Workers who participate in the CDC study would also be compensated for their time. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said workers would get $75 for participating in an interview as well as providing a nasal swab and a blood sample, although he said they didn\u2019t have to do all three. Advocates for farm workers said they were skeptical that the $75 payment would be enough to encourage more testing. \u201cThere are some really significant resources that are being allocated to the owners of the cattle. But far less is being advocated to the workers who are in close contact and at high risk working in those milking parlors,\u201d said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers. \u201c$75 is not going to seem like a good gamble to someone who may be looking at much longer off of work. And $75 isn\u2019t going to feed their families,\u201d she said. Strater estimates that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 dairy workers in the US. \u201cThis is not a huge amount of people. But if you think about how important to protecting the public health that would be, you would think that we will be putting all of our resources into a protective ring around these folks,\u201d she said. Strater says there\u2019s a real reluctance on the part of farm workers to be tested, even when they have symptoms, because a positive test could mean time off work. \u201cThe testing situation is really challenging,\u201d said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health programs for the National Center for Farmworker Health. The way we now find out about human cases of H5N1 is \u201ca very passive system,\u201d she said. Alcauter says public health officials assume that if someone has influenza symptoms, they\u2019ll go to a doctor, who will take an occupational health history, and if the worker tests positive for the flu, the doctor will send that person\u2019s swab to a state public health lab to be tested for H5N1. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a very realistic scenario,\u201d she said, noting that only a few dozen people had been tested for the H5N1 virus after exposure to cattle. Besides payments to help assist farms in protecting their workers, payments of up to $1,500 per farm will be available to aid in the development of biosecurity plans.\u00a0The USDA will offer dairy farms $100 to purchase a piece of equipment called an in-line sampler so their milk can be tested as it travels between cows and holding tanks. Another $2,000 will be available to farms that heat treat their wasted milk before it is disposed. The USDA will also cover up to $10,000 of veterinary costs at farms where cattle have tested positive for H5N1 and will cover the cost of shipping samples to testing labs in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The government says it will also compensate farmers for lost milk production if their cows get sick. The National Milk Producers Federation said it was pleased by the announcement of additional financial help to dairy farmers. \u201cWe look forward to continued collaboration and consultation with USDA and other federal agencies as we monitor, understand, and contain this outbreak, and we will do what we can to help dairy farmers understand and benefit from these initiatives as swift implementation is put into motion,\u201d the group said in a statement. In addition, HHS is going to send an additional $101 million in funding to the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration to help fund their H5N1 response efforts. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified 93 million to be used by CDC to expand our monitoring of people exposed to infected animals, to scale up our testing and analysis capabilities, to determine whether candidate vaccines are effective and to manufacture, store, and distribute additional influenza diagnostic kits,\u201d HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said. Another $8 million will be given to the FDA to support to the agency\u2019s ability to conduct surveillance at different points in the milk production system, Becerra said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/bird-flu-government-farm-incentives/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}

Florida enacted a new law\u00a0on May 1, 2024, that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, with\u00a0a few exceptions\u00a0\u2013 including documented rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Florida joins the majority of\u00a0Southern states\u00a0that now have complete bans or highly restrictive abortion laws, enacted since the Supreme Court overturned the\u00a0federal right to get an abortion\u00a0in June 2022. Many of the restrictive laws ban abortion after a set number of weeks. Florida Republicans supporting the bill have labeled it a\u00a0reasonable compromise between a full abortion ban and few abortion restrictions. READ MORE: Mexico is a destination for Americans seeking reproductive health services  Some OB-GYNs\u00a0have explained that\u00a0many women\u00a0do not even know they are pregnant at\u00a0six weeks.\u00a0Research shows that women\u00a0on average find out they are pregnant at five and a half weeks. About 23% do not know until seven weeks of pregnancy or later. So, do Americans, including those enacting six-week bans, actually understand how the timing or dating of pregnancy works? We are\u00a0scholars\u00a0of\u00a0political science,\u00a0gender and public opinion\u00a0and are writing a book about public opinion on abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the federal right to get an abortion in June 2022. How does pregnancy work? To gain insights into this issue, we developed a few pregnancy questions and included them in a research survey in late September 2023. The survey had 1,356 respondents, who were broadly representative of the U.S. population. The respondents\u2019 median age was 46. Approximately 49% of these people were men, while 70% were white and 29% were college graduates. Meanwhile, 43% of them were Democrats, and 38% were Republicans. READ MORE: Fetal personhood rulings could nullify a pregnant patient\u2019s wishes for\u00a0end-of-life\u00a0care The first question asked respondents how pregnancies are dated.\u00a0The correct answer\u00a0is that pregnancies are dated using the first day of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period, which is often two to three weeks before conception. The second question asked about trimesters. Many Americans are familiar with the term trimester, and\u00a0polling consistently shows\u00a0that Americans find abortion most acceptable during the first trimester. We asked Americans if they knew approximately how many weeks a trimester was. The correct answer is 13. Americans\u2019 pregnancy knowledge We found that only one-third of respondents knew how pregnancy is dated. A majority \u2013 approximately 60% \u2013 falsely thought that pregnancy is dated from conception or in the weeks since the woman last had sex. Less than one-fourth of the respondents answered both pregnancy knowledge questions correctly. In our survey, we also asked respondents whether they support a six-week abortion ban. Similar to other\u00a0national surveys, we find that most Americans oppose strict abortion restrictions \u2013 only 35% support six-week bans. Importantly, we find that those who support six-week abortion bans are significantly less likely than others to correctly understand the timing of pregnancy. The statistically significant relationship between having low levels of pregnancy timing knowledge and support for a six-week abortion ban holds in analyses controlling for potentially confounding variables. Some anti-abortion lawmakers\u00a0have demonstrated\u00a0their\u00a0ignorance\u00a0about pregnancy\u00a0before. There is, for example, a long history of some anti-abortion politicians saying, incorrectly, that it is\u00a0extremely rare\u00a0for a person who is raped to get pregnant. Our survey shows that a large swath of those opposing abortion lack knowledge about the basics of pregnancy. A gender disparity Perhaps not surprisingly, women in this survey knew more about pregnancy than men. The question about how pregnancies are dated, for example, was answered correctly by 43% of women compared with only 23% of men. As mentioned above, a majority of Americans incorrectly believe pregnancy is dated from conception, but significantly more men than women think this is true. This finding is particularly important when considering the gender breakdown of the Florida state lawmakers who approved the six-week ban. Although we do not have data on the pregnancy knowledge of those legislators, we do know that those who voted for the ban were\u00a0overwhelmingly men. Florida\u2019s six-week ban will make it much harder for anyone to get abortions there \u2013 and it will also affect people in\u00a0neighboring states\u00a0who want or need an abortion. In 2023, Florida was home to the closest abortion clinic for\u00a06.4 million women\u00a0living in the South. In 2023,\u00a0around 7,700 women\u00a0from other Southern states,\u00a0where abortion is now largely banned, traveled to Florida to get abortions. Overall, our findings raise serious questions about whether Americans without medical training \u2013 much like those in our state legislatures \u2013 have the necessary knowledge needed to regulate abortion access.

The inhospitable location has long puzzled archaeologists, some of whom had found evidence that the Nile River once flowed near these pyramids in some capacity, facilitating the landmarks\u2019 construction starting 4,700 years ago. Using satellite imaging and analysis of cores of sediment, a new study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment has mapped a 64-kilometer (40-mile) long, dried-up, branch of the Nile, long buried beneath farmland and desert. \u201cEven though many efforts to reconstruct the early Nile waterways have been conducted, they have largely been confined to soil sample collections from small sites, which has led to the mapping of only fragmented sections of the ancient Nile channel systems,\u201d said lead study author Eman Ghoneim, a professor and director of the Space and Drone Remote Sensing Lab at the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s department of Earth and ocean sciences. \u201cThis is the first study to provide the first map of the long-lost ancient branch of the Nile River.\u201d Ghoneim and her colleagues refer to this extinct branch of the Nile river as Ahramat, which is Arabic for pyramids. The ancient waterway would have been about 0.5 kilometers wide (about one-third of a mile) with a depth of at least 25 meters (82 feet) \u2014 similar to the contemporary Nile, Ghoneim said. \u201cThe large size and extended length of the Ahramat Branch and its proximity to the 31 pyramids in the study area strongly suggests a functional waterway of great importance,\u201d Ghoneim said. She said the river would have played a key role in ancient Egyptians\u2019 transportation of the enormous amount of building materials and laborers needed for the pyramids\u2019 construction. \u201cAlso, our research shows that many of the pyramids in the study area have (a) causeway, a ceremonial raised walkway, that runs perpendicular to the course of the Ahramat Branch and terminates directly on its riverbank.\u201d Hidden traces of a lost waterway Traces of the river aren\u2019t visible in aerial photos or in imagery from optical satellites, Ghoneim said. In fact, she only spotted something unexpected while studying radar satellite data of the wider area for ancient rivers and lakes that might reveal a new source of groundwater. \u201cI am a geomorphologist, a paleohydrologist\u00a0looking into landforms. I have this kind of trained eye,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile working with this data, I noticed this really obvious branch or a kind of riverbank, and it didn\u2019t make any sense because it is really far from the Nile,\u201d she added. Born and raised in Egypt, Ghoneim was familiar with the cluster of pyramids in this area and had always wondered why they were built there. She applied to the National Science Foundation to investigate further, and geophysical data taken at ground level with the use of ground-penetrating radar and electromagnetic tomography confirmed it was an ancient arm of the Nile. Two long cores of earth the team extracted using drilling equipment revealed sandy sediment consistent with a river channel at a depth of about 25 meters (82 feet). It\u2019s possible that \u201ccountless\u201d temples might still be buried beneath the agricultural fields and desert sands along the riverbank of the Ahramat Branch, according to the study. Why this branch of the river dried up or disappeared is still unclear. Most likely, a period of drought and desertification swept sand into the region, silting up the river, Ghoneim said. The study demonstrated that when the pyramids were built, the geography and riverscapes of the Nile differed significantly from those of today, said Nick Marriner, a geographer at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. He was not involved in the study but has conducted research on the fluvial history of Giza. \u201cThe study completes an important part of the past landscape puzzle,\u201d Marriner said. \u201cBy putting together these pieces we can gain a clearer picture of what the Nile floodplain looked like at the time of the pyramid builders and how the ancient Egyptians harnessed their environments to transport building materials for their monumental construction endeavors.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}

Across all those ways of crunching the numbers, about 85% showed that those who have and use the internet report greater well-being that those who do not, according to the research. The global perspective is useful, and the data analysis of the research is strong, said Dr. Markus Appel, professor of the psychology of communication and new media at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany. He was not involved in the research. Other research has shown that the connection between mobile internet use and well-being is complex and varies among individuals, he added. \u201cThe internet is neither a curse (nor) a blessing for people\u2019s well-being,\u201d Appel said. \u201cIt depends on what people do with it.\u201d Online users report greater well-being This study was observational, meaning that the data doesn\u2019t show that the internet access necessarily caused the better well-being \u2014 there might be other factors responsible for the association. \u201cOur results might then simply indicate that individuals with more money, access to healthcare, etc, report greater well-being,\u201d Vuorre said in an email. The researchers accounted for that in their data and tried to adjust for factors such as income levels and still found that internet users reported greater well-being than those non-internet users, Vuorre said. Cut the internet or keep scrolling? The internet is used for a wide variety of things \u2014 including online banking, shopping, finding services, reading the news and cyberbullying \u2014 and those different uses will have different effects on well-being, Vuorre said. Much of life has moved online very quickly, and it hasn\u2019t left much time to investigate all the impacts of the internet, he added. \u201cWe as a society and/or academic scientists don\u2019t have time to sufficiently learn and develop methodology to address each panic carefully and therefore do not learn sufficiently to be able to inform policy and make conclusions with confidence,\u201d Vuorre said. \u201cCaution is warranted on all sides.\u201d Many studies have shown concerning connections between social media use and mental health, particularly among younger people. Scrolling through images of other people\u2019s lives and comparing them with your own has been associated with a poor effect on mood, for example. Before institutions advise harsh limitations on computers and mobile phones, more research is needed on both the potential harms and benefits, Vuorre said. \u201cAlthough prominent narratives and the cautionary principle might suggest draconian limitations to technology use, ours and many other findings provide a much more nuanced and mixed view,\u201d he added. To get the best out of your internet use, Appel recommends being mindful of your own experience. \u201cIf you sense that some activity on the internet makes you feel sad or envious \u2014 stop it. Look out for something else,\u201d Appel added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/internet-greater-well-being-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_health_pig-kidney-recipient-transplant-death", "text": "A 62-year-old man has died months after becoming the world\u2019s first living recipient of a genetically edited pig kidney transplant, hailed as a medical milestone. Rick Slayman received the kidney at Massachusetts General in March after he had been diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year. The hospital emphasized there is no indication his death was a result of the transplant. After undergoing the four-hour surgery at the recommendation of his doctors, Slayman, a manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, was discharged from the hospital\u00a0in April. After the surgery, doctors said they believed the new kidney could last years, but acknowledged there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. \u201cMr. Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation,\u201d Massachusetts General said in a statement. \u201cWe offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Slayman\u2019s family and loved ones as they remember an extraordinary person whose generosity and kindness touched all who knew him.\u201d Slayman\u2019s family described him as a kind man who was fiercely dedicated to the people in his life. \u201cOur family is deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick but take great comfort knowing he inspired so many,\u201d a family statement said. \u201cMillions of people worldwide have come to know Rick\u2019s story. We felt \u2013 and still feel \u2013 comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant.\u201d Slayman had been a patient in the hospital\u2019s transplant program for 11 years, he previously said in a statement. He received a kidney from a human donor in 2018, after living with diabetes and high blood pressure for many years. The kidney began to show signs of failure five years later, and he resumed dialysis in 2023. \u201cI saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,\u201d Slayman wrote in the statement. Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, director of the Legorreta Center for Clinical Transplant Tolerance, performed the groundbreaking operation in March to a round of applause in the operating room. The need for organs far exceeds the number available in the US. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are more than 100,000 people currently waiting for an organ donation. Experts have long been researching how to safely and successfully transplant animal organs into people, which they say could help solve the organ shortage. Before Slayman\u2019s transplant, just two transplants using pig organs had been completed \u2013\u00a0both heart transplants performed under compassionate use. Both patients died weeks after receiving the hearts. EGenesis, the biotech company providing the genetically edited pig kidney, called Slayman \u201ca true pioneer\u201d in a statement late Saturday night. \u201cWe are profoundly grateful to Mr. Slayman and his family and we will honor his legacy and invaluable contribution to science and medicine by continuing our efforts to advance xenotransplantation for the millions of patients globally in need of lifesaving organs,\u201d the company added. Slayman\u2019s family also thanked his care team at across Massachusetts General in a statement. \u201cAfter his transplant, Rick said that one of the reasons he underwent this procedure was to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive. Rick accomplished that goal and his hope and optimism will endure forever. His legacy will be one that inspires patients, researchers, and health care professionals everywhere,\u201d his family said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/health/pig-kidney-recipient-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness", "text": "After decades of decline, accidental drowning rates are rising in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. With Americans getting ready to hit swimming pools and beaches on Memorial Day weekend, a new study shows that many lack the skills they need to stay safe in the water. Roughly 15% of US adults \u2013 40 million people \u2013 say they don\u2019t know how to swim.\u00a0More than half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to a new national survey by the CDC. The new data on swimming skills in the US population is included in a Vital Signs report released Tuesday by the CDC. It comes on the heels of an increase in drowning deaths in the US in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Each year, on average, about 4,000 Americans died from accidental drowning, a number that changed little from 2011 to 2020. But that number has been about 10% higher the past few years, adding 500 to 600 more deaths each year to the annual tally.\u00a0It\u2019s the first uptick in drowning rates in the US for at least\u00a0two decades. \u201cWhen I just look at the overall numbers, with over 4,000 people dying \u2013 that\u2019s over 12 people a day \u2013 that\u2019s really one person every two hours. And those are lives, not numbers,\u201d said Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC. The increases in drownings were even more dramatic for certain ages and racial groups. Drowning has long been the leading cause of death for preschool-age children. Drowning rates increased almost 30% in this age group in 2021 and 2022. Although the number of drowning deaths in children ages 4 and younger increased among young children in 2020, the rate increase was not statistically significant that year. Black people also saw drowning rates increase faster than the general population; compared with 2019, they were nearly 30% higher in 2021.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that Black Americans reported spending less recreational time in the water than White and Hispanic people.\u00a0If drowning rates were calculated based on exposure rather than population, the study authors noted, it\u2019s likely that the disparities for Black people would be even more pronounced. Additionally, the CDC\u2019s swimming skills survey found that 1 in 3 Black adults said they couldn\u2019t swim, compared with 1 in 7 adults in the general population, a legacy of segregation and discrimination in access to swimming pools in the US, according to the CDC. Hispanic Americans, a group that doesn\u2019t traditionally have disproportionately higher drowning rates compared with White non-Hispanics, also saw drowning rates increase by nearly 25% in 2022, compared with 2019. American Indian and Alaska Natives continued to have the highest rates of drownings of any racial or ethnic group overall. In 2019, there were about 3 drowning deaths for every 100,000 people among American Indian and Alaska Natives, a rate that has seen little change over the course of the pandemic.\u00a0By comparison, there were 1.2 accidental drowning deaths for every 100,000 among White people in 2019. Houry says it\u2019s hard to say exactly how the pandemic may have played a role in the increases.\u00a0The study can only make associations \u2013 it can\u2019t untangle the causes \u2013 but she notes that it was harder to get into public pools, with many closing or implementing policies that limited access.\u00a0Staffing was also problematic for many swim venues. \u201cThere would have been people, if swimming pools were closed for that year, who didn\u2019t get swim lessons and so might have been behind in getting swim lessons,\u201d Houry said. Berkeley Champlin didn\u2019t know the statistics around drowning deaths in young children until her son, Gordie, tragically became one of them. In July 2020, 3-year-old Gordie slipped unnoticed out of the sliding glass doors in Champlin\u2019s home in Livonia, Michigan, while Champlin was at work. Normally, he would have been in day care, but like many schools, it was shut down at the time. His father, who was home with him, later found him in the family\u2019s pool. He couldn\u2019t be revived. Gordie loved animals and couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night without special stuffed animals: an elephant and a bunny. \u201cI put his elephant and his bunny in his casket with him so that he has them always, because he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Champlin said.\u00a0She has drawings of the stuffies tattooed on her forearm. \u201cI wish he would have had swim lessons,\u201d she said. Every year since Gordie died, Champlin has channeled her grief into raising money for swim lessons for other children. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive.\u00a0It costs $120 a month in some places for a child to take lessons,\u201d said Champlin, who knows that may put them out of reach for some families. Champlin set a goal of paying for three kids to learn to swim each year.\u00a0This year, 42 families reached out to her for help, and she set up a\u00a0GoFundMe account\u00a0to raise money to cover them all. \u201cIf anyone else is ever in that situation, or if you go on vacation, or you\u2019re on the lake or a new pool or something that you don\u2019t have your standard parameters around, swim lessons is the way to prevent accidents from happening,\u201d she said. Houry, from the CDC, agrees. \u201cI think we forget drowning is still a really big problem for our young kids and that we can do something about it by making sure kids know how to swim,\u201d she said. Houry said the CDC is funding programs at the Red Cross and YMCA to help lower the cost of lessons and make sure everyone who needs them can get them \u201cbecause it\u2019s so important to have that equitable access,\u201d she added. Houry said kids should start getting swim lessons between the ages of 1 and 4. \u201cIf you are an adult and you don\u2019t know how to swim, it\u2019s never too late to get that swim lesson. It\u2019s really important,\u201d she said. But Houry\u00a0said that even if kids can swim, adults shouldn\u2019t leave them unattended, drink alcohol or get distracted while watching kids in the pool. In settings like a party, where it\u2019s easy for conversations or phones to divert attention, the CDC says it can be useful to assign an adult specifically to watch kids in the pool.\u00a0When swim time is over, the\u00a0CDC recommends\u00a0shutting and locking doors that give access to water.\u00a0In the event that something does happen, learning CPR can help you save a life before paramedics arrive. Houry says fencing that completely encloses a pool can help make backyard and community pools safer.\u00a0In open water, like lakes, life jackets are important for safety, too.\u00a0 When visiting a lake or ocean beach, it\u2019s a good idea to take stock of the hazards, such as rip currents, before going into the water. As Gordie\u2019s birthday approaches on July 12, Champlin said, she finds herself wondering what kind of a party he\u2019d want at age 6. Would he still love animals and superheroes as much, or would it be some kind of gaming thing like Roblox? Just as in past years, they\u2019ll spend his birthday at the zoo, a place that still holds vivid memories of her son. \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness", "text": "Eating enough healthy fats is great for brain and heart health, but new research has possibly provided even more evidence for adding them \u2014 particularly omega-3s \u2014 to your diet. \u201cWe found that a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is associated with a greater risk of dying,\u201d said Yuchen Zhang, lead author of the April study published in the journal eLife, in a news release. Zhang is a doctoral student in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia\u2019s College of Public Health. Omega-3 fatty acids are naturally found in foods including fish \u2014 especially fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines \u2014 as well as flaxseed, walnuts, chia seeds and in dietary supplements such as fish oil. The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA; eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA; and docosahexaenoic acid, known as DHA, according to the National Institutes of Health. The body must obtain all three from foods, and omega-3s contribute to the health of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system and endocrine system. Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, on the other hand, include nuts, seeds, corn and soy \u2014 and the oils and preservatives produced from these foods, the authors said. Linoleic acid is the most common omega-6 fatty acid.\u00a0 \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that the high omega-6 to omega-3 fats ratio typical of Western diets \u2014 20:1 or even higher, compared to an estimated 1:1 during most of human evolution \u2014 contributes to many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and autoimmune disorders,\u201d Zhang said. But the results of past studies have been mixed, she added, and few have investigated the role of an imbalance in mortality. Also, accurately measuring fatty acid intake is difficult, partly due to reliance on participants\u2019 own recollections of their dietary intake. Zhang and the other researchers looked into the associations between the omega-3/omega-6 ratio in blood plasma \u2014 a more objective measure \u2014 and death from any cause and specifically from cancer or cardiovascular disease, the top two leading causes of death worldwide. They used data from 85,425 people who had participated in the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than half a million people between ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom for at least a decade. Participants, whose plasma samples were collected between 2007 and 2010, had answered questionnaires about their diet, including whether they took fish oil supplements. After nearly 13 years of follow-up, the authors found participants with the highest ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 were 26% more likely to die early from any cause, 14% more likely to die from cancer and 31% more likely to die from heart disease than those with the lowest ratios. Considered individually, both high levels of omega-6 and omega-3 were linked with a lower risk of premature death. But the protective effects of omega-3 were greater, likely explaining \u201cwhy having a high ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s was linked to harm,\u201d the authors said. Despite the findings, the study is \u201conly one \u2018snapshot\u2019 in time of biomarkers and dietary intake of omega 3s and 6s. This is correlation, not causation,\u201d said Dr. Lauren R. Sastre, director of the Farm to Clinic Program and assistant professor in the department of nutrition science at East Carolina University, via email. Sastre wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cAnd even that relationship cannot be strongly supported due to methodological flaws in not considering other dietary components to the overall health/clinical outcomes,\u201d Sastre added. \u201cThere are many anti-inflammatory food components (nutrients, phytochemicals, etc.) that are associated with reducing all-cause, cancer and (cardiovascular disease) mortality, and to only evaluate omega 3s and 6s \u2014 strong confounders may be present that would bias the results.\u201d Managing healthy fat intake If the omega-6/omega-3 balance actually does have more to do with premature death risk than the study has the capacity to prove, it could be due to the possible function of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of \u201cRegenerative Health: Discover Your Metabolic Type and Renew Your Liver for Life.\u201d Arachidonic acid is what the body converts from linoleic acid. It\u2019s a \u201cbuilding block for molecules that can promote inflammation, blood clotting, and the constriction of blood vessels,\u201d according to Harvard Health. But this fatty acid can also be converted into molecules that fight inflammation and blood clots. Omega-6s aren\u2019t inherently bad, but having too many may offset the anti-inflammatory factors associated with omega-3, Kirkpatrick said, so \u201ca more balanced approach \u2026 may be favorable.\u201d \u201cThe source of the omega 6s may also be a factor in offsetting the balance as well,\u201d she added via email. \u201cProcessed seed oils may also contain high amounts of omega 6s for example.\u201d Focusing on this balance and increasing your intake of foods rich in omega-3s can be more important than simply limiting those high in omega-6s, Kirkpatrick said. \u201cI would also look at the quality of the omega 6 foods in the diet,\u201d she added, \u201caiming for whole foods \u2026 rather than more processed products that may contain large amounts via the addition of seed oils.\u201d If you\u2019re curious what your blood plasma ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is, ask your physician about testing for it. In Kirkpatrick\u2019s practice, she often works with her patients\u2019 doctors for this purpose. Some patients request it with the goal of improving their mental health, heart health or risk of dementia, she said. Overall, \u201cit\u2019s important to note that an unbalanced ratio is only one chapter in our story of better or worse health span,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cGetting a variety of fiber-rich foods (beneficial to the microbiome) and other nutrient-dense foods, as well as adequate, good-quality sleep, stress management and physical activity play a large role in how long we will enjoy good health within our lifetime.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial", "text": "When Cheri Ferguson started taking Ozempic last year, she said, she hoped to lose about 50 pounds she\u2019d gained during the Covid-19 pandemic. Over about three months, she told CNN in June, the medicine \u2013 which is approved for type 2 diabetes and used off-label for weight loss \u2013 helped reduce the constant chatter in her brain urging her to eat, just what she\u2019d hoped it would do. But it had another unexpected effect: Ferguson said her desire to drink alcohol and use her vape pen also drained away. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone\u2019s just come along and switched the light on, and you can see the room for what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of these vapes and cigarettes that you\u2019ve had over the years, they don\u2019t look attractive anymore. It\u2019s very, very strange. Very strange.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling described by thousands of people taking these medicines, which are in a class known as GLP-1 receptor agonists and used by an estimated 15 million Americans, according to a recent poll. And now, Ozempic\u2019s maker, Novo Nordisk, said it intends to study the phenomenon. The company plans to start assessing the effects of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and other medicines on alcohol consumption this month in a newly announced clinical trial in alcohol-related liver disease \u2013 although cutting drinking isn\u2019t the study\u2019s main goal. A focus on liver disease, not addiction The Danish drug giant has been saying since at least last year that it doesn\u2019t plan to study semaglutide \u2013 which is also approved for weight loss as Wegovy \u2013 in areas like alcohol addiction, despite so many anecdotal reports like Ferguson\u2019s, and academic studies that are already underway. Novo Nordisk reiterated that stance Wednesday, noting that the main purpose of its new trial is to assess whether the medicines can improve liver health. Its primary measure is the medicines\u2019 effects on enhanced liver fibrosis, or scarring, over 28 weeks. \u201cSecondary endpoints include safety and tolerability and changes in alcohol consumption,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThere is a significant unmet medical need in alcohol-related liver disease, and the first line of treatment for the condition is lifestyle intervention to refrain from drinking alcohol.\u201d The trial, first reported by Bloomberg News, aims to enroll about 240 participants and is slated to begin May 20, according to a government database. \u201cEven though not all patients in the trial will have alcohol use disorder, it is natural to include alcohol consumption as a secondary endpoint,\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s spokesperson said, noting that the trial is part of the company\u2019s plans to address liver diseases more broadly. Nonetheless, researchers in addiction science cheered the news. A need for more treatments \u201cThose of us doing work in this area see this as a step in the right direction,\u201d Christian Hendershot, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Bowles Center of Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who is running one of the few studies in this area, said by email Wednesday. \u201cAdditional treatment options for this group are really needed.\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s CEO told CNN in August that the company had heard many similar anecdotal reports. \u201cWe\u00a0know\u00a0that\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0benefits\u00a0in\u00a0obesity\u00a0is\u00a0that\u00a0it\u00a0addresses\u00a0this\u00a0craving,\u00a0the\u00a0desire,\u00a0to\u00a0snack\u00a0and eat,\u201d Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. \u201cThat function in the brain, in this craving center, is perhaps also what is benefitting some of the other addictions.\u201d Studies in animals suggest the same thing, National Institutes of Health researcher Dr. Lorenzo Leggio told CNN last year. He published a study in May 2023 showing that semaglutide reduces alcohol drinking in rodents, noting that \u201cat least one of the mechanisms of how these drugs reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol,\u201d like those related to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Jorgensen said Novo Nordisk hadn\u2019t studied that effect and had no plans to do so at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0the\u00a0easiest\u00a0to\u00a0study,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t expect that we would go in and study these addictions widely.\u201d Jorgensen did say there could be \u201can opportunity to collect data when we do large studies,\u201d as well as to use artificial intelligence to mine large databases of experiences with the medicines in the real world for signals of effects on things like alcohol use. A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes tirzepatide-based competitors to Ozempic and Wegovy called Mounjaro and Zepbound, said Wednesday that it too had seen \u201canecdotal commentary in publications about the potential use of GLP-1s for additional indications like addiction.\u201d But while the Indianapolis-based drugmaker continues \u201cto evaluate future development options for tirzepatide,\u201d the spokesperson said the company hadn\u2019t announced any plans to develop its medicines for those uses. An unattractive market for drugmakers Medicines for addiction, and particularly for alcohol use, haven\u2019t been successful financially for the drug industry, leading to less interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing drugs in the space. Research from financial firm TD Cowen found that less than 5% of the 29 million Americans estimated to have alcohol-use disorder receive drug therapy. The firm pointed to issues like doctors not being familiar with medicines to treat alcohol use and compliance with the drugs. \u201cAlcohol is now the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver transplantation in the US,\u201d Leggio told CNN by email Thursday. \u201cWe do need to develop novel treatments for alcohol-associated liver disease itself, plus novel treatments for the underlying medical problem that leads to ALD; that is, alcohol use disorder.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very promising and exciting that a company like Novo Nordisk is taking the lead in conducting such an important clinical trial,\u201d Leggio said. Novo Nordisk is looking at multiple medicines in its newly announced trial in alcohol-related liver disease; in addition to semaglutide, the company said it will investigate experimental drugs cagrilintide and zalfermin \u2013 listed on the trial posting as NNC0194-0499 \u2013 alone and in combination. Cagrilintide is a medicine that mimics a hormone called amylin that Novo Nordisk is testing in combination with semaglutide \u2013 which mimics another hormone, called GLP-1 \u2013 in large trials in both diabetes and weight loss, calling the combination CagriSema. Zalfermin, the company said, acts like yet another metabolic hormone, FGF21, which is produced mainly in the liver. Though trials in use of semaglutide and similar medicines have been slow to start, so many reports of the drugs\u2019 effects on alcohol use have emerged that Leggio, Hendershot and other researchers warned in a commentary in the journal Nature Medicine that the drugs shouldn\u2019t be prescribed for alcohol-use disorder until their safety and efficacy has been proven in clinical trials. \u201cClinical decisions should follow from controlled studies, triangulated with other clinical and preclinical evidence,\u201d the researchers wrote in the December commentary. \u201cWell-controlled [trials] with scientific rigor are needed before any claim of efficacy for alcohol-use disorder and other substance use disorders can be made.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}

Eating\u00a0ultraprocessed foods\u00a0raises the risk of developing or dying from dozens of health conditions, according to a February review covering nearly 10 million people. Science has also shown that when you eat Mediterranean meals, which focus on vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and fish, you can reduce the risk of some\u00a0cancers,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0heart disease, high cholesterol\u00a0and stroke. Adopting this approach to eating can\u00a0also improve brain health, strengthen bones and ward off depression and dementia. Hot dogs and cookies are delicious, though. So, what to do? Spot the troublesome ingredients Many ultraprocessed foods have very long lists of ingredients and include additives, according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. If you can\u2019t pronounce the names in your food\u2019s ingredient list, that\u2019s a warning sign. The list may include preservatives designed to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing. All are signs that the food is ultraprocessed. Skip eating out when you can\u2019t tell what ingredients are in your food, and note that many items on fast-food restaurant menus can be ultraprocessed (such as hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets and fries). Start with breakfast Breakfast may be the easiest meal to change. Instead of sugar-fortified cereal or toaster waffles,\u00a0have some warm and filling ancient grains such as quinoa, sorghum or wheat berries cooked with milk, honey, nuts and fruits. No time in the morning to prepare breakfast? Prep these overnight oats the night before. Or have a simple small bowl of plain Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of sliced nuts to go. How processed is your lunch? Instead of a loaded deli sandwich or slices of pizza every day, try to bring your own plant-based lunch once or twice per week. I love adding roast chicken leftovers to this kale ricotta salad (sub in feta if you can\u2019t find the ricotta). Or make this dish by registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, founder of\u00a0Olive Tree Nutrition. She created her Warm Farro Grain Salad With Pomegranate for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better newsletter. Need more ideas? Check out CNN contributor Casey Barber\u2019s ideas for school lunch. Try our interactive to help you buy the least ultraprocessed lunch you can. Is it time for a snack? Snacks can be tricky. The no-fly list of ultraprocessed food is loaded with store-bought chips, sugar-packed yogurts and candy-filled trail mix. Instead, think about apples, oranges, bananas, carrot sticks, and other fruits and veggies. Protein-packed nuts and seeds are filling while also providing a brain boost and heart-healthy fats. If you want to get fancy, Al Bochi created this\u00a0roasted almond snack for CNN that features the Mediterranean spice blend za\u2019atar. Suzy Karadsheh\u2019s avocado salsa dip is also amazing for movie nights, the big game and parties (whichever one you choose). Dinner during the week With dinner a rushed affair for many overscheduled families, it can be impossible to cook during the week. Try to avoid fast-food burgers and chicken nuggets when you can.  Instead, consider grilling chicken or cooking ground turkey on the weekend for easy-assemble Tuesday taco night. Karadsheh also has a Mediterranean twist on tuna salad that will convert even the most anti-tuna eaters (which once included me). May I have dessert, please? Baked goods and ice cream are fine for special occasions, but for an everyday dessert that\u2019s not highly processed,\u00a0Al Bochi\u2019s recipe for Strawberry Ricotta Granola Parfaits is next level. For something grown-up, try poaching pears with\u00a0pomegranate juice\u00a0or port and serve them over yogurt or bake pears and other fruits in parchment. Does this still sound too hard? Ultraprocessed foods are designed to be fun and taste good. Reducing your reliance on them can be hard. Try one suggestion at a time, for a week at a time.

{"id": "2024_05_10_health_families-student-protest-fears-wellness", "text": "Whatever their personal or political allegiances, many college students are seeing their experience on campus influenced by the Israel-Hamas war. For some, division among their peers, disruption to academics and potential violence have affected their first experience away from home in what is expected to be a haven for exchanging ideas, said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, who also has grown children. While students navigate their own place in the conversation, many of their loved ones back home are worrying about them. Saltz spoke to CNN about the stress that families might be feeling and what they can do about it. This conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. CNN: Why is the conflict over the war happening on campuses stressful for many parents and families? Dr. Gail Saltz: There hasn\u2019t been much discussion about parents who are already in the unusual position of having children who are adults \u2014 I am supposed to respect their adulthood and their decision-making, and maybe offer an opinion if asked, but I\u2019m often not asked. But at the same time, I\u2019m still their parent. I still want what\u2019s best for them. I don\u2019t have eyeballs any longer \u2014 probably for the first time in their growing up \u2014 on what exactly is happening (around them). The uncertainty of what exactly is going on with your kid, while the atmosphere is filled with a lot of information, some of which sounds kind of dire, is very stressful. Dire can range from the university will not be able to function in the way that universities usually do, so that will impact their classes or social situations or grading, to things that are (really) dire, like when local police come (on campus). What will the impact of that be? If there will be suspensions and expulsions, then will this affect my child\u2019s future? CNN: Now that their kids are adults, many families might be feeling a bit helpless. Is there anything they can do? Saltz: Parents can talk to their kids, but the talking needs to be more in the question format than in the lecture format. When you\u2019re anxious, your tendency is to want to control, which would quell the anxiety. Every human feels the way to control is to dictate what to do. And so, it would be understandable that a parent would feel the best thing to do is to say, \u201cListen, I\u2019m hearing about X, Y or whatever it is. I don\u2019t want you to protest. I don\u2019t want you to do these things.\u201d But the reality is that your kid has aged out of when that would be remotely productive or impactful, and so it won\u2019t even achieve what you were hoping. The best way to deal with what we\u2019re talking about is really to do it in a question format. \u201cI would like to understand what\u2019s happening. Can you tell me how you\u2019re feeling about what\u2019s happening? What\u2019s your thought process?\u201d Everything you\u2019re concerned about may be framed in a \u201ctell me what you\u2019re thinking\u201d sort of way. It\u2019s difficult if they start saying they\u2019re thinking something that freaks you out to not jump in and say, \u201cWell don\u2019t do that.\u201d But really, I advise you to hear them out. You can definitely pose another question. For example, \u201cAnd how do you feel if the administration says these students are expelled?\u201d You hope that they\u2019re developing in their mind, on their own, (a way of) questioning what ultimately are good decisions for them, that fit with their values and morals but also consider things like their safety and well-being. CNN: Many families may be struggling with not being with their children as they navigate a complex issue. How can families support their students emotionally? Saltz: There\u2019s a lot of division (on campus), and some of the division is even amongst people who previously felt they were friends or people who were trying to be friends \u2026 or were certainly their classmates. There\u2019s a great sense of (people sorting out) what you think and what you\u2019re willing to do to show what you think indicates what team you\u2019re on. And so, people are having difficulty maintaining a friendship if they now somehow feel they\u2019re not on the same team. As is pretty much always the case, being able to talk about emotional tolls with anybody who you feel very supported by and is in your corner \u2014 whether it is your parents or siblings \u2014 is helpful. Just the venting part, without having to solve problems, can help, because really what they\u2019re looking for is just empathy, just being listened to, being understood and being allowed to say what a hard time they\u2019re having. Remind them they can ask for help. They can go talk to professors. If something is going on, there are resources at the school, and you hope that they will make use of that. Sometimes when kids become really overwrought, they sort of turtle and forget that, really, there are people at their school who are very aware what a difficult time this is for their students and are very willing to be there. Parents can listen for things that are concerning. If a kid is like, \u201cI can\u2019t get out of my bed. I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d you should be arranging help to get your child to see a mental health professional. CNN: If a parent or guardian\u2019s views differ from their child, that might feel like a rejection. How can parents provide that listening ear if their child has different beliefs? Saltz: Hopefully as a parent, you understand that your purpose in raising a child is to produce a full-fledged human being (who) has found their identity. That identity won\u2019t always match yours, and that they might even adopt \u2014 as teenagers do all the time \u2014 various identities. Whatever identity you even currently see might not be their endgame. I think all parents want their children to be happy and healthy. And to do that, they have to have the freedom to establish their own identity, and it might disappoint you that they don\u2019t have the same religious identity or the same political identity. Lots of parents struggle with this. In the healthiest parent-child relationship, to maintain closeness and to keep that relationship, you will allow that to happen. And you will say, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t agree, I understand where you\u2019re coming from, and I hope that you will continue to remember and understand where I\u2019m coming from, which does not mean that you have to be my clone.\u201d CNN: What would you say to parents who worry that their child\u2019s identity may feel threatened on campus? The reality is both Islamophobia and antisemitism have risen astronomically. If that happens to a kid, they may feel understandably emotionally threatened. If in anger, when their identity is being threatened, they have a behavioral response that provokes a physical confrontation, then they may be in danger. One thing a parent can do to help their student is to discuss through and analyze in a problem-solving way. A preplan helps with impulsive feelings that are brought on by being emotionally supercharged. If the safety issue is one of emotional safety, I go back to a parent helping a child through anti-bullying techniques. Those have to do with not engaging in the intended provocation and recruiting bystanders to support you. Bystanders can be more the pushers back on someone who is purposely bullying. But many of these protests are not about bullying. Many of the kids out there doing the protests are not saying anything antisemitic. CNN: How should parents and caregivers take care of their own mental health and well-being during this time? Saltz: Once your kid is an adult, there\u2019s a certain amount of acceptance that you can\u2019t walk them home and tuck them in. There is a point where you\u2019re acknowledging, \u201cMy child is an adult. That means that I can\u2019t control everything, and I have to accept that they will have failures and mistakes that I would not have wanted them to make.\u201d Those mistakes may feel dire and irrevocable, but that for the most part is pretty rare. There is a certain amount of perspective-taking that helps calm yourself down a little bit about what the possible outcomes you\u2019re worried about are and how they may be a bump in the road. Some parents are prone to high anxiety, particularly if you\u2019ve recently gone through or going through something else very difficult or traumatic. If so, I would advise you to seek some mental health care because it\u2019s really hard to help your child if you\u2019re undone. Take your own temperature. It\u2019s been a hard time, even before this war started for a lot of people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/families-student-protest-fears-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}

But there\u2019s another part of the anatomy that\u2019s often overlooked: the feet. Feet are wired up to nerve fiber tracts from the brain so you can stand, balance and wiggle your toes. They\u2019re also plumbed by blood vessels, which lead all the way from the heart. The appearance and function of our feet then can indicate viral infections, diseases of the cardiovascular system and even neurological disorders. Here are a couple of examples. READ MORE:\u00a0Is the \u2018barefoot-boy summer\u2019 trend bad for your feet? Hand, foot and mouth disease Infectious diseases tend to affect different parts of the body. Measles\u00a0usually starts off on the face, or in the mouth, as little spots that look like grains of sugar.\u00a0Pityriasis versicolor, a type of fungal infection, tends to begin and stay on the torso. The reasons why they tend to affect these areas is not well understood. Hand, foot and mouth disease, or HFM,\u00a0begins in exactly these areas. It\u2019s caused by a virus known as\u00a0coxsackie and tends to produce raised pink-red spots that can blister and weep. The name is a bit of a misnomer \u2014 the rash can also affect the legs and buttocks, too. Noticing a new rash on the feet should prompt a doctor to consider HFM. HFM is a common childhood illness that\u2019s very contagious. Thankfully, it\u2019s also usually short-lived, clearing without treatment after a few days. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with\u00a0foot and mouth\u00a0\u2014 or better, hoof and mouth, however. Foot and mouth is a different virus from HFM that (mainly) affects cloven-hoofed animals, such as cows and sheep. It\u2019s the disease that resulted in a\u00a0UK epidemic in 2001. READ MORE:\u00a0How much time should you spend sitting versus standing? New research reveals the optimal mix Heart, vessels and feet Our circulatory system supplies blood to every part of the body \u2014 from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes. By the time blood vessels reach these extremities, like twigs from a tree, they have branched and got much smaller in size. At some point, we\u2019ve all experienced the discomfort of icy cold feet, especially when going barefoot around the house or during chillier days. It\u2019s normal for feet to feel cool to the touch, but they should not change color from their usual skin color to blue \u2014 nor should they ever get painfully cold. Severe symptoms of discoloration and pain can point toward a phenomenon called\u00a0blue toe syndrome. It can be triggered by tiny little masses called microemboli, made up of blobs of cholesterol. These emboli pass easily through large vessels but will struggle as they become smaller. On reaching the smaller vessels of the feet, they finally become stuck, cutting off the blood supply. The tissues then become starved of oxygen, causing the feet to change color and become painful. In serious cases, blue toe syndrome can lead to tissue death, breakdown and the formation of gangrene, which may require\u00a0amputation\u00a0of toes \u2014 or even the whole foot. This rare condition is sometimes called\u00a0\u201ctrash foot,\u201d because of the way in which the feet become so discolored. What\u2019s the underlying cause of these tiny cholesterol fragments? Most likely aneurysms and atherosclerosis \u2014 vessels that have ballooned or hardened upstream of the feet. When trash foot does occur, it is often following surgical treatment for these conditions, such as\u00a0aortic aneurysm repair. The procedures disrupt the vessel, which can cause emboli to break off. As well as trash foot, there are other signs in the feet that can point toward cardiovascular disease.\u00a0Raised red swellings\u00a0appearing on the feet (as well as the hands) can indicate an infection of the heart called\u00a0bacterial endocarditis. These can be painless \u2014 in which case we call them Janeway lesions \u2014 or sore, which are called Osler\u2019s nodes. READ MORE:\u00a0Are your feet beach ready? The Babinski sign The toes can signal issues with the nervous system, too. If you\u2019ve ever watched \u201cER\u201d or\u00a0\u201dGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d\u00a0and heard one of the characters shout \u201cupgoing plantars!\u201d during a patient examination, you know they\u2019re referring to the Babinski reflex. After finding the upgoing plantar, the doctor may then have creased their brow with worry \u2014 and for good reason. The Babinski sign is a simple test that involves stroking the sole of the foot with a blunt-ended instrument to check the response of the toes. This is the\u00a0plantar reflex\u00a0\u2014 plantar relating to the sole of the foot. Normally, when this reflex is triggered, the toes should curl under or flex downward toward the sole. It the big toe points upward, and the smaller toes fan out, this is an \u201cupgoing plantar\u201d response \u2014 also known as the\u00a0Babinski sign, named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski who first described it. It is\u00a0normal to find this response in babies, whose nervous systems are undergoing development and not capable of all the motor functions of an adult. In\u00a0adults, however, finding the Babinski sign is an altogether different story. Most commonly, it signifies that a stroke is disrupting the normal brain circuitry that controls the feet. Other causes\u00a0include multiple sclerosis and (rarely) drug intoxication. In some otherwise healthy people though, the Babinski sign can be observed during deep sleep. The scope is much wider than just these conditions. Diabetes, kidney failure and even thyroid disorders can affect the feet. They are, therefore, important indicators of our health so regular checks are essential \u2014 and seek medical advice if you notice any pain, discoloration or rashes.

{"id": "2024_05_08_health_ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness", "text": "Eating ultraprocessed foods is associated with an early risk of death, according to a 30-year study \u2014 but different foods have different impacts. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. Processed meats and sugary foods and drinks aren\u2019t correlated with the same risks as ultraprocessed whole grains, for example, said lead study author Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. The study analyzed data from more than 100,000 health professionals in the United States with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. From 1986 to 2018, the participants provided information on their health and lifestyle habits every two years. Every four years, they completed a detailed food questionnaire. The group eating the least ultraprocessed food ate about three servings a day on average, while the highest averaged seven servings a day, according to the study published Wednesday in The BMJ journal. Those who ate the most had a 4% higher risk of deaths by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths, the data showed. Song described the correlation as \u201cmoderate,\u201d noting that the connection was not equally strong among all kinds of ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThe positive association is mainly driven by a few subgroups including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d he said. Findings in this study were consistent with hundreds of others in the field, but what makes this one unique is its parsing out of different subgroups within the ultraprocessed food category, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. Do we need to get rid of all ultraprocessed foods? Song wouldn\u2019t necessarily advise a complete rejection of all ultraprocessed foods because it is a diverse category, he said. \u201cCereals, whole grain breads, for example, they are also considered ultraprocessed food, but they contain various beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, I do think people should try to avoid or limit the consumption of certain ultraprocessed foods, such as processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and also potentially artificially sweetened beverages.\u201d There are also more questions that need to be answered when it comes to ultraprocessed foods. First, the recent study is strong because of the length of time covered\ufeff, but it is an observational study. That means that while researchers can observe a correlation, they can\u2019t say that the foods were the cause of the deaths, said Dr. Peter Wilde, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in the United Kingdom. Researchers also need to look more at the components of ultraprocessed foods that might be affecting health \u2014 whether they be food additives, emulsifiers or flavors \u2014 to advise governments and institutions on how to regulate foods, Song said. Overall diet matters most Researchers also found that the most important factor to reducing risk of death is the quality of a person\u2019s overall diet, Song said. \u201cIf people maintain a generally healthy diet, I don\u2019t think they need to be like scared or be freaked out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall dietary pattern is still the predominant factor determining the health outcomes.\u201d A healthy diet is varied, with as many colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains as possible, Wilde said. \u201cIf you are worried about food additives, then choose foods that have low levels of additives,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cJust be mindful of the nutritional content of (the ultraprocessed foods) that you do choose to consume.\u201d It is also important to recognize that foods need to be eaten in balance. Fruit juice contains beneficial vitamins, minerals and antioxidants when consumed in moderation, but too much will have high levels of sugar that may override their benefits, Wilde said. \u201cThis is not black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cA particular food is not either good or bad, it will contain elements of both, and the balance between the two may depend on how much you eat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_health_maycember-survival-guide-wellness", "text": "When my kids were in elementary school, the weeks between spring break and summer vacation seemed to go by at warp speed, mostly because I spent most of that time running the children from event to event in between work meetings. From Spring Sing to Mother\u2019s Day breakfast to field day and beyond, there was always a reason to be at school, send something to school or procure some special outfit for some event at school. It was exhausting. Cut to the teen years. You might think it\u2019s a little less intense, and perhaps parents of teens are even just a bit nostalgic for a Spring Sing, but sadly that\u2019s not the case. Sugar-fueled class parties were replaced with stress-fueled study groups for Advanced Placement exams, and field day morphed into an endless loop of sports tournaments (all of which require at least 45 minutes of commuting), not to mention prom, volunteer hours, extra credit projects, awards ceremonies, banquets, fundraisers and requests for parent volunteers to assist with a long list of school events. \u201cMaycember\u201d is a term that online content creators the Holderness family coined to describe the sheer chaos of the month of May, much like the month of December. Regardless of the age of your kids, both May and December are packed with social and school-related responsibilities, and it can become overwhelming. Sometimes it feels like Mayhem. Between the nonnegotiables, such as standardized testing and preparing for finals, and the carrots dangled to help them succeed, such as extra credit projects and appearances, teens are running on empty as the school year comes to an end. While it\u2019s certainly a nice gift to earn extra credit points by attending a school event, time off to rest on the weekend is another gift most exhausted teens can use as they crawl toward the finish line. While the teen years are generally characterized by increased independence and spending more time with friends than family, the expectations for parent involvement remain high this time of year. Though I\u2019ve been known to \u201cbuy time\u201d by donating extra funds if I can\u2019t take time off from work to volunteer on campus, there\u2019s still a lot to do before we store the backpacks for the season. While so many of these May obligations are impossible to move, I\u2019ve learned that there are some ways to make this time of year a little less hectic. Try these suggestions if you like \u2014 but don\u2019t make them another obligation! Hold your boundaries Setting boundaries is easy; it\u2019s holding boundaries that can be tricky. I\u2019m always grateful for the people who volunteer their time to head up committees on the PTA or parent board. Schools need parents who can transform ideas into reality and make things happen. It\u2019s their job to seek help (sometimes on repeat) until every action item is accounted for and every event is complete, but not every parent can volunteer for every event. Be clear and confident with your boundaries. If you can\u2019t volunteer for an event, but you can make a financial contribution, do that. If you can\u2019t do either, say that you would love to help another time. It\u2019s important to set boundaries around your time for volunteering, but it\u2019s equally important to set boundaries with your own kids. If attending every event isn\u2019t possible, talk with your kids about the events they hope you\u2019ll attend and why, then make a plan that works for everyone. You might even ask a grandparent or other relative to attend an event on your behalf. Telling your family that you simply can\u2019t do it all might feel like a failure, but it\u2019s a valuable life lesson. When families learn to prioritize, they take the time to consider what an event means to them and why it\u2019s important to attend. One way to start this conversation is to ask each kid to list their top three events for May and discuss them over an ice cream cone. You might even find that the things you thought were important (prom!) come in second place to something completely different (quiz bowl, anyone?). Parent guilt is real, and it can feel like missing these moments will be remembered for a lifetime. But the truth is that kids will remember the time you spent together and how they felt in your presence. Kids crave relational safety from their parents, not a camera roll full of snapshots from school events. Prioritize mental health No good comes from a family running around from event to event without a moment even to enjoy the ones they attend. Just like it\u2019s OK to skip out on some holiday parties in December, families are not required to respond \u201cyes\u201d to every invitation for end of the year celebrations. Particularly with teens, it\u2019s essential to model positive actions that promote mental health. Teens are wired to do all the things, so they don\u2019t always make the choice to slow down and pay attention to their minds and bodies. Parents can help by creating some mental health safe zones. Creating quiet nights to offset the celebrations takes the guesswork out of it for teens. Instead of trying to manage multiple events, they can simply say, \u201cI have a family thing tonight,\u201d and take a break from the action. Will every teen love this approach? No. That\u2019s OK. It\u2019s not your job to win coolest parent ever, but it is your job to help your teens learn to slow down when life gets overwhelming. They\u2019ll thank you for it one day. Watch your social media consumption People love to worry about how scrolling through social media affects teens, but not nearly enough attention is paid to how the same behavior affects parents. Seeing the perfect report cards, perfect test scores and parent attendance at every single thing can really wear you down, but you don\u2019t have to go there. You can set a time limit on your phone to decrease your own scrolling and think about replacement behaviors that feel better. I don\u2019t often feel great after getting lost in social media, but I always feel good after a rousing game of Bananagrams with my teens. It\u2019s an easy swap. Give yourself a break from comparison culture and focus on enjoying the time you can spend with your family during this busy season. In a few short weeks, Maycember will be behind us for another year, and we\u2019ll all breathe a sigh of relief. (Don\u2019t get me started about camp.) Until then, focus on relationship building over checking things off the list. You\u2019ll be glad you did.

{"id": "2024_05_13_health_ultraprocessed-food-bad-health-wellness", "text": "When\u00a0you open a bag of nacho-flavored chips or cheese puffs, you probably know that you\u2019re about to indulge in an unhealthy snack. The dead giveaway? It\u2019s the yummy, spicy, cheesy, neon-orange dust that coats each morsel and gets all over your fingers. Ditto for a frozen pizza and chicken nuggets. But what about a granola bar? An applesauce pouch? String cheese? Flavored yogurt? Surely these foods \u2014 snacks that millions of children and adults eat every day \u2014 are not bad, right? Well, it turns out that many fall under the category of ultraprocessed foods \u2014 depending on their exact ingredients. This type of food has been studied a lot lately, and the results aren\u2019t great. Ultraprocessed foods represent a relatively new way of categorizing foods. Proposed in 2009 by researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, the system, called NOVA, is based not on what kind of food it is \u2014 meat, grains, vegetables, etc. \u2014 but rather on how processed it is. NOVA separates foods into four groups, starting with natural and minimally processed foods in the first category to ultraprocessed foods, which use industrial formulations and manufacturing techniques, in the fourth. \u201cMy operating definition for ultraprocessed (foods) is you can\u2019t make it in your home kitchen because you don\u2019t have the machinery and you don\u2019t have the ingredients,\u201d food policy expert Dr. Marion Nestle told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell on the Chasing Life podcast recently. Nestle is the Paulette Goddard Professor of nutrition, food studies and public health, emerita, at New York University. Listen to more of the conversation between Nestle and Tirrell here. Ultraprocessed foods contain additives such as flavor enhancers, colors and thickeners \u2014 basically ingredients you wouldn\u2019t usually use in your cooking.\u00a0It makes them shelf-stable, easy to prepare (just heat and serve) and in many cases hard to resist. (The food industry pushes back on the NOVA system, saying there is no agreed-upon scientific consensus on the definition of ultraprocessed.) Due to a confluence of historical, regulatory and economic factors, Nestle said, food companies in the 1980s \u201cdid a lot of work on trying to figure out what flavor and texture and color combinations would be most attractive to people and started producing foods that would make them lots of money.\u201d She said tens of thousands of new products have hit store shelves since then. \u201cMost of them fail, but the ones that win, win big,\u201d Nestle said. Before you reach for that can of soda, bag of chips or frozen dinner, why not learn more about what you\u2019re eating? Here are five things to know about ultraprocessed foods: Ultraprocessed foods are linked to bad health outcomes Eating a lot of ultraprocessed foods isn\u2019t healthy. \u201cNow there have been more than 1,500 observational studies \u2014 all of them demonstrating a consistent finding, which is that eating ultraprocessed foods is linked to obesity,\u00a0type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, bad outcome from Covid-19, overall mortality,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cAny bad health problem you can think of that\u2019s related to diet is related specifically to ultraprocessed foods.\u201d The most recent study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, analyzed more than 30 years\u2019 worth of data and found that eating ultraprocessed foods was associated with a 4% higher risk of death by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths. Other studies have linked ultraprocessed foods to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Nestle pointed out that these studies have been observational and not designed to prove causation \u2014 that ultraprocessed foods caused these bad health outcomes. \u201cYou can do that when you have a controlled clinical trial,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd guess what? We have one.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods cause weight gain That one randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that ultraprocessed foods actually caused people to gain weight. These types of studies are not easy or cheap to undertake, which is why they are not done more often. To conduct this one, Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, had 20 volunteers spend four weeks living at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. For two weeks, they ate a diet made up of 80% healthy ultraprocessed foods (think yogurt and whole wheat bread, not chips and soda). For the other two weeks, they ate a diet that contained no ultraprocessed foods. The diets were matched, among other things, for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients. Participants did not know what exactly the study was measuring. \u201cWe basically just asked people, you know, just eat as much or as little of the food that you\u2019d like,\u201d Hall told Tirrell. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be trying to change your weight, (you) shouldn\u2019t be trying to gain weight or lose weight.\u00a0Just eat to the same level of appetite as you normally would.\u201d Researchers found that when the participants were on the ultraprocessed diet, they ate about 500 calories more per day than when they were on the minimally processed one. This difference in calories translated quickly to the scale. Participants gained on average 2 pounds during the two weeks on the ultraprocessed diet and lost 2 pounds on the minimally processed one. And their blood work showed lower markers of inflammation when they were on the latter. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with nutrition research, you have no idea what an important finding this is,\u201d said Nestle, who was not involved in the study. \u201cFive hundred calories is huge.\u201d Hall said it\u2019s unclear what drives people to consume more calories when they are on an ultraprocessed diet. \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re really interested in now,\u201d he said, \u201cis to figure out what the mechanisms were.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods are hard to avoid Ultraprocessed foods are everywhere, and most of us consume them without even realizing it \u2014 even when you think you are eating something relatively healthy, such as baked potato chips or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, researchers found that ultraprocessed foods make up more than half of American adults\u2019 diets. For US children, that percentage is even higher, at 67%. Ultraprocessed foods are cheap and convenient Yup, that\u2019s right: Truly eating \u201cclean\u201d costs more. \u201cTo actually create the minimally processed menu, it was about 40% more expensive than the ultraprocessed menu,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even account for the time that it takes to make the foods, right? So, all those factors probably play a huge role in \u2026 the foods that we choose to eat in the real world.\u201d Not all ultraprocessed foods are bad Some ultraprocessed foods can provide important nutrients, such as whole wheat bread and yogurt. And others, in Hall\u2019s study, were shown not to increase caloric intake. \u201cThe snacks were neutral in terms of how many calories (the participants) ate,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhich goes to show that not all ultraprocessed foods necessarily drive this effect.\u201d Hall\u2019s team is conducting a new study to tease out which ultraprocessed foods are harmful and which are neutral, or even healthy. Americans may soon get more help sorting through the health effects of ultraprocessed foods. The US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration will soon issue new Dietary Guidelines, which are updated every five years. Nestle said that the scientific advisory committee guiding this process has been asked to consider the connection between ultraprocessed foods and poor health outcomes. We hope these five things help you understand ultraprocessed foods a bit more.

{"id": "2024_05_17_world_black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn", "text": "Albert Einstein was right: There is an area at the edge of black holes where matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead falls in, as predicted by his theory of gravity. Using telescopes capable of detecting X-rays, a team of astronomers has for the first time observed this area \u2014 called the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 in a black hole about 10,000 light-years from Earth. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ignoring this region, because we didn\u2019t have the data,\u201d said research scientist Andrew Mummery, lead author of the study published Thursday in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \u201cBut now that we do, we couldn\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time that black holes have helped confirm Einstein\u2019s grand theory, which is also known as general relativity. The first photo of a black hole, captured in 2019, had previously strengthened the revolutionary physicist\u2019s core assumption that gravity is just matter bending the space-time fabric. Many of Einstein\u2019s other predictions have turned out to be correct over the years, among them gravitational waves and the universal speed limit. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough man to bet against at this point,\u201d said Mummery, a Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow in the department of physics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. \u201cWe went out searching for this one specifically \u2014 that was always the plan. We\u2019ve argued about whether we\u2019d ever be able to find it for a really long time,\u201d Mummery said. \u201cPeople said it would be impossible, so confirming it\u2019s there is really exciting.\u201d \u2018Like the edge of a waterfall\u2019 The observed black hole is in a system called MAXI J1820 + 070, which is made up of a star smaller than the sun and the black hole itself, estimated at 7 to 8 solar masses. The astronomers used NASA\u2019s space-based NuSTAR and NICER telescopes to collect data and understand how hot gas, called plasma, from the star gets sucked into the black hole. NuSTAR is short for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, which orbits Earth, and NICER, formally known as the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, is located on the International Space Station. \u201cAround these black holes there are big discs of orbiting material (from nearby stars),\u201d Mummery said. \u201cMost of it is stable, which means it can happily flow. It\u2019s like a river, whereas the plunging region is like the edge of a waterfall \u2014 all of your support is gone and you\u2019re just crashing headfirst. Most of what you can see is the river, but there\u2019s this tiny region at the very end, which is basically what we found,\u201d he added, noting that while the \u201criver\u201d had been widely observed, this is the first evidence of the \u201cwaterfall.\u201d Unlike the event horizon, which is closer to the center of the black hole and doesn\u2019t let anything escape, including light and radiation, in the \u201cplunging region\u201d light can still escape, but matter is doomed by the powerful gravitational pull, Mummery explained. The study\u2019s findings could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes. \u201cWe can really learn about them by studying this region, because it\u2019s right at the edge, so it gives us the most information,\u201d Mummery said. One thing that\u2019s missing from the study is an actual image of the black hole, because it is too small and far away. But another team of Oxford researchers is working on something even better than a picture: the first movie of a black hole. To achieve that, the team will first need to build a new observatory, the Africa Millimetre Telescope in Namibia, which Mummery expects to be online within a decade. The telescope, which will join the international Event Horizon Telescope collaboration that captured the groundbreaking 2019 image of the black hole, will enable scientists to observe and film large black holes at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. A link to the past According to Christopher Reynolds, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, finding actual evidence for the \u201cplunging region\u201d is an important step that will let scientists significantly refine models for how matter behaves around a black hole. \u201cFor example, it can be used to measure the rotation rate of the black hole,\u201d said Reynolds, who was not involved in the study. Dan Wilkins, a research scientist at Stanford University in California, calls it an exciting development, and points out that in 2018 there was an enormously bright outburst of light from one of the black holes within our galaxy, paired with an excess of high-energy X-rays. \u201cWe had hypothesized at the time that this excess was from the hot material in the \u2018plunging region,\u2019 but we did not have a full theoretical prediction of what that emission would look like,\u201d said Wilkins, who also was not involved with the new study. This study actually performs that calculation, he added, using Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity to predict what the X-rays emitted by material in the \u201cplunging region\u201d would look like around a black hole, and compares it with the data from that bright outburst in 2018. \u201cThis will be prime discovery space over the next decade or so,\u201d Wilkins said, \u201cas we look towards the next generation of X-ray telescopes that will give us more detailed measurements of the innermost regions just outside the event horizons of black holes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_world_solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn", "text": "A series of solar flares and coronal mass ejections from the sun have the potential to create dazzling auroras that may be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California but also disrupt communications on Earth tonight and over the weekend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The center, which is a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005. But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The Space Weather Prediction Center tracked multiple strong flares emitting from a large cluster of sunspots on the solar surface since Wednesday. The cluster is 17 times the diameter of Earth. Scientists also observed at least seven coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, releasing from the sun in the direction of Earth. These significant outbursts are expected to continue through Sunday. The center\u2019s space weather scale covers three categories: solar flares that cause high-frequency radio blackouts, geomagnetic storms and solar radiation storms. The current solar activity is capable of producing a solar radiation storm, according to Shawn Dahl, the service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cThat\u2019s the very low end of our scale,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cIt does mean things to some rocket launch operations and satellite operators. But at this point in time, it\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be handled as far as we understand it. The potential for stronger events of course does exist and we\u2019ll see if any materialize.\u201d The peak of the geomagnetic storm activity for Earth could occur between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET on Saturday, the center has forecasted. The center referred to this as \u201can unusual event.\u201d There have been three geomagnetic storms since December 2019, but all of them have been considered weak, according to the center. Geomagnetic storms driven by the sun in recent months have caused auroras to be visible in places where they are rarely seen, including as far south as New Mexico, Missouri, North Carolina and California in the United States, and the southeast of England and other parts of the United Kingdom. The solar storm caused a dazzling aurora australis to light up the sky over New Zealand around 6:20 a.m. local time. Depending on the location, the auroras may not always be visible overhead, but keep an eye on the horizon, experts say, because they may create a colorful display there as well. Even if auroras aren\u2019t visible in the sky, experts at the center recommend taking images of the sky with your phone because the images may capture what you can\u2019t see with the naked eye. \u201cA severe storm would mean that the aurora will likely be visible in southern Michigan,\u201d said Michael Liemohn, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in a statement. \u201cGet away from city lights to a place with clear skies and you should be able to see the green or red glow of aurora across the sky.\u201d The effects of geomagnetic storms When coronal mass ejections are directed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGeomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth\u2019s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\u201d according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201c(The center) has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action.\u201d The center has notified operators in these areas to take action to mitigate the potential for any impacts, which include the possibility of increased and more frequent voltage control problems. Other aspects operators will monitor include a chance of anomalies or impacts to satellite operations and frequent or longer periods of GPS degradation. In turn, the operators also make sure power lines are performing as expected, ensure that alternate equipment is available and functioning, and any maintenance is suspended, Dahl said. \u201cBut the key element here is that they know what\u2019s causing anything if the situation unfolds that will allow us to be able to take the proper steps to help mitigate and control any developing problems,\u201d Dahl said. When coronal mass ejections arrive, they carry their own magnetic field, which can overwhelm power lines and induce electrical currents, so operators will monitor for any signs of such activity, said Rob Steenburgh, space scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about impacts to the power grid, we\u2019re talking about the high voltage transmission lines. That\u2019s where these currents can develop. It\u2019s not on any line going from a small transformer to their home,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cIt\u2019s only really developing on the high voltage transmission lines, which creates problems for the major transformers that control distribution.\u201d Solar storms generated by the sun can also cause radio blackouts and even pose risks for crewed space missions. NASA\u2019s Space Radiation Analysis Group is dedicated to monitoring conditions for astronauts aboard the International Space Station. If there appears to be an increased radiation risk, the astronauts can move to parts of the station that are more well-shielded. \u201cDuring the recent solar weather activity that measured higher than originally predicted aboard the International Space Station on May 11, the Expedition 71 crew was told to avoid lower shielded areas of the space station out of an abundance of caution,\u201d according to a May 14 update released by the federal agency. The center warned that additional solar activity could cause geomagnetic storm conditions to be ongoing through the weekend. So far, researchers have obseverd only three severe geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle, which began in December 2019, according to the center. Experts at the center say they are a \u201clittle concerned,\u201d but mainly because such events are rare. The team likened it to being prepared for a summer storm: Keep batteries and a weather radio on hand in the event of a power outage, but said that people don\u2019t need to \u201cdo anything out of the ordinary\u201d to prepare for space weather. No disruption to internet or cellphone service is expected. And any disruption to GPS is not expected to be prolonged, as long as providers can quickly lock back on to satellite signals, according to experts at the center. Tracking space weather Every 11 years or so, the sun experiences periods of low and high solar activity, which is associated with the amount of sunspots on its surface. The sun\u2019s strong and constantly shifting magnetic fields drive these dark regions, some of which can reach the size of Earth or larger. Over the course of a solar cycle, the sun will transition from a calm to an intense and active period. During the peak of activity, called solar maximum, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip. Then, the sun will grow quiet again during a solar minimum. Solar maximum is expected to peak through mid- to late 2024, but the sun will remain active for a couple of years afterward. Teams at the Space Weather Prediction Center use data from ground and space-based observatories, magnetic maps of the solar surface, and ultraviolet observations of the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere to determine when the sun is most likely to send out solar flares, coronal mass ejections and other space weather that could affect Earth. Solar flares can affect communications and GPS almost immediately because they disrupt Earth\u2019s ionosphere, or part of the upper atmosphere. Energetic particles released by the sun can also disrupt electronics on spacecraft and affect astronauts without proper protection within 20 minutes to several hours. The material sent speeding away from the sun during coronal mass ejections can arrive at Earth between 30 and 72 hours afterward, causing geomagnetic storms that affect satellites and create electrical currents in the upper atmosphere that travel through the ground and can have an impact on electric power grids. The storms also affect flight patterns of commercial airlines, which are instructed to stay away from Earth\u2019s poles during geomagnetic storms due to loss of communication or navigation capabilities. Extreme storms have occurred before, such as one that knocked out the power grid in Quebec in 1989 and the Carrington Event of 1859.The latter remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded, causing telegraph stations to spark and catch fire. If such an event were to occur today, it could cause trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and bring down some power grids for a substantial amount of time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/world/solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_breastfeeding-mom-public-shame-sinf-cec", "text": "It\u2019s spring, and the air is filled with the melodies of mating songbirds. But when I walk down a tidy street near my suburban Virginia home, the jarring memory of another sound echoes in my mind: my daughter\u2019s piercing screams. Those desperate cries jolted me out of a daydream as I pushed her stroller down this very sidewalk back in December 2022. My daughter was home sick from daycare, and I\u2019d taken her on a walk hoping the cooler air would calm her cough. It seemed to be working, until suddenly, it clearly wasn\u2019t. There are so many moments as a parent when you find yourself doing something you vowed you\u2019d never do \u2014 especially when your child is having a meltdown in public. This was one of those moments for me, but that alone is not why it\u2019s seared in my mind. I will never forget that day, not because of what my child did, or even how I handled it, but because of the surprising way a stranger responded. On that December afternoon, my usually sweet 17-month-old was erupting into a full-blown meltdown. As her face reddened with rage, I tried handing her the bottle I\u2019d brought. She swatted it to the ground and kicked her feet so hard one of her shoes flew off. Even though she was still learning her first words, she had no trouble expressing herself. She didn\u2019t want milk from a bottle. She wanted it direct from the source: me. The way I saw it, that was simply impossible here \u2014 and the idea of it was mortifying. I hadn\u2019t brought my nursing cover, the tasteful shawl I made a point of wearing while feeding her in public.\u00a0Whenever she needed to nurse, I tried to cover up politely or slip away out of view. On this street, we were exposed. There was nowhere to hide. It\u2019s only as I describe it now that I realize how bizarre that sounds. There are so many parts of the world where women and children truly need to take cover to survive. I was lucky to be somewhere safe. And besides, I was proud to be a mom and loved feeding my daughter, so why was I acting so ashamed? Long before I ever had a child of my own, I\u2019d heard comments from TV personalities who\u2019d slammed breastfeeding in public, I\u2019d read news stories about women who were told to cover up, and I\u2019d even heard some snide remarks from members of my own family about the way moms nursed their kids. Of course, I\u2019d also read about celebrities and seen friends who defied these antiquated expectations. And once I started breastfeeding in public myself, most people didn\u2019t really notice \u2014 or at least, they acted like they didn\u2019t. But still, whenever I fed my daughter outside our home, part of me felt anxious about whether anyone was going to be offended. The years of comments I\u2019d heard sent a message so clear that I\u2019d developed a sense of shame around my body, and around feeding my child, without even realizing it. So even as my daughter\u2019s cries grew louder on that December afternoon, breastfeeding her seemed out of the question. In every direction I looked, there were blocks of houses and nicely manicured lawns, with no benches or parks in sight.\u00a0Plopping down in the middle of the sidewalk and lifting up my shirt was something I\u2019d NEVER do. Returning home was the only escape route I could see. I did a quick calculation. If I walked fast, we could probably get home in 10 minutes. Imagining the large number of houses we\u2019d have to pass with her screaming at the top of her lungs, I plowed ahead. But the meltdown only intensified with each step. And as I saw my daughter gasping to catch her breath with tears streaming down her face, and as I thought about how hard the past few nights had been, with coughing fits keeping her up for hours, I realized that giving her what she needed was the only thing that mattered. So suddenly, there I was \u2014 after months of trying to be discreet so I wouldn\u2019t make anyone else uncomfortable while I fed my child \u2014 sitting cross-legged in the middle of a sidewalk, lifting up my shirt and praying no one would notice us. I was relieved to see how quickly she relaxed, but I braced myself every time I heard a car engine rumbling or the jangle of a dog\u2019s leash. Someone was going to see us and say something. I wished I could sink into the ground and hide. In the distance, I saw a woman walking brusquely in our direction. I steeled myself for the criticism I knew had to be coming. Why was I blocking the sidewalk? Why was I flashing the neighbors rather than feeding my daughter at home? Why couldn\u2019t I get it together and control my child? But once she reached our stretch of the sidewalk, this stranger didn\u2019t ask any of those questions. Her words were kind and compassionate. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d she asked. I was stunned. I\u2019d been so certain she would judge me. \u201cYes,\u201d I said a bit sheepishly. \u201cShe just melted down, and I had to feed her.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t glare. She smiled. Then she told me how beautiful my daughter and I looked sitting there together, paired with the classical music piping through her headphones. She was standing a few feet away, but her words were an embrace I hadn\u2019t even realized I needed. In a matter of moments, I started to see the same beauty she did. I let go of the pressure and shame that had been weighing on me and found myself opening up. It\u2019s been more than a year since our paths crossed, and I can no longer remember this woman\u2019s face, but I can still feel her warmth. That day, I told her that we\u2019d been on a peaceful walk when suddenly the situation turned. My daughter had been home sick all week, I explained, and she was simply exhausted.

{"id": "2024_05_17_health_flirt-covid-variants-summer-wave-risk", "text": "Covid-19 levels are about the lowest they\u2019ve ever been in the United States, but another new crop of virus variants once again threatens to disrupt the downward trend as the country heads into summer. KP.2 \u2014 one of the so-called FLiRT variants \u2014 has overtaken JN.1 to become the dominant coronavirus variant in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data through May 11 shows that it\u2019s responsible for more than a quarter of cases in the country, which is nearly twice as many as JN.1. A related variant, KP.1.1, has caused about 7% of cases, CDC data shows. FLiRT variants are offshoots of the JN.1 variant \u2014 all part of the broader Omicron family \u2014 that caused this winter\u2019s wave. The acronym in the name refers to the locations of the amino acid mutations that the virus has picked up \u2014 some in places that help it evade the body\u2019s immune response and others that help it become more transmissible. Covid-19 variants are \u201caccumulating mutations that do one of two things: They either cause antibodies that you\u2019ve accumulated from vaccination or infection to no longer bind to the to the virus \u2014 we call that escape from immunity \u2014 or they increase the strength in which the viruses bind to cells,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This has become a familiar pattern in the way the virus that causes Covid-19 continues to evolve, but experts say we still don\u2019t know enough to predict exactly where the changes will occur next or how they will affect the way the virus moves through the population. The mutations of the FLiRT variants make increased transmissibility \u2014 and a possible summer wave \u2014 a real threat. Covid-19 is settling into some seasonal patterns, which have included a summer bump in years past, but the exact level of risk for this year is unclear. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some variants in the past that start out kind of strong and then don\u2019t take over. These subvariants could progressively become dominant, or they could get up to accounting for somewhere between 20% and 40% of the cases and then just stay there. We just have to see,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThe virus continues to be in charge. It\u2019s going to tell us what it\u2019s going to do. All of our crystal balls are rather cloudy.\u201d Covid-19 surveillance has scaled back significantly since the US public health emergency ended a year ago, which also adds to the uncertainty. But the data that is available is consistent. For now, wastewater surveillance suggests that viral activity is very low and decreasing in all regions of the country, and Covid-19 hospitalization rates remain extremely low. \u201cWe learned from the laboratories that FLiRT variants appeared, so far, to be as transmissible as the other Omicron subvariants, which means they\u2019re really quite contagious. But they do not appear to be producing more severe disease or any sort of illness that\u2019s distinctive from the point of view of clinical presentation symptoms,\u201d Schaffner said. As of May 1, the requirement for all hospitals to report Covid-19 data to the federal government has expired. But Schaffner\u2019s Vanderbilt University Medical Center is part of a CDC-run surveillance network that continues to track trends based on a sample of hospitals that cover about 10% of the US population. Covid-19 hospitalization rates have fallen from nearly 8 new admissions for every 100,000 people in the first week of the year to about 1 new admission for every 100,000 people at the end of April, the data shows. While the FLiRT variants pose some risk this summer, experts remain focused on what might happen in the fall. \u201cIf I were to predict, I would say that this might result in a few extra cases, a small surge this summer. But it\u2019s really going to be about which variant is around when we get to the fall,\u201d Pekosz said. \u201cThe fall is probably when we should expect to see a surge of Covid cases. And if we have a variant around there that has a lot of these mutations that avoid immunity, then the potential in the fall to have a larger surge is greater.\u201d The fall and winter pose a greater risk because of the immunity that has built up in the population, he said. \u201cThe virus now needs better conditions to transmit, and those better conditions to transmit are probably going to happen in the fall when weather gets cooler, people are spending more time indoors and they\u2019re more likely to be in environments where respiratory virus transmission occurs more efficiently.\u201d Research published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA is a reminder of the burden that Covid-19 continues to have in the US. This winter, while Covid-19 hospitalization rates were far lower than they were in earlier years, it was still deadlier than the flu. A study of thousands of hospital patients found that 5.7% of Covid-19 patients died, compared with 4.2% of those hospitalized for influenza. In other words, Covid-19 carried about a 35% higher risk of death than flu. People who received the latest Covid-19 vaccine this past fall may still have some protection against the latest variants; that vaccine targeted a different strain but was found to be similarly effective against JN.1, and experts say that some of those benefits may extend to its FLiRT relatives. People who had a recent infection \u2014 especially since the start of the year, when JN.1 was prominent \u2014 may also have some protection. But immunity wanes over time. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee will meet to discuss recommendations for the version of the Covid-19 vaccine that will be available this fall. The meeting was postponed by about three weeks in order to \u201callow for additional time to obtain surveillance data\u201d to have \u201cmore up-to-date information when discussing and making recommendations,\u201d according to a post on the federal agency\u2019s website. For now, experts say, risk remains relatively low. \u201cAs with all things Covid, our outlook may change in a week or two. But at the moment, we\u2019re in really a very good place \u2014 the best place we\u2019ve been in for a long, long time,\u201d Schaffner said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/flirt-covid-variants-summer-wave-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers", "text": "Laboratory tests by the US Department of Agriculture haven\u2019t found any H5N1 bird flu virus in raw beef, but they are a good reminder why eating rare hamburgers can be risky. As part of a suite of tests conducted to check safe food handling advice after the detection of H5N1 bird flu virus in dairy cattle, the USDA recently mixed a substitute virus into ground beef and then cooked patties at varying times and temperatures. Researchers found none of the virus in hamburgers cooked to 145 degrees, roughly the temperature of a medium burger, or well-done burgers cooked to 160 degrees. They did, however, find some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, although the virus was present \u201cat much, much reduced levels,\u201d said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA. Whether that small amount of virus could make someone sick is still an unknown. The USDA already advises consumers to cook ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, as measured with a food thermometer, to avoid infections from bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli, he noted. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody needs to change any of the safe food handling or safe cooking practices that are already recommended,\u201d Deeble said. The USDA also announced $22 million in new government investments to protect animal health. The bulk of the funding will go to the Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and to a network of state laboratories called the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. \u201cThere are some labs that have equipment that needs to be updated or upgraded and additional folks that are interested in adding capacity to the laboratories that they operate. And so this funding is going to help support those types of projects,\u201d Deeble said Thursday. Between May 6 and May 12, the national lab network processed 1,100 tests for H5N1 bird flu in cattle, and 278 of those were presumed positive, Deeble said.\u00a0He cautioned that because multiple samples can be taken from the same animal or tests may be pooled, the number of tests doesn\u2019t reflect the number of animals tested or the number that are positive.\u00a0Approximately 600 of the tests were performed in accordance with the USDA\u2019s new order, which requires testing of dairy cattle moving between states.\u00a0Another 450 tests were performed on animals showing symptoms. USDA said that it had gotten a positive response to its offer last week to financially compensate producers who take steps to protect their herds and workers against further spread of the virus. However, it doesn\u2019t have the forms ready for farmers to fill out, so nobody has been signed up for the program.\u00a0It hopes to have the paperwork ready by the middle of next week, Deeble said. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency had not been able to find farmworkers willing to participate in studies looking at how bird flu transmits on dairy farms in return for $75. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up hope. We are in\u00a0constant conversation with a number of states. We\u2019re getting closer, but as of yet, nothing across the finish line,\u201d Shah said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_medical-residents-abortion-restrictions-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "Isabella Rosario Blum was wrapping up medical school and considering residency programs to become a family practice physician when she got some frank advice: If she wanted to be trained to provide abortions, she shouldn\u2019t stay in Arizona. Blum turned to programs mostly in states where abortion access \u2014 and, by extension, abortion training \u2014 is likely to remain protected, like California, Colorado, and New Mexico. Arizona has enacted a law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. \u201cI would really like to have all the training possible,\u201d she said, \u201cso of course that would have still been a limitation.\u201d In June, she will start her residency at Swedish Cherry Hill hospital in Seattle. According to new statistics from the Association of American Medical Colleges, for the second year in a row, students graduating from U.S. medical schools were less likely to apply this year for residency positions in states with abortion bans and other significant abortion restrictions. Since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, state fights over abortion access have created plenty of uncertainty for pregnant patients and their doctors. But that uncertainty has also bled into the world of medical education, forcing some new doctors to factor state abortion laws into their decisions about where to begin their careers. Fourteen states, primarily in the Midwest and South, have banned nearly all abortions.\u00a0The new analysis by the AAMC\u00a0\u2014 a preliminary copy of which was exclusively reviewed by KFF Health News before its public release \u2014 found that the number of applicants to residency programs in states with near-total abortion bans declined by 4.2%, compared with a 0.6% drop in states where abortion remains legal. Notably, the AAMC\u2019s findings illuminate the broader problems abortion bans can create for a state\u2019s medical community, particularly in an era of provider shortages: The organization tracked a larger decrease in interest in residencies in states with abortion restrictions not only among those in specialties most likely to treat pregnant patients, like OB-GYNs and emergency room doctors, but also among aspiring doctors in other specialties. \u201cIt should be concerning for states with severe restrictions on reproductive rights that so many new physicians \u2014 across specialties \u2014 are choosing to apply to other states for training instead,\u201d wrote Atul Grover, executive director of the AAMC\u2019s Research and Action Institute. The AAMC analysis found the number of applicants to OB-GYN residency programs in abortion ban states dropped by 6.7%, compared with a 0.4% increase in states where abortion remains legal. For internal medicine, the drop observed in abortion ban states was over five times as much as in states where abortion is legal. In its analysis, the AAMC said an ongoing decline in interest in ban states among new doctors ultimately \u201cmay negatively affect access to care in those states.\u201d Jack Resneck Jr., immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said the data demonstrates yet another consequence of the post-Roe v. Wade\u00a0era. The AAMC analysis notes that even in states with abortion bans, residency programs are filling their positions \u2014 mostly because there are more graduating medical students in the U.S. and abroad than there are residency slots. Still, Resneck said, \u201cwe\u2019re extraordinarily worried.\u201d For example, physicians without adequate abortion training may not be able to manage miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, or potential complications such as infection or hemorrhaging that could stem from pregnancy loss. Those who work with students and residents say their observations support the AAMC\u2019s findings. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to go to a place where evidence-based practice and human rights in general are curtailed,\u201d said Beverly Gray, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine. Abortion in North Carolina is banned in nearly all cases after 12 weeks. Women who experience unexpected complications or discover their baby has potentially fatal birth defects later in pregnancy may not be able to receive care there. Gray said she worries that even though Duke is a highly sought training destination for medical residents, the abortion ban \u201cimpacts whether we have the best and brightest coming to North Carolina.\u201d Rohini Kousalya Siva will start her obstetrics and gynecology residency at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., this year. She said she did not consider programs in states that have banned or severely restricted abortion, applying instead to programs in Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, and Washington, D.C. \u201cWe\u2019re physicians,\u201d said Kousalya Siva, who attended medical school in Virginia and was previously president of the American Medical Student Association. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be giving the best evidence-based care to our patients, and we can\u2019t do that if we haven\u2019t been given abortion training.\u201d Another consideration: Most graduating medical students are in their 20s, \u201cthe age when people are starting to think about putting down roots and starting families,\u201d said Gray, who added that she is noticing many more students ask about politics during their residency interviews. And because most young doctors make their careers in the state where they do their residencies, \u201cpeople don\u2019t feel safe potentially having their own pregnancies living in those states\u201d with severe restrictions, said Debra Stulberg, chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Chicago. Stulberg and others worry that this self-selection away from states with abortion restrictions will exacerbate the shortages of physicians in rural and underserved areas. \u201cThe geographic misalignment between where the needs are and where people are choosing to go is really problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people further concentrating in urban areas where there\u2019s already good access.\u201d After attending medical school in Tennessee, which has adopted one of the most sweeping abortion bans in the nation, Hannah Light-Olson will start her OB-GYN residency at the University of California-San Francisco this summer. It was not an easy decision, she said. \u201cI feel some guilt and sadness leaving a situation where I feel like I could be of some help,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel deeply indebted to the program that trained me, and to the patients of Tennessee.\u201d Light-Olson said some of her fellow students applied to programs in abortion ban states \u201cbecause they think we need pro-choice providers in restrictive states now more than ever.\u201d In fact, she said, she also applied to programs in ban states when she was confident the program had a way to provide abortion training. \u201cI felt like there was no perfect, 100% guarantee; we\u2019ve seen how fast things can change,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel particularly confident that California and New York aren\u2019t going to be under threat, too.\u201d As a condition of a scholarship she received for medical school, Blum said, she will have to return to Arizona to practice, and it is unclear what abortion access will look like then. But she is worried about long-term impacts. \u201cResidents, if they can\u2019t get the training in the state, then they\u2019re probably less likely to settle down and work in the state as well,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_04_29_health_genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Even if your genetics put you at greater risk for early death, a healthy lifestyle could help you significantly combat it, according to a new study. That risk could be mitigated by about 62% in people with a genetic predisposition, said lead author Dr. Xifeng Wu, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejiang Univeristy School of Medicine in China. Many studies have shown the connection between a healthy lifestyle and longevity and others have underscored the genetic component in lifespan, but the report published Monday in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine explored how the two come together. With data from more than 350,000 people and information on their genetics, education, socioeconomic status and disease history, this study had strong methodology, said Dr. Aladdin Shadyab, associate professor of public health and medicine at University of California San Diego. He was not involved in the research. The sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added. The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan. Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed. And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Wu, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University. Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed. \u201cAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,\u201d Wu said. The factors that made a difference The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan. But researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death. \u201cThe study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors \u2014 no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet \u2014 that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,\u201d Wu said. Adequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults. Moderate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Making lifestyle changes Building a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there. There are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking. A CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Committing to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of \u201cMindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,\u201d said in a previous CNN article. For a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly. When it comes to catching enough z\u2019s, if you can\u2019t seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you can\u2019t sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics. And if you\u2019ve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_health_wegovy-trial-analysis", "text": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use. The analyses \u2013 of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss \u2013 also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used \u2013 and covered by insurers. \u201cThe implications are profound,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. \u201cWe have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.\u201d More than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans. One important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely \u2013 and how long \u2013 they\u2019ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years. Researchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways: Weight loss continued for more than a year The analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau. A previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events. It was sustained for up to four years The results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years. Patients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight. However, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did \u2013 almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug. Results vary for everyone In the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines. No safety surprises out to four years Overall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased. The researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn\u2019t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug\u2019s prescribing information because they\u2019d been seen previously in trials. Benefits beyond weight loss A key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play. That\u2019s because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didn\u2019t lose weight. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefit\u201d with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the new analyses. \u201cThat\u2019s because that\u2019s what GLP-1 does: It\u2019s cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you don\u2019t require weight loss \u2013 it\u2019s not the whole story.\u201d An analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight. \u201cThis suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,\u201d or body fat, the researchers concluded. A separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said. \u201cThese two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.\u201d A benefit from reducing inflammation Drucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,\u201d he said. But based on his lab\u2019s research, he said, \u201cone of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.\u201d Drucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis \u2013 driven by inflammation \u2013 who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive. The results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who don\u2019t have obesity or aren\u2019t overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event \u2013 another thing that would need to be studied. And, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely. \u201cWe probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are going to be helpful in terms of actually improving\u00a0health\u00a0and saving lives and saving\u00a0health\u00a0care dollars in people with obesity and heart disease even without much weight loss,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes and\u00a0death.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/health/wegovy-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_health_ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness", "text": "The ultraprocessed foods your kids eat now may be putting them a greater risk for cardiometabolic problems \u2013 like heart attack, stroke and diabetes \u2013 in adulthood, a new study suggests. \u201cOne of the important things to learn is that some of the things that we deal with in the adult world, more likely than not start very early in life,\u201d said Dr. Stuart Berger, a pediatric cardiologist and chair of the section of cardiology and cardiac surgery for the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the research. The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, analyzed data from more than 1,400 children ages 3 to 6 recruited from schools across seven cities in Spain. The children\u2019s caregivers met with researchers in person and completed questionnaires at home on physical activity, food consumption and demographics from 2019 to 2022, according to the study. Researchers divided the data from the children into three groups based on the amount of ultraprocessed food they ate. Children who consumed the most ultraprocessed foods were more likely to have risk factors like a higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure and waist-to-height ratio, the study showed. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, chicken nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. \u201cAmericans eat ultraprocessed foods every day,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. A group of Americans in a study published on May 8 ate at least three servings of ultraprocessed food a day, with one group eating an average of seven daily servings, the study showed. Many studies have shown the negative health effects of ultraprocessed foods in adults, but Friday\u2019s study is among the first to show the impact they can have on the cardiometabolic health of young children, said Berger, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago. \u201cThis particular topic, ultraprocessed food consumptions and risk, is a very important topic in kids,\u201d he said. Starting young The study is observational, meaning that while researchers can identify an association between how much ultraprocessed foods children eat and their health, they cannot say that one causes the other, Berger said. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be mindful of ultraprocessed foods for young children, because how they eat for the rest of their lives is greatly impact by their early nutrition, he said. \u201cWhat we know is people who eat a certain way, even moms who eat in utero, set up baby\u2019s preferences,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere are a ton of publications that have shown that what we eat early in life \u2026 actually sets the stage for what happens in the future.\u201d Shifting your child\u2019s diet away from ultraprocessed foods and toward more fresh options is easier to do when they are very young, Berger said. Ultra-convenient The problem is that avoiding ultraprocessed foods is not equally easy for everyone. The study found that the children with the highest amount of ultraprocessed foods in their diet had mothers who were younger, had a higher BMI and had lower levels of education and employment. In places where fresh food might be harder to obtain, ultraprocessed foods are more accessible and inexpensive, Freeman said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are also ultra-convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, people reach for them when they feed their kids, and their kids aren\u2019t hungry, but they\u2019re filled with all these different chemicals and substances and seasonings and salts of sugars and whatever that they become very addicted to.\u201d Freeman stressed that giving kids ultraprocessed foods without also providing fresh fruits and vegetables sets them up for problems down the road. Adding in more nutritious foods and encouraging physical activity as much as possible is critical, Berger added. \u201cIf you can do something to create a healthy lifestyle early, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that you can you can eliminate metabolic syndromes later in life like diabetes, obesity, and all the complications associated with diabetes and obesity,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
