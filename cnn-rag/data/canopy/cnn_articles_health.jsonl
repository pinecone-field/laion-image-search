{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_low-back-pain-walking-wellness", "text": "Low back pain affects at least 619 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to increase to 843 million people by 2050, according to research estimates. Unfortunately, nearly 70% of people who recover from an episode of low back pain have a recurrence within a year, experts say. In addition to acute physical discomfort and lost time at work, treatment often requires education, physical therapy and exercises such as Pilates that may require fees or specialized equipment. Yet there is an easy, free way to prevent low back pain, at least for a while, according to a new randomized clinical trial. People in the study who walked regularly after having at least one episode of low back pain were pain free nearly twice as long as those who did not. \u201cThe intervention group had fewer occurrences of activity-limiting pain compared to the control group, and a longer average period before they had a recurrence, with a median of 208 days compared to 112 days,\u201d said senior author Mark Hancock, a professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University in Sydney. \u201cWalking is a low-cost, widely accessible and simple exercise that almost anyone can engage in, regardless of geographic location, age or socio-economic status,\u201d Hancock said in a statement. Walking for at least 30 minutes The study, published Wednesday in The Lancet journal, followed 701 Australian adults, mostly women in their 50s, who had recently recovered from an episode of low back pain that derailed their ability to perform daily activities. Each person was randomly assigned to a control group with no intervention or an individualized walking and educational program. Those in the intervention group were asked to build up to 30 minutes of walking five times a week over a six-month period at speeds adjusted for age, physical capacity and individual preferences. Jogging was also allowed. \u201cAfter three months, most of the people who took part were walking three to five days a week for an average of 130 minutes in total,\u201d Hancock told CNN via email. Participants were asked to wear pedometers to track their daily steps and keep a walking diary. At three months into the program, they also wore an accelerometer that objectively measured daily step count and the amount of brisk walking or other physical activity. The program also provided six physiotherapist-guided education sessions over six months, a more cost-effective model than typical treatment, Hancock said. \u201cWe included 3 standard sessions with a physiotherapist and 3 brief phone catch ups,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn the few previous studies of prevention exercise programs for back pain the intervention included approximately 20 group classes. \u201cWe also discussed simple strategies to reduce the risk of a recurrence of low back pain and instructions on how to self-manage any minor recurrences. The education was embedded in the same sessions as the walking prescription.\u201d Cost-effective intervention In addition to providing participants with longer pain-free periods, the walking program reduced the amount of time taken off work and medical visits by half, said lead study author\u00a0Natasha Pocovi, a postdoctoral fellow at Macquarie. \u201cThe exercise-based interventions to prevent back pain that have been explored previously are typically group-based and need close clinical supervision and expensive equipment, so they are much less accessible to the majority of patients,\u201d Pocovi said in a statement. \u201cOur study has shown that this effective and accessible means of exercise has the potential to be successfully implemented at a much larger scale than other forms of exercise.\u201d Due to the structure of the study, it was not possible to determine how much of the benefit was due to walking or the educational program provided by physiotherapists, Hancock said. \u201cWe believe it is likely the two components complement each other, with education helping to overcome avoidance and fear of movement, while the health coaching and walking program resulted in behavior change,\u201d he said. However, because the intervention appeared to be behavioral coaching, and not actual physical therapy, the act of walking may indeed have been the key reason for improvement, said A. Lynn Millar, a retired physical therapist\u00a0and former professor at Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was not involved in the study. \u201cThis is important, as many studies have shown that pain response is partially a behavioral response,\u201d Millar said in an email. \u201cThe coaching was limited in duration, thus they can suggest that the primary intervention of walking was the major contributor to the long term response.\u201d What walking does for the body What is it about walking that is so helpful for lower back pain? For one, exercise is good for every part of the body. \u201cFirst, the person is sitting less, and sitting is not the best posture for the back,\u201d Millar said. \u201cSecond, walking will improve general circulation,\u00a0and will improve blood circulation to the\u00a0muscles of the back that\u00a0are\u00a0actively supporting the individual during the motion. Movement of a joint also helps circulate the\u00a0joint fluids,\u00a0thus the\u00a0joints of the\u00a0spine may be benefiting from the motion.\u201d Walking improves metabolism and the amount of calories burned, experts say. Lower weight can ease the load on the back and legs, ensuring better spinal health. Taking a brisk stroll also improves the strength of core muscles around the spine and in the legs, all of which can improve posture and provide better support to the spine. Walking also increases muscle endurance, assuring muscles are less susceptible to fatigue and injury. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking increase bone density, protecting against injury while stimulating the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good hormones that reduce pain and stress. When starting a walking program, good shoes and arch supports are necessary,\u00a0and potential problems may be offset by exercise programs such as resistance training and stretching, Millar said. \u201cI also think it is important to have varied paces and distances throughout the week. Some problems are caused by progressing too rapidly, and not paying attention to initial\u00a0aches,\u201d she said. \u201cI also used to see people that were walking in shoes that did not have good support, or they had become so worn, the support was gone,\u201d she added. If your \u201cback goes out\u201d during walking, activity modification such as cycling or swimming may be necessary, Millar said.\u00a0 Taking a day or two off from walking and doing some back exercises and stretching can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/low-back-pain-walking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_lilly-azheimers-donanemab-fda", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Donanemab, made by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly, works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Lilly said it will be sold under the name Kisunla and would cost $695 per vial before insurance, what would amount to $12,522 for a six-month course or about $32,000 for a year, depending on when the patient would complete their treatment. Donanemab is not a cure, but clinical trials showed that it slowed the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s, allowing people to live independent lives for longer and safely participate in everyday activities. Lilly told\u00a0a committee of FDA advisers in June that\u00a0late-stage clinical research data\u00a0showed \u201chighly meaningful results\u201d for people who took donanemab, with about 35% lower risk of progression of the disease over a year and a half compared with those who got a placebo. The FDA advisers\u00a0voted\u00a0that the treatment appeared safe and effective. Although rare, there were some serious adverse events during the drug trial, Lilly told the committee, occurring in only 2% of patients. The participants who took donanemab had a slightly higher mortality rate: 2%, compared with 1.7% in the placebo arm of the trial. Three people died while taking the drug after developing ARIA, micro-hemorrhages known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Because most of the ARIA\u00a0incidents came in the first six weeks of the trial, Lilly told the FDA advisers that it added another MRI exam to the trial before giving second doses in order to detect people with asymptomatic ARIA. If it was detected, providers would pause treatment so it could resolve and not become more serious or symptomatic. Kisunla is not the first monoclonal antibody treatment approved to treat early Alzheimer\u2019s. Eisai and Biogen\u2019s\u00a0lecanemab, sold as Leqembi, is already being used. Another drug by Biogen, aducanumab, sold as Aduhelm, in 2021 became the first such therapy to get accelerated FDA approval, but\u00a0the company said\u00a0it will stop making it by the\u00a0end of this year\u00a0as it shifts resources to its other Alzheimer\u2019s drug. In trials of Leqembi, the drug that\u2019s already on the market, some participants also had ARIA, but it was at a lower rate than seen in the donanemab trial. Leqembi has also\u00a0been tied\u00a0to patient deaths. Kisunla was approved with instructions that prescribers can consider stopping the patient\u2019s treatment if they see improvement based on brain scans. The potential to complete the treatment after a limited course of therapy, Lilly said, could lower out-of-pocket costs. Kisunla otherwise costs more than Leqembi, which runs about $26,500 per year. Lilly said Tuesday that because the medicines work best in the early symptomatic stage of the disease, it\u2019s working with others to improve early detection and diagnosis. \u201cEach year, more and more people are at risk for this disease, and we are determined to make life better for them,\u201d said Anne White, executive vice president and president of Lilly Neuroscience. One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia,\u00a0according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, killing more people than prostate and breast cancer combined. Successful treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s can\u2019t come fast enough,\u00a0advocates for patients say, and could be a big help to a growing number of people who are predicted to develop the disease. The number of people projected to have Alzheimer\u2019s is predicted to grow to nearly 14 million by 2060,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0As of 2023,\u00a0about 6.7 million Americans 65 and older  live with Alzheimer\u2019s. The disease doesn\u2019t just affect patients. More than 11 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias in 2022 alone,\u00a0research\u00a0shows,\u00a0while there has been an\u00a0ongoing shortage of paid workers and medical professionals. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association said Tuesday that it was celebrating the announcement of the approval of the treatment. \u201cThis is real progress. Today\u2019s approval allows people more options and greater opportunity to have more time,\u201d Dr. Joanne Pike, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said in a news release. \u201cHaving multiple treatment options is the kind of advancement we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2014 all of us who have been touched, even blindsided, by this difficult and devastating disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/lilly-azheimers-donanemab-fda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn", "text": "Do you yearn for long days and short nights? Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers. The summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It\u2019s the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It\u2019s also the first official day of summer. Our ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion.\u00a0Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge). Pagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe. The mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility \u2013 both the plant and human variety \u2013 in destinations worldwide. The science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia. Summer solstice science Is it summer solstice all over the world? No. It\u2019s only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world\u2019s population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there. When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on\u00a0June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that\u2019s 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool. Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador\u2019s capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight. But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn\u2019t get that dark.\u00a0 The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They\u2019ll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order. Why don\u2019t we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night\u00a0back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That\u2019s because the Earth is aligned on an\u00a0axis, an imaginary pole\u00a0going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts \u2013 at\u00a0an angle of 23.5 degrees. \u201cAs Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun\u2019s direct rays,\u201d explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that\u2019s the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox. Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it\u2019s not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US. \u201cOn average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\u201d says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward. \u201cTemperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night \u2013 so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\u201d says Ward. \u201cThe only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\u201d\u00a0because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August. The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe. How to celebrate summer solstice What does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically. The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at\u00a0summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times. The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise. What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day. In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night \u2013 a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires. In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations\u2019 International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_arfid-eating-disorder-wellness", "text": "When Hannah was 7 years old, she told her parents she didn\u2019t want to be afraid of food anymore. She had stopped wanting to go to Girl Scouts, birthday parties, restaurants, family celebrations and even the dinner table. Food was everywhere, and it gave her a lot of anxiety, said her mom, Michelle, who is not sharing their last name for Hannah\u2019s safety. Michelle first saw it when she tried to switch baby Hannah from formula to milk and solids\u2014 but Hannah refused. Often, she would pucker her lips shut or spit out the food she was given. As she got older, Hannah had a list of about five foods she would eat, and they were specific. Like the green sour cream and onion Pringles, but only the small packs, not the big container, Michelle said. Now 8 years old, Hannah is being treated for Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, or ARFID. Unlike eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia nervosa, this diagnosis isn\u2019t concerned with body shape or size, said Kate Dansie, clinical director of the Eating Disorder Center in Rockville, Maryland. Instead, people with ARFID are very limited in the foods they feel safe and comfortable eating, Dansie said. Unlike just being \u201cpicky,\u201d this disorder can be debilitating and cause long-term health problems. The diagnosis is new and was only added to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-5, in 2013. (The DSM is the handbook health care professionals use as the authoritative guide in diagnosing mental disorders.) While an estimated 9% of the US population will have an eating disorder at some point, studies suggest that somewhere between 0.5% and 5% of the population has ARFID, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. \u201cI would call this the silent eating disorder because it\u2019s very prevalent, but it\u2019s the least studied, and it\u2019s the least talked about, and it\u2019s the least funded at a federal research level,\u201d said Dr. Stuart Murray, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California and director of the Translational Research in Eating Disorders Laboratory. Here is what experts want you to know about ARFID. What is ARFID? Rather than restricting their calories or nutritional content, people with ARFID often limit their food by sensory or textural preferences, Murray said. \u201cThis is where a person will usually restrict the variety and volume of food because they have incredibly debilitating beliefs about the composition of the food,\u201d he added. \u201cExamples can be not eating any foods that are a certain texture, a certain smell, a certain flavor, even a certain brand of a food.\u201d In some cases, people with ARFID have had a traumatic experience with food, like choking, which induces a greater vigilance with eating, Murray said. Other times, people with this condition seem to have a low drive to eat and high anxiety around food, he said. A rigid or fearful of change personality type may also contribute to ARFID symptoms, Murray said. Is it like picky eating? Many kids are picky and try to get out of eating some vegetables or other food, but that is not the same as ARFID, Dansie said. One way to spot the difference is the level of impairment and anxiety that comes with facing a new food, Murray said. \u201cA picky eater might be able to eat around a certain food on their plate, or they might be able to have a little bit of it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody with ARFID might not be able to eat anything on the plate if a food that\u2019s deemed to be unacceptable is on the plate.\u201d And it isn\u2019t just a handful of foods that people with ARFID won\u2019t eat, Dansie said. Often, people with this condition will have a list of as few as five or 10 foods that they feel comfortable eating, she added. A greater vigilance around tasting may also come with ARFID, and many people with the condition can tell small differences, like if the brand of pasta sauce has been changed, Murray added. \u201cThat in itself can be quite debilitating and crippling for parents,\u201d he said. A good relationship with food is fundamental The condition often starts in childhood, but ARFID can impact people of all ages, Murray said. And people can experience consequences throughout their life. \u201cKids can really fall off their growth curve quite quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can become metabolically, nutritively imbalanced very quickly, so the medical effects are quite profound.\u201d Hannah experienced this before she began working with an ARFID specialist. She had been keeping pace with the expected growth and weight gain for her age. But with not enough food in her system, her growth stopped, Michelle said. In some cases, the restriction around eating can lead to weight loss or hospitalization, Murray said. \u201cWith any kind of psychological or psychiatric issue, the (indicator of a problem) is always when it\u2019s affecting the child and the family,\u201d Dansie said. \u201cWhen the impact is significant, that that\u2019s when we get worried.\u201d There can be social impacts as well. \u201cThis can be very isolating for people,\u201d Murray said. \u201cKids become super anxious about going to parties or any type of social event where they think they might not know what the food is going to be.\u201d Often, issues around food and eating impact many areas of a person\u2019s life, Dansie said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that if you can look at a person\u2019s relationship with food, you can look at their relationship with everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so fundamental to well-being to have a good relationship with food.\u201d ARFID isn\u2019t something kids just grow out of, so it is important to approach it with as much sympathy and compassion as possible, he added. What you can do Although there is much researchers still need to learn about ARFID, there are resources available, Murray said. \u201cThe first thing we should know is early intervention is better because the list of avoided foods can grow exponentially,\u201d he said. There isn\u2019t much data on if medication is helpful, but therapy \u2013 including cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT \u2013 has helped many people. Therapy for ARFID \u201cusually involves a guided exposure to foods so that one can relearn associations with those foods and ultimately not avoid them,\u201d Murray said. At home, there are things families can do to better support a child with ARFID, like prioritizing making sure the child gets enough calories before focusing on expanding variety, said Dr. Nicole Stettler, clinical executive director of Eating Disorder Recovery Services at Rogers Behavioral Health. You can also give your child tools like timers or visual reminders to eat, and try \u201cfood chaining,\u201d which is a strategy that combines new foods with ones they already know they like, she said. As family and caretakers of someone with ARFID, it is important to remember that they aren\u2019t trying to be difficult \u2013 although it can be frustrating to feel like the stars have to align for a mealtime to go smoothly, Murray added. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really frustrating, because most of the time the stars don\u2019t align, and I don\u2019t know the formula to get him or her to eat,\u201d he said. \u00a0However, it is \u201creally damaging for any child with any psychiatric disorder if they feel punished because of it, so it\u2019s really important to not punish and adopt a supportive stance among parents.\u201d Five months into her treatment, Hannah pushing herself to try new things often and to take three bites to give it a full chance, Michelle said. Her confidence has grown, she is getting more curious, and her list of \u201csafe foods\u201d has increased by 11, she said. \u201cOur goal is to get her to a good place \u2026 so that as she gets older, she\u2019ll have the tools that she needs,\u201d Michelle said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/arfid-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_birth-control-drops-after-abortion-bans", "text": "Women in states with the most restrictive abortion laws have also become less likely to access prescription birth control, a new study suggests. In a dozen states that have enacted near-total abortion bans, monthly prescription rates for birth control pills and emergency contraceptives were significantly lower in the second half of 2023 than they were before the US Supreme Court Dobbs decision that revoked the federal right to abortion, according to the study published Wednesday in the JAMA Network Open medical journal. The researchers point to the closures of some family planning clinics and broad public confusion about what options remain legal in the wake of the June 2022 Dobbs decision as key factors contributing to this trend. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to recognize that these issues all fall under the scope of reproductive health care,\u201d said Dr. Michael Belmonte, an Ob-Gyn and fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists focused on complex family planning. He was not involved in the new research. \u201cWhen something touches on abortion care, that will ultimately have ripple effects for miscarriage care, for contraception and emergency contraception, and, quite frankly, access to general medical health care for many women across the United States.\u201d For the new study, researchers tracked trends in monthly birth control prescription rates from March to November 2021 \u2013 a period before the Dobbs decision leaked \u2013 and after the decision, from July 2022 to October 2023. They compared rates in a group of 12 states that enacted the most restrictive policies to a group of 14 states where abortion policy remained relatively consistent. The use of birth control pills has been trending down in the US overall \u2013 and other research suggests that use of IUDs, a longer-acting form of birth control, has been growing for decades \u2013 but the prescription fill rate fell about 4% more than expected in states with the most restrictive laws post-Dobbs, according to the new research. States with abortion bans saw an even more significant drop in prescriptions for emergency contraception \u2013 including levonorgestrel, such as Plan B, and ulipristal, such as Ella. Both groups of states studied \u2013 those that enacted bans and those where abortion policies stayed more consistent \u2013 had a similar prescription fill rate pre-Dobbs and both and saw an initial spike following the decision.\u00a0But by the second half of 2023, the prescription rate for emergency contraception in the states with bans was less than half of what it was before the Dobbs decision \u2013 dropping from about 20 fills for every 100,000 women of reproductive age each month down to eight fills. In states where abortion policies stayed consistent, the rate actually ticked up in the same timeframe \u2013 from 20 to 21 fills. \u201cThese findings suggest that efforts to protect and improve access to oral contraceptives are needed, especially for emergency contraceptives in states where abortion is most strongly restricted,\u201d the study authors wrote. Emergency contraception has become enmeshed in the abortion debate, and survey data suggests that there was widespread public confusion around the legality of emergency contraception months after the Dobbs decision and how it differed from medication abortion. Nearly a third of adults were \u201cunsure\u201d if emergency contraceptive pills were legal in their state, according to a KFF survey from January 2023. The confusion was even greater in states with abortion bans, where half of women either incorrectly thought that it was illegal or were unsure. \u201cThis drives home the importance for proper and accurate patient education, consumer education, and the need to combat disinformation and misinformation about the conflation and confusion between (emergency contraception and abortion,\u201d said Karen Diep, a women\u2019s health policy analyst with KFF who was not involved in the new research. In December 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration adjusted the Plan B label to explicitly state that it \u201cdoes not terminate pregnancy.\u201d All while reproductive health care deserts are getting worse. About 1 in 9 women of reproductive age in the US \u2013 and closer to 1 in 5 Black and Hispanic women \u2013 rely on family planning clinics to get contraception, according to a KFF analysis from 2022. But dozens of clinics closed post-Dobbs \u2013 and the new study found that declines in emergency contraception prescriptions were greatest in states that saw more widespread closures of family planning clinics. And the landscape continues to change rapidly, adding to the confusion and challenges around access. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted to block a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to contraception nationwide. But the Biden administration has \u201credoubled\u201d commitments to protect access to reproductive health care, including support for Title X family planning clinics and work to ensure birth control remains accessible under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIn the two years since\u00a0Dobbs, we have witnessed the devastating impacts. Many women, especially those in states with stringent abortion\u00a0restrictions, have found themselves navigating care deserts, forced to travel great distances to\u00a0receive essential services. These barriers disproportionately affect marginalized communities,\u00a0exacerbating existing health disparities,\u201d US Department of Health and Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration stands firm in its commitment to defending reproductive rights. We believe that no woman should have fewer rights than her mother and that women must have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies without fear or interference from politicians,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/birth-control-drops-after-abortion-bans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_politics_chevron-ruling-explained-supreme-court-meaning", "text": "A major Supreme Court ruling Friday that shifted power from the executive branch to the judiciary stands to transform how the federal government works. By overturning a 1984 precedent, the court\u2019s conservative majority has made countless regulations vulnerable to legal challenge. The types of executive branch moves that the ruling jeopardizes include a plan to put Wi-Fi on school buses, a new ban on noncompete clauses, health care coverage rules being implemented through Obamacare, and the latest plan to forgive student loan debt. The Supreme Court ruling could boost efforts by conservatives who have taken aim at the Biden Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s rules limiting planet-warming pollution from vehicles, oil and gas wells and pipelines, and power plants. \u201cThere is no substantive area that this doctrine does not touch,\u201d said Kent Barnett, a University of Georgia School of Law professor who specializes in administrative law. The so-called Chevron doctrine \u2014 named after the case, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council \u2014 told courts to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute in circumstances in which the law in question is vaguely written. The precedent is deeply entrenched in administrative law, with Republican and Democratic administrations alike using it to shield regulatory action from legal attack. \u201cEssentially, anytime where an agency has a dispute with either an individual or some other entity \u2014 sometimes even the federal government versus the state government \u2014 Chevron deference could come up,\u201d said Thomas Berry, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion overruling the precedent, writing for an ideologically split 6-3 court that \u201cCourts must exercise their independent judgement in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority.\u201d The Roberts court has been chipping away at the precedent over the years. But in the case before the justices this term \u2014 two lawsuits challenging regulations requiring that fishermen pay environmental monitors they are required to carry on their boats \u2014 the high court dealt the final blow. The ruling has injected legal uncertainty into regulations of all types, including those on technology, labor, the environment and health care. There are so many highly complex scientific policy decisions that it would be nearly impossible for Congress to draft legislation with enough detail to account for every regulatory scenario,\u00a0legal scholars argue. Roberts said the new opinion should not be used to upend previous cases upholding regulations absent a \u201cspecial justification.\u201d But Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissent joined by the court\u2019s two other liberals,\u00a0questioned whether that threshold would really constrain the ruling\u2019s reach, given the possibility of new lawsuits against regulations that went unchallenged because of the protections of Chevron, as well as the ability of lower courts to find a \u201cspecial justification\u201d in almost any circumstance. For now, opponents of regulations are constrained by a six-year statute of limitation for challenging executive branch actions under the relevant law. But the Supreme Court has yet to decide a case heard this term that might gut that limitation.\u00a0That decision is expected Monday. Here is a partial look at what could be affected by the new ruling: Consumer safeguards Agencies charged with consumer protection, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, often face opposition\u00a0from\u00a0financial service firms and other private-sector companies, which may claim that new rules constrain their ability to compete or cost them too much. Think of issues like what shows up on your credit report, what fees banks and other consumer service providers can charge, how lenders make credit decisions, and rules governing the protection of consumers from scams and fraud. Lawsuits that block those regulations could be costly for consumers, advocates say. Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, pointed to a recent ruling in Texas in which a federal court paused CFPB\u2019s new rule limiting credit card late fees. \u201cEvery day that rule remains stayed, consumers pay $27 million in late fees that they otherwise would not have had to pay if the rule were in place,\u201d Rust said. Giving power to the judicial branch to interpret how agencies can apply consumer laws when there are statutory ambiguities will hurt consumers and \u201crubber-stamp\u201d the political aims of \u201cactivist judges,\u201d Rust said, adding that it will also limit the ability of consumer advocates to weigh in on regulatory policy. \u201cI can\u2019t get a meeting with the Supreme Court, but I can get a meeting with the CFPB,\u201d Rust said, referring to public comments solicited by the agency while regulations are crafted. \u201cI don\u2019t think many in the public are up to writing an amicus brief.\u201d Proposed employer rules and employee rights may be more constrained Overtime pay, benefits, workplace retirement plans, the minimum wage, independent contractors and employee rights to unionize are just some of the critical workplace issues for which guardrails set by agencies charged with enforcing workplace laws\u00a0may be contested more vociferously than they already are now. The decision may immediately affect a hot-button rule issued this year by the Federal Trade Commission banning noncompete clauses in employer contracts, a regulation the agency says could benefit 1 in 5 US workers but is being challenged by business groups. \u201cThe noncompete case is among the most vulnerable, along with many Securities and Exchange Commission cases,\u201d said Andrew Schwartzman, senior counselor at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society. When it comes to regulatory agencies like the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, they will no longer be given an automatic advantage when a case is brought challenging how they chose to interpret a law. \u201cWhat this decision changes is that the agency no longer gets a boost when it comes into court. If a case was like a race, the agency often started a few legs ahead. Today it starts at the same line as the challenger,\u201d said Alexander MacDonald, a partner and member of the Workplace Policy Institute at Littler, a law firm representing employers. \u201cNothing about today\u2019s decision means the agency loses. It just means the challenger has an equal opportunity to put forth its interpretation of the law,\u201d MacDonald added. When it comes to supporting and upholding worker rights and protections, the ruling on its face may not signal that courts would necessarily disadvantage federal agencies, said Sharon Block, a Harvard Law School professor and executive director of its Center for Labor and a Just Economy. But practically speaking, if a court or particular judge is hostile to a given issue, that may tip the scales against them. \u201cThe ruling says courts may be informed by the agency\u2019s interpretation. That also means they may not. It\u2019s up to them,\u201d Block said. \u201cThe least democratic part of the government will determine what kind of protections the American people have \u2026 that Congress has entrusted to agencies.\u201d With this ruling, she said, the Supreme Court, has sent \u201can engraved invitation to aggressive challenges to anything these agencies do.\u201d Potential weakening of patient and consumer health care protections Friday\u2019s ruling\u00a0could open the door to legal challenges to the decisions made by the government\u2019s public health agencies, with the American Cancer Society and other health associations warning\u00a0in a friend-of-the-court brief\u00a0that the reversal of Chevron could unleash a \u201clitigation tsunami,\u201d even on long-settled policy. The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Health and Human Services (through its Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) rely heavily on the flexibility that the Chevron deference provides to manage a highly detailed and sometimes unavoidably complex regulatory process. On Medicaid alone, the law is what one federal judge\u00a0famously described as\u00a0\u201calmost unintelligible to the uninitiated.\u201d The laws created to allow these health agencies the authority to regulate the country\u2019s complex health sector were written in a purposely ambiguous way,\u00a0legal scholars say. Ambiguity was necessary to give the agencies the flexibility to use their technical and scientific expertise to make the countless real-world policy decisions that make up the regulatory foundation of programs that directly affect the health of nearly every American. The multitude of Health and Human Services Department regulations that govern the Affordable Care Act exchanges, Medicaid, Medicare, insurance coverage and more could now be more easily challenged in court. Several regulations \u2014 including those involving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal premium tax credits, annual out-of-pocket limits, the adequacy of in-network doctor options and preventive health services at no cost to patients \u2014 could be subject to litigation by those seeking to challenge the agency\u2019s interpretations of the congressional statutes, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research and polling organization. In addition, challengers could have more chances of success in lawsuits against HHS regulations issued by the Biden administration that ban health care providers and insurers from discriminating based on gender identity and sexual orientation and that interpret the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, as prohibiting the disclosure of information on reproductive health care, including abortions, said Andrew Twinamatsiko, a director at the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. \u201cIt really moves away from the understanding that we have a robust scientific community that protects our health,\u201d Twinamatsiko said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have everybody coming in and second-guessing what these agencies are doing, and thereby creating this chaos and also a lack of trust in the system.\u201d Other programs that could be in jeopardy include the FDA\u2019s\u00a0Fast\u00a0Track\u00a0approval process, with which the agency has sole discretion over which drugs or devices qualify for expedited approval. Some scholars say\u00a0the\u00a0FDA\u00a0approval process as a whole could also be undermined by Chevron\u2019s reversal. Drugs and devices are approved by the FDA based on evidence that companies submit from what the law calls\u00a0\u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d investigations. However, the definition of such an investigation is left up to FDA interpretation. Challenges to tech regulations, such as new net neutrality rules The end of Chevron could complicate the US government\u2019s efforts to regulate data brokers, social media platforms, generative artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency and more as agencies scramble to interpret their congressional mandates to fit those new challenges. Shifting regulatory power from agencies to the courts gives well-resourced companies with armies of lawyers even more power to fend off regulations they view as harmful. \u201cCongress rarely gets anything done on tech, so agencies do most of the regulatory work,\u201d said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the market research firm TD Cowen. \u201cBut if the court reduces their rulemaking power, it would be particularly helpful in protecting the major tech platforms against new regulations that currently appear likely if Biden is reelected.\u201d In the telecom sector, Chevron has been a major reason the Federal Communications Commission is recognized as having the power to regulate \u2014 and deregulate \u2014 internet service providers (ISPs). Using that authority, the agency voted in April to restore net neutrality rules for ISPs, prohibiting them from blocking or slowing down websites, a move that instantly triggered industry lawsuits. Major questions doctrine is the next big regulatory legal fight In some ways, the court\u2019s decision overturning Chevron simply makes official what has already been the reality in practice, other legal experts say. \u201cFor quite some time, Chevron has been a dead letter for several reasons,\u201d said David Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor and former director of the FTC\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cBy and large, Chevron is no longer cited, let alone relied on, in lower courts.\u201d Faced with a hostile Supreme Court,\u00a0the EPA has relied on Chevron less and less in recent years. Still, the end of the precedent takes another tool out of the agency\u2019s legal toolbox. For instance, the Supreme Court in 2014 cited Chevron to uphold a version of the EPA\u2019s so-called good-neighbor rule, which addresses the problem of air pollution that travels across state lines. The Supreme Court put the latest iteration of the regulation on hold last week after a lower court \u2014 in a decision that did not cite Chevron \u2014 said the new pollution rules could be implemented. Overturning Chevron could also theoretically hamstring a future Republican administration trying to implement its own rules. Chevron\u2019s reversal \u201cdoesn\u2019t eliminate agency authority; it shifts the burden of how you interpret a statute,\u201d said Ann Carlson, the former acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. In her view, the major questions doctrine \u2014 which says agencies can\u2019t regulate things of \u201cmajor\u201d economic or political significance if Congress hasn\u2019t given them explicit authority to do so \u2014 is what to watch. Major questions, if used often and effectively to attack the EPA and other agencies, could render them useless because it argues they cannot operate without Congress passing laws explicitly giving them approval to do things, Carlson and other environmental law experts said. Given extreme political polarization, things often move at a glacial pace in Congress. Whether the Supreme Court is overturning Chevron or reviving major questions, David Doniger, a senior federal strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN,\u00a0\u201ctheir goal is enfeebling the federal government.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/chevron-ruling-explained-supreme-court-meaning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_weight-gain-antidepressants-wellness", "text": "Antidepressants can be lifesavers for many struggling with so many mental health diagnoses \u2014 anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet taking these mood-altering substances can lead to an unpleasant side effect for some \u2014 weight gain. While many people never add extra weight, doctors say concerns over additional pounds are a key reason people may be hesitant to start taking an antidepressant for their mental health. Weight gain is also a reason why some stop their medications despite feeling less depressed or anxious while using them. Now, a new study sheds light on just how much weight gain might occur \u2014 on average \u2014 while taking eight of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. One of the most widely prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, also known by brand names Zoloft and Lustral, was associated with an average gain of nearly 0.5 pounds (0.2 kilograms) at six months. That rose to 3.2 pounds (1.46 kilograms) at 24 months, according to the study. Using that as a comparison, researchers found people taking escitalopram, known by the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex, had an average 15% increased risk over sertraline of gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight at six months. The risk was 14% for paroxetine, sold under the names Paxil, Aropax, Pexeva, Seroxat, Sereupin and Brisdelle, the study found. Duloxetine, sold by the brand names Cymbalta, Loxentia and Yentreve, was associated with a 10% increased risk of a patient gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight compared to sertraline, the study said. A weight gain of 5% or more over baseline is considered clinically significant for health, said lead study author Joshua Petimar, an assistant professor of population medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The typical adult gains an average of 1 to 2 pounds per year, which over time, can contribute to obesity. This weight gain can be driven by physical inactivity, stress, poor sleep and poor food choices, such as eating too many ultraprocessed foods, as well as medications, experts say. Weight gain by pounds The study, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, used electronic health record prescription and body mass to compare weight gain among more than 183,000 people. Researchers looked at weight at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months for individuals between the ages of 18 and 80 who were starting an antidepressant for the first time. When analyzing the data by pounds and kilograms of weight gained, people on escitalopram and paroxetine added an average of 1.4 pounds (0.63 kilograms) by six months. By 24 months, weight had risen by 3.6 pounds (1.63 kilograms) for escitalopram and nearly 3 pounds (1.33 kilograms) for paroxetine. Duloxetine was associated with an average gain of 1.2 pounds (0.55 kilograms) at six months and 1.7 pounds (0.78 kilograms) at 24 months. \u201cIn our study, the average weight at baseline was 84 kg, or about 185 lb,\u201d Petimar said in an email. \u201cThis means that in our study, a 5% increase in weight translated on average to a weight gain of 4.2 kg, or about 9 lb.\u201d However, the study found no significantly higher or lower risk for citalopram, sold as Celexa; fluoxetine, sold as Prozac; or venlafaxine, sold as Effexor, Effexor XR, Vensir, Vencarm, Venlalix and Venlablue, when compared to sertraline. \u201cWe need to remember these are average values; many people won\u2019t gain any weight, while others could gain considerably more,\u201d said Dr. Roy Perlis, associate chief of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who conducted a similar study in 2014. He was not involved with the new research. \u201cStill, having average values to work with \u2014 and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies \u2014 at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,\u201d Perlis said in an email. Not all patients perceive weight gain negatively, although it is more common for patients to want to avoid weight gain than to seek it when taking an antidepressant, Petimar said. For example, mirtazapine is an antidepressant that is sometimes used in the treatment of eating disorders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t examine mirtazapine in our study because it\u2019s not considered a common front-line medication for new users of antidepressants,\u201d he said. Weight loss occurred with one drug One antidepressant contributed to a small amount of weight loss at six months, the study found. \u201cBupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) on average had a 15% lower risk of gaining a clinically meaningful amount of weight compared to sertraline,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cOur study didn\u2019t explore reasons why bupropion was associated with less weight gain than other antidepressants, but other studies have similarly concluded that it is associated with less weight gain than other common antidepressants,\u201d he added. When analyzed by pounds or kilograms lost, people who took bupropion dropped almost one quarter of a pound (0.01 kilograms) at six months, before gaining 1.2 pounds (0.56\u00a0kilograms) at 24 months, according to the research. Why do antidepressants contribute to weight gain? Science doesn\u2019t yet know, Perlis said. \u201cRemarkably, we don\u2019t know the precise mechanism by which antidepressants contribute to weight changes. Worse, we really don\u2019t know much about who is most\u00a0likely to gain or lose weight, so we can\u2019t make good predictions in advance,\u201d he said. One caution, Perlis said, is that some people lose weight when depressed and lose their appetite. \u201cSome of what we\u2019re seeing may be people regaining weight they\u2019d lost as their depression or anxiety improves.\u201d The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them, experts say. \u201cPatients who are concerned about weight gain should have an open and honest conversation with their clinician about their concerns,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cThere are many clinical factors that determine which medication is right for a given patient,\u201d Petimar said. \u201cThese include the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, their medical history, any other drugs that they are already taking, and possible side effects that the patient is concerned about.\u201d Clinicians have to weigh all of these factors when they decide which is the best course of treatment, he added, while patients can strive to avoid weight gain by following healthy eating habits and exercising regularly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/weight-gain-antidepressants-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_opinions_bird-flu-eggs-food-health-safety-farms-ruhlman", "text": "I\u2019m writing from an organic farm and ecotourism site in Tuscany called\u00a0Spannocchia. I\u2019ve just made myself a couple of\u00a0mollet eggs\u00a0\u2014 whites cooked, yolks runny. Delicious \u2014 but also perhaps slightly worrying, given the emerging reports of\u00a0bird flu on poultry and dairy farms. Should I be concerned? And should you be as well, as you prepare your favorite meals at home? There have been numerous reported cases of wild birds and marine animals said to be carrying this virus and its variants, as well as the documented\u00a0spread to mammals\u00a0beyond cows, such as\u00a0cats, dogs\u00a0and mice. Should any of that determine the temperature at which I cook my eggs? And just as importantly, what should I tell home cooks who seek my advice on the matter? This avian flu virus is clearly something to take seriously as it spreads rapidly through dairy farms across the United States affecting\u00a0more than 90 herds in 12 states since March. It\u2019s clear that drinking\u00a0raw or unpasteurized milk is now high-risk. \u201cOur national dairy industry is clearly fighting a major epidemic of H5N1 avian flu,\u201d Donald G. McNeil Jr., a journalist who has covered epidemics for decades,\u00a0wrote. Even though I know it may contain harmful bacteria, I\u2019ve had raw milk. It\u2019s delicious \u2014 and at the time I drank it, it seemed worth the risk. But viruses are not bacteria. They are a different kind of microorganism, capable of mutating. Since we know that this virus is spreading through our dairy farms, it\u2019s clearly foolhardy to drink raw milk. Not just so that you don\u2019t get sick yourself but just as importantly, so that you don\u2019t become a spreader. Fortunately, with avian flu so far, there\u2019s no evidence yet of human-to-human transmission. But again, viruses mutate. There\u2019s no guarantee that transmissions between humans won\u2019t occur in the future. We have substantial evidence that heat inactivates the virus.\u00a0The USDA reports\u00a0that ground beef inoculated with the virus was virus-free when cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and higher. For a burger or steak, that would be medium to well-done, with no pink at the center. Live virus is likewise\u00a0not present in pasteurized milk. So where does all of this leave us in terms of how you should proceed in your kitchen? Most food authorities couch their your-food-is-safe-to-eat opinions with the caveat \u201cas long as it\u2019s properly cooked.\u201d But even with cooked food, there is some risk of becoming ill if an entire dish is not heated to pasteurization temperatures (between 145 degrees and 160 degrees Fahrenheit). Until we learn otherwise, I would say the best guidance for now is that it\u2019s probably safe to continue to prepare your meals as you always have \u2014 runny eggs and all. Most professional chefs I\u2019ve spoken to are comfortable with that guidance. They haven\u2019t changed kitchen protocol in terms of cooking times and temperatures as a result of bird flu. We need to monitor how and where the virus is spreading. For now,\u00a0the CDC risk assessment to humans from bird flu is low. But home cooks should keep an ear to the ground from health authorities for changes in that guidance. Is there a danger that our avian flu could cause chefs and food writers like me to rethink that guidance? Yes, I\u2019m afraid so. The virus has been found in the muscle of infected cattle, it\u2019s alive in raw milk, and it is small enough to pass through the pores of eggshells. As I was writing this piece, I reached out a few chefs and others including McNeil, who is a leading authority on viruses and how they spread to get their views on the potential danger to our food chain posed by bird flu. McNeil told me that he felt US food authorities could have done more \u2014 and done it much sooner \u2014 to sound the alarm to the public about the emergence and spread of bird flu. There are\u00a0plenty of experts\u00a0in the scientific community who agree with him. The government needs to do more to make industrial farms comply with inspections that some have been resistant to. Moreover, he wrote to me by email that \u201cit\u2019s clear that many dairy farmers are resisting letting inspectors onto their property to test either their cows or their workers. I think that\u2019s outrageous. Hidden transmission creates the perfect setting for an epidemic.\u201d Months into this bird flu outbreak, guidance from the government is less clear than we\u2019d like about what we should and shouldn\u2019t consume and how we should prepare the foods we love, and for a lot of people \u2014 including food professionals like me \u2014that\u2019s frustrating. As the H5N1 virus spreads, there might come a moment when food authorities decide we should be taking greater precautions than we did before its emergence. That could mean cooking all burgers medium to well, all eggs till they\u2019re hard and taking steak tartare topped with a raw egg yolk totally off the menu. With no evidence that the virus is in anything we eat raw other than milk, I\u2019ll continue to prepare my eggs so that the yolk is runny, and I\u2019ll keep ordering the beef tartare for dinner at my neighborhood bistro. It\u2019s funny, though. The Italian farm where I\u2019m staying employs numerous international interns. On the morning I began writing this essay, the first words I heard came from one of those interns, outside my window. She called out to her colleague, \u201cOne of the chickens is dead.\u201d Chickens on farms die for all kinds of reasons, but the timing seemed an ominous reminder that we need to be alert and to pay attention. Until we hear something definitive however, I\u2019m trying not to be afraid of my food, and advise you to do the same.\u00a0Bon appetit!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/opinions/bird-flu-eggs-food-health-safety-farms-ruhlman/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_health_parents-kids-screen-time-wellness", "text": "Whether it\u2019s\u00a0lockboxes\u00a0or\u00a0control apps, parents have searched far and wide for ways to reduce their child\u2019s screen time. A new\u00a0study\u00a0suggests that the answer may lie in the parent\u2019s own screen habits. Using a phone in front of your child can have more of an effect than you might think. The study, published this month in\u00a0the journal Pediatric Research, shows that parents\u2019 screen use is associated with increased adolescent screen time \u2013 along with problematic social media, video game and mobile phone use. Problematic use can include addictive behaviors such as withdrawal, building tolerance, relapse and obsessive thoughts, which may disrupt daily functioning, according to the study. The researchers analyzed data from the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, involving over 10,000 families with 12- and 13-year-olds. The data revealed that\u00a072.9% of parents said they use screens around their adolescents. This is a huge predictor of a child\u2019s screen use, according to Dr. Jason Nagata, lead study author and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. When a child sees their parent using a screen, experts say, they are likely to mimic the behavior. Surveyed parents rated their agreement with statements such as \u201cWhen I am with my child, I use a screen-based device\u201d on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Each point increase was associated with a nearly 40-minute rise in their children\u2019s screen time. \u201cEven if parents think their kids are not paying attention, the data shows one of the biggest predictors of preteen screen use is what their parents do with screens in front of them,\u201d Nagata said. Dr. Ken Ginsburg, a professor of pediatrics at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who was not involved in the study, added that parents are role models for their children 24/7. \u201cOur actions can speak so loudly that kids can\u2019t hear the words we are saying. Practicing what we preach makes all the difference,\u201d he said. Using screen time as a reward or consequence might also be counterproductive, increasing usage.\u00a0Preteens, who may be increasingly turning to social media for support and identity exploration, can view these parenting practices as intrusive, leading to rejection of rules, according to the study. \u201cWhen parents are overly controlling, it backfires,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cKids watch what we do and don\u2019t like to be controlled. When kids perceive we set rules to control them, they always go around those rules.\u201d The screen age Children\u2019s average daily screen time more than doubled during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to\u00a0previous research, and some nations are grappling with how to curb the potential negative effects. Regulators in China have\u00a0proposed\u00a0a two-hour daily limit on phone time for minors. In the US, the surgeon general has\u00a0called\u00a0for warning labels on social media apps to mitigate \u201csignificant harms\u201d associated with their use. \u201cScreen use is on the rise for everyone,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cWhile screens in themselves are not inherently bad \u2026 teenagers are particularly vulnerable to excessive use.\u201d Specifically, screen overuse reduces the essential sleep time and quality needed for a kid\u2019s healthy development, according to Nagata and previous research. Beyond role modeling, open communication and creating a media plan are effective strategies for balanced screen use, according to the study and guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Family Media Plan. Dr. Susan Tomopoulos, co-developer of the plan and an associate professor of pediatrics at NYU\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine who was not part of the new study, said the increased pandemic screen times were an impetus for the academy to update its media recommendations. \u201cAfter the pandemic, parents were turning to doctors because they wanted to manage their family\u2019s media habits,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they were overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know where to start.\u201d Setting up healthy media practices begins with a family conversation to customize screen time guidelines and outline screen-free zones around the house, according to the academy. This is especially important in the bedroom and dining room, where screen presence is associated with higher adolescent screen time and problematic social, video game and mobile phone use, the study found. Prioritizing screen-free activities and face-to-face time is crucial for a child\u2019s healthy development, according to Tomopoulos. \u201cIt is so easy for adults, as well as kids, to get caught up in swiping and scrolling. We really want entire families to check their digital habits at home \u2026 and to talk early and often about technology media,\u201d she added. How to have a conversation with your child Initiating a productive discussion on media use starts with conveying to the child, \u201cI set rules because I care,\u201d according to Ginsburg, who is also co-founder and program director of the\u00a0Center for Parent and Teen Communication. \u201cOne of the biggest myths is that teenagers do not care what their parents say. When we set rules, it is important we communicate why,\u201d he said. \u201cThe baseline should be \u2018I care about you, and therefore blank,\u2019 instead of \u2018don\u2019t do blank.\u2019 \u201d The conversation may end with an agreement on certain principles such as establishing a \u201cone screen at a time\u201d rule and limiting screens at mealtime, bedtime and study time, as\u00a0recommended\u00a0by the American Academy of Pediatrics. As the ABCD Study continues to follow participants into adulthood, research into the long-term effects of excessive adolescent screen use is also unfolding. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot more guidance for parents to help their children navigate social media,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cThe goal is to give children the skills to develop healthy screen behaviors for their young adulthood and beyond.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story spelled Dr. Ken Ginsburg\u2019s name incorrectly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/parents-kids-screen-time-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_tiktok-falsehoods-sun-protection-wellness", "text": "As our planet endures what may be the hottest year on record, social media influencers are spawning messages about the sun and sunscreen that are not only false, but dangerous, say experts. \u201cStop wearing sunscreen,\u201d says a TikTok influencer with 1.6 million followers and 36 million likes. \u201cThe more time you spend outside, the less likely you are to get sunburned,\u201d proclaims a shirtless TikTokker with nearly 90,000 followers and over 11 million likes. \u201cThe sun does not cause skin cancer,\u201d insists a TikTok pundit with 76,000 followers in a post that has been bookmarked nearly 4,000 times. \u201cCooling down the skin can help prevent sunburns,\u201d claims another TikTokker with over 4 million likes. \u201cWhen I feel my skin starting to get hot in the sun, I\u2019ll go in the ocean or I\u2019ll go in the pool, and I\u2019ll cool down.\u201d Such assertions fly in the face of decades of scientific research on the dangers of sun exposure and the protective role of sunscreen, experts say. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a \u201cproven human carcinogen,\u201d causing squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, which works closely with industry. Long-wave ultraviolet A rays (UVA) and short-wave ultraviolet B rays (UVB) penetrate the ozone layer\u00a0and can burn, damage and age skin\u00a0even on cloudy days. \u201cExtensive research has shown that UV radiation from the sun is a significant cause of skin cancers such as melanoma. It\u2019s really indisputable at this point,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen Suozzi, a dermatologic surgeon at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cUV radiation has both UVA and UVB, and we know that both of them damage the DNA in skin cells,\u201d she said. \u201cThese mutations accumulate over time and then lead to skin cancer \u2014 which can quickly spread throughout the body \u2014 as well as wrinkles, dark spots and other signs of skin aging.\u201d What should you do? Wearing a hat, sunglasses and protective clothing \u2014 along with sunscreen and staying in the shade during the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \u2014 will help protect the skin from sun damage, experts say. Jumping in the water to cool off the skin, however, does not. \u201cIt\u2019s really the exact opposite,\u201d Suozzi said. \u201cYou\u2019ll just lose the sense of heat, so you\u2019ll get a higher exposure to UV without knowing it, and because the water is reflective, you\u2019ll get a double hit of exposure to your face.\u201d Early sun damage can lead to melanoma years later Historically, younger generations often fail to adequately protect themselves from the sun, experts say. Surveys show that trend continues today among Gen Z young adults. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only 8% of men and 26% of women younger than 30 said they always used sunscreen when outside for more than an hour on a sunny day. \u201cSunlight isn\u2019t toxic, sunscreen is,\u201d according to an X contributor who says he has a doctorate in tanning without sunscreen. While some products do contain worrisome chemicals, many do not, and today\u2019s broad spectrum sunscreens do a much better job at protecting the skin from UVA and UVB rays, said David Andrews, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a consumer organization which advocates for sunscreen safety. \u201cMineral-based sunscreens are not absorbed into the skin and are better for the environment,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThere are many good, safe choices on the market that don\u2019t leave a white cast on the skin.\u201d Unless accelerated by a tanning bed, skin damage can take years, if not decades to develop, experts say, leaving today\u2019s unwary youth at risk for early skin aging and lethal skin cancers such as melanoma. \u201cMelanoma is the deadliest cancer known to man,\u201d said Dr. Kelly Olino, clinical director of the Smilow Melanoma Program at the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cMelanoma is the only type of cancer where, if it is two-millimeters in size, we say \u2018Goodness, this is serious,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf you had a two-millimeter colon cancer, we\u2019d be having a parade saying, \u2018Wow, we got this one really, really early.\u2019\u201d Sun tanning versus sunburns While getting a sunburn appears to be a no-no for many of these social media gurus, they do encourage their followers to get a tan. The reasoning goes like this: As UV exposure is increased, a pigment in the skin called melanin darkens. Melanin has protective properties against UV radiation; therefore tanning should be encouraged. \u201cSlow exposure to the sun allows you to build melanin and protect skin the natural way,\u201d says a Tiktokker who has gathered over 3 million likes. \u201cAs long as\u00a0you have a good tan, you don\u2019t need sunscreen. It\u2019s much better to just quietly, slowly build up a tan during the spring,\u201d said a computer scientist interviewed on X, formerly known as Twitter. That\u2019s just so wrong, according to experts. \u201cTanning is the body\u2019s response to being damaged, so tanned skin is already damaged skin, and all you\u2019re doing is creating more and more damage,\u201d Olino said. \u201cIn the best case scenario with your \u2018base tan\u2019 or sun damaged skin, the melanin that\u2019s produced gives you an SPF of 2 to 4 or so, and we would never tell people that anything less than 30 SPF would be protective from additional sun damage,\u201d she said. In fact, a sunburn is much more than a red flag for a little sun damage. It\u2019s a sign of actual cell death, Suozzi explained. \u201cWe see this under the microscope,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call them sunburnt cells, and you can see them actually dying. And when they die, the body creates inflammation, and that\u2019s what causes the redness. It\u2019s a very inflammatory process.\u201d When it comes to vitamin D, 15 minutes of sun on the skin each day is all that is needed, said Andrews, and the skin does not need to be free of sunscreen for that to happen. \u201cVitamin D can still be generated when you\u2019re wearing sunscreen,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cYou can actually still have that beneficial sun exposure while you\u2019re wearing a sunscreen that\u2019s reducing the risk of sunburn and preventing overexposure to the sun.\u201d A little truth, a lot of malarky Social media pundits often espouse ideas that distort a grain of truth, such as pointing to data that shows a simultaneous rise in sunscreen use and new melanoma diagnoses. \u201cSince sunscreen came out, the rise of skin cancer has only gone up and up,\u201d says one TikTok influencer. \u201cIf you think sunscreen is protecting you from melanoma, why is the rate going up?\u201d asks the computer scientist in her TikTok interview. It is true that the rate of melanoma cases has been rising, but it\u2019s not due to sunscreen, Suozzi said. Instead, credit dermatologists, who are detecting skin cancers at earlier stages and saving lives. That\u2019s a good thing. \u201cDue to better screening we are detecting melanomas at earlier stages, which leads to higher reported incidence rates,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition, the sun exposure that\u2019s causing the increase in melanomas today occurred 40 or 50 years ago, when people were in their 20s and unlikely to use sunscreen. So the driving force is exposure years and years ago, not the increased use of sunscreen today.\u201d Sunglasses are another target. As one TikTok influencer told his friend: \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get sunburned if you wear sunglasses. \u201cOur eyes can sense the sun \u2026. and when it\u2019s harsh lighting our eyes tell us to produce melanin in our skin,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf our eyes can\u2019t realize that the sun is that harsh because we\u2019re wearing a lens over top, it\u2019s gonna burn your skin.\u201d So if people go out into the sun with sunglasses on, \u201cyou can burn a lot easier because your brain didn\u2019t get the message that the sun\u2019s hot,\u201d another said. While the eyes do contain melanin \u2014 that\u2019s what determines our eye color \u2014 the vast majority of the body\u2019s pigmentation is produced by cells in the skin, which is the largest organ of the body. Ultraviolet light penetrates deep into the lower layer of the epidermis to trigger the process. \u201cThe videos seem to imply that if you weren\u2019t wearing sunglasses, you\u2019d also get tanned under your clothes, which we absolutely know doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d EWG\u2019s Andrews said. \u201cIf it\u2019s only going to the brain, then your whole body would be perfectly tanned, right? \u201cIt made me laugh and cry. It\u2019s frightening, and I know those videos have thousands of views, which is shocking, because the message is so separated from reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these falsehoods are only influencing a few people, that\u2019s one person too many.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/tiktok-falsehoods-sun-protection-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_health_alzheimers-association-criteria", "text": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0\u201cDr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: The Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient\u201d airs at 8 p.m. ET Sunday, July 7, on CNN. With another pricey Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment expected to receive an approval decision soon, the nonprofit Alzheimer\u2019s Association has published the final version of its new diagnostic criteria for the disease. And for the first time, the criteria call on doctors diagnosing the disease to rely on biomarkers \u2014 pieces of beta amyloid and tau proteins picked up by lab tests or on brain scans \u2014 rather than pen-and-paper tests of memory and thinking. The idea behind the change, the authors say, is to catch the condition in its earliest and most treatable stages, even before symptoms develop.\u00a0However, it also means people could be diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s based on a blood test alone, even if they don\u2019t have any memory difficulties. Biology should be the basis of the diagnosis, the authors argue, rather than symptoms.\u00a0Furthermore, they say, just because a person doesn\u2019t have symptoms doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t develop them down the line. But the criteria have been criticized by outside experts and drug industry watchdog groups who point out that people can have beta amyloid proteins in their brains and blood without ever developing dementia symptoms. They also point out that there\u2019s no research to support the idea that giving a person expensive, risky injected medications before they show symptoms will benefit them in the long run. Risks and benefits of early diagnosis In clinical trials, the new drugs \u2013 which are antibodies that recognize and grab onto pieces of beta amyloid to remove them from the brain \u2013 showed modest benefits. Beta amyloid peptides are protein pieces that form sticky plaques in the brain. Together with another protein, tau, which makes fibrous tangles that block the communication of nerve cells, they are considered a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There\u2019s still debate about the role of beta amyloid in the disease, however, and some experts contend that plaques are a consequence of the condition rather than its cause. In an 18-month study of people who were in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the antibody lecanemab \u2013 which the US Food and Drug Administration approved in 2023 \u2013 slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 27% compared with a placebo. Also last year, the experimental drug donanemab appeared to slow the progression of disease by about 35% compared with a placebo.\u00a0This month, a group of experts that advises the FDA on its drug approval decisions unanimously recommended the approval of donanemab for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The drugs come with some risk.\u00a0As they remove amyloid, they can lead to fluid accumulation, swelling and even microbleeds in the brain, which may lead to hospitalization. Both trials were in people who had early symptoms of memory decline. Studies that have tested antibodies in patients who had amyloid buildup in their brains but no symptoms have not found a benefit to patients. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence for it,\u201d said Dr. George Perry, a neurobiologist and editor of the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Critics say the new criteria could dramatically expand the number of people eligible to take the new drugs and could generate huge profits for drug manufacturers in the process. \u201cThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association should lose all credibility by releasing\u00a0guidelines labeling perfectly normal people as having Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, director of PharmedOut, a program based at Georgetown University that tracks pharmaceutical marketing tactics. \u201cIf followed, these guidelines will ruin the lives of tens of thousands of\u00a0people who\u00a0will be misinformed that they have dementia,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only entities that gain from this travesty are the pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s and the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, which is preying\u00a0on fear.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Association says its criteria is based on the latest developments in Alzheimer\u2019s science. Because Alzheimer\u2019s therapies haven\u2019t been approved for people without symptoms, for now, it recommends against diagnostic testing in people without cognitive impairment, according to the working group that developed the criteria. \u201cOur goal in sharing them now \u2014 even as the field and our knowledge continues to evolve \u2014 is to advance diagnosis, treatment and prevention in order to improve individual care and reduce the societal impact of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Dr. Maria C. Carrillo, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association\u2019s chief science officer and medical affairs lead, and senior author on the new criteria. Financial conflicts of interest The new criteria \u2013 from the leading patient advocacy organization for Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 were developed by a 20-member working group, many of whom reported financial ties to many of the companies that are marketing new drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s or that have new drugs in development. A third of the expert panel is directly employed by pharmaceutical companies, while another third has reported some other kind of payment from pharmaceutical or testing companies.\u00a0Two members of the panel were employees of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, which also takes funding from pharmaceutical companies.\u00a0Only a handful of members of the work group declared no relevant conflicts of interest. \u201cWe should not be relying on this paper that was basically developed by industry. It\u2019s just not standard of practice how we think about guidelines,\u201d said Dr. Eric Widera, a geriatrician at the University of California San Francisco who authored a commentary in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society on the new criteria. Widera says it\u2019s a familiar playbook for the pharmaceutical industry: expanding the market for a drug by first expanding the population diagnosed with the disease that it treats. \u201cThis is diagnostic creep,\u201d he said. He cites examples such as the \u201cIs it low T?\u201d awareness campaign, launched by Abbott Labs, which made a testosterone replacement product as well as a more sensitive test for the hormone. Biogen similarly created the \u201cIt\u2019s Time We Know\u201d campaign in 2021 to spread awareness of mild cognitive impairment after its Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm won a controversial FDA approval the same year. Aduhelm has since been taken off the market. Widera estimates that as many as 1 in 10 normally functioning 50-year-olds would test positive for beta amyloid under the new criteria. Currently, about 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s, but estimates suggest roughly 40 million would test positive for beta amyloid. \u201cPublications such as this are a necessary component of a strategy aimed at selling as many monoclonal antibodies as possible,\u201d said Dr. Karl Herrup, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Defending the need for industry input Dr. Clifford Jack, who studies brain imaging at the Mayo Clinic, led the development of the new guidelines and says he is proud of what the committee accomplished. \u201cI personally wrote about 99% of the text in the final document. And I have no conflict of interest at all,\u201d he said. The change in the guidelines was spurred, the authors say, by the availability of the first drugs to slow the progress of the disease as well as new blood tests for amyloid and tau proteins.\u00a0Those tests are available to doctors and patients through the specialty labs that make them, but they have not been approved by the FDA, which requires rigorous proof that a test doesn\u2019t give too many false negative or false positive results before it gives a green light for widespread use. In a comment on the new criteria, published Friday in the journal Nature Medicine, members of the work group said it was composed of members from industry, clinical medicine and academia as well as the FDA and the federal National Institute on Aging, to incorporate a diversity of viewpoints. \u201cWe want these criteria to reflect the best available current scientific knowledge, and some of that knowledge is contained in industry, who are the ones who are actually running these trials,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI can honestly say that I did not see any attempt at any point by a committee member to insert any kind of commercial interest into these guidelines,\u201d he said. The first draft of the criteria, which were first presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in 2023, noted that they were being developed as a collaboration between the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and the National Institute on Aging. But the new criteria received criticism, and the institute removed its name from the title after it was asked to do so by administration within the wider National Institutes of Health.\u00a0The collaboration violated an NIH policy not to endorse private entities, products or services, according to an email from the National Institute on Aging. \u201cNIA continues to serve on the working group and looks forward to continuing its collaborative efforts with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and other involved workgroup organizations,\u201d the agency said in a statement. Since the draft criteria were released, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association has clarified that these are not meant to serve as detailed diagnostic guidelines for clinicians. Instead, the criteria are meant to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between research and the doctor\u2019s office. New guidelines in the works The association said it plans to convene a new workgroup, with different members, to develop \u201cnuts-and-bolts\u201d guidelines for Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis for doctors.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear how much those guidelines will be based on the diagnostic criteria. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be very concrete, and it probably will include recommendations that describe specific commercial products,\u201d Jack said. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association is committed to the development of trustworthy clinical practice guidelines \u201cand other types of evidence-based guidance informing clinical decision-making at the individual, health system, and population levels,\u201d spokesperson Niles Franz said. \u201cA core criterion for trustworthy guidelines, as defined by the National Academy of Medicine, involves collaboration between an organizing body and panels of clinical and subject-matter experts who are minimally conflicted both intellectually and financially,\u201d Franz said in a statement. \u201cTo that end, the Association recently established rules for collecting [conflict of interest] disclosures from guideline panel nominees, criteria for evaluating these forms and selecting panel members, and process for managing existing and new conflicts during and after guideline development,\u201d he said. Franz said the association hopes to have the new clinical guidelines ready for publication by 2025. In the meantime, Widera and others say the decision to take one of the new amyloid-clearing drugs is highly personal and one that should be made in close collaboration with a physician. \u201cThere is, I would say, probably more controversy around these guidelines than there are about the drugs themselves,\u201d Widera said. Widera says he hopes that in the next round of guidelines, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association will consider the risks involved. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to broaden the definition of what a disease is, you should also say what is the risk and harm of doing so,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/alzheimers-association-criteria/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness", "text": "Scientists have found microplastics in human penises for the first time, as concerns over the tiny particles\u2019 proliferation and potential health effects mount. Seven different kinds of microplastics were found in four out of five samples of penis tissue taken from five different men as part of a study published in IJIR: Your Sexual Medicine Journal on Wednesday. Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. They form when larger plastics break down,\u00a0either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. Some minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, and evidence is mounting that they are increasingly present in our bodies. Study lead author Ranjith Ramasamy, an expert in reproductive urology who conducted the research while working at the University of Miami, told CNN that he used a previous study that found evidence of microplastics in the human heart as a basis for his research. Ramasamy said he wasn\u2019t surprised to find microplastics in the penis, as it is a \u201cvery vascular organ,\u201d like the heart. The samples were taken from study participants who had been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction (ED) and were in the hospital to undergo surgery for penile implants to treat the condition at the University of Miami between August and September 2023. The samples were then analyzed using chemical imaging, which revealed that four of the five men had microplastics in their penile tissue. Seven different types of microplastics were detected, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) the most prevalent, according to the study.  Now their presence has been confirmed, more research is needed to investigate potential links to conditions such as ED, Ramasamy said. \u201cWe need to identify whether microplastics are linked to ED and if there is a level beyond which it causes pathology and what types of microplastics are pathologic,\u201d he said. As for the wider implications of the findings, Ramasamy said he hoped the study would \u201ccreate more awareness about the presence of foreign bodies within human organs and foster more research surrounding this topic.\u201d Prior research has found that one liter of bottled water \u2014 the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters \u2014 contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles. \u201cI think we need to be mindful about consuming water and food from plastic bottles and containers and try and limit the use until more research is done to identify levels that could cause pathology,\u201d Ramasamy said. Toxicologist Matthew J. Campen told CNN that this is \u201can interesting study that confirms the ubiquity of plastics in the body.\u201d \u201cAs we are trying to understand the potential health effects of plastics, this is another concerning paper,\u201d said Campen,\u00a0a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cPlastics are generally non-reactive with the cells and chemicals of our bodies, but they could be physically disruptive to the many processes our bodies undertake for normal function, including functions related to erection and sperm production.\u201d Campen coauthored a study published in May that found that human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas. The study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers of males who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said at the time the study was published. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d There are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to microplastics. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_exercise-summer-heat-wellness", "text": "For people in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s summer and you might be inspired to get outdoors to move more.\u00a0But the weather is getting too warm in some places for people to exercise safely outside. We know that adults should aim for at least\u00a0150 minutes \u00a0of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly. This can include exercises such as brisk walking, biking, playing basketball, swimming and more vigorous household tasks like mowing the lawn and vacuuming, also called functional fitness.\u00a0But is that all safe to do at high temperatures? How hot is too hot for exercising outdoors? Is it safe to exercise outside at some times of the day? Should younger or older people take more precautions in the heat? What about people who have heart and kidney conditions or take certain medications? To help us stay fit and safe in the summer heat, I spoke with CNN wellness analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What precautions should people take before exercising during the summer? Wen:\u00a0Summer can be a fantastic time to get outside and become more active, but as temperatures rise to unsafe levels,\u00a0people should be aware of the risk of\u00a0heat-related illnesses. I\u2019d advise that people look at the weather forecast before exercising. If a\u00a0heat wave\u00a0is expected, avoid exercising in the hottest part of the day and instead go out in the morning or evening. If it\u2019s going to be very hot all day and into the night, don\u2019t do your workout outside. CNN: What can happen if people work or exercise too much outside in the heat? Wen:\u00a0Someone working or exercising outside for prolonged periods of time may experience symptoms of heat exhaustion, including headache, weakness, dizziness\u00a0and nausea. When this happens, get out of the sun and into a cool, air-conditioned space. If symptoms worsen and the person develops confusion and vomiting, for instance, they may have\u00a0heat stroke, which is an emergency and requires immediate medical attention. CNN: Which people are most at risk during a heat wave?\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0\u00a0People who are the most vulnerable include those who are very young and elderly, and those who have chronic medical conditions. Several underlying conditions, such as heart, lung and kidney problems, can be exacerbated by heat. CNN: Do any medications make people more vulnerable during a heat wave? Wen:\u00a0Several medications can increase risk during times of extreme heat. Common blood pressure medications, like calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics, can have effects such as increasing the likelihood of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances during extreme heat. There are medications used for some mental health conditions that can affect the body\u2019s normal response to regulate temperature. That includes some antidepressants and stimulants used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Over-the-counter medicines can also have these effects. Diphenhydramine, for instance, and doxylamine are common antihistamines that can make people sweat less and affect temperature regulation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/exercise-summer-heat-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_er-visits-heat-related-illnesses-wellness", "text": "As heat blankets much of the US, hospitals in many states are seeing extremely high rates of heat-related emergencies, according to data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and forecasters say more abnormally warm weather is on the way later this summer. According to the CDC\u2019s map, the regions hardest hit by heat illnesses are not always the ones seeing the highest temperatures. While temperatures have soared to 100 degrees and even beyond across much of the South and Southwest, the states seeing the highest numbers of heat-related ER visits are in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Mountain west, where temperatures have been in the 80s and 90s. But the heat is much more unusual, especially in mid-June, for these locations,\u00a0trending well above historical averages. On Saturday, for example, when the heat was reaching a climax in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, hospitals in more than two dozen states across six regions reported \u201cextremely high\u201d rates of heat-related emergencies despite temperatures hovering in that lower range. The CDC defines \u201cextremely high\u201d as being in the top 5% of busiest days for heat-related illnesses over the last five years, from 2018 through 2023. Hot buildings, inexperience put people at risk CDC health scientist Claudia Brown says that\u2019s because built environments in those areas aren\u2019t designed to deal with heat and people\u2019s bodies aren\u2019t as used to handling high temperatures. \u201cSo in these more northern regions, for example, there tends to be less prevalence of air conditioning in the homes,\u201d said Brown,\u00a0who works in the Climate and Health Program at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health.\u00a0\u201cSo you may not have as high of temperatures as you have in, say, Arizona, but you have a higher health impact because they don\u2019t have, necessarily, the infrastructure in place to deal with that heat.\u201d With climate change increasing both the number and intensity of heat waves, the CDC earlier this year launched a new heat risk tool where people can look up their ZIP code and see a heat forecast and recommendations to stay safe. Dr. Cheyenne Falat works in the emergency department at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, a city that declared a code red heat alert over the weekend and opened cooling stations for residents. \u201cWe have seen some pretty significant cases of heat stroke and other heat illnesses coming in over the past few weeks, not just the past few days,\u201d said Falat, who also specializes in environmental medicine.\u00a0 She\u2019s bracing for more. In Baltimore, where there are high rates of substance use disorders, people can get into trouble if they take drugs and pass out in a car with no one around.\u00a0 Other patients have been older adults who live in homes without air conditioning, outdoor workers, and people who underestimate the heat when they head outside for a workout. Falat said heat is a serious health threat Americans are just learning how to grapple with.  \u201cHeat waves as a natural phenomenon kill more people, on average, than any other extreme weather event,\u201d she said. Staying safe in extreme heat Dr. William Brady, who works in the emergency department at the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville said he thinks inexperience has a lot to do with it, too. \u201cYou know, if you live in New Hampshire, you\u2019re used to really not dealing with terribly high periods of heat,\u201d Brady said. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that way, that I have to be careful with the heat.\u201d Brady said their ER is seeing an uptick in cases of heat exhaustion, usually in people who work or exercise outdoors.\u00a0 They come in with \u201cnausea, vomiting, headache, that sort of thing.\u201d So far, he says, he hasn\u2019t seen any cases of heat stroke, which can be life-threatening. Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, where patients have a throbbing headache, a rapid heart rate, high fever, as well as neurological symptoms like confusion. They may also faint or pass out. Brady said he\u2019s also seeing more people with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk from climbing temperatures such as emphysema, heart failure and diabetes. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more patients that are coming in just not tolerating the heat,\u201d he said. With climate change driving longer, ever hotter waves of high temperatures, Americans are on a steep learning curve when it comes to heat. \u201cWe know that heat is uncomfortable when temperatures and humidity reach a certain height,\u201d Brady said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not really used to being threatened by it the way other parts of the world have had been.\u201d Brady recently attended a medical conference in Taiwan and took a class to learn how to manage large crowds and mass gatherings during periods of high heat, to cut down on the risk of heat injury. \u201cThis is a potentially new issue that were beginning to face,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAnd we need to pay attention to it because it is exceedingly dangerous.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/er-visits-heat-related-illnesses-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning\u00a0to doctors on Tuesday to be on the look out for cases of dengue. A surge in dengue cases globally is raising the risk that people could catch the disease in the US. The number of people who develop the mosquito-borne disease has been increasing globally as the world\u2019s climate warms due to the human-made climate crisis. The infected mosquitos that spread the disease, the Aedes aegypti, and sometimes\u00a0Aedes albopictus, mosquitoes like warmer and wetter weather. Generally, dengue had been relatively rare in the continental US with most people getting sick after having traveled to popular destinations overseas where the disease is more common. So far this year, a higher-than-expected number of dengue cases have been identified among US travelers, with 745 cases in records kept through June 24, the CDC said. In 2023, 1,829 travel-associated cases were reported by US travelers, the highest number of travel-associated cases since dengue became reportable in the US in 2010, according to the CDC.  Twenty-three countries reported outbreaks last year with more than 5 million cases reported to the World Health Organization and 4,000 deaths in the Americas alone. Over the years there have been a handful of outbreaks in locally-transmitted cases in states with warmer climates and habitat friendly to the kind of mosquito that spread dengue like Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona. California reported its first locally transmitted case in Pasadena last year. Tuesday\u2019s warning from the CDC says that the number of global infections in 2024 have been the highest on record. Cases in the Americas have already exceeded the highest number ever recorded in a single year,\u00a0with more than 9.7 million people getting sick with dengue; that\u2019s twice as many cases in all of 2023. So many people have gotten sick with dengue in Puerto Rico, local public health officials declared a public health emergency. Other areas with frequent dengue transmission associated with the US include American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. The CDC warning instructs doctors to test patients with symptoms that look like dengue, especially those patients who have traveled to a part of the world where the disease is more common. Symptoms typically start about a week after the person has been bitten by the infected mosquito, although 40 to 80% of infections are asymptomatic, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA). Symptoms of dengue can include a fever, vomiting, muscle aches, joint and bone pain, pain behind the eyes, headache, nausea, low white blood cell counts and a fever. Most people recover after about a week. The CDC said warning signs that the dengue is progressing to a more serious form of the disease include persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, bleeding from the nose or gums, liver enlargement, being tired and abdominal pain. Severe disease can bring with it severe bleeding, respiratory distress, and a person\u2019s organs can start shutting down and people can die. Mortality can be as high as 13% in untreated patients, the IDSA said. Infants, pregnant people and the elderly are at an increased risk for severe dengue, along with people who have certain underlying medical conditions. Other than supportive care including treatment with fluids and rest, there are no specific medicines to treat dengue. There is no dengue vaccine recommended for travelers or for adults. There was a vaccine, Dengvaxia, but Sanofi Pasteur stopped making it citing a lack of demand. The public health departments in Puerto Rico will still be giving the shots to children aged 9 to 16 years with a lab-confirmed case who live in areas with frequent transmission until the doses expire in 2026. In April of this year the CDC had launched an emergency response that addresses the increasing dengue caseload in the US. It also expanded lab capacity and is working with local leaders to strengthen surveillance for the disease. To prevent dengue, use bug spray when outside, particularly when traveling to parts of the world where dengue is common. Wear loose-fitting and long-sleeved shirts and pants. Run the air conditioning or use window screens so mosquitos stay outside.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_health_hiking-heat-safety-wellness", "text": "With summer officially here, many people are excited to go hiking along their favorite local trails or tackle an out-of-town bucket-list hike. But before you grab your backpack and race out the door, hiking and safety officials urge caution. Temperatures are already soaring in many parts of the nation and around the world, and high heat has the potential to make any hike risky \u2014 and even deadly. Earlier in June, a young couple was rescued on a hiking trail in the California desert after running out of water and becoming dehydrated. The boyfriend was conscious during the rescue, but the girlfriend appeared unconscious, and medical officials referred to her \u201csevere condition,\u201d according to KTLA in Los Angeles. Others have not been as fortunate. Last year, a 14-year-old boy died while hiking with two family members in Texas\u2019 Big Bend National Park. The temperature was 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius). In 2021, a couple, their 1-year-old child and their dog all died in California while hiking in Devil\u2019s Gulch Valley on an extremely hot day. Experts said they likely perished from hyperthermia (an abnormally high body temperature) and dehydration. In Phoenix, where more than 200 hikers are rescued every year \u2014 mostly due to hiking during the hottest part of the day \u2014 the city instituted a program to close certain trails when the heat reaches excessive levels. How to tackle hiking in the heat Despite these heat-related dangers, it\u2019s possible to hit the trails safely when temperatures soar. Here\u2019s how to do so, according to experts. Prepare for a hot hike ahead of time Whether it\u2019s hot or cool, you should be in reasonable shape before tackling any hike. If you\u2019re planning a hilly, 5-mile trek, for example, make sure you\u2019re able to hike 5 challenging miles before arriving at the trailhead. To prepare for heat, become acclimatized to hot weather. You can do so by taking short, easy hikes in warm weather, progressing up to longer, more difficult hikes in hot weather. If that\u2019s not possible and you\u2019re traveling to a hot locale for your hike, schedule the trek several days into the trip when your body will be more accustomed to the weather. It\u2019s also good to know your sweat rate, said Dr. Floris Wardenaar, an assistant professor of nutrition\u00a0at Arizona State University in Phoenix. Wardenaar, who studies the physiological aspect of hiking, recommended weighing yourself before and after several hikes, then comparing any weight loss with the amount of water you consumed during the hike. \u201cBody mass loss is a good proxy marker of sweat loss,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lose more than 2% of your body weight on a hike.\u201d If you\u2019re losing more weight than that, you should be drinking more fluids. Load up on water and carry a water filter Water is essential for any hike, no matter the season \u2014 but it\u2019s critical in hot weather. Unfortunately, many people underestimate the amount of water they\u2019ll need. \u201cAlways hike with a water treatment device, too, and carry electrolytes,\u201d Martinez said. Electrolyte tablets or drinks help replace the salts and minerals lost through sweat, which assists in preventing heat-related ailments such as heatstroke and heat exhaustion. \u201cBring extra water, even if it\u2019s heavy,\u201d said Teresa Ana Martinez, executive director and cofounder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition. The Continental Divide Trail stretches 3,100 miles (4,989 kilometers) from Mexico to Canada, including some 800 miles (1,287.5\u00a0kilometers) in New Mexico, where there\u2019s plenty of desert terrain. Hike in the morning, preferably on shady trails \u201cThe benefit of hiking earlier in the day versus later in the evening is that in the evening, the earth still holds heat from the day,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cIt will radiate from the rocks, too.\u201d If possible, select a trail that winds through shady woods, along water or even in a cool canyon or cave. This way, should you struggle with the heat, you can find shade and water for cooling off. Wear light, loose clothing that covers most of your skin A long-sleeve shirt and pants might seem counterintuitive on a hot day, but they\u2019ll prevent sunburn and stop your skin and body from heating up. A neck buff and hiking gloves are also a good idea, said Abe Christian, operations manager for the Florida Trail Association. The Florida Trail meanders more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) through the state, from Big Cypress Swamp on the southern tip of the peninsula to Fort Pickens in the panhandle. \u201cThere are plenty of places on the Florida Trail where the sun can beat you to death,\u201d Christian said. \u201cSo you need to cover your skin as best as possible.\u201d The buff can also double as a compress should the heat get to you. Just dip it in water and place on your head and neck. Take along a sun umbrella, phone \u2014 and a buddy Make sure you have a fully charged phone in case you need to call for help. A portable battery is helpful, too. Martinez swears by a sun umbrella, which keeps the sun\u2019s rays from heating your head. (Look for those with an ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF, label or a seal of recommendation from groups such as the Skin Cancer Foundation.) If possible, bring along a friend. Sometimes when you\u2019re experiencing dehydration, heat exhaustion or heatstroke, you\u2019re not thinking clearly and don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in danger. When in doubt, turn around \u201cIf you start your hike and think it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too hot,\u201d Martinez said. Just turn around and come back another day, she said. Another tip: Turn around when half of your water is gone, even if you haven\u2019t reached your goal. \u201cYour ego is your worst enemy,\u201d Martinez warned. \u201cPeople underestimate how quickly things can escalate. You don\u2019t know when your body will say, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/health/hiking-heat-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_fda-brominated-vegetable-oil-ban-wellness", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration will no longer allow the use of brominated vegetable oil in food products, the agency said Tuesday. Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) is vegetable oil modified with the chemical bromine and has been used in small amounts to keep citrus flavoring from floating to the top in beverages, according to an FDA statement. Dozens of products \u2014 mostly sodas \u2014 use BVO as an ingredient, according to the Eat Well Guide by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that focuses on consumer health, toxic chemicals and pollutants. The rule that no longer allows BVO in food will go into effect August 2, but companies will have one year after that date to reformulate and relabel their products as well as deplete their BVO inventory, according to the FDA statement. The food additive was removed from the FDA\u2019s list of Generally Recognized As Safe or \u201cGRAS\u201d substance list in 1970 and has been regulated since then, the agency said. Because of the past restrictions, there are only a small number of products that still contain BVO, the FDA said. \u201cOver the years many beverage makers reformulated their products to replace BVO with an alternative ingredient,\u201d James Jones, FDA deputy commissioner for human foods, said in a 2023 statement. Additionally, a 2012 Change.org petition with more than 200,000 signatures brought attention to health concerns, according to an EWG news release. It also said many companies eliminated it from consumer products due to market pressure. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation into law in October 2023 prohibiting the manufacture, sale or distribution of foods that contain BVO as well as red dye No. 3, potassium bromate and propylparaben. Studies point to health concerns Brominated vegetable oil can accumulate in the body and has been linked to health hazards, according to the EWG. Those include nervous system damage, headaches, skin and mucous membrane irritation, fatigue and loss of muscle coordination and memory. A 1976 study found that consumption of BVO by pigs damaged their hearts, kidneys, livers and testicles. The FDA cited a 2022 study in the proposal to revoke the BVO regulation that found rates given BVO had the substance\u2019s derivatives accumulated in their heart, liver and fat. The reconsideration of BVO regulations shows that the FDA is reviewing new evidence as it emerges and responding to public concerns, CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen said in a previous story. What should people do until the BVO ban goes into effect on August 2? \u201cMy takeaway from the studies is that how much and how often you drink matters,\u201d Wen said. \u201cIf someone drinks one soda at a barbecue that happens to contain BVO, that\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cHowever, if someone is drinking a soda a day, every day, they should be careful and check out the ingredients.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/fda-brominated-vegetable-oil-ban-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_new-studies-bird-flu-dairy-workers-and-dairy-products", "text": "US health agencies are starting new rounds of tests on dairy workers and milk products to better understand the possible impact of H5N1 bird flu. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is partnering with the state of Michigan to begin a highly anticipated study to assess whether workers exposed to infected cattle had themselves become infected. And the US Food and Drug Administration is testing what\u2019s known as flash pasteurization after recent studies raised questions about whether the method neutralizes all infectious virus in milk. The projects are part of a suite of new research announced by federal agencies on Tuesday to understand the dynamics of H5N1 bird flu, which for the first time jumped from birds to dairy cattle around the beginning of the year.\u00a0 Since late March, more than 120 herds across 12 states have tested positive for the highly contagious infection, which appears to be spreading through contact with raw milk, the US Department of Agriculture confirmed. \u201cWe know this to be spread by contact with milk,\u201d said Dr. Eric Deeble, who is the acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA. Deeble said that early on, the movement of cattle was largely driving spread of the infection. But since the USDA ordered cattle to be tested before they could be moved state-to-state in late April, the infection has been ferried between farms on shared equipment and shared workers, according to a recent epidemiological study by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, or MDARD. \u201cWe know that milk has really high viral loads, and so when we\u2019re looking at transmission patterns,\u00a0that\u2019s a really high risk, it seems,\u201d MDARD Director Dr. Tim Boring said. How\u00a0the virus is using humans to hitch a ride \u2014 whether through infection or contaminated clothing or skin \u2014 isn\u2019t clear yet, Boring said. \u201cMy guess it\u2019s perhaps not truly binary, whether it is on people or in people,\u201d Boring said. Dairy farmers have been reluctant to let government officials onto their farms forwidespread testing of their herds, and farm workers have shied away from testing, even when they have symptoms.\u00a0 Advocates say workers are reluctant to test since it might mean missing work and pay. Last week, Michigan said it would\u00a0pay up to 20 dairy farms\u00a0a maximum of $28,000 each to participate in research.\u00a0That financial assistance is on top of funds\u00a0the federal government is offering. The offer seems to have worked.\u00a0 On Tuesday, the CDC announced that it had partnered with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to launch a study to test the blood of farm workers for antibodies to the H5N1 virus. \u201cThe point of this study is to determine if there is asymptomatic infection\u201d of workers who have been exposed to cows infected with the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis,\u00a0 director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The FDA also announced Tuesday that it has started another round of dairy product sampling to address gaps in its previous testing.\u00a0 This time, the 155 products it\u2019s plucking from store shelves will include raw milk cheeses, cream cheese, ice cream and butter, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Earlier this year, FDA\u2019s initial testing of milk and sour cream and other and other kinds of dairy products purchased at grocery stores found traces of virus in 1 out of 5 items sampled. Further testing confirmed, however, that those viral fragments were inactive and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick, leading the agency to declare milk and other dairy products safe to consume, as long as they\u2019re pasteurized. But\u00a0two recent\u00a0lab studies\u00a0published in the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine raised new questions. The studies\u00a0heated raw, infected milk to the times and temperatures used for flash pasteurization \u2014 the most common form of pasteurization in the US \u2014\u00a0and found that while it greatly reduced levels of infectious virus in milk, it didn\u2019t completely neutralize all of it. Scientists cautioned, however, that because the experiments didn\u2019t replicate the full flash pasteurization process, including a pre-heating step, more research was needed. Prater said the FDA believes its experiments are closer to the method used in commercial milk processing. Also on the FDA\u2019s\u00a0to-do list\u00a0are studies to measure the persistence of the virus in cheese as it ages, and pooled testing of raw milk samples from dairies. Prater didn\u2019t give a specific timeline for when the agency would have results from those studies, but said it hope to have the information in the very near future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/new-studies-bird-flu-dairy-workers-and-dairy-products/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_health_bionic-leg-ami-neuroprosthesis", "text": "Amy Pietrafitta has learned to walk seven times. First was as a child and then after an industrial burn led to the amputation of her left leg in 2018. Since then, she\u2019s had \u201cfirst steps\u201d in prosthetic legs for running, water, high heels, rowing and everyday walking. Her latest \u201cfirst steps\u201d were different. This time, she was fitted with a bionic leg that was fully connected to her brain, allowing her to walk and move like anyone else. With this new leg, she said, she couldn\u2019t even tell there was a difference. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like my leg had been amputated,\u201d the 47-year-old from Massachusetts said. \u201cIt was the happiest moment in my life.\u201d Pietrafitta was part of a study of a new neuroprosthesis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that\u2019s fully controlled by the nervous system. Her leg had been amputated using a novel muscle-pairing technique called agonist-antagonist myoneural interface, or AMI, which preserves signaling between the muscles and the brain. The neuroprosthesis uses sensors placed between the reconstructed amputation site and the bionic leg to transmit electrical signals from the brain. This allows the prosthetic to sense its position and movement and to send this information back to the patient, enabling a sense of proprioception: the brain\u2019s ability to sense self-movement and location in space. The study,\u00a0published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, indicated that participants who\u2019d had the specialized amputation and neuroprosthesis increased their walking speed 41%, matching the ranges and abilities of people without leg amputations. The results also suggested that the bionic limb could be controlled using just 18% of natural proprioception.  This is the first bionic leg fully controlled by the human nervous system to demonstrate natural walking speeds and gait patterns, according to Dr. Hugh Herr, principal investigator and senior author of the study and co-lead of the\u00a0Yang Center for Bionics\u00a0at MIT, where the research took place. \u201cIt feels natural, as if the limb were made of flesh and bone. It\u2019s as if the central brain isn\u2019t aware the limb is amputated because the brain is getting normal sensations,\u201d said Herr, who had both legs amputated below the knee after a climbing accident in 1982. Herr embarked on the project after observing a trend of prosthetics being increasingly controlled by robotic algorithms rather than the human nervous system. \u201cWe want to rebuild human bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reconstruct and give people back what they so seek. We don\u2019t just want to build fancier and fancier robotic tools or devices.\u201d To test the interface, 14 participants were split into two groups and fitted with bionic prosthetic legs. Seven had undergone AMI surgery, and seven had not. The results suggested that those with AMI amputations navigated real-world environments better, including slopes, stairs, obstructed pathways and even an \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d-style course, according to Pietrafitta and Dr. Matthew J. Carty, the lead surgeon in the first AMI procedure and a co-author of the new study. \u201cThis is a fundamental paradigm shift in the way we think about amputation in conjunction with technology: treating it as a restorative procedure as opposed to a failure,\u201d Carty said. Beyond first steps The technology also allows users to switch between speeds without changing prosthetics. This reduces the hassle of swapping legs, avoids unwanted attention and restores a sense of normalcy, according to Pietrafitta. \u201cIt felt normal. \u2026 I was ready to run. I kept wanting to take my hands off [the supports], to get out and start moving,\u201d she said. Restoring a normal gait is about more than getting from point A to point B. According to Pietrafitta, it\u2019s about re-entering society. \u201cIt meant my life could begin again. \u2026 I could go out there and live the way I wanted to,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in your home and you\u2019re bedridden, family and friends start to dwindle away. It\u2019s too hard for people to come in and see you in pain.\u201d For John Rheinstein, a lower and upper limb prosthetic specialist and clinic manager at the Hanger Clinic in New York, the physical prosthesis is only part of a successful amputation outcome. \u201cCare has improved over the years (in part) as a result of advances in understanding and treating the emotional impacts of losing a limb,\u201d he wrote in an email. Is innovation accessible? An estimated 1.9 million Americans live with limb loss, a figure expected to double by 2050, largely due to increasing rates of diabetes, a known risk factor, according to a 2018 report published by the federal\u00a0Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Herr said his team aims to make fully neuro-controlled prosthetics commercially available within five years. However, the 2018 report estimates that fewer than half of people with amputations receive prosthetic prescriptions. People with amputations may struggle to get prescriptions and insurance coverage for prosthetic devices, especially for options with more advanced technology. Rheinstein cites insurance coverage for prosthetic limbs \u2014 specifically the lack of coverage for activity-specific prosthetics \u2014 as one of the most difficult parts of his patients\u2019 rehabilitation journeys. \u201cDemonstrating to payers the value of the outcomes we provide and how outcomes-based prosthetic care reduces overall healthcare costs\u201d is one of the biggest challenges the industry faces today, he said. For example, the\u00a0BionX emPOWER prosthetic is the only motor-driven prosthetic on the market, according to Herr, and many people with limb loss aren\u2019t able to access it. Although AMI neuroprostheses aren\u2019t available to the public, the AMI surgery has been performed on about 60 people around the world, according to Herr. At the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, where Carty is a staff surgeon in the Division of Plastic Surgery, AMI is now the standard of care for amputations, Carty said. \u201cThe [hospital\u2019s] ethical board determined it\u2019s unethical to offer the standard amputation, because we now know the AMI amputation is so beneficial,\u201d Herr said. \u201cWe hope it\u2019ll be standard not only in Boston, but in clinical sites all over the world.\u201d The more surgeons, prosthetists, researchers and patients work together on new developments, the better, according to Rheinstein, who hopes the AMI technique will \u201cbring attention to the importance of thoughtfully planned amputation surgery to a patient\u2019s successful rehabilitation.\u201d \u201cHollywood for decades has given us visions of these remarkable bionic humans \u2026 but science reality has been slower than science fiction,\u201d Herr added. \u201cWe\u2019re finally producing systems that we\u2019ve seen in the movies.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/bionic-leg-ami-neuroprosthesis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_cancer-drug-shortages-continue", "text": "While a shortage of the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and carboplatin has improved in the United States, some of the nation\u2019s largest cancer centers now report additional concerns related to drug shortages, a new report finds. Among 28 large cancer centers across the country, 89% reported last month that at least one drug used to either treat cancer, its symptoms or the side effects of treatment was in short supply at their center, according to new survey results released Wednesday by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. That percentage has not changed much from last year, when about 86% of surveyed centers reported a shortage of at least one type of anti-cancer drug. But what has changed is specifically which cancer drugs are impacted. The new NCCN survey, conducted from May 28 to June 11 of this year, found that among 28 of the network\u2019s 33 cancer centers, more than half \u2014 57% \u2014 reported a short supply of the chemotherapy drug vinblastine, which is often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to treat Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and cancer of the testicles. The centers that participated in the survey also reported that several other key cancer medications are currently in short supply, with 46% reporting a shortage of the chemotherapy drug etoposide and 43% reporting a shortage of the chemotherapy drug topotecan. Dr. Crystal Denlinger, chief executive officer of the NCCN, said in an email that she was not surprised by the new survey results. \u201cSadly, as a practicing oncologist, I am well aware of and understand the challenges facing my patients and colleagues regarding oncology drug shortages, which have been going on for years. On the bright side, we have seen a new enthusiasm for both short- and long-term solutions since last year\u2019s survey came out. Our new survey shows the short-term solutions were fairly effective at meeting immediate needs,\u201d Denlinger said. However, long-term solutions are still needed, she said. \u201cThe current presidential administration and Congress have put forth various proposals. However, people with cancer don\u2019t always have the luxury of time. Given the results of this most recent survey, it is imperative to keep this issue top of mind as this is an urgent issue that requires sustained attention and solutions.\u201d Last year, 21% of surveyed centers reported a shortage of vinblastine, and etoposide and topotecan were not mentioned by name in the previous survey. But in that previous survey, 72% of centers reported a\u00a0shortage of the chemotherapy medication carboplatin, and 59% reported a\u00a0shortage of cisplatin. Carboplatin and cisplatin are\u00a0used in combination to treat many types of cancer. Cisplatin\u00a0and other similar platinum-based drugs are prescribed for an estimated 10% to 20% of all cancer patients,\u00a0according to the\u00a0National Cancer Institute. The new survey results suggest that the shortage of carboplatin and cisplatin has improved, as only 11% of surveyed centers reported a short supply of carboplatin and 7% reported a shortage of cisplatin. \u201cThanks to policymakers, patient advocates, healthcare professionals and health systems who went to extraordinary efforts to collaborate and mitigate harm, the shortages for carboplatin and cisplatin are mostly resolved at this time,\u201d Denlinger said. \u2018A significant and ongoing problem\u2019 The new survey also indicated that the current shortage of cancer drugs has not significantly disrupted patient care or clinical trials. But additional administrative work has been needed to ensure these things are not disrupted, according to NCCN. Among the centers reporting drug shortages, more than half \u2013 56% \u2013 indicated that their center still was able to treat patients who were receiving those medications by enacting \u201cmitigation strategies,\u201d such as limiting the use of medications that were in stock, adjusting doses, and implementing waste management strategies. Meanwhile, 37% of the centers with shortages reported still treating patients without mitigation strategies. But among the surveyed centers that reported drug shortages, 43% indicated that the shortages have impacted clinical trials at their center, leading to greater administrative burdens, reductions in trial enrollments, reductions in open trials, and budget changes, among other disruptions. It\u2019s not just the large cancer centers that are part of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network that are experiencing these drug shortages. Dr. Carolyn Hendricks, an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) board member, who was not involved in the NCCN report, said that smaller community cancer centers also are experiencing short supplies of critical cancer medications. \u201cI\u2019m in a community oncology practice. We in the community are experiencing the same types of shortages that the NCCN cancer centers are experiencing, and this survey data, which is an update of some prior surveys, really speaks to the fact that this is really a significant and ongoing problem, both in the cancer center environment and also in the community,\u201d Hendricks said. In Hendricks\u2019 practice in Maryland, she said that the center is currently experiencing a significant shortage of the chemotherapy drug etoposide, which was named in the new NCCN report. She added that the center received an alert Tuesday about the shortage. \u201cIt\u2019s more used for thoracic oncology, lung cancer \u2013 and the drugs that are incorporated in the lung cancer regimens are very important \u2013 and some testicular cancers and some other types of solid tumors,\u201d Hendricks said about etoposide. \u201cCancer care is complicated, but the vast majority of all cancer patients are treated with combination regimens, and so therefore it\u2019s critical that if one drug is in shortage, it becomes a challenge to administer the entire regimen to the patient and to afford either the highest chance of cure or the best quality of life in patients who have advanced disease,\u201d she said. In February, the chief medical officer and executive vice president of ASCO, Dr. Julie Gralow, testified before the US House Committee on Ways & Means about chronic drug shortages in the United States, calling the shortage a crisis. \u201cEvery day we hear from oncologists around the country about the challenges cancer patients and their providers are facing amid some of the worst oncology drug shortages to date,\u201d Gralow said at the time. \u201cThis crisis is forcing providers to make impossible choices, including having to decide which patients receive lifesaving and life-prolonging oncology drugs on schedule and in the established doses \u2014 and which ones won\u2019t.\u201d What needs to change The issue of cancer drug shortages continues to be driven by a combination of supply chain and economics, Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the new NCCN report, said in an email. He added that he was not surprised by the report\u2019s findings. \u201cMost older chemotherapy agents, particularly sterile injectable ones are produced in just a few settings, often times overseas. There is very little incentive financially for production. Therefore there is little redundancy and significant vulnerability if there is a manufacturing or supply chain issue,\u201d Dahut said. \u201cThe regulatory bodies can help signal the potential for shortages as well as help oversee the manufacturing, but without a change in the economic model shortages are likely to continue.\u201d Hendricks said that she thinks the way drugs are developed and then maintained in the supply chain are among the factors driving the ongoing drug shortage crisis. \u201cThe problem is the medications that are transitioned from a blockbuster drug into generic status,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cIn the United States, when new drugs come in development, they\u2019re under patent. They\u2019re usually blockbuster drugs \u2014 big in the news, high chance of cure \u2014 but mixed in amongst them are drugs that have come off the patent system and are classified as generics. The price goes down, which is good for the patients, but that means the supply chain of these generic medications is so vulnerable. They\u2019re not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t create a way to get pharmaceutical companies to want to make both the phenomenal blockbuster drugs we have and the generics then this problem will be chronic, and we won\u2019t be able to dig our way out or see a clear solution.\u201d Several generic cancer drug manufacturers have discontinued products over time for economic reasons, according to a White House statement last year. A Senate Finance Committee white paper from this year notes generics make up anywhere between 66-84% of drug shortages. In the new NCCN report, the surveyed centers called for solutions and noted concerns about how the marketplace currently operates. For instance, when asked what policy solutions they would like to see enacted to address oncology drug shortages, 75% of centers reported \u201ceconomic incentives to encourage high quality manufacturing of generics\u201d and 64% reported \u201cbetter information systems\u201d to accredit or rate generics suppliers so hospitals can contract with those using high-quality practices. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a marketplace that was designed in an unsustainable way. Generic medication manufacturers currently operate on very narrow margins, which are continually being squeezed. This may result in de-prioritization of generic drug manufacturing in favor of newer, and more expensive agents that remain on patent. This results in a fragile supply chain for older, but still critical, generic medications that can and does break frequently and recovers slowly,\u201d Denlinger said about the ongoing shortage. \u201cIt has also led to fewer companies in the generic market and demands extreme efficiency from those companies still in the market. When a supply issue occurs, it is difficult to ramp up additional capacity in the system. We need to invest in economic incentives for the generic drug market \u2014 which is distinctly different from the brand name drug market \u2014 to encourage the stable manufacturing of quality generic drugs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also need better systems to communicate information about impending shortages and other supply concerns with health care systems and providers so that health care providers can prepare in advance for anticipated shortages before it becomes a crisis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/cancer-drug-shortages-continue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_moderna-mrna-bird-flu-vaccine", "text": "The US Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday a contract with Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine that targets pandemic flu, in case the shot becomes necessary with the latest outbreak of bird flu. \u201cThis is an important step in our nation\u2019s pandemic influenza preparedness and response capability as we look to add this additional platform to our existing portfolio of approved pandemic influenza vaccines,\u201d Dawn O\u2019Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response with HHS, said at a news conference. The government has 4.8 million doses of an H5 vaccine with a traditional platform under production, O\u2019Connell said. The vaccine is tailored to the currently circulating strains of the H5N1 bird flu virus and should come off the finishing line starting in the middle of this month \u2014\u00a0ahead of schedule, she said. The new $176 million contract with Moderna will help the government stay \u201cnimble\u201d in case it needs to act quickly against any kind of circulating strains of a pandemic flu virus, officials said. The mRNA vaccines wouldn\u2019t be available any time soon, O\u2019Connell said. Moderna has a vaccine candidate in early stage testing, and results should be available in the coming weeks, but late-stage testing of its vaccine wouldn\u2019t start until 2025. If something changes with the current H5N1 bird flu outbreak \u2014 for instance, if there is human-to-human transmission or if the severity of cases gets worse \u2014 there are options to \u201caccelerate the timeline,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. However, such a vaccine may not be necessary. \u201cThe risk to the general population right now remains low and CDC\u2019s assessment of that has not changed,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. H5N1 bird flu has been identified in dairy cows in 12 states, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Three farm workers in the US who worked with infected cattle have tested positive for bird flu. Daskalakis said that even if a vaccine were available, the CDC isn\u2019t entirely sure that vaccination is the best approach to protect farm workers right now, given that uptake might be limited, the virus hasn\u2019t spread widely and illnesses haven\u2019t been severe. Biosecurity safety measures that many farms already have in place have been essential to keep the virus from spreading, said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for H5N1 response at the US Department of Agriculture, but the country needs to be prepared for anything. \u201cWe do know that the vast majority of farms practice biosecurity and that includes dairy farms,\u201d\u00a0Deeble said at Tuesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cBut this is a new and emerging disease that calls for a different set of biosecurity practices or enhancements of specific ones.\u201d More than 780 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected cows, and at least 53 have been tested, the CDC said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/moderna-mrna-bird-flu-vaccine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_loneliness-stroke-wellness", "text": "Lonely isn\u2019t just how many people are around \u2013 it\u2019s how you feel. And it may impact your stroke risk, according to a new study. In fact, older adults who reported being chronically lonely had a 56% higher risk of stroke than those who were consistently rated low on the loneliness scale, according to a new study. \u201cIt is important to routinely assess loneliness, as the consequences may be worse if unidentified and/or ignored,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Yenee Soh, research associate in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an email. The study, which published Monday in the journal eClinicalMedicine, looked at data collected between 2006 to 2018 as part of the Health and Retirement Study. More than 12,000 participants age 50 years or older were initially surveyed between 2006 and 2008, according to the study. When researchers followed up four years later, nearly 9,000 participants remained in the study. They responded to questions on the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale and were given loneliness scores for both points in time. Researchers also tracked the participants\u2019 instances of stroke and analyzed the data against their loneliness scores, according to the study. While there was a strong increase in risk for people who scored high on loneliness at both points of the survey, there was not a clear association with stroke risk in those who only scored high at one point in time, Soh said. This suggests that the biggest impact on stroke risk occurs over the long term. \u201cWe have known for a while that loneliness is a risk factor for many conditions,\u201d said Dr. Matt Pantell, associate professor in the department of pediatrics and core faculty member of the Center for Health and Community at the University of California, San Francisco. He was not involved in the research. Prior research has linked loneliness and isolation\u00a0to sleep problems, inflammation and other symptoms in young adults, and linked them to a shorter life span, insomnia, depression and other symptoms in older adults. Loneliness and social isolation may be connected to higher risks of heart disease, dementia, diabetes, addiction, self-harm and suicidality in people of all ages. \u201cThis (new study) has implications for clinicians and health systems in that understanding whether or not a person is lonely, and for how long, may be able to help identify those at higher risk of stroke,\u201d Pantell added. Are you lonely or alone? Being on your own often doesn\u2019t mean you will always feel lonely. Being alone means not having many people around, while being lonely is a feeling of isolation you can have regardless of the people around you. And that feeling of loneliness is what the study found to be correlated to the increased risk of stroke, Soh said. \u201cGiven that loneliness is a highly subjective experience, seeking help to address and intervene to one\u2019s specific personal needs is important,\u201d she said. Health care providers can play a part by screening for loneliness and referring patients to therapists and behavioral health clinicians, Soh added. \u201cIndividuals may be unaware or reluctant to admit feeling lonely,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be helpful to take self-administered questionnaires that assess loneliness by oneself or when in a healthcare setting to first identify and acknowledge that one is feeling lonely.\u201d It is important to note that this study is observational, meaning that it can\u2019t say that the feeling of loneliness was the direct cause of the strokes, just that they were correlated, Pantell said. People who feel lonely may share demographic factors or health characteristics that also make them more likely to have a stroke, he said. However, the researchers conducted a strong study and did control for other explanations, Pantell added. Feeling more connected What makes someone feel lonely is often unique to them, meaning that the changes they need to feel more socially integrated will be individual as well, Soh said. Loneliness impacts people of all ages in the United States, a country in an \u201cepidemic of loneliness and isolation,\u201d said US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy in 2023. \u201cMake it be known that you are experiencing feelings of loneliness, and also identify what would be helpful for you specifically to address the feelings of loneliness,\u201d Soh said. A wide range of organizations provide resources to help combat loneliness, so it may help to get involved in those in your community, Soh added. Scrolling through social media may feel like involving oneself in community, but it may take a bit more interaction to combat loneliness, said Dr. Olivia Remes, a mental health researcher at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, in a previous CNN story. Remes was not involved in the latest research. Interact with friends\u2019 posts or send a private message, she said. Better yet, make interacting in-person with those in your community a part of your daily routine. \u201cTaking the steps to practice chatting with those you encounter as you go about your day can pay off. It can make you feel better, boost your mood, and even stave off loneliness,\u201d she said. If you find yourself having a hard time putting yourself out there to make the connections you need, or getting caught in patterns of thinking that you won\u2019t be received well, it might be time to seek the help of a mental health professional, said Dr. Louise Hawkley, a principal research scientist in the Academic Research Centers, NORC, at the University of Chicago in a previous CNN story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/loneliness-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

{"id": "2024_06_28_health_covid-summer-wave", "text": "Covid-19 levels have been rising in the United States for weeks as new variants drive what\u2019s become an annual summer surge. Covid-19 surveillance has been scaled back significantly since the US public health emergency ended more than a year ago \u2014 individual cases are no longer counted, and severe outcomes are based on representative samples of the population \u2014 but the data that is available is showing a consistent upward trend. Infections are probably growing in at least 38 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wastewater surveillance suggests that viral activity is still relatively low, but hospitalizations and deaths are also ticking up. Covid-19 levels are especially high in the West, where viral levels are back to what they were in February, and in the South, according to the CDC. \u201cThe virus tends to replicate well and to stay alive in an environment with warm and moist conditions. That fits with what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, a nonprofit public health organization. \u201cThe South and the West are steamy and hot right now.\u201d The summer bump has become a familiar seasonal pattern, but experts warn that the coronavirus can still be quite unpredictable. \u201cI think it\u2019s still a bit early to say what the pattern is,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cA large portion of the population has had some exposure to the virus, the peaks have been a little bit less high, and we have tended to see a summer bump as well as a winter increase. But whether that pattern is going to continue or whether it will become an all-year-round disease or whether it will stay in one particular time \u2014 I think it\u2019s a little early to say.\u201d Data from WastewaterSCAN, a nationwide sewage surveillance network based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, suggests that this summer wave started weeks earlier than last summer\u2019s wave and has reached levels similar to last summer\u2019s peak. \u201cIt remains to be seen if this will be a peak level for this surge,\u201d said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, assistant professor of environmental health at Emory and program director for WastewaterSCAN. \u201cWe are always trying to unpack what is potential seasonality with Covid and also what are the impacts of new variants that may be coming through that drive these surges that we see more regularly, more frequently than we do for influenza and RSV,\u201d she said. Over the past few months, the JN.1 virus variant that drove this winter\u2019s surge has been overtaken by newer offshoots. These so-called FLiRT variants \u2014 an acronym that refers to the locations of the amino acid\u00a0mutations that the virus has picked up \u2014 have changes in some places that help them evade the body\u2019s immune response and others that help them become more transmissible. Two of them \u2014 KP.3 and KP.2 \u2014 now account for more than half of the new Covid infections in the US, according to CDC data. Expect an updated vaccine this fall Because of manufacturing timelines, experts have to make predictions now if they want a new vaccine for fall. Earlier this month, the FDA endorsed a plan to update the Covid-19 shots to be more effective against the JN.1 lineage of the coronavirus. But the agency later updated its own recommendation. Vaccine manufacturers were advised to target the KP.2 strain if possible, in part because of the \u201crecent rise in cases.\u201d \u201cJN.1 has continued to evolve, and it makes it somewhat difficult to pick the particular specific strain to be used,\u201d Dr. Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told an independent advisory committee ahead of the initial recommendation. The new vaccines \u2014 some that will make the switch to target KP.2 \u2014 are anticipated to become available between mid-August and late September. That\u2019s enough time to offer protection during the winter respiratory virus season but probably after this summer\u2019s wave has ebbed. On Thursday, the CDC recommended that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated Covid-19 vaccine for the 2024-25 season. The recommendation echoes the vote of that agency\u2019s independent advisory committee. \u201cIt makes sense to do that vaccine at the same time that you\u2019re expecting flu and RSV, because you just want to reduce the overall incidence of disease,\u201d Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told CNN. Protection from Covid-19 vaccines wanes, and the timing of the shot prioritizes maximum protection when there have typically been higher and more sustained peaks, Plescia said. Unlike flu and RSV, Covid-19 is constantly circulating; it doesn\u2019t offer a reprieve. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever get a break,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do get a break from flu and RSV. You get through the season, and then you\u2019re done. You can prepare for the next one. [Covid] is just kind of always there.\u201d Flu and RSV levels now remain low in the US, according to the latest CDC update. But vaccination rates for all three major respiratory viruses lagged during the winter season, and the CDC advisers also looked ahead to the upcoming season with discussions around vaccine coverage recommendations for flu and RSV. On Wednesday, the CDC updated its recommendations on who should get the RSV vaccine. For the upcoming respiratory virus season, everyone 75 and older is urged to get an RSV vaccine, as well as those ages 60 to 74 who are at higher risk of severe illness. The changes are meant to \u201csimplify RSV vaccine decision-making for clinicians and the public,\u201d the agency said. When it comes to infectious respiratory diseases, Plescia said, \u201cpeople need to remember that there are things you can do to reduce your risk. And getting vaccinated is the main one.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/covid-summer-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_health_latino-new-hiv-diagnosis-rates-reaj", "text": "When Felix Hernandez learned that he had HIV, he had no one to lean on. In the years since his diagnosis, he found a way to support other people who may be feeling alone\u00a0by helping administer HIV tests at a Tennessee clinic. \u201cIn my case I didn\u2019t have anyone that I could count on besides from the medical staff,\u201d Hernandez, a 31-year-old HVAC technician, told CNN. \u201cSometimes you want somebody that can relate with you and unfortunately, even though the medical staff can be a great support system, sometimes they\u2019re not positive so they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through.\u201d While working at the clinic for the past two years, Hernandez says\u00a0he has noticed that HIV infections among Latinos are becoming more common. Latinos or Hispanic people represent less than 20% of the United States population but they made up nearly a third of new HIV diagnoses in 2022, according to the latest figures released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When compared to all racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic people have the second highest rate of new HIV diagnoses \u2013 there were about 19 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people, which is nearly double the national rate\u2013 and new diagnoses are rising quickly. Across the US, new HIV diagnoses overall held relatively steady between 2018 and 2022 but they increased 19% among Latinos or Hispanic people. In contrast, Black people had\u00a0the highest share of HIV diagnoses in 2022 but new cases have fallen in recent years, down nearly 6% since 2018, the data shows. Daniel Castellanos, vice president of research and innovation for the nonprofit Latino Commission on AIDS, said the estimates are a confirmation of a pattern that Latino advocates and health policy experts have been concerned about for years. A trend that he says has been\u00a0fueled by the high number of uninsured people, socio-economic instability, and the need for more mental health and substance abuse services. The uninsured rate among Hispanic or Latino people was nearly 18% in 2021, making it among the highest in the nation when compared to other racial and ethnic groups, according to a survey by the US Census Bureau. Overall, an estimated 8.6% of the US population was uninsured in 2021. \u201cFor instance, homelessness or housing stability is a major issue, or adhering to your treatment if you don\u2019t have a place to stay, or (if) you are staying with family members and constantly thinking about what people are going to say if they see you taking that medication,\u201d Castellanos said. When Hernandez tested positive in 2019, the stigma and misinformation surrounding HIV that often festers in Latino communities played a large role on how he first handled his diagnosis. \u201cThe emotions were just like \u2018nobody\u2019s gonna love me. I\u2019m not gonna have children, I\u2019m HIV positive.\u2019 It was more of guilt and disgust at the same time, but it was stuff that I had to overcome,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to go about it but just to keep quiet, (go) on with my daily life and just hide it,\u201d he added, saying that it took him several years to tell his parents, partly because of how they previously reacted when he shared with them that he was gay. Latino advocates and health policy experts said young gay Latino men, transgender women and newly settled immigrants are among the most adversely impacted by HIV. In 2022, Latino men who have sex with men accounted for more\u00a0new HIV diagnoses than any other race or ethnicity, according to the CDC data. Edgar Longoria, executive director of Entre Hermanos, a Seattle nonprofit serving the Latino LGBTQ community, said that not feeling comfortable sharing information with relatives or others is one of the main barriers faced by those at risk of getting HIV and those living with HIV. \u201cIn Latin America there\u2019s a Catholic influence, so it\u2019s taboo to speak about sex at home if you are heterosexual, and it\u2019s even less common to talk about sex if we are talking about gay sex,\u201d Longoria said. In the case of LGBTQ Latinos,\u00a0they strongly prefer anonymous HIV services and often check to see if anyone will see them entering an LGBTQ resources office or clinic out of fear, he added. Parallel to the growth of the Latino population in the Seattle area, Entre Hermanos says there has been an uptick of HIV cases in recent years. A decade ago, the nonprofit\u2019s medical case managers supported an average of 10 individuals. That number has grown to nearly 200 clients, said Martha Zu\u00f1iga, deputy director for Entre Hermanos. For Zu\u00f1iga, who began advocating for HIV education and access to care after losing seven of her close friends during the 1980\u2019s AIDS crisis, the statistics in Seattle and across the country are alarming. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad for me that this is a never-ending story. Even though there\u2019s a lot of resources in the world, they are\u00a0not in the right places, not in the hands of the right people, or on the way that it can better serve these communities,\u201d Zu\u00f1iga said. Entre Hermanos provides several services, including testing, HIV medical case management, support groups, and gaining access to pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP \u2013 a medication\u00a0that decreases a person\u2019s risk of getting HIV from sex\u00a0or injection drug use\u00a0by about 99%\u00a0when used as prescribed,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But Zu\u00f1iga says more institutions and the community at large are needed to increase awareness of HIV and PrEP. \u201cThere\u2019s young people who still think that HIV is a death sentence and people who grew up during the HIV epidemic that never got the correct information about what HIV is and how to protect themselves,\u201d Zu\u00f1iga said. \u201cIt looks like they are not getting any kind of sexual education at home and the same thing is happening at schools.\u201d In a 2021 report, the CDC said awareness of PrEP and referrals to PrEP providers\u00a0among Latinos who were tested for HIV at CDC-funded sites in 2019 was low compared to their White counterparts. Last month during a meeting of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, co-chair Vincent Guilamo-Ramos discussed the rising HIV rates among Latinos saying\u00a0the country \u00a0\u201ccannot end the HIV epidemic\u201d without an increased focus on the Latino community. Guilamo-Ramos presented\u00a0nine actions to \u201cturn the tide,\u201d including the equitable distribution of resources to the Latino community, eliminating barriers to care and building what he called a \u201cLatino HIV workforce.\u201d \u201cI think most of the time, I would argue that when you do hear about Latinos, it historically has been about the border and migration. We have many other needs and issues, we need to start to make that much more visible,\u201d Guilamo-Ramos said during the meeting. Longoria said he encourages medical providers to routinely offer HIV and STD testing, and consider offering it along with common tests such as blood sugar and cholesterol. \u201cThey need to offer it, because if they don\u2019t offer it, our community won\u2019t ask for it,\u201d Longoria said. For now, Hernandez says he is taking any opportunity to help increase awareness of HIV in the Latino community. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge community out there aside from the LGBTQ community that\u2019s here as a support system. There\u2019s so many agencies out there and you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s like a whole new family so you\u2019re not alone. We are in this together and we\u2019re here together until we eradicate HIV,\u201d Hernandez said. CNN\u2019s Deidre McPhillips contributed to this story.

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_07_02_health_emtala-abortion-reminder-letter", "text": "In letters to health-care providers Tuesday, the Biden administration reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that pregnant people have access to emergency treatment, even if that treatment necessitates an abortion and the person lives in a state with an abortion ban. In the letters, US Department of Health And Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure reminded hospitals and provider associations of their legal duty to provide stabilizing medical care \u2013 or transfers, if appropriate \u2013 to all patients. The letters come soon after the US Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban that had prompted at least one large hospital system to send some pregnant patients out of state via air transport to protect their health. Idaho\u2019s ban criminalizes most abortions and does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion even if the patient\u2019s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself, in most circumstances. The Biden administration argued that the law violates the federal\u00a0Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also known as EMTALA. The 1986 law requires all US hospitals that have received Medicare money \u2014 nearly all of them \u2014 to screen everyone who comes into their emergency rooms to determine whether the person has an emergency medical condition, without regard for their ability to pay for those services. The law also requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or transfer them to a facility that has that capacity. Hospitals must treat patients \u201cuntil the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.\u201d Pregnant people were singled out in the law\u00a0in 1989, after reports that some hospitals were refusing to care for uninsured women in labor. Congress expanded EMTALA to specify how it included people who were pregnant and having contractions. In 2021, the Biden administration released the\u00a0Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor\u2019s duty to provide stabilizing treatment \u201cpreempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,\u201d although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided. In July 2022, the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0guidance\u00a0clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. Experts have said that the law around emergency treatment has been murky ever since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to make their own laws restricting abortions. Forty-one states now have\u00a0abortion bans\u00a0with only limited exceptions, and 14 states have total bans. Texas also sued the US government over its EMTALA guidance, and in 2022, a federal judge allowed the law\u00a0to be blocked. The federal government has asked the US Supreme Court to review the law, and that case could go before the court next term. Although last week\u2019s Supreme Court decision did not resolve the entire EMTALA matter, Tuesday\u2019s letter to providers spells out that \u201cEMTALA\u2019s protections remain in place.\u201d The letter reminds providers\u00a0that state law is pre-empted if it prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life and health of the pregnant individual and if they seek medical help that necessitates an abortion. \u201cNo pregnant woman or her family should have to even begin to worry that she could be denied the treatment she needs to stabilize her emergency medical condition in the emergency room,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs health care providers, you know better than anyone how crucial it is for anyone experiencing a medical emergency to receive appropriate care and to receive it quickly. And yet, we have heard story after story describing the experiences of pregnant women presenting to hospital emergency departments with emergency medical conditions and being turned away because medical providers were uncertain about what treatment they were permitted to provide.\u201d CMS says it will investigate all EMTALA complaints to make sure providers are following federal law. The agency also announced Tuesday that it had created an EMTALA complaint form in Spanish and had made it easier for people to file complaints directly at CMS.gov. CMS has created a website to help people understand exactly what protections are offered under EMTALA. If a provider is found to be in violation of EMTALA, CMS will offer one opportunity to come into compliance. Failure to do so may mean a fine or the loss of a Medicare provider agreement. The federal agencies said they will continue to educate the public about their rights to emergency medical care and will help support hospitals and health care professionals in their efforts to meet EMTALA obligations. \u201cWe will continue to do everything in our power to give you the clarity you need regarding the federal laws that protect you and your patients in emergency medical situations,\u201d the letter says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/emtala-abortion-reminder-letter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_health_worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness", "text": "Eating higher levels of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespans by more than 10%, according to a new, unpublished study of over 500,000 people whom researchers followed for nearly three decades. The risk went up to 15% for men and 14% for women once the data was adjusted, said study lead author Erikka Loftfield, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Asked about their consumption of 124 foods, people in the top 90th percentile of ultraprocessed food consumption said overly processed drinks topped their list. \u201cDiet soft drinks were the key contributor to ultraprocessed food consumption. The second one was sugary soft drinks,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cBeverages are a very important component of the diet and the contribution to ultraprocessed food.\u201d Refined grains such as ultraprocessed breads and baked goods ranked next in popularity, the study found. \u201cThis is one more large, long-duration cohort study confirming the association between UPF (ultraprocessed food) intake and all-cause mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Carlos Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health at Brazil\u2019s University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in an email. Monteiro coined the term ultraprocessed food and created the NOVA food classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made. Monteiro was not involved in the study, but several members of the NOVA classification system were coauthors. The NOVA classification system sorts foods from unprocessed or minimally processed \u2014 whole foods such as fruits and vegetables \u2014 to ultraprocessed foods such as deli meat and sausage. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food appetizing. Health risks linked to processed meats and soft drinks The preliminary study, presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago, analyzed dietary data gathered in 1995 from nearly 541,000 Americans ages 50 to 71 who were participating in the US National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. Researchers linked the dietary data to death rates over the next 20 to 30 years. Compared with those in the bottom 10% of ultraprocessed food consumption, people who ate the most overly processed food were more likely to die from heart disease or diabetes, according to the study. Unlike other studies, however, researchers found no rise in cancer-related death. Some ultraprocessed foods carried more of a risk than others, Loftfield said: \u201cHighly processed meat and soft drinks were a couple of the subgroups of ultraprocessed food most strongly associated with mortality risk.\u201d Diet drinks are considered ultraprocessed food because they contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium and stevia, and additional additives not found in whole foods. Diet beverages have been linked to a higher risk of dying early from cardiovascular disease as well as the onset of dementia,\u00a0type 2 diabetes,\u00a0obesity, stroke and\u00a0metabolic syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes. The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans already recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to premature death and the development of chronic disease. A March 2019 study found women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages\u00a0\u2014 defined as a standard glass, bottle or can \u2014 had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared with women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk. Processed meats such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, ham, corned beef, jerky and deli meats are also not recommended; studies have linked red and processed meats to bowel and stomach cancers, heart disease, diabetes and early death from any cause. \u201cThe evidence from this new study indicates that processed meat may be one of the most unhealthy foods, but people do not tend to view ham or chicken nuggets as UPF (ultraprocessed food),\u201d said Rosie Green,\u00a0a professor of environment, food and health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in a statement. She was not involved in the study. The study found that people who consumed the most ultraprocessed food were younger and heavier, and had an overall poorer quality of diet than those who ate fewer ultraprocessed foods. However, the increased health risk could not be explained by these differences, because even people with normal weight and better diets were also at some risk for early death from ultraprocessed foods, the study found. Results may underestimate risk One key limitation of the study was that the dietary data was gathered only once some 30 years ago, Green said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how dietary habits might have changed between then and now.\u201d Ultraprocessed food manufacturing has exploded since the mid-1990s, however, with estimates that as nearly 60% of the average American\u2019s daily calories come from ultraprocessed foods. That\u2019s not surprising, considering as much as 70% of the food in any grocery store may be ultraprocessed. \u201cIf anything, we are probably underestimating ultraprocessed food consumption in our study because we\u2019re being very conservative,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cThe intake is likely to have only grown over the years.\u201d In fact, a study published in May that found similar results \u2014 a higher risk of premature death and death from cardiovascular disease in over 100,000 health professionals who ate ultraprocessed foods \u2014 accessed ultraprocessed food intake every four years and found consumption doubled between the mid-1980s and 2018. \u201cFor example, the daily intake of packaged savory snacks and dairy-based desserts, such as ice cream, has essentially doubled since the \u201890s,\u201d said the lead author of the May study, Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIn our study, just as in this new one, the positive association was mainly driven by a few subgroups, including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d Song said. \u201cHowever, all categories of ultraprocessed food were associated with increased risk.\u201d Choosing more minimally processed foods is a one way to limit ultraprocessed foods in one\u2019s diet, Loftfield said. \u201cWe should really be focusing on eating diets that are rich in whole foods,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if the food is ultraprocessed, then look to see the levels of sodium and added sugars and try to make the best decision possible using the nutrition facts label.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "health"}}
