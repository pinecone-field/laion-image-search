{"id": "2024_06_18_health_childhood-obesity-recommendations-uspstf", "text": "The US Preventive Services Task Force updated its final recommendations Tuesday for how primary care clinicians can best help children with a high body mass index, the measure most practitioners use to determine whether a person has obesity. The task force suggested that extensive and intensive behavioral interventions are the best way to help a child get to a healthy weight. Recent studies have shown that popular weight-loss drugs and surgical procedures are also highly successful treatments for children, and they are recommended as viable options under American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. But neither option is part of the USPSTF\u2019s latest recommendations, and along with the large number of hours the task force recommends for behavioral interventions, it has left some doctors frustrated. Several providers characterize the new recommendations as unrealistic or problematic. What the recommendations say The latest recommendations from the task force \u2013 a volunteer panel of independent medical experts \u2013 suggest that clinicians provide intensive behavioral interventions for children who are at least 6 years old with a high BMI, or refer children for such services. A high BMI for a child is defined a little differently than it is for adults, although both use height and weight to estimate mass. A BMI of 30 or higher is within the obesity range for adults, but a child is considered to have a high BMI if they fall at or above the 95th percentile for their age and sex.\u00a0That means the child\u2019s BMI is higher than that of 95% of other kids of the same age or gender, based on growth charts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Parents can use the CDC\u2019s online calculator to estimate their child\u2019s body fat percentage. The USPSTF\u2019s recommended interventions can include self-monitoring, goal-setting, supervised physical activity, instruction in healthier eating and limits on screen time. Providers can tailor these options to fit the patient and their family, the task force says, but the interventions should involve at least 26 hours in a calendar year and include supervised physical activity. According to research that the USPSTF reviewed before making its recommendations, most children who were a part of such intensive programs experienced small weight loss and reductions in BMI after six months to a year. Those who did better spent a larger number of hours with the clinician and had physical activity as a part of their program. Why the recommendations matter A high BMI in children can lead to several significant and even life-threatening health conditions including diabetes, breathing issues, bone and joint problems, liver issues, skin problems, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which itself may lead to heart diseases. Obesity can also make a child a target of bullying, affecting their emotional well-being and self-esteem. Nearly 20% of children in the US have what\u2019s considered a high BMI. The number of children with obesity has grown significantly, tripling over the past four decades, studies show. The USPSTF recommendations help primary care providers determine what preventive care works and what doesn\u2019t, and insurance companies use them to help decide what treatments to cover. The task force gives its guidelines letter grades based on the most up-to-date science. Under the Affordable Care Act, private insurers must cover preventive services that get a grade of A or B; the new child obesity recommendations got a B grade. Some doctors say guidelines are impractical Dr. Susma Vaidya, a pediatrician who runs a weight loss clinic at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, says intensive behavioral intervention is essential and important, but she thinks the recommendation of 26 hours per year \u2013 which averages out to an hour every other week \u2013 is a nearly impossible goal. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure currently to provide this intensive behavioral therapy management,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging for providers. It\u2019s challenging for parents and for kids to be able to commit to that number of hours. And we know that the amount of BMI improvement can be fairly minimal.\u201d Dr. Mona Sharifi, an associate professor of pediatrics and biostatistics at the Yale School of Medicine, worked on the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines that came out last year on helping doctors manage patients with obesity. She was happy to see that the USPSTF recommendations reiterate the strength of the evidence around intensive behavioral treatments, she said, but the group\u2019s last two sets of recommendations on this topic \u2013 issued in 2010 and 2017 \u2013 were similar, and little has changed. \u201cHere we are 15 years later from the first version of these, and still, access to this kind of treatment is abysmal \u2013 and it might even be worse, really, post-pandemic,\u201d Sharifi said. Many programs remain inaccessible for the vast majority of children and adolescents who need them most, according to an editorial published alongside the latest guidelines Tuesday in the journal JAMA. Even the past recommendations are \u201cstill not routinely implemented in clinical practice,\u201d wrote Dr. Thomas Robinson of the Stanford Solutions Science Lab and Department of Pediatrics and Dr. Sarah Armstrong, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Health at Duke University Medical School. Several highly effective pediatric programs also shut down during the pandemic and still haven\u2019t returned, Sharifi said. Some doctors are trying to resurrect these programs, she said, but \u201cin the absence of appropriate reimbursement from insurers, it\u2019s just been really difficult.\u201d Dr. Justin Ryder, a pediatric obesity researcher with Stanley Manne Children\u2019s Research Institute at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago, said that such a high benchmark as 26 hours could also mean insurers refuse to cover programs that are less intense. \u201cI\u2019ve got huge problems with these recommendations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that these recommendations really do a disservice to kids with obesity.\u201d Twenty-six hours of intervention is \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d to achieve in the clinical setting, he said. \u201cIn a primary care setting, it\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d Lack of recommendations on surgery Some doctors are also critical of the USPSTF\u2019s decision not to recommend surgery. Although procedures such as bariatric surgeries are among the options that the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests doctors consider, the task force didn\u2019t review the latest research on the matter, saying surgery is considered \u201coutside the scope of the primary care setting.\u201d \u201cBariatric surgery has 10 years of data now in adolescents,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cIt has some of the most robust and best long-term followup, as well as outcome data, in this patient population, and to not even mention it as a potential option, it\u2019s a clear miss.\u201d Lack of recommendations on medication Some of the biggest disagreements with the recommendation involve weight-loss drugs, for which the USPSTF said \u201cthe totality of the evidence was found to be inadequate.\u201d However, the task force did examine studies involving the medications liraglutide, semaglutide, orlistat, phentermine and topiramate (sold under brand names such as Saxenda, Wegovy, Alli, Lomaira and Topamax, respectively). In most trials, the medications were\u00a0associated with larger BMI reductions than with placebos. But there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to determine what effects they could have in the long term, said task force member\u00a0Dr.\u00a0John Ruiz, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Arizona. The drugs also may come with side effects like nausea, vomiting and gallstones. \u201cThere\u2019s just such a limited set of studies done that one doesn\u2019t know if those results are reliable and to whether they are generalizable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether there\u2019s any harms that have come about, particularly, in longer-term use of those medications. That would be important to know.\u201d Vaidya says the drugs have transformed her practice in Washington. \u201cI appreciate that these are children, and we are always very cautious about using medication, but these are FDA-approved medications, and sometimes, these medications facilitate a family or child\u2019s ability to adhere to the lifestyle modifications that we also recommend,\u201d she said. Vaidya said she has seen children struggle for years to get to a healthy weight through lifestyle interventions alone before they finally get \u201cunstuck\u201d with the help of weight-loss medications. \u201cI think the role of pharmacotherapy, honestly, can\u2019t be understated,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/childhood-obesity-recommendations-uspstf/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_fda-menthol-vapes-response", "text": "Four menthol vaping products were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday, the first non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products to get the agency\u2019s sign-off. The decision drew harsh criticism from pediatricians and anti-tobacco groups, which called it \u201ca blow to public health\u201d and warned of potential for \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d to children. The products, made by NJOY, an Altria company, are disposable e-cigarettes and nonrefillable pods that are used with the company\u2019s reusable vaping device. Nicotine levels in the products range from 2.4% to 6%. The company did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Friday\u2019s authorizations do \u201cnot mean these tobacco products are safe nor are they \u2018FDA approved,\u2019\u201d the agency said, but evidence submitted by the company showed that the products could be beneficial to adult smokers to help them make a switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes. The agency said there was sufficient evidence that the products would be \u201cappropriate for the protection of public health.\u201d \u201cBased upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,\u201d Dr. Matthew Farrelly, director of the Office of Science in the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in a news release. E-cigarettes were created to be a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes and were advertised by tobacco companies as a way to help people quit smoking, with flavored vapes being most popular. Massive advertising campaigns targeted children, helping lead to a vaping epidemic among young people \u2014 and eventually an FDA crackdown on flavors. Still, many flavored products remain available for purchase while the agency reviews marketing applications. An FDA official told the US Senate Judiciary Committee last week that regulation of e-cigarettes was a \u201ctop priority.\u201d However, the agency missed a September 2021 deadline to complete its review of e-cigarette makers\u2019 applications to sell their products; a federal court had ruled that the FDA was violating the Tobacco Control Act by allowing e-cigarette products that did not have agency pre-authorization to stay on the market. The FDA has been making its way through 27 million applications from companies seeking marketing authorization for e-cigarette products. Only 27 have gotten the FDA\u2019s green light, and until now, tobacco was the only flavor to do so. Anti-tobacco groups and doctors were quick to criticize Friday\u2019s decision as short-sighted and risky, especially for young people. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is hard to understand in light of the FDA\u2019s own repeated conclusions that flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products, appeal to kids and have fueled the youth e-cigarette epidemic. What has changed?\u201d Yolonda C. Richardson, president and CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in an email. \u201cThis decision is especially troubling given the FDA\u2019s failure to do its job and clear the market of unauthorized, illegal e-cigarette products. Rather than authorizing the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, the FDA should be stepping up its enforcement efforts against the illegal products that are addicting our kids.\u201d The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said in an email that the FDA decision had \u201cdealt a blow to public health,\u201d even as the Biden White House continues to hold up a long-awaited ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. \u201cOn the heels of the administration refusing to finalize rules to prohibit menthol in cigarettes and all flavors in cigars, this decision is a missed opportunity for the FDA to do the right thing,\u201d said Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \u201cBy authorizing the sale of menthol flavored e-cigarettes, including two disposable menthol e-cigarettes, the agency is continuing to allow Big Tobacco to addict yet another generation of youth to their products. Authorizing the sale of any flavored e-cigarette flies in the face of public health and fails to protect young people from a lifetime of addiction.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics said it is also \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d by the FDA decision. \u201cPrevious decisions by FDA to allow the marketing of flavored e-cigarettes had disastrous consequences for children that we are still working to overcome,\u201d President Dr. Benjamin Hoffman said. \u201cThese products will inevitably end up in the backpacks of middle schoolers. Once that happens, FDA will have an obligation to immediately reverse this deeply unwise decision.\u201d Erika Sward, assistant vice president of nationwide advocacy for the American Lung Association, said it \u201copposes any flavored products being on the market. But what is most troubling is the fact that these are so highly addictive with 5% and 6% nicotine. And that is a recipe for more addiction, particularly among kids.\u201d \u201cMenthol-flavored e-cigarettes are highly attractive to kids. And this is a one-two combination of a flavor plus such high levels of nicotine, and that\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\u201d Sward said. About 10% of high school-age adolescents and nearly 5% of middle school students use e-cigarettes,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, according to the FDA. But when they do vape, teens and young adults are much more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. According to the to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey, more than 23% of high school e-cigarette users nationwide use menthol-flavored products. The FDA said it has put \u201cstringent marketing restrictions\u201d on the newly authorized products in an effort to prevent youth access and exposure. The agency also said it will closely monitor how the products are marketed, and if the company fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the agency may suspend or withdraw authorization. \u201cAll tobacco products are harmful and potentially addictive,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cThose who do not use tobacco products shouldn\u2019t start.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/fda-menthol-vapes-response/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness", "text": "When her daughter was 6 years old, Kelceymarie Warner began to notice her child\u2019s hesitation before bedtime. \u201cHer body would be a little more tense, and she would hyperventilate if you pushed the subject too soon, she really needed to be slowly moved into the cycle.\u201d Warner, who is a parent to four young daughters, believes that sticking to a nightly routine is the best way for her kids to have an easy transition to bedtime. But when her 6-year-old was experiencing bedtime anxiety, Warner had to make some additions to her routine. Warner is not the only one \u2014 many parents know all too well what can be a nightly struggle to get their young children to bed. A new C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health reinforces this common difficulty, revealing that 1 in 4 parents said their child has trouble getting to sleep because they are anxious or worried. Over one-third of parents reported that their child doesn\u2019t stay asleep throughout the night and often or occasionally wakes up upset or crying. \u201cFrom 1 year of age to 6 years of age, kids change a lot. The different phases that they go to are often pretty predictable: They\u2019re scared of the dark, or as kids develop and their imagination develops \u2026 now they\u2019re scared of monsters,\u201d said Sarah Clark, Mott poll co-director and a research scientist in pediatrics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt can be all sorts of things, and so often with kids, and I would argue adults too, some of those anxieties seem to come out at night.\u201d The Mott Poll was conducted in February with 781 parents who have at least one child age 1 to 6 years old. Almost half reported their child leaving their bed and moving to the parent\u2019s bed some or most nights, while 1 in 3 parents said their child often or occasionally insists that they stay in the room until the child falls asleep. But some of these habits may be causing more trouble than the temporary relief they provide, Clark said. While a child may feel safe knowing the parent is in the room, they could later wake up and not be able to go back to sleep on their own, she added. How to help an anxious child with bedtime Warner said her child\u2019s bedtime anxiety may have been caused by the major changes that happened when her youngest daughter was in the neonatal intensive care unit for three months. \u201cMy husband and I were gone for extended periods during the day and even during the night because we wanted to be with a new baby who was born three months early \u2014 but we also needed to be there with our other children. I think she really struggled with a major change in her routine, and it just kind of triggered this very difficult time for her especially.\u201d Warner began incorporating activities into her daughter\u2019s bedtime routine that would promote relaxation and reassurance, such as drinking herbal tea after bathtime, reading a story together and saying nightly affirmations like \u201cI am loved\u201d and \u201cI am important.\u201d The new routine took longer than usual, sometimes up to an hour, but now, a little over a year later, her daughter is able to go through some parts of the routine on her own, and is able to better self-soothe, Warner said. She had posted her advice for other parents that may be facing a similar scenario\u00a0on her TikTok\u00a0account in 2023. The most important factor in getting kids to bed is consistency and sticking with a bedtime routine, Mott Poll co-director Clark said. Ninety percent of polled parents reported having an established and consistent bedtime routine. But some 27% described getting their child to bed was difficult, and those parents were more likely to not have a bedtime routine, stay in the room until the child fell asleep and keep the television or a video on. \u201cWe know that young children really resonate with consistency and routine, and getting ready for bed helps their body and their brain know that this is the time to start winding down,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Hartstein, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. She studies sleep and circadian health in early childhood and was not involved in the Mott poll. Hartstein recommends limiting media use at night, especially avoiding exciting content that could stimulate the child\u2019s brain and make it harder to wind down. A\u00a0January 2022 study\u00a0that Hartstein led found that children around this age group were more sensitive to light at night than adults are, and it could interfere with a child\u2019s production of natural melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Parents could find it beneficial to dim the lights an hour before bed, which would trigger a mental cue that it\u2019s time to get ready to sleep soon, she added. As for staying in the child\u2019s bedroom until they fall asleep, Clark recommends leaving the room and returning to check in every few minutes, which lets the child know that someone will be making sure they are safe every so often, but not staying in the room indefinitely. It\u2019s common for young children to experience sleep issues, especially as preschool-age children begin to reduce or drop naptime, Hartstein said. If parents are especially worried or see their child struggling during the day because they are sleepy, they should talk with their pediatrician, she added. Giving melatonin to young children The poll also found 1 in 5 parents often or sometimes give their child melatonin before bedtime, which came as a surprise given the younger age range of 1 to 6 years old, Clark said. \u201cClearly, this is something that people are feeling the need to try with younger kids. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a signal of how disruptive sleep problems can be for the whole family.\u201d It isn\u2019t recommended to give melatonin to children younger than age of 3, since many sleep issues with children that age are behavioral, according to\u00a0Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0If a parent is considering giving melatonin to their child, they should speak with their pediatrician first, Hartstein said. \u201c(One) concern is that what you\u2019re teaching them is that if they can\u2019t sleep, they should just take a medication, at a time when they should really be developing these healthy sleep habits that will carry them through childhood,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_bids-for-connection-better-relationship-wellness", "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s a woodpecker over there!\u201d Alyssa Caribardi watched as her friend whipped her head around to look out the window and seek out the bird. And with that simple gesture, Caribardi knew their friendship would last. In what may seem like a small, everyday exchange, her friend\u2019s reaction was an important indicator for their relationship: She had responded to Caribardi\u2019s \u201cbid for connection,\u201d a term coined by relationship experts at the\u00a0Gottman Institute\u00a0in Seattle. Their interaction might not look important to outsiders, but Caribardi had given someone close to her an opportunity to connect, and her friend had reciprocated. \u201cBids for connection are when one partner reaches out to the other person for either interest, or a conversation or expressing a need,\u201d said Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, a clinical psychologist who has researched couples and long-lasting marriages alongside her husband, Dr. John Gottman, for more than 40 years. \u201cDepending on how the partner responds, the relationship either succeeds or doesn\u2019t do so well.\u201d The bids can be verbal or physical, such as pointing out a bird in a tree, repeating something heard on TV, asking for advice or even simply directing a smile at the other person. Whether the bid is big or small doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 what is important is the other person\u2019s response,\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said. And it\u2019s not just important for couples to know about these opportunities to connect \u2014 it also affects parent-child relationships, friendships, even business ties, she noted. How to recognize a \u2018bid for connection\u2019 The basis of \u201cbids for connection\u201d stems from the Gottmans\u2019 \u201cLove Lab\u201d research, which started\u00a0in 1986 and tracked couples for six years. At the end of that time, the couples still together were found to have responded to each other\u2019s bids 86% of the time, while those who split up only responded 33% of the time. Caribardi knows that feeling. The Leander, Texas, native said she thought the woodpecker was neat, partially because she had never seen one before. But the fun part was her friend\u2019s reciprocated interest that spiraled into a deep-dive Google session on the bird. \u201cWe can talk about literally anything and everything \u2014 a brick wall could talk to us. And the woodpecker showed me that,\u201d Caribardi said. \u201cBut even if she just said, like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that is really cool,\u2019 that\u2019s literally the only thing that you need. Just someone to acknowledge what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Caribardi posted her experience with the woodpecker on TikTok in October, referring to it as \u201cthe bird test,\u201d alongside others who took to the app to recount their experience with giving out small bids \u2014 such as pointing out cool birds \u2014 to their friends and partners. Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said this test is a good example of the importance of \u201cturning toward\u201d a partner, one of the three responses someone can have to a bid. If a partner responds to a bid, even with a simple acknowledgement that the other person was heard, it is the best and most beneficial response to have. If the partner were to ignore the other person and have no verbal response to the bid being made, she calls that \u201cturning away.\u201d But the worst response is what\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0calls \u201cturning against,\u201d which happens when there is hostility toward the bid. Partners may respond with a comment such as \u201cStop interrupting what I\u2019m doing,\u201d or another variation that tells the other person they don\u2019t care about the bid. \u201cMost of us, at the end of the day, want to be seen and understood and feel important. And so, when there are too many bids that are missed or rejected, it leaves you feeling the opposite: unseen, unimportant, misunderstood,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Fogel Mersy, a licensed psychologist and sex therapist based in Minnesota. \u201cIf that happens more often than not, it starts to erode connection and safety and trust in a relationship.\u201d What to do when your partner wants to connect While bids look to be crucial in a relationship, no one is perfect and should not be expected to answer a bid all the time, Fogel Mersy said. \u201cYou just want a ratio of more positive to negative responses to bids.\u201d If someone notices a partner has missed or continuously misses a bid, she recommends communicating the intent for attention by saying, \u201cHey, that was my way of trying to connect with you,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m looking to converse with you, or get some attention from you, is now a good time?\u201d Fogel Mersy also recommends people become more aware of their own responses when partners make a bid and even ask their partners directly if they feel they are getting responses to their calls for attention. The more direct a person is with a bid and its intent, the more likely the bid is to be reciprocated, she added. It\u2019s OK if a person notices that a partner is sending out a bid to connect but isn\u2019t feeling up to connecting at the moment, maybe because they are too tired or have a lot on their mind.\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0recommends communicating those feelings directly and honestly to the partner, instead of lashing out with a \u201cturning against\u201d response. \u201cMost of the time, if the response is positive, it\u2019s not really going to matter how small or big (the bid) is, but with negative \u2018turning away,\u2019 or \u2018turning against,\u2019 those can cause some real emotional damage in the relationship,\u201d\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said. The takeaway is \u201cthat turning toward one another is really the foundation of a good strong friendship \u2014 and also passion and romance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/bids-for-connection-better-relationship-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_social-media-mental-health-limited-science-wellness", "text": "When US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy pushed last week for a tobacco-style warning on social media, he called the mental\u00a0health\u00a0crisis in young people an emergency that demanded action without waiting for \u201cperfect information.\u201d Even among experts, questions remain about the exact role that social media plays in the mental\u00a0health\u00a0of children and teens. Authors of a sweeping new review of research into social media and mental\u00a0health\u00a0say there\u2019s still key information missing to know whether prevention programs and interventions will work. In the study, published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, researchers reviewed nearly 150 studies on the relationship between social media and the mental health of adolescents. They found an overall link between anxiety and depression in adolescents and the time spent on social media platforms, as well as a link between the types of activities and content they were interacting with. However, the level of impact varied enough to suggest that the findings shouldn\u2019t be generalized to the population as a whole. The researchers found that very few studies assessed the relationship between social media use and adolescents who were experiencing mental health symptoms at clinical levels \u2014 where they\u2019re seeking health services or have an active diagnosis, for example \u2014 which further clouds the findings. There\u2019s a \u201creal risk that we are incorrectly generalizing results from the general population to young people with mental\u00a0health\u00a0conditions,\u201d wrote the study authors, from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and Stellenbosch University in South Africa. \u201cIn a world increasingly saturated by digital technology, we cannot afford to design prevention programs, interventions, and regulations without knowing that they work for everyone, especially those who are most vulnerable.\u201d Another analysis of existing research, published by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in December, also highlighted key questions that remain to be answered. \u201cThere is not enough evidence to say that social media causes changes in adolescent health at the population level,\u201d according to a news release from the independent organization about the report. And \u201cdespite many years of research, the evidence clarifying precisely how social media influences health is limited.\u201d While the science suggests there is a link between social media and mental health, there is often a lack of clarity on whether social media is influencing an individual\u2019s mental health or whether an individual\u2019s mental health is influencing their use of social media, said Dr. Sandro Galea, chair of an ad-hoc National Academies committee that authored the analysis of research and dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. Future research should focus on following trends over time \u2013 tracking the mental health of the same children before and after exposure to social media to see what effects it has \u2013 and digging in on more specific measures that capture how social media is used, he said. For Murthy, the urgency of the youth mental health crisis is dominant \u2014\u00a0and there\u2019s enough evidence to act now. In a New York Times op-ed, Murthy advocated for a warning label that would \u201cregularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe\u201d among other interventions. Murthy cited two key reports in support of a warning label: one study from 2019 that found that adolescents who spent more time on social media faced increased risk for anxiety and depression and one survey from 2022 in which nearly half of adolescents said that social media makes them feel worse about their bodies. \u201cOne of the most important lessons I learned in medical school was that in an emergency, you don\u2019t have the luxury to wait for perfect information. You assess the available facts, you use your best judgment, and you act quickly,\u201d Murthy wrote in his essay. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor.\u201d Public health often lacks \u2018perfect\u2019 data Many experts agree that the surgeon general is starting an important conversation and that the need for more information shouldn\u2019t lead to passiveness, but a social media warning label will require nuance in language and implementation. It will also require Congress to act to make it a reality. \u201cThe Surgeon General is identifying something that he sees as a challenge to the health of the public and thinking about ways to act to mitigate the challenge. Through that lens, I think he\u2019s doing exactly what a surgeon general should do,\u201d Galea said. \u201cPublic health action, not infrequently, has to happen absent complete or perfect data.\u201d The National Academies committee specifically recommended against a social media ban. Despite potential harms \u2013 such as unhealthy social comparisons and distracting from other important healthy behaviors such as sleep, exercise and studying \u2013 social media can also benefit young people by helping to foster connection with friends and family, and with online support communities. But there is an important distinction between benefits and safety, Murthy said Friday on The Daily, a podcast from the the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at the research question broadly. What we\u2019re trying to understand first and foremost is the answer to the question parents are asking us, which is, \u2018Is social media safe from my kids?\u2019 And if you ask researchers, \u2018What does data tell us about safety? Where is the data that tells us these platforms are safe?\u2019 That data is not there. So there\u2019s not evidence of safety. There is growing evidence of harm,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain benefits, but getting some benefits does not justify forcing kids to endure significant harm.\u201d Still, social media is not the same as cigarettes. Smoking has a much stronger and more direct link with negative health effects, and cessation is not the end goal with social media. Instead, a social media warning label should be more like those on bicycles and motor vehicles, said Pamela Wisniewski, an associate professor in human-computer interaction at Vanderbilt University, whose research has focused on the relationship between social media, privacy, and online safety for adolescents. \u201cThe key is to focus on solutions that empower youth and give them choices and opportunities to maximize the benefits of social media use, while minimizing risks, as opposed to taking restrictive and surveillance-based approaches that are heavily rooted in fear,\u201d she said. The goal should be to ensure proper use, not just focus on the risks and harm. There is an expectation that products children interact with are tested for safety, and a warning label on social media could deliver a clear message that there are \u201ca lot of safety gaps,\u201d said Dr. Jenny\u00a0Radesky, co-medical director of the American Academy of Pediatrics Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health. \u201cWe expect that infant formula is tested for bacteria, toys are tested for lead paint, and that there are rules about safety for everything from cribs to cars. These safety guardrails that prioritize children\u2019s well-being in digital products do not exist in the US,\u201d she said. Still, warning labels are brief and nuance can be lost in the \u201cnoise of the internet,\u201d Radesky said. \u201cFamily conversations to support healthy media use take a long time and need to happen over and over.\u201d For the surgeon general, a warning label is part of a holistic strategy to reduce the risks that social media poses to young people in the US. Systematic design changes by the platforms and legislation to support those changes remain the priority. \u201cTo be clear, a warning label would not, on its own, make social media safe for young people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese harms are not a failure of willpower and parenting; they are the consequence of unleashing powerful technology without adequate safety measures, transparency or accountability.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/social-media-mental-health-limited-science-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness", "text": "There\u2019s a crack of light shining through the dark clouds of America\u2019s battle with poor nutrition and subsequent health issues, according to a new study that analyzed two decades of nutritional data. \u201cThere is good news. Americans are starting to hear the message about nutrition, and some companies and restaurants are starting to make healthier products. It\u2019s a little bit of an improvement,\u201d said senior study author and cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston. However, he added, the majority of the improvement occurred between 1999 and 2010, with no advances in nutrition after that. \u201cWe have stalled as a nation \u2014 and that does not bode well for our health,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIf I was grading America on its diet, I\u2019d give it a D\u2014just up from an F.\u201d An upward trend, but more is needed The number of adults in the United States who ate a poor diet decreased from about 49% to just over 37% between 1999 and 2020 \u2014 a drop of 11.4%, while those who ate somewhat better nutritionally rose by 10.5%, the study found. A poor diet was defined as one with too many refined grains, processed meat and sugary beverages, including fruit juice, as well as ultraprocessed foods full of added sugar, salt and fat.\u00a0Healthy choices such as fruits and vegetables are extremely low in this eating style. \u201cIntake of fruits and vegetables didn\u2019t increase at all over this 20-year period, which is pretty striking,\u201d Mozaffarian said. An ideal diet included at least the daily recommended servings of fruits and vegetables, as well as more beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Dietary guidelines such as those from the American Heart Association suggest eating 4 to 5 cups a day of canned, fresh or frozen fruits and the same amount for vegetables. The nutritionally ideal diet also contained few sugary beverages, processed meats, refined grains and ultraprocessed food, which is often high in added sugars, fat and salt, the study said. Unfortunately, the number of people who ate an ideal diet \u2013\u2014 which included those 9 cups of fruits and vegetables \u2014 rose less than 1%, the study found. \u201cPeople often ask me, \u2018Well, if the diet\u2019s slowly improving, why is obesity and diabetes still going up?\u2019 It\u2019s still going up because only 1.58% of Americans have an ideal diet. We still have a long way to go,\u201d Mozaffarian said. More than a million Americans die each year from diet-related diseases such as obesity, cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes,\u00a0according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the United States an\u00a0estimated $1.1 trillion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity annually. \u201cI think it is correct to emphasize that diet quality remains dismal in the US. There is no secret why Americans are experiencing epidemics of obesity and diabetes and declining life expectancy,\u201d said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, in an email. He was not involved in the study. Food insecurity is a major issue The study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed dietary information on nearly 52,000 US adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. Nutritional advances were highest among women, younger adults, Hispanic adults, and people with more education and higher incomes who had access to private health care insurance. Fewer gains were seen in men, Black or older adults and people with less income, lower educational levels, non-private health insurance, and food insecurity issues. \u201cDisparities in the population by education and income and race and ethnicity are the same or sometimes getting worse,\u201d Mozaffarian said. The study found that people with lower income saw a 5% improvement in nutritional quality, while those with higher incomes improved their nutritional score by 16%. \u201cWe do need to avoid just blaming the victims of the dysfunctional US food system for the terrible diets documented in the survey,\u201d Willett said. \u201cWe fail to educate students about nutrition in our schools and feed them unhealthy diets. \u201cOur health care system is missing in action almost completely, we allow advertising to seduce children into junk foods and beverages that kill them prematurely, and we indirectly subsidize unhealthy foods in many ways that make healthier options relatively more expensive and less available to low-income Americans,\u201d he said. How to improve your nutrition There are easy steps you can take to boost the nutritional quality of your diet, experts say. Cook at home as often as possible: \u201cMy top suggestion is to shop at the grocery store as much as you can, rather than getting your food at a coffee shop, sandwich shop or quick-serve restaurant,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Even eating at a full-service restaurant should be limited, he added. Prior research by Mozaffarian and his team found about 80% of all food consumed by Americans from restaurants was of poor diet quality. \u201cShockingly, even when we compared fast food versus sit-down restaurants, there wasn\u2019t a dramatic difference in quality,\u201d he said. Instead, try to choose minimally-processed foods to cook at home and avoid the ready-to-heat-and-eat convenience foods so prevalent at the grocery store. Bring your lunch and snacks to work. Don\u2019t drink your sugar. Americans are beginning to get the idea that sugary sodas are unhealthy, but they have not yet made the connection that energy, sports and caffeinated drinks can be equally sugar laden, Mozaffarian said. \u201cEnergy drinks, pre-sweetened iced teas, and specialty coffee drinks can have more sugar than soda,\u201d he said. \u201cI see people walking out of the coffee shop with drinks with whipped cream on top. Don\u2019t drink your sugar.\u201d However, once sugary beverages are removed from the equation, only \u201c6% of calories in the country come from added sugar in foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIn contrast, about 35% of calories in the country come from refined grains and starches.\u201d Limit refined grains.\u00a0Overall, the biggest contributor to the poor quality diet of Americans is refined grains, at 5.2 servings per day \u2014 \u201calmost two servings a meal of refined grains such as refined bread, refined rice, crackers, chips, and other ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Whole grains still contain the bran and germ, which is a nutritional powerhouse full of healthy fats, antioxidants, minerals and E and B vitamins. Whole grains take longer to digest, don\u2019t raise blood sugar as quickly as refined grains and contain more fiber, which can reduce the risk of chronic disease, promote weight loss, and improve digestion. \u201cSome examples of whole grains include barley, bulgur, farro, millet, quinoa, black rice, brown rice, red rice, wild rice, oatmeal and popcorn,\u201d according to My Plate, the US Department of Agriculture website. Refined grains such as white flour, corn grits, white bread and white rice have been milled, removing the bran and germ, to give them a finer texture and longer shelf life. Milling also removes nutrients like dietary fiber, iron and vitamins.\u00a0Refined grains are found in nearly all ultraprocessed foods, including breakfast cereals, desserts, pastries, bread and crackers. Replace refined grains. Instead, nourish your gut microbiome with fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds and minimally-processed whole grains,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi can also help the microbiome, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_science_strawberry-full-moon-june-scn", "text": "Despite its name, June\u2019s full moon will not look like a strawberry. But the bright orb could still turn heads Friday night with an appearance that is bigger and more colorful than the average moon. The full moon \u2014 which will reach the crest of its fullness\u00a0at 9:08\u00a0p.m. ET Friday\u00a0\u2014 comes one day after the\u00a0summer solstice, the day of the year when the sun appears the highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. Since a full moon is opposite the sun, this strawberry moon will shine lower in the sky than usual, according to\u00a0NASA. Because of this \u201clower than average path across the sky,\u201d the full moon could have an \u201corange- or amber-colored appearance, for the same reason sunsets appear orange or reddish,\u201d said Preston Dyches, a science communicator with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. Dyches said the effect is the result of the moon\u2019s reflected light having to travel a longer distance throughout Earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering away most blue wavelengths (which are shorter than red wavelengths). Native American tribes across North America gave the strawberry moon its name to mark the in-season ripeness of strawberries, according to\u00a0The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The moon\u2019s low placement in the sky could also cause the orb to appear bigger than usual, according to\u00a0NASA,\u00a0due to an effect dubbed the moon illusion. Scientists don\u2019t really know why this optical illusion happens, but it\u2019s believed to be a combination of how our brain processes visual information and the moon\u2019s size in comparison with smaller objects near the horizon, such as trees or the roofs of houses. For optimal viewing, Dyches recommends looking when the moon is rising or setting to see the effects of the moon illusion. No equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features, according to\u00a0NASA\u2019s Moon Viewing Guide. \u201cWhenever something beautiful about the natural world can be experienced from your doorstep, it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time,\u201d Dyches said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to marvel at the sight of another giant world. \u2026 I like to gaze up and think of it as a place people will live and work someday.\u201d How to see the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019 in the night sky Because the moon appears full for three days a month surrounding its peak, the strawberry moon will be visible to almost everyone worldwide. However, it will be more difficult to observe for those farther north, such as in Alaska or Denmark, where the low-traversing moon will only briefly rise above the horizon, Dyches said. Besides the full moon, those in the Northern Hemisphere can spot the \u201cSummer Triangle,\u201d an arrangement of three bright stars whose presence in the sky symbolizes summertime in the north, said Dyches, who also produces the space agency\u2019s monthly sky-watching highlights video called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up.\u201d To find the triangular pattern, it is easiest to look for the brightest of the three stars, Vega, which will be near the east in the sky, according to EarthSky. The second brightest, Altair, will be to the lower right, and the star Deneb, to the lower left of Vega, will finish off the sides of the triangle. Those away from bright city lights can spot the center of the Milky Way as a \u201chazy band of dim clouds arching across the sky,\u201d and the constellation Scorpius can be seen as it \u201cpoints the way to the galaxy\u2019s core,\u201d Dyches added. Remaining moons of 2024 There are six more full moons set to shine bright in the sky this year,\u00a0according to EarthSky. Here are the remaining full moons of 2024 and their peak dates: July 21: Buck moon August 19: Sturgeon moon September 17: Harvest moon October 17: Hunter\u2019s moon November 15: Beaver moon December 15: Cold moon", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/science/strawberry-full-moon-june-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_fda-gene-therapy-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration has given the green light for the first gene therapy that treats a rare form of muscular dystrophy to be used in most people who have the disease and a certain genetic mutation. Last year, the drug \u2013 Elevidys, from the biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics \u2013 was approved to treat only children ages 4 and 5 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, one of the most severe forms of inherited muscular dystrophies, who have a confirmed mutation in a gene called DMD that is associated with muscle strength. The FDA announced Thursday that it had given traditional approval for Elevidys for ambulatory people 4 and older with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene and accelerated approval for non-ambulatory people 4 and older with this mutation. There\u2019s not enough data on safety to support its use in children under 4, the agency says. Elevidys, given as a one-time intravenous infusion, costs about $3.2 million per patient, making it among the most expensive drugs in the world. Although eye-popping, such a\u00a0price tag\u00a0isn\u2019t out of step with other one-time gene therapies, which have topped\u00a0$3 million to 4 million\u00a0per patient in recent years. Elevidys was previously approved under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval pathway, which clears medicines for diseases where they\u2019re urgently needed based on data suggesting that they\u2019re likely to confer clinical benefits. The drug has been closely monitored since that approval, and in October, Sarepta Therapeutics released results from a confirmatory trial showing that the therapy missed its primary goal \u2013 a measure of how well kids can move \u2013 but was successful on a number of secondary measures. The approval addressed \u201can urgent unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a devastating condition with limited treatment options, that leads to a progressive deterioration of an individual\u2019s health over time,\u201d Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a news release at the time. It was the first time a therapy of this nature \u2013 a one-time treatment that delivers a working copy of a gene to make up for one that leads to disease \u2013 had been cleared under the accelerated approval framework. The move came after emotional\u00a0testimonials\u00a0from families at an FDA advisory committee meeting. Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes progressive muscle weakness that can rob children of their ability to walk by the time they\u2019re teenagers, and many don\u2019t live well into their 30s. It primarily affects boys because of the way it\u2019s inherited, affecting an estimated 1 in 3,300 boys. The Muscular Dystrophy Association trusts the decision of the FDA, which weighs the risks and benefits of the drug, said Dr. Sharon Hesterlee, chief researcher at the association. \u201cUltimately, what we want is what\u2019s best for our patient community \u2013 and that\u2019s balancing that risk-benefit ratio appropriately,\u201d she said. Potential risks of Elevidys include increases in certain liver enzyme levels and acute serious liver injury. The most common side effects of the drug include vomiting, nausea, increased liver function tests and fever. Yet a major benefit is that the gene therapy provides another option for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and it\u2019s administered just once. There is no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and outside of Elevidys, treatments are limited. Other\u00a0approaches\u00a0may include steroid medications,\u00a0certain\u00a0drugs that change how the muscle cells \u201cread\u201d the mutated gene, physical therapy or surgery to correct spinal curvature, Hesterlee said. \u201cRight now, the\u00a0main\u00a0standard of care for Duchenne is corticosteroids, like prednisone,\u00a0although there are some newer drugs available. These kids are\u00a0still\u00a0often on chronic doses of\u00a0steroids\u00a0for many, many years,\u201d she said, adding that the side effects of corticosteroids \u2013 such as weight gain, behavioral issues and increased risk of bone breakage \u2013 are not ideal. Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be difficult to treat, she said, and having more treatment options that are proven to be effective remains important. \u201cMuscle makes up a significant amount of your body mass. So when you have a disease like this, it\u2019s really impacting a lot of tissue. So anything you do, you\u2019re looking at trying to bring back or stop a disease process that\u2019s really throughout the body, and it\u2019s a disease that\u2019s progressive, so you lose more and more muscle over time,\u201d Hesterlee said. \u201cThat\u2019s made it pretty challenging, but we\u2019ve certainly learned a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t overlook the fact that these boys are living so much longer and doing so much better. Even 20 years ago, they were dying in their teens, and many of them are now living into their 30s. They\u2019re going to college; they have girlfriends; some of them have gotten married. These are things that weren\u2019t happening years ago. So we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/fda-gene-therapy-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_health_hiking-heat-safety-wellness", "text": "With summer officially here, many people are excited to go hiking along their favorite local trails or tackle an out-of-town bucket-list hike. But before you grab your backpack and race out the door, hiking and safety officials urge caution. Temperatures are already soaring in many parts of the nation and around the world, and high heat has the potential to make any hike risky \u2014 and even deadly. Earlier in June, a young couple was rescued on a hiking trail in the California desert after running out of water and becoming dehydrated. The boyfriend was conscious during the rescue, but the girlfriend appeared unconscious, and medical officials referred to her \u201csevere condition,\u201d according to KTLA in Los Angeles. Others have not been as fortunate. Last year, a 14-year-old boy died while hiking with two family members in Texas\u2019 Big Bend National Park. The temperature was 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius). In 2021, a couple, their 1-year-old child and their dog all died in California while hiking in Devil\u2019s Gulch Valley on an extremely hot day. Experts said they likely perished from hyperthermia (an abnormally high body temperature) and dehydration. In Phoenix, where more than 200 hikers are rescued every year \u2014 mostly due to hiking during the hottest part of the day \u2014 the city instituted a program to close certain trails when the heat reaches excessive levels. How to tackle hiking in the heat Despite these heat-related dangers, it\u2019s possible to hit the trails safely when temperatures soar. Here\u2019s how to do so, according to experts. Prepare for a hot hike ahead of time Whether it\u2019s hot or cool, you should be in reasonable shape before tackling any hike. If you\u2019re planning a hilly, 5-mile trek, for example, make sure you\u2019re able to hike 5 challenging miles before arriving at the trailhead. To prepare for heat, become acclimatized to hot weather. You can do so by taking short, easy hikes in warm weather, progressing up to longer, more difficult hikes in hot weather. If that\u2019s not possible and you\u2019re traveling to a hot locale for your hike, schedule the trek several days into the trip when your body will be more accustomed to the weather. It\u2019s also good to know your sweat rate, said Dr. Floris Wardenaar, an assistant professor of nutrition\u00a0at Arizona State University in Phoenix. Wardenaar, who studies the physiological aspect of hiking, recommended weighing yourself before and after several hikes, then comparing any weight loss with the amount of water you consumed during the hike. \u201cBody mass loss is a good proxy marker of sweat loss,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lose more than 2% of your body weight on a hike.\u201d If you\u2019re losing more weight than that, you should be drinking more fluids. Load up on water and carry a water filter Water is essential for any hike, no matter the season \u2014 but it\u2019s critical in hot weather. Unfortunately, many people underestimate the amount of water they\u2019ll need. \u201cAlways hike with a water treatment device, too, and carry electrolytes,\u201d Martinez said. Electrolyte tablets or drinks help replace the salts and minerals lost through sweat, which assists in preventing heat-related ailments such as heatstroke and heat exhaustion. \u201cBring extra water, even if it\u2019s heavy,\u201d said Teresa Ana Martinez, executive director and cofounder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition. The Continental Divide Trail stretches 3,100 miles (4,989 kilometers) from Mexico to Canada, including some 800 miles (1,287.5\u00a0kilometers) in New Mexico, where there\u2019s plenty of desert terrain. Hike in the morning, preferably on shady trails \u201cThe benefit of hiking earlier in the day versus later in the evening is that in the evening, the earth still holds heat from the day,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cIt will radiate from the rocks, too.\u201d If possible, select a trail that winds through shady woods, along water or even in a cool canyon or cave. This way, should you struggle with the heat, you can find shade and water for cooling off. Wear light, loose clothing that covers most of your skin A long-sleeve shirt and pants might seem counterintuitive on a hot day, but they\u2019ll prevent sunburn and stop your skin and body from heating up. A neck buff and hiking gloves are also a good idea, said Abe Christian, operations manager for the Florida Trail Association. The Florida Trail meanders more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) through the state, from Big Cypress Swamp on the southern tip of the peninsula to Fort Pickens in the panhandle. \u201cThere are plenty of places on the Florida Trail where the sun can beat you to death,\u201d Christian said. \u201cSo you need to cover your skin as best as possible.\u201d The buff can also double as a compress should the heat get to you. Just dip it in water and place on your head and neck. Take along a sun umbrella, phone \u2014 and a buddy Make sure you have a fully charged phone in case you need to call for help. A portable battery is helpful, too. Martinez swears by a sun umbrella, which keeps the sun\u2019s rays from heating your head. (Look for those with an ultraviolent protection factor, or UPF, label or a seal of recommendation from groups such as the Skin Cancer Foundation.) If possible, bring along a friend. Sometimes when you\u2019re experiencing dehydration, heat exhaustion or heatstroke, you\u2019re not thinking clearly and don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in danger. When in doubt, turn around \u201cIf you start your hike and think it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too hot,\u201d Martinez said. Just turn around and come back another day, she said. Another tip: Turn around when half of your water is gone, even if you haven\u2019t reached your goal. \u201cYour ego is your worst enemy,\u201d Martinez warned. \u201cPeople underestimate how quickly things can escalate. You don\u2019t know when your body will say, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/health/hiking-heat-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_bird-flu-risk-opinion-frieden", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, is president and chief executive of\u00a0Resolve to Save Lives\u00a0and senior fellow for global health at the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations. The United States\u2019 response to H5N1 \u2013 \u201cbird flu\u201d \u2013 has taken too long, showing how risky gaps in coordination and trust can be. With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters in cattle herds from Michigan to Texas, Idaho to North Carolina, it\u2019s clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right. We\u2019ve seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Although the challenge was smaller because of it size, Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, among a half dozen outbreaks that never made headlines, is featured in our new\u00a0Epidemics That Didn\u2019t Happen\u00a0report. The U.S. has done a lot, including scaling up test production, evaluating vaccines, tracking wastewater for related viruses, and providing information about efforts. Finland did three things particularly well; all are relevant to the U.S. response to the virus. Rapid response.\u00a0Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was known to be circulating among birds in Finland, just at the virus has been circulating among birds in the U.S. for the past two years. Human and animal health specialists worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk workers on farms with infected animals. In the United States, H5N1 has been spreading among cattle since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn\u2019t know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The\u00a07-1-7 target for outbreak detection\u00a0and response should be our guiding principle: seven days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, one day to notify public health authorities, and seven days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland\u2019s response met this target. In the U.S., instead of 7 days, the time from emergence of H5N1 in cattle to detection was more like 100 days, and it\u2019s not clear we\u2019ve met the 7-day target for initial response even months into the outbreak. Doing so requires communication and public health measures in the affected communities and an effective coordination mechanism. We must improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health. Trust.\u00a0Farmers already had a high level of trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs, and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals.\u00a0Farmers were immediately reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust of the government in the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland\u2019s\u00a0next move: vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so. Trust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are on the front line of these outbreaks.\u00a0In May, the US Department of Agriculture announced\u00a0payments to farms\u00a0to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including\u00a0covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1,\u00a0compensating farms that\u00a0supply personal protective equipment to their workers, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies.\u00a0We may need to do more to protect our nation\u2019s agricultural sector. Coordinated government response.\u00a0Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. The joint response strengthened detection, collaboration of industry groups, and protection of workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure it had the authority to implement effective control measures. In the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. There are multiple agencies involved: USDA monitors cattle health, US Food and Drug Administration monitors milk safety and the CDC monitors diseases in humans, including from animal exposure. Coordination seems to be improving, but any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country\u2019s size and diversity. We have a lot to learn, and no time to lose.\u00a0First, localities,\u00a0states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies \u2013 including CDC, USDA, FDA \u2013 and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public.\u00a0Second,\u00a0Congress needs to provide resources to prevent and respond to pandemic risks, including for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we\u2019re prepared to stop new events before they become epidemics. Third and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing their questions and concerns. If one country responds to H5N1 well, that\u2019s not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country \u2013 including the United States \u2013 needs an effective response.

{"id": "2024_06_20_health_obesity-genetic-wellness", "text": "Obesity isn\u2019t just a matter of food and exercise \u2014 it may be in your genetic code, according to new research. \u201cObesity\u2019s causes are very complex and in the majority of cases, the combination of many factors. In this study, however, we found a clear genetic trigger for obesity,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Mattia Frontini, British Heart Foundation senior fellow and an associate professor in cellular biology at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, in an email. Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that follows people long term, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Med. They compared data from people with two faulty copies of a particular gene (SMIM1) and those who did not have the two faulty copies. Women with the gene mutation weighed an extra 4.6 kilograms (10.14 pounds), and men with the variant weighed an extra 2.4 kilograms (5.29 pounds), according to the study. The faulty copies of the SMIM1 gene cause decreased function in the thyroid and declining energy expenditure, Frontini said, \u201cwhich means that given the same food intake, less energy is used and this excess is stored as fat.\u201d Not only is the correlation significant, but this study also identifies a specific gene mutation, which isn\u2019t always the case in research, said Dr. Philipp Scherer, director of the Touchstone Diabetes Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. He was not involved in the study. \u201cIt is an exciting study in that it puts a new gene on the map,\u201d Scherer said. \u201cIt\u2019s an actual gene, rather than just a genomic locus with a mutation somewhere where we don\u2019t understand. \u2026 We think we\u2019re looking at a gene here that we can further study.\u201d This genetic finding is \u2018pretty rare\u2019 This particular genetic finding doesn\u2019t apply to a large population of people with obesity \u2014 only about 1 in 5,000 people have this genetic makeup, Frontini said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty rare, but you multiply that to a population of 10 (million), 15 million and there\u2019s quite a few people out there that would walk around with that mutation and maybe weren\u2019t fully aware of the fact that there is a genetic explanation for their struggle with obesity,\u201d Scherer said. Dysfunction in the thyroid is common, affecting almost 2% of the population in the UK, Frontini said. And thyroid dysfunction is treated regularly with a relatively inexpensive medication, Frontini said. The next step in the research is to find out if people with the SMIM1 mutation qualify to treat their thyroid with medication, he added. \u201cIf they do, we plan to run a randomized clinical trial to determine if they would benefit from the treatment,\u201d Frontini said. \u201cThe hope is that they will, and we can improve their quality of life using a cheap, safe treatment.\u201d The best approach in the meantime Weight isn\u2019t just a matter of willpower or laziness. The size and shape of your body is determined by many factors \u2014 some of which you have control over and others you don\u2019t, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Among these factors are lifestyle habits, the amount of sleep you get, medications, health problems, where you live and work, and genetics, according to the institute. Research into genetic factors and potential treatments is still underway, but Scherer said the current best approach to medical treatment of obesity is GLP-1 medications. Severe restrictive dieting is not the answer, Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and author of \u201cThe Diet Detox: Why Your Diet Is Making You Fat and What to Do About It,\u201d said in an earlier CNN article. Demonizing foods too much may make you crave them more, and then the guilt you feel when you give in can lead to a cycle of fluctuating between restricting yourself and bingeing, she added. If you want to make changes to your lifestyle, it\u2019s best to try a gradual, sustainable approach while maintaining a healthy relationship with food, Emily Feig, a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in the same CNN report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/obesity-genetic-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_resistance-training-older-adults-wellness", "text": "Retirement should be filled with time with loved ones, relaxation and\u2014according to new research\u2014heavy lifting. As people get older, their skeletal muscle function declines, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine. \u201cIf you do resistance training at this age, benefits in some parameters may last several years,\u201d said lead study author \ufeffMads Bloch-Ibenfeldt, a doctoral student at the Institute of Sports Medicine at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. To investigate whether resistance exercise programs could be helpful in the long term, researchers performed a randomized control trial with 369 recently retired and healthy adults who were between 64 and 75 years old. The participants were assigned one of three exercise programs for a year. They either lifted weights three times a week, did moderate-intensity training using their body weight and resistance bands three times a week, or did not change their usual exercise routines, the study said. Researchers measured their bone and muscle strength as well as body fat levels at the start of the trial at the end of the one-year program and then two and four years later, according to the study. It was up to the individuals whether they continued their strength training regimen or went back to their normal exercise level, Resistance training with heavy loads yielded the greatest long-lasting benefit in leg strength, the study showed. Even four years after the training, their leg strength was unaltered, whereas the moderate-intensity group did see a decrease \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t significant, the study showed. \u201cExercise is critically important across the life span. This study does show that even in those engaging in activity later in life around retirement can lead to marked benefits to one\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the School of Medicine (Geriatric Medicine) and in the Gillings School of Global Public Health (Nutrition). He was not involved in the research. What counts as resistance training? The umbrella of exercise includes aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance activities, Batsis said. \u201cEach of these have important consequences if one regularly performs them or does not on overall health (including cognition) and physical function,\u201d Batsis\ufeff said in an email. You can think of resistance training as \u201cexercises that improve strength by making muscles work against a force,\u201d said CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a mind-body coach for professional athletes. That force can include weights, resistance bands or your own body weight\u2014like with pushups or squats, she added. \u201cFor older adults, resistance training is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, and mobility,\u201d she said. According to the recent study, adding heavier weight seems to be important, Bloch-Ibenfeldt said. What you can do at home One limitation of the exercise proposed in the recent study is that the weighted exercises were done at a gym, which is something not everyone has the time, money or transportation to do, Batsis said. While you should consult a certified trainer or physical therapist to ensure\ufeff you are exercising safely, there are things you can do from home, Santas said. For older adults, it is important to strengthen in ways that are important to functional movements of everyday living, she added. Santas recommends box squats, where you sit lightly on a chair seat and stand back up. If you don\u2019t need to hold the arms of the chair for support, add some dumbbells, Santas said. The added weight gives \u201cadditional resistance while also improving\u00a0grip strength, which is essential for functional independence and serves as (a) marker for heart health,\u201d she added. You can also increase strength in functional movements, protect your knee joints and prevent injury by placing a resistance band around both of your legs and doing side steps,\u00a0side lunging\u00a0or\u00a0reverse lunging, she said. Try to do two or three sets of eight to 12 of each activity at least a couple of times a week, Santas said. Regular maintenance of exercise and other health factors are important for independence later in life, Batsis said. \u201cThe basics of lifestyle changes, including nutrition and exercise are a major key to healthy aging,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/resistance-training-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}

Capturing the moment was an unforgettable experience and one that I had thought would involve expensive travel to the northernmost reaches of our planet. The storms that create spectacular auroras such as those I witnessed originate from the sun\u2019s dynamic magnetic field, an astrophysical enigma that scientists this week came closer to unraveling. Solar update Figuring out how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works will help scientists improve the forecasting of space weather, which dazzles night sky watchers but can disrupt GPS and communication satellites. The sun\u2019s looping magnetic field lines, which form a tangled web of structures more complex than those on Earth, are difficult to study directly. To grasp what\u2019s going on, scientists create mathematical models. A new model, which took more than a decade to develop and required a NASA supercomputer to conduct the detailed calculations, found that the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated much closer to the surface than previously thought. The team believes its model is more accurate because it accounts for a unique solar feature. A long time ago A single gold earring found in the ruins of a 2,000-year-old building in the Pyrenees is a clue to how a devastating fire may have started. The inferno consumed the wooden structure, situated in an Iron Age settlement called Tossal de Baltarga, and killed six animals penned in a stable. Archaeologists believe the fire was deliberate. Had it been accidental, the building\u2019s owners likely would have released the livestock and returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden gold, which was concealed in a jar. The arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic, according to the new study. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but the excavation uncovered telling details of the lives of an Iberian people called the Cerretani. Sky watch The builders of Stonehenge placed the huge stones that make up the prehistoric monument in line with sunrise and sunset on the longest and shortest days of the year, revealing an intimate understanding of the sun that\u2019s still palpable today. But does the 4,500-year-old site in southwest England \u2014 and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world \u2014 also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge has a lunar link first gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored \u2014 until now. This summer, archaeologists are using the lunar standstill, a little-known phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years, to investigate. Across the universe Space scientists have observed the edge of a black hole \u2014 an area known as the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 for the first time. Andrew Mummery, lead author of a new study on black holes and a research fellow at the University of Oxford, compared it to \u201cthe edge of a waterfall\u201d at the end of a river, where orbiting material from nearby stars plummets into the abyss. In the plunging region, matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead hurtles into the black hole. But unlike at the black hole\u2019s event horizon, or surface, light can still escape at this point. The study\u2019s findings, which Albert Einstein predicted, could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes. Wild kingdom Corvids \u2014 the group of birds that includes crows, ravens and jays \u2014 are famously smart. One corvid species may even be capable of something researchers refer to as \u201cmental time travel.\u201d This type of recollection enables the mind to recall a seemingly unimportant bit of information that you didn\u2019t consciously commit to memory \u2014 for instance, remembering what you had for lunch yesterday. Researchers working with Eurasian jays trained to find food hidden under cups said these birds may be capable of the feat of memory. In the experiment, which involved decorated cups, the jays were able to remember what a particular cup looked like, even after the cups were rearranged and a time delay. And in other corvid news, crows can count up to four, the latest research has found.

{"id": "2024_06_19_health_microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness", "text": "Scientists have found microplastics in human penises for the first time, as concerns over the tiny particles\u2019 proliferation and potential health effects mount. Seven different kinds of microplastics were found in four out of five samples of penis tissue taken from five different men as part of a study published in IJIR: Your Sexual Medicine Journal on Wednesday. Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. They form when larger plastics break down,\u00a0either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. Some minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, and evidence is mounting that they are increasingly present in our bodies. Study lead author Ranjith Ramasamy, an expert in reproductive urology who conducted the research while working at the University of Miami, told CNN that he used a previous study that found evidence of microplastics in the human heart as a basis for his research. Ramasamy said he wasn\u2019t surprised to find microplastics in the penis, as it is a \u201cvery vascular organ,\u201d like the heart. The samples were taken from study participants who had been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction (ED) and were in the hospital to undergo surgery for penile implants to treat the condition at the University of Miami between August and September 2023. The samples were then analyzed using chemical imaging, which revealed that four of the five men had microplastics in their penile tissue. Seven different types of microplastics were detected, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) the most prevalent, according to the study.  Now their presence has been confirmed, more research is needed to investigate potential links to conditions such as ED, Ramasamy said. \u201cWe need to identify whether microplastics are linked to ED and if there is a level beyond which it causes pathology and what types of microplastics are pathologic,\u201d he said. As for the wider implications of the findings, Ramasamy said he hoped the study would \u201ccreate more awareness about the presence of foreign bodies within human organs and foster more research surrounding this topic.\u201d Prior research has found that one liter of bottled water \u2014 the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters \u2014 contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles. \u201cI think we need to be mindful about consuming water and food from plastic bottles and containers and try and limit the use until more research is done to identify levels that could cause pathology,\u201d Ramasamy said. Toxicologist Matthew J. Campen told CNN that this is \u201can interesting study that confirms the ubiquity of plastics in the body.\u201d \u201cAs we are trying to understand the potential health effects of plastics, this is another concerning paper,\u201d said Campen,\u00a0a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cPlastics are generally non-reactive with the cells and chemicals of our bodies, but they could be physically disruptive to the many processes our bodies undertake for normal function, including functions related to erection and sperm production.\u201d Campen coauthored a study published in May that found that human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas. The study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers of males who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said at the time the study was published. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d There are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to microplastics. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Looking back, Tammy Maida, 67, said things started to change in her late 50s. At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}

Drinking a glass of\u00a0strong liquor\u00a0every day.\u00a0Bacon\u00a0for breakfast every morning.\u00a0Wine and chocolate. While a popular news story, this is a relatively meaningless question that doesn\u2019t help us understand why certain people have lived so long. Let me try to explain why, via beautiful buildings, fighter pilots and statistics. READ MORE: Why hypochondriacs die earlier than those who worry less about their health In the second world war, Allied statisticians were applying their skills to minimising the number of bombers being shot down by enemy fire. By studying the damage patterns of bombers returning from action, maps could be drawn up of the most frequently damaged parts of aeroplanes so that expensive, heavy armour could be added to these areas. Simple enough, right? Then, along comes statistician Abraham Wald who argues for the exact\u00a0opposite point. The planes that they\u2019re studying are all those that did return from combat with extensive damage, but what about those that didn\u2019t return? Wald argues that armour should be added to those places that are undamaged on all the returning planes, as any plane hit in these undamaged areas was shot down, never making it back to be surveyed. READ MORE: What the world\u2019s oldest dog can tell us about aging Survivorship bias This phenomenon is known as survivorship bias, or the cognitive and statistical bias introduced by only counting those that are around to count but ignoring those that haven\u2019t \u201csurvived.\u201d You can take these examples to the absurd. Imagine a group of 100 people, all of whom have smoked their entire life. As a group, the smokers would die earlier of cancers, lung disease or heart disease, but one or two might defy the odds and live to 100 years of age. Now imagine the intrepid journalist interviewing the lucky soul on their 100th birthday with that classic question: \u201cWhat do you attribute your successful ageing to?\u201d \u201cSmoking a pack a day,\u201d says the newly minted centenarian. It seems obvious but survivorship bias is everywhere in society. We can all think of that one famous actor or entrepreneur who succeeded despite adversity, who worked hard, believed in themselves and one day made it. But we never read about or hear about the countless examples of people who tried, gave it their all and never quite made it. READ MORE: Are you a rapid ager?\u00a0 That\u2019s not a good media story. But this creates a bias, we primarily hear the successes, never the failures. This bias applies to our perceptions of architecture (mostly great buildings from a given period \u201csurvive\u201d), to finances (we often hear examples of people who have succeeded in risky investments, those who fail don\u2019t sell books or self-help plans) and to career plans (\u201cIf you work hard, and drop out of college now, you can be a successful athlete like me,\u201d say those who have succeeded). I work with a variety of older people and often include extreme outliers who have lived to extreme ages. We\u2019re currently studying over 65-year-olds who have maintained unusually high levels of exercise into older age and have maintained excellent health. They\u2019re phenomenal examples of older humans, many of them are faster, fitter and stronger than me by many of the measures we perform in the lab, despite being almost twice my age. READ MORE: Why married people live longer\u00a0 While we know that their lifelong exercise is associated with their unusually good health into older age, we can\u2019t directly say one causes the other yet. It could be that highly active people are protected against chronic diseases such as cancers, diabetes and heart disease. But it also could be that these people are still active into older age as they\u2019ve not been afflicted by cancers, diabetes or heart disease earlier in their lives. Conversely, there could be some unknown third factor that we\u2019ve not yet identified about these people that both keeps them healthy and separately keeps them exercising. For clarity, there are things that scientists like me will say in carefully caveated, scientific language that will probably help you to live longer. Being very physically active, not eating too much and not smoking are all on that list, along with generally having a positive outlook in life, and of course, picking the right parents and grandparents. Correlation does not equal causation. That point is hammered home relentlessly to students in science degrees.

{"id": "2024_06_24_health_study-infant-mortality-texas-invs", "text": "A new study has drawn\u00a0a possible\u00a0link between rising infant mortality in Texas and the state\u2019s abortion restrictions, which, when they took effect in 2021, were the strictest in the nation. The\u00a0study, published today in JAMA Pediatrics \u2013 a publication\u00a0of\u00a0the Journal of the American Medical Association \u2013 cited an\u00a0investigative report\u00a0by CNN last year that revealed a sudden spike in infant deaths in the wake of the law\u2019s passage. \u201cA report from the media found an increase in infant deaths in Texas between 2021 and 2022, suggesting that Texas\u2019 abortion policy could be responsible,\u201d according to the study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Michigan State University. \u201cHowever, to our knowledge, no studies have conducted a systematic evaluation of infant mortality after the passage of Texas\u2019 (law).\u201d The authors say their study is the first attempt to do so, and their conclusions echo the findings of CNN\u2019s story. In\u00a0September\u00a02021, Texas banned nearly all abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy. When the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother. The study looks at the effects of the\u00a02021\u00a0law, called Senate Bill 8, which made no exceptions for rape or incest, forcing women to carry a pregnancy to term even under traumatic circumstances. It also made no exceptions for congenital anomalies, also known as birth defects. The only exception that allowed for an abortion to be obtained after six weeks was \u201cif a physician believes that a medical emergency exists,\u201d according to the language of the bill. The new JAMA Pediatrics study found that, between 2021 and 2022, infant deaths in Texas surged 12.9%, compared with a much smaller increase\u00a0in the rest of the US\u00a0of 1.8%. It also found a significant jump in the rate of infant mortality in Texas \u2013 or the number of deaths per thousand live births \u2013 relative to\u00a0the rest of the country, suggesting that the increase in the number of infant deaths was not solely the byproduct of a rise in births. In that same time period, infant mortality rates rose 8.3% in Texas, compared with an increase of 2.2% in the rest of the nation. The neonatal mortality rate \u2013 or the death rates of babies younger than 28 days \u2013 also increased in Texas by 5.8% but decreased in the rest of the US, the study found. \u201cThis study provides some of the first empirical evidence on the association of restrictive abortion policies with infant deaths by using population-based data and a rigorous causal inference technique,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAlthough replication and further analyses are needed to understand the mechanisms behind these findings, our results indicate that restrictive abortion policies may have important unintended consequences in terms of trauma to families and medical cost.\u201d The study \u2013 whose lead author, Dr. Alison Gemmill, is a demographer and perinatal epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University \u2013\u00a0was published alongside a critique\u00a0of the Texas law by three unaffiliated medical experts in an editorial. \u201cIn the coming years, as more people continue to be harmed by abortion bans across the country, we anticipate that more research will illuminate what Texans already know to be true: abortion bans harm everyone,\u201d wrote Ghazaleh Moayedi and Aketch Osamba, both of the  Pegasus Health Justice Center in Dallas, and Atsuko Koyama, of the University of Arizona, in the editorial. \u201cFuture scholarship should focus on best practices and implementation strategies for collective action against and resistance to the increasing trend of extremist ideologies influencing the practice of medicine,\u201d the authors wrote. The study also found that\u00a0the number of\u00a0congenital anomalies increased in Texas\u00a0from 2021 to 2022\u00a0but not\u00a0in\u00a0the rest of the US. The authors based their study on publicly available death-certificate data and looked at infant and neonatal deaths across the country from January 2018 to December 2022.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/study-infant-mortality-texas-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_us_roe-v-wade-overturned-2-years", "text": "Two years ago, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion and setting off a fierce fight for reproductive rights at the state level. Abortion has emerged as a key issue in the 2024 election, and as access narrows\u00a0in many states, reproductive freedom advocates are working to get measures preserving reproductive rights on the November ballot to let voters weigh in. Abortion rates reach a decade-long high in the US Two years after Roe v. Wade was overturned,\u00a014 states have total or near-total bans\u00a0on abortion, including Alabama, Texas, Idaho and Tennessee. Despite\u00a0an increase in\u00a0restrictive policies,\u00a0the number and rate of\u00a0abortions\u00a0in 2023 hit their highest point in over a decade, according to\u00a0a report from\u00a0the\u00a0Guttmacher Institute, a\u00a0research and policy non-profit that advocates for sexual and reproductive health rights. The organization estimates\u00a0there were more than 1 million abortions in the\u00a0formal\u00a0US\u00a0healthcare system\u00a0last year, a\u00a011% increase from 2020. States without\u00a0total\u00a0abortion bans saw a\u00a026% increase from 2020, according to the report. The loss of\u00a0abortion\u00a0access in states with bans, the authors noted, was countered by\u00a0\u201cefforts on the part of clinics, abortion funds and logistical support organizations to help people\u2026access care.\u201d Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in 2023, about 642,700, were medication abortions \u2013 not including self-managed medication abortions outside of the healthcare setting, the report says. The authors note a steady increase since 2001, when medication abortions\u00a0accounted for less than 10% of all procedures. Over the years, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed some of the restrictions for use of the abortion pill, and access to the medication increased. In 2016, the agency deemed the abortion pill safe to use up to 10 weeks into pregnancy, rather than seven, and expanded the pool of providers who could prescribe it. After the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA allowed for the pill to be dispensed by certified pharmacies and through the mail, rather than just in healthcare settings. States implement increasingly restrictive abortion policies Abortion policies have changed rapidly\u00a0in many\u00a0states since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0to overturn Roe. Four states, California, Michigan, Vermont and Ohio, have since\u00a0enshrined rights to reproductive freedom in their constitutions, while lawmakers in\u00a0New York\u00a0and other states implemented policies to protect abortion patients and providers. More than a dozen states passed\u00a0abortion \u201ctrigger\u00a0laws\u201d ahead of\u00a0the court\u2019s decision,\u00a0meant to take effect almost immediately in the event that Roe was overturned,\u00a0and at least seven\u00a0states without trigger laws have followed suit with restrictive reproductive health policies that critics say put patients in danger and leave providers at risk of civil and criminal liability. Patients and providers have struggled to navigate a patchwork of sometimes hastily implemented abortion policies that include\u00a0mandatory waiting periods\u00a0to obtain an abortion in states\u00a0including\u00a0Arizona and Georgia, limits on\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0for abortion, in states including South Dakota, and vague language around\u00a0medical emergency exceptions\u00a0to abortion bans in states including Texas. Lower courts have been asked to take abortion issues up in multiple legal challenges across states. These policies have already had real-world\u00a0effects. For example,\u00a0one woman in Texas\u00a0sued the state to access an abortion for a pregnancy that was threatening her future fertility. Another Texas woman was\u00a0unlawfully charged\u00a0with murder for\u00a0using abortion medication to self-induce an abortion and spent two nights in jail before the charges were dropped.\u00a0Providers say\u00a0that patients in states with abortion bans have been forced to carry pregnancies against their will, leading to compromised fertility and other life-threatening consequences. Last month, Florida replaced its 15-week abortion ban with a\u00a0six-week ban, which falls before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. The move was a major blow to reproductive access in the South, where Florida was a critical access point for people seeking abortions. Providers\u00a0and advocates\u00a0say the restrictive policies have created a\u00a0reproductive care\u00a0\u201cdesert\u201d in the region. Patients cross state lines to access reproductive care More than 171,000 patients travelled for an abortion in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Many people who traveled to obtain abortions before Roe was overturned were going to states that now have total abortion bans, meaning people are now traveling farther distances \u2013 sometimes crossing multiple state lines \u2013 to access care, the\u00a0organization noted recently. In just the first half of 2023,\u00a0nearly 1 in 5 people\u00a0who had an abortion \u00ad\u2013\u00a0more than 92,000 people \u2013 traveled across state lines for abortion care, according to a\u00a0December\u00a02023\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the\u00a0institute. As the abortion care landscape becomes more and more restrictive, Alexandra Mandado, president of Planned Parenthood in South, East and North Florida,\u00a0says that remaining abortion clinics\u00a0will struggle to absorb the increase in out-of-state patients. Supreme Court takes up other high profile reproductive rights cases The Supreme Court recently\u00a0rejected a challenge\u00a0to access\u00a0to the abortion pill, mifepristone, maintaining widespread access to medication abortion in a ruling that will allow for continued mailing of the pills\u00a0to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. Experts say abortion pill access could face additional legal challenges in the future. The court is considering another case this summer dealing with\u00a0medical emergency exceptions\u00a0to abortion bans. In the case, the Biden administration sued the state of Idaho,\u00a0where exemptions to its abortion ban are limited to life-threatening situations,\u00a0arguing that federal law requires hospitals receiving Medicare funding to provide stabilizing care, including abortions, when a pregnant person\u2019s health is\u00a0in danger. Access to other reproductive care services is challenged In February,\u00a0the\u00a0Alabama Supreme Court\u00a0ruled that frozen embryos are considered human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death, causing fertility clinics throughout the state to pause in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments out of fear of legal prosecution. As families across the state lost access to IVF treatments, lawmakers scrambled to meet the widespread demand for a fix. In March,\u00a0the state passed a law\u00a0aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from the legal liability imposed on them by the state court\u2019s ruling. While some services resumed,\u00a0at least one\u00a0of the state\u2019s limited pool of IVF providers says it will halt services altogether\u00a0by the end of the year, citing litigation concerns. Experts have\u00a0expressed concern\u00a0that other reproductive care services, like contraception, are also on the line amid a swell of misinformation that some say is sown intentionally to create panic,\u00a0like lawmakers conflating emergency contraception\u00a0with abortion, for example. Advocates work to get abortion on state ballots in November Most abortion policies implemented after the Supreme Court overturned Roe were directly triggered by that decision or handed down by lawmakers or state courts. In an effort to\u00a0restore the issue of reproductive health access, organizers across the country have been working to get measures to enshrine reproductive health rights in state constitutions\u00a0on ballots in November. Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota have secured the measures on their state ballots, with New York and Nevada likely to follow suit. Organizers in at least seven other states are working to do the same. In addition to making it more difficult to challenge access to abortion services, organizers hope that the measures will allow voters to\u00a0send a message to politicians about what they want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/us/roe-v-wade-overturned-2-years/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_fauci-memoir-gupta-interview", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards wear you down.\u201d That phrase, instilled in Dr. Anthony Fauci when he was a student at the Jesuit-run Regis High School in New York City, might as well be the motto of his professional life. Even though he chose a career centered in science, medicine and public health, controversy has always had a way of finding him, even as he tried to make it constructive. Fauci chronicles many such moments in his new memoir, \u201cOn Call: A Doctor\u2019s Journey in Public Service.\u201d Fauci was in the public eye for decades as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, but he became a veritable household name at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was charged with monitoring and mitigating the spread of the virus. Fauci spoke frequently to the worried and bewildered American public at government news conferences, giving status updates and offering guidance on face masks, social distancing, school closures, hospitalization rates and, eventually, vaccines. Many credit him with helping the country navigate the uncharted waters of the coronavirus crisis with his medical expertise, calm demeanor and signature Brooklyn-tinged gravelly voice. At the same time, Fauci was navigating his own political headwinds \u2013 some from his boss, former President Donald Trump, who tried to play down the threat of SARS-CoV-2 even as he initiated Operation Warp Speed, the $10 billion-plus public-private partnership focused on rapidly developing vaccines as well as therapeutics. Speaking to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Fauci described how \u201cpainful\u201d it was at one point to correct Trump about hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19 during a news conference early in the pandemic, a move that upset some of the President\u2019s aides. But Trump\u2019s attention was elsewhere, Fauci said: When he called the doctor to his office, the President surprised him by talking about how many people were watching the news conferences. As the pandemic continued, many coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and antivaxxers blamed Fauci personally for struggles with school closures, mask mandates and vaccine recommendations. Even now, Fauci recently testified, he still faces death threats. The pandemic was not the first time Fauci found himself in the center of a political and medical maelstrom. He was in the hot seat during the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s, when his agency spearheaded the effort to fight the widening epidemic. HIV/AIDS activists called him and the entire medical establishment out for not doing enough or moving quickly enough to help people infected with the virus. Yet throughout his career, Fauci seems to have taken public criticism in stride and used it, even, to build something better. It was an attitude he learned in childhood. \u201cThe Jesuit priests, when you thought that all of a sudden the whole world was pounding on you, they would say \u2018Illegitimi non carborundum,\u2019 which means \u2018don\u2019t let the bastards wear you down,\u2019 which \u2026 lately, that is a very relevant and appropriate saying,\u201d Fauci told Gupta. \u201cThey don\u2019t get me down to the point of interfering with what my work is, but it does wear and tear on you,\u201d he added. Fauci recently sat down for a conversation with Gupta \u2014 one of the many they have shared over the years \u2014 to discuss his life\u2019s work and his legacy. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. (Listen to more of the conversation on the podcast \u201cChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\u201d here.) Dr. Sanjay Gupta: You talk about this interesting press briefing that you did. This is in March of 2020.\u00a0And you had to correct the record, even if the President was talking. How challenging is that? Dr. Anthony Fauci: I said to myself, \u201cI have a responsibility to preserve my own personal integrity and a responsibility to the American public.\u201d\u00a0\u2026 So when I walked up to the podium, I said, \u201cHere it goes!\u201d That was painful to me, to have to do that, but there was no doubt that I had to do it. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cWell, maybe you should, and maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d There was no doubt that I had to do it, because I would actually be just relinquishing my responsibility. And what happened is that the President was less upset about that than the people around him, who really got upset. But then he called me in his office once when he wanted to ask me another question, and he was looking at three different televisions, and he says, \u201cMy God, these ratings are amazing. They\u2019re better than cable; they\u2019re better than network.\u201d The President \u2014 it\u2019s no secret. I\u2019m not divulging a secret about the President \u2014 he was very, very fixated on image and ratings. And he thought that the amount of attention that was given to the press briefings was really terrific. And his comment was, \u201cWow, do you see those ratings?\u201d And my feeling was, \u201cThe ratings are in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d Gupta: I want to talk about the 54 years of public service \u2014 almost 40 years, as you say, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Go back to June 5, 1981. That was a date you really talked a lot about in the book. What\u2019s the significance of that? Fauci: I was in my office in the clinical center at the NIH, and I read the June 5 [issue of the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which described five cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among five gay men in LA] and I looked at it and I said, \u201cGosh, what a curiosity. This is strange that they\u2019re all gay men.\u201d But maybe there was talk about using poppers or drugs to enhance your sexual experience that maybe somehow had the collateral effect of suppressing their immune system. But it bothered me. Boy, you really have got to suppress the immune system a lot to get pneumocystis [a serious lung infection caused by a common fungus]. \u2026 So I put it aside, saying \u201cit\u2019s probably a fluke, and it\u2019s just going to disappear.\u201d The real transforming thing came one month later, in July of 1981, when the second MMWR came; this time, 26 \u2014 curiously \u2014 all young, otherwise healthy gay men, not only from L.A. but from San Francisco and New York City, who presented not only with pneumocystis but with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and multiple other opportunistic infections. I can say \u2014 retrospectively, when you try to evaluate the different landmarks in your life, in your career \u2014 reading that MMWR totally transformed my professional career because I made the decision right there, even though I had a very successful career up to that point \u2026 I said, \u201cthis is a brand new disease. \u00a0And even though I don\u2019t know what it is, there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s an infection. \u2026 And it seems to be destroying the immune system.\u201d And here I am: boards in internal medicine, boards in infectious diseases, boards in clinical immunology. I said, \u201cIf there\u2019s one disease that I have to study, is this disease.\u201d Gupta: I don\u2019t think many people who sort of know you from Covid realize that in many ways, you went through some of these same challenges before with HIV/AIDS. Not just new disease, trying to find new therapeutics, but the activists. What was that part of your life like? Fauci: Well, naturally, people ask about the difference or similarity between the pushing back against me and the government in HIV and pushing back against the government and me as the face of Covid. \u2026 It is as different as peanuts and watermelons. It just is very different because the [HIV/AIDS] activists were trying to get the attention of the authorities, the scientific authorities and the regulatory authorities, that the time-proven way of approaching the development of interventions for a new disease doesn\u2019t work well for a disease that\u2019s rapidly killing themselves and their friends and their loved ones. So they wanted a seat at the table. \u2026 So their confrontation to us was based on a good thing. I think back to John Lewis\u2019 \u201cgood trouble\u201d versus bad trouble. They made good trouble for us because they wanted us to just put ourselves in their shoes. \u2026 Again, one of the best things I did in my career was to, instead of running away from them the way most of the scientific community did \u2026 I said to myself, \u201cThis can\u2019t work, so let me put aside the theatrics and the disruption and listen to what they have to say.\u201d And what they had to say made absolutely perfect sense to me. And I said to myself, \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I would be doing exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d That\u2019s when I invited them in to sit down with us and said \u201clet\u2019s start talking.\u201d \u2026 It became such that they became an important part of the community scientific effort to address HIV with therapeutics, with prevention, with regulation, to the point now where they\u2019re on all of our advisory committees. They\u2019re part of the discussion. And quite frankly, many of them turned out to be some of my closest friends. Gupta: But just to punctuate this point, though, at that time, going back 40 years, did you feel that way, the way you\u2019re describing it now? I mean, this idea that, \u201cHey, look, there might be something to be gained from these confrontations\u201d? Fauci: The thing that drove me was empathy, which has been something that has driven my motivation about medicine and about anything that I\u2019ve done, that goes back to my family, that I describe in the book: my parents and my training in the Jesuit schools. There\u2019s empathy for people who are in trouble and people who are suffering. When you combine empathy with listening to them \u2014 just forget the screaming and the yelling. Just listen to what they\u2019re saying. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, it just made perfect sense to me. So my interaction and my response to them, as I often get asked, is dramatically different than someone, on the basis of no evidence, accuses you of killing people or that scene of Marjorie Taylor Greene at the hearing. I mean, come on. That is nothing like what the [HIV] activists were doing. Gupta: What do you want your legacy to be? How do you want people to reflect on Dr. Anthony Fauci? Fauci: I\u2019ve thought about that, and when I think about legacies \u2014 I really, honestly mean this \u2014 I will leave that to other people to decide. I know what I\u2019ve done \u2026 with the development of drugs for HIV, with the development of the vaccine for Covid. I know that, but that\u2019s not [for me to] say, \u201cI want my legacy to be this,\u201d because people are going to have different interpretations of that \u2026 But what I would want my legacy to be, something that I am certain of, is that I have given it 100% every single day. And in the sports analogy, I can say I always left it on the field or left it on the court \u2026 I never held back. I just gave everything I could for the discipline I\u2019m in, which is science, medicine and public health. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like my legacy to be.

{"id": "2024_06_19_health_abortion-clinics-in-banned-states-pivot", "text": "In the last couple years, Houston Women\u2019s Reproductive Services scaled down from nearly 5,000 square-feet to an 800-square-foot location. The Texas clinic cut more than a dozen full-time employees down to a medical director and three part-time staff members. It\u2019s no longer able to provide abortions, but it changed its focus and stayed open. \u201cI was willing to make whatever sacrifices needed to be made to keep our head above water, just keep the doors open and the lights on, and be able to provide care to these people who desperately need our help,\u201d said clinic administrator Kathy Kleinfeld. It\u2019s one example of the shift to the the country\u2019s abortion landscape since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision ended the federal right to abortion two years ago. Since then, 14 states have near-total bans on abortion. Clinics can no longer provide abortions in more than a quarter of US states. Although the total number of facilities that provide abortions in the United States hasn\u2019t changed that much \u2013 only a couple dozen clinics have closed completely \u2013 the number of closures doesn\u2019t always capture the upheaval. States that enacted abortion bans generally had few clinics to start with. Since Dobbs, some packed up and moved to places where they can still provide care, but may require patients to travel further. Still other clinics remain open, but in a different capacity. Kleinfeld\u2019s clinic in Houston pivoted to broader reproductive health, including pre- and post-abortion care for those who travel out of state or self-manage their abortions. In the months before the Supreme Courts\u2019 Dobbs decision, there were about 3,000 abortions a month in Houston and Kleinfeld said she knew that need wouldn\u2019t stop once Texas\u2019 trigger law banned abortions. \u201cThere were a lot of different ways it could have gone; most of all would have involved closing,\u201d Kleinfeld said of her clinic in Houston. \u201cThat was just not something I was willing to do.\u201d Few clinics to start with In 2021, there were about 750 abortion clinics in the United States, according to data from the University of California San Francisco\u2019s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.\u00a0Less than a tenth \u2013 only about 60 of them \u2013 were in the 14 states that have since banned abortion. \u201cThe reason that banned states did not have many facilities to begin with is that they were hostile to abortion and put up barriers to providing abortion services even before Dobbs,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College. Her research focuses on the US abortion landscape, and she has been tracking travel distances to abortion facilities. These states were more likely to have regulations like mandatory waiting periods and parental involvement that created challenges for people seeking abortions, as well as logistical hurdles for providers, such as those in Texas. \u201cThis is basic economic theory,\u201d Myers said. Strict regulatory environments created high costs to entry for providers, leaving space for only the few that could effectively scale their services up enough to survive, she said. The Dobbs decision wasn\u2019t the first time abortion clinics in Texas confronted their fate. About half of the abortion clinics there closed in 2013 when the state legislature passed a law that required them to meet hospital-like standards. The US Supreme Court overturned those restrictions, but dozens of doors closed remained shuttered. \u201cHaving lived through that, I knew all the other clinics \u2013 the very few that were left \u2013 I knew they were going to close\u201d after the Dobbs decision, Kleinfeld said. By 2023, the total number of facilities providing abortions in the US was down to about 725, the UCSF data shows. But each clinic closure has a ripple of negative effects, experts say, especially in regions where services have already been suppressed. \u201cWe need every single abortion clinic in this country. There really aren\u2019t enough for the number of people who need care,\u201d said Nikki Madsen, executive director at Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion care providers and other stakeholders. \u201cWhen we treat abortion in an isolated way, we miss the broader cost of closing a clinic.\u201d About two-thirds of the clinics in states with bans have stayed open in some capacity, the UCSF data shows. Clinics often provide other reproductive health-care services and are sometimes the only touchpoint that people have with the health-care system. \u201cIndependent clinics have always been based in their communities. They really understand the communities where they\u2019re located and the people that they serve in those communities,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cSo over this time, the clinics have been really working to figure out how they can continue to serve the same communities that they were serving pre-Dobbs in an increasingly hostile environment.\u201d Clinics move to the front lines While some clinics have held their ground with a shift in focus, a handful of others have relocated into key access states or opened new locations. \u201cProviders are going to locations that place them as close as possible to the places where people are coming out of banned states in search of abortion,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThey are primarily locating in places that put them on the front lines to receive patients, very strategically in southern Illinois, in New Mexico, in Virginia.\u201d The number of abortion clinics in New Mexico more than doubled post-Dobbs, rising from five in 2021 to 11 in 2023, according to the UCSF data. And the number of abortion providers in Illinois grew from 27 to 36 in that time frame. Among the new additions is CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, which relocated its abortion clinic from Memphis, where abortion is banned, about 200 miles north to Carbondale, a small city in southern Illinois. It still has a location in Tennessee that offers other services including birth control consultations and STI testing. Red River Women\u2019s Clinic had a much less distant \u2013 but no less significant \u2013 move. It popped just a couple miles away from its original location in Fargo, North Dakota, over the border into Minnesota. \u201cWe were the only abortion clinic in North Dakota for over 20 years,\u201d said Tammi Kromenaker, the clinic director. \u201cWe knew that if we didn\u2019t do something, those patients who already drive three, four, five hours one way just to get to our clinic would face even bigger hurdles.\u201d Kromenaker says she had been exploring options to move the clinic out of North Dakota years before the Dobbs decision as a conservative state legislature threatened the clinic\u2019s work, but options felt out of reach, mainly because they were too expensive. But when the Dobbs decision leaked a month before it was handed down, the need to act instantly outweighed those concerns. \u201cIt just was just this thing, like, \u2018we just have to do this. We have to, no matter the obstacles,\u2019\u201d Kromenaker said, and she was thankful for a fundraising campaign that buoyed the clinic in that leap. Struggle for solid financial footing As clinics weigh their options in a post-Dobbs world, finances are the greatest determining factor. \u201cIt costs money to close the clinic. It costs money to reopen the clinic. If patients have never gone to you for prenatal care before, it\u2019s going to take time to develop a patient population who comes to you for prenatal care,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cAll of these shifts really require community support and financial support from the community to continue to keep these clinics open.\u201d And constant changes to the abortion landscape in the US exacerbate clinics\u2019 struggle for solid footing. \u201cI would have expected to see providers open in North Florida and North Carolina, which were both geographically important destinations after Dobbs, except for the fact that both states are fairly hostile to abortion,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe future there was so uncertain, and I think it was too risky to open.\u201d Before Dobbs, a 100-mile increase in distance to the nearest clinic could prevent about 1 in 5 people who wanted an abortion from being able to reach a facility to get one, her research shows. Travel distance to abortion clinics continues to be a critical barrier to access, but a surge in virtual clinics has helped fill some of that gap. In the last few months of 2023, about 1 in 5 abortions in the US were telehealth abortions, where medication abortions pills were mailed to a patient after a remote consultation with a clinician, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning. By December, nearly a tenth of all abortions in the US \u2013 about 8,000 a month \u2013 were telehealth abortions provided under shield laws, which allow providers in some states where abortion remains legal to prescribe medication abortion drugs via telehealth to people living in states with bans or restrictions. \u201cSome people have resources to travel, but the pressure on brick-and-mortar clinics continues to build,\u201d said Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project. \u201cNow, patients can get their medications sooner because they don\u2019t have to wait for a spot to open up in a clinic or find a way to get there. It\u2019s vital.\u201d A Supreme Court ruling last week maintained broad access to medication abortion, but other ongoing legal challenges and ballot measures that will be on the table in a few states during this year\u2019s election leave policies and planning very much in flux. Although Red River has moved all of its staff and services to the Minnesota, Kromenaker has kept the address in Fargo to maintain standing in ongoing legal battles with the state. \u201cIt would have been easy to just walk away and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to sell this building. We\u2019re done with North Dakota. We\u2019re out,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe have fought so long and so hard, we just didn\u2019t want to give up. We\u2019re just one little clinic, but downtown Fargo is still, technically, our corporate address so that we can maintain that standing in North Dakota and continue to fight for those patients we\u2019ve served for \u2026 26 years in July.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/abortion-clinics-in-banned-states-pivot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_ketamine-pill-depression-fewer-side-effects", "text": "A new ketamine pill may help hard-to-treat depression with fewer side effects than other forms of the treatment, early research suggests. Technically, no form of ketamine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat any psychiatric disorder, including depression. A derivative of ketamine, called esketamine, was approved in 2019 to treat depression. It\u2019s a nasal spray called Spravato. There\u2019s also FDA-approved injected ketamine, brand-named Ketalar, which can be prescribed off-label. Both can be a fast-acting lifeline for people living with depression that hasn\u2019t been relieved by other types of treatments.\u00a0Getting the drug, or a derivative of it, through a vein or as a squirt up the nose requires close medical supervision in a clinic, however, making these options hard for some people to access or even to do. \u201cIt\u2019s very logistically involved. You have to come in and be observed for a couple hours,\u201d said Dr. Brian Barnett, clinical director of the Psychiatric Treatment Resistance Program at the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the study.\u00a0\u201cThe field has really been looking for a way to take advantage of ketamine for depression but let patients take this at home in the form of a pill.\u201d To confuse matters even further, compounded ketamine lozenges and pills are available through online pharmacies and can be obtained with a prescription, but the FDA warned patients and providers about using compounded ketamine last fall because these products have not been evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Some doctors who prescribe ketamine for depression say they are wary of the oral forms because it\u2019s not clear how much of the drug actually makes it to a patient\u2019s bloodstream. Patients need to be monitored closely because ketamine, which was originally used to dull pain in surgery, can cause feelings of disconnection or disassociation from their bodies and the world around them. It also distorts thinking and decision-making.\u00a0Some find this hallucinogenic experience beneficial and even pleasant, but others have described it as terrifying.\u00a0These forms of the drug can also cause a person\u2019s blood pressure to go up, which may make them off-limits for those with heart conditions. The clinic setting limits who can get the treatment as well, Barnett said.\u00a0Not all areas have clinics that can do this kind of intensive monitoring, and patients aren\u2019t allowed to drive until the morning after an infusion, so treatments may be out-of-reach if they can\u2019t get a ride or afford a hotel stay. From a public health standpoint, Barnett said, you can serve more people with a pill than with clinic-based treatments.\u00a0A 2021 study estimated that in any given year, 2.8 million American adults have treatment-resistant depression. \u201cIt would be very beneficial for many people to have this available as a medication that they could take at home. But obviously, we want a medication like that to have very minimal dissociative side effects,\u201d Barnett said. That\u2019s where slow-release ketamine pills come in. Studying drug withdrawal to see if it works For the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in New Zealand enrolled 231 adults who had been diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, meaning they had tried at least two different antidepressants to lift their mood without success. The study participants scored an average of 30 points on a clinical scale that measures depressive symptoms, a score that\u2019s considered moderate depression, and on average, they\u2019d tried nearly five different treatments without relief. For the first five days of the study, all of the participants took a daily dose of 120 milligrams of ketamine in the form of a slow-release pill.\u00a0On day eight, the researchers assessed who had responded to the drug.\u00a0Slightly more than half the group \u2013 132 \u2013 had remission of their symptoms, meaning they scored under 10 on the clinical scale. Overall, 168 had some degree of benefit and were considered responders to the pill. People who had not responded to the drug were not eligible to continue with the research. Those 168 adults were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups;\u00a037 people got a  placebo, or dummy pill, while roughly equal-size groups took one of four daily doses of ketamine that ranged from 30 milligrams to 180 milligrams. By 14 weeks, everyone taking ketamine still continued to see some relief from their depression, but for most groups, the differences compared with placebo were not statistically significant, meaning they could have been observed due to chance alone. Researchers did see what\u2019s called a dose response, however, meaning the higher the dose of the drug, the more relief participants had in their depressive symptoms, which is usually a sign that the drug is having a real effect. People who took the highest dose, 180 milligrams a day, did see a statistically significant benefit, a reduction in their depression score of about six points compared with the placebo group. \u201cThe results here, they look encouraging,\u201d Barnett said, noting that a two-point drop in the clinical rating scale the researchers used is considered meaningful to patients. A six-point drop is \u201csimilar to what we\u2019ve seen in recent clinical trials of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression,\u201d Barnett said, referring to a chemical in certain mushrooms that\u2019s currently being studied. During the first five days of the study, when everyone was taking the drug, the most common side effects reported were dizziness, headache, dissociation, fatigue, feeling abnormal and nausea. About 11% of people taking the 120 milligram ketamine pill at the beginning of the study said they experienced dissociation or feeling disconnected.\u00a0But this appeared to be much milder than the dissociation reported by people who get ketamine infusions.\u00a0On a commonly used rating scale, people taking the ketamine pill ranked below a score of 3 in the first phase of the study, but another study found that people getting IV ketamine rated their dissociation around a 7. Effects on blood pressure were also minimal with the slow-release pill. Weighing study biases Experts agree that the study was an important first step. \u201cThe report is important since it is the first large placebo-controlled study to be published attempting to explore the benefits of oral ketamine,\u201d Dr. Gerard Sanacora, director of the Yale Depression Research Program, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. But Sanacora said the design of the study, which is known as a randomized withdrawal trial, probably biased the results in favor of making the drug look more effective than it might be in the real world, something the study authors acknowledge, too. By studying only people who responded to the drug, the study authors noted that they hoped to avoid the high failure rates of many antidepressants tested in a general population, where as many as 50% of trials fail to show an effect compared with a placebo. Sanacora said it\u2019s very likely that the study participants could have known they were getting ketamine, rather than the placebo, and therefore expected it to work. \u201cIt is usually easier to guess correctly once you have been exposed to the active treatment and then receive the inactive treatment,\u201d he wrote. Therefore, he said, it would be really important for the pills to be retested in a larger population to get an idea of how well they might work in the real world. He noted that there\u2019s a \u201ctremendous tension\u201d between wanting the important benefits of a drug like ketamine to be more available to people and making sure the treatment can be given safely and responsibly. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction, but we clearly need more high-quality data before we can say much more about the overall efficacy and safety of the new form of treatment and especially the safety of doing this at home,\u201d Sanacora wrote. Challenges of oral dosing Perhaps unsurprisingly, the study, which led to withdrawal and depression relapse for many, had a high drop-out rate.\u00a0Of the 168 people who initially saw benefit from the pills, 100 didn\u2019t complete the trial.\u00a0Ninety-four left because they stopped being helped by their treatment.\u00a0One person left because of an adverse event. Four others left for unspecified reasons.\u00a0A 65-year-old man died as a result of suicide. The researchers say the study\u2019s independent review committee judged that the death was a result of the patient\u2019s depression rather than the treatment. \u201cAttempted and completed suicide is a sad reality of treatment trials in patients with depression,\u201d noted study author Dr. Paul Glue, a professor in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, in an email. Both Barnett and Sanacora agreed that it was difficult to know whether the drug played any role in a study this size and said that larger studies were needed to tease out any serious safety signals. Among the participants, women and younger adults tended to have stronger treatment effects than men and older adults. That may have something to do with the way the pills are metabolized, Barnett said. \u201cOne of the challenges with oral ketamine, one of the reasons that we haven\u2019t used as much for depression as IV, is that it can be sort of unpredictable, and how much is getting into the bloodstream?\u201d he said. However, he thought the slow-release form of the pill probably helped with maintaining a steadier dose.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/ketamine-pill-depression-fewer-side-effects/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_older-americans-healthcare-affordability-kff-partner-wellness", "text": "What weighs most heavily on older adults\u2019 minds when it comes to health care? The cost of services and therapies, and their ability to pay. \u201cIt\u2019s on our minds a whole lot because of our age and because everything keeps getting more expensive,\u201d said Connie Colyer, 68, of Pleasureville, Kentucky. She\u2019s a retired forklift operator who has lung disease and high blood pressure. Her husband, James, 70, drives a dump truck and has a potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythm. Tens of millions of seniors are similarly anxious about being able to afford health care because of its expense and rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. A new wave of research highlights the reach of these anxieties. When the University of Michigan\u2019s National Poll on Healthy Aging asked people 50 and older about 26 health-related issues, their top three areas of concern had to do with costs: of medical care in general, of long-term care, and of prescription drugs. More than half of 3,300 people surveyed in February and March reported being \u201cvery concerned\u201d about these issues. In fact, five of the top 10 issues identified as very concerning were cost-related. Beyond the top three, people cited the cost of health insurance and Medicare (52%), and the cost of dental care (45%). Financial scams and fraud came in fourth place (53% very concerned). Of much less concern were issues that receive considerable attention, including social isolation, obesity and age discrimination. In an election year, \u201cour poll sends a very clear message that older adults are worried about the cost of health care and will be looking to candidates to discuss what they have done or plan to do to contain those costs,\u201d said John Ayanian, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation. Health care costs are impacting wallets Older adults have good reason to worry. One in 10 seniors (about 6 million people) have incomes below the federal poverty level. About one in four rely exclusively on Social Security payments, which average $1,913 a month per person. Even though inflation has moderated since its 2022 peak, prices haven\u2019t come down, putting a strain on seniors living on fixed incomes. Meanwhile, traditional Medicare doesn\u2019t cover several services that millions of older adults need, such as dental care, vision care or help at home from aides. While private Medicare Advantage plans offer some coverage for these services, benefits are frequently limited. All of this contributes to a health care affordability squeeze for older adults. Recently published research from the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s 2023 Health Care Affordability Survey found that nearly a third of people 65 or older reported difficulty paying for health care expenses, including premiums for Medicare, medications, and expenses associated with receiving medical services. One in seven older adults reported spending a quarter or more of their average monthly budget on health care; 44% spent between 10% and 24%. Seventeen percent said they or a family member had forgone needed care in the past year for financial reasons. The Colyers in Pleasureville are among them. Both need new dentures and eyeglasses, but they can\u2019t afford to pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket, Connie said. \u201cAs the cost of living rises for basic necessities, it\u2019s more difficult for lower-income and middle-income Medicare beneficiaries to afford the health care they need,\u201d said Gretchen Jacobson, vice president of the Medicare program at the Commonwealth Fund. Similarly, \u201cwhen health care costs rise, it\u2019s more difficult to afford basic necessities.\u201d This is especially worrisome because older adults are more prone to illness and disability than younger adults, resulting in a greater need for care and higher expenses. In 2022, seniors on Medicare spent $7,000 on medical services, compared with $4,900 for people without Medicare. Not included in this figure is the cost of assisted living or long-term stays in nursing homes, which Medicare also doesn\u2019t cover. According to Genworth\u2019s latest survey, the median annual cost of a semiprivate room in a nursing home was $104,000 in 2023, while assisted living came to $64,200, and a week\u2019s worth of services from home-health aides averaged $75,500. Many older adults simply can\u2019t afford to pay for these long-term care options or other major medical expenses out-of-pocket. \u201cSeventeen million older adults have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Program on Medicare Policy for KFF. (That\u2019s $30,120 for a single-person household in 2024; $40,880 for a two-person household.) \u201cFor people living on that income, the risk of a major expense is very scary.\u201d Planning for the future is challenging How to deal with unanticipated expenses in the future is a question that haunts Connie Colyer. Her monthly premiums for Medicare Parts B and D, and a Medigap supplemental policy come to nearly $468, or 42% of her $1,121 monthly income from Social Security. With a home mortgage of $523 a month, and more than $150 in monthly copayments for her inhalers and her husband\u2019s heart medications, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t make it if my husband wasn\u2019t still working,\u201d she told me. (James\u2019 monthly Social Security payment is $1,378. His premiums are similar to Connie\u2019s and his income fluctuates based on the weather. In the first five months of this year, it approached $10,000, Connie told me.) The couple makes too much to qualify for programs that help older adults afford Medicare out-of-pocket costs. As many as 6 million people are eligible but not enrolled in these Medicare Savings Programs. Those with very low incomes may also qualify for dual coverage by Medicaid and Medicare or other types of assistance with household costs, such as food stamps. Older adults can check their eligibility for these and other programs by contacting their local Area Agency on Agency, State Health Insurance Assistance Program or benefits enrollment center. Enter your ZIP code at the Eldercare Locator and these and other organizations helping seniors locally will come up. Persuading older adults to step forward and ask for help often isn\u2019t easy. Angela Zeek, health and government benefits manager at Legal Aid of the Bluegrass in Kentucky, said many seniors in her area don\u2019t want to be considered poor or unable to pay their bills, a blow to their pride. \u201cWhat we try to say is, \u2018You\u2019ve worked hard all your life, you\u2019ve paid your taxes. You\u2019ve given back to this government so there\u2019s nothing wrong with the government helping you out a bit.\u2019\u201d And the unfortunate truth is there\u2019s very little, if any, help available for seniors who aren\u2019t poor but have modest financial resources. While the need for new dental, vision and long-term care benefits for older adults is widely acknowledged, \u201cthe question is always how to pay for it,\u201d said Neuman of KFF. This will become an even bigger issue in the coming years because of the burgeoning aging population. There is some relief on the horizon, however: Assistance with Medicare drug costs is available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, although many older adults don\u2019t realize it yet. The act allows Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs for the first time. This year, out-of-pocket costs for medications will be limited to a maximum $3,800 for most beneficiaries. Next year, a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket drug costs will take effect. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing people who\u2019ve had very high drug costs in the past save thousands of dollars this year,\u201d said Frederic Riccardi, president of the Medicare Rights Center. \u201cAnd next year, it\u2019s going to get even better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/older-americans-healthcare-affordability-kff-partner-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_food-hoarding-wellness", "text": "Having grown up with food insecurity, Kimi Ceridon and her sister see how their childhood experiences continue to leave their mark on their lives. Ceridon looks back on how she would sneak off to her room with any extras she could come by. And now, she is protective of getting a fair portion size when sharing with someone. And when the pandemic hit, Ceridon said she and her sister talked about how conscious they had to be not to panic and run out to stores to hoard food. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in scarcity, and now here we were again living in scarcity, and even though both of us no longer had concerns of food insecurity, it was bringing up a lot of anxiety,\u201d said Ceridon, owner of Life Love Cheese, a grazing board company in Boston. Many people like to see a pantry full of food available for themselves and their family. But when the amount of food gets to be too much, is hidden or becomes too precious to toss when it goes bad, a person might be dealing with food hoarding, experts say. An estimated 2% to 6% of people suffer from a hoarding disorder, according to the International OCD Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Among those disorders is food hoarding. About 75% of those people have another mental health condition alongside hoarding, such as major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, the foundation said. It is natural to have an emotional relationship with food and get comfort from having it available, said Kate Daigle, licensed professional counselor and certified eating disorder specialist in Denver. But for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a history of food scarcity or other trauma, the desire to have a stockpile of food may become debilitating, said New York psychologist Dr. Alexis Conason. What is food hoarding? Food hoarding can vary depending on the access the person has to buying food, Daigle said. For young children, it can mean hiding food from their parents or caregivers in their room or their closet \u2014 sometimes eating it, but sometimes not, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just having it there as a form of emotional safety, coming from a place of feeling deprived,\u201d Daigle said. \u201cNot necessarily physically deprived from food, but maybe emotionally having some deprivation or scarcity mindset around food.\u201d For adults or children with access to money, it can mean going out and buying large quantities of food and sometimes stashing it in hiding places as well, Daigle said. What\u2019s so bad about hoarding food? It is interesting to talk about food hoarding after the lockdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic, because food hoarding served a purpose in that time, Daigle said. But for many Americans, having a basement, pantry or entire home filled with food isn\u2019t necessary, she said. A fixation around hoarding food can have a financial impact when a person spends all their money on food and can\u2019t take care of other basic needs. There are also sanitary and health concerns when that food goes bad, Daigle said. There are concerns around mental health and social relationships as well, she added. Some people engaging in food hoarding behaviors may isolate out of shame or feel more comfortable being around food versus being out in public. Why do people hoard food? Storing more food than we need at a given moment is in some ways strategic and common in nature, said Dr. Erin Rhinehart, professor of neuroscience at Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. \u201cIt evolved as like insurance against famine,\u201d she said. Many animals have evolved mechanisms for storing food to protect their survival, she added. \u201cIn animals, if they actually experience like a short period with no food, that behavior increases,\u201d Rhinehart said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically an insurance policy or a way to make sure that you\u2019re never going to run out of food.\u201d Food hoarding may share underlying problems with \u2014 but is not necessarily caused by \u2014 eating disorders, Daigle said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the food. It\u2019s about the behavior,\u201d she said. Some eating disorders have food hoarding as part of their behaviors, and the same experience may drive people to cope with both hoarding and eating disorder behaviors, she said. Many people with these behaviors may have had significant trauma in their childhood. \u201cPerhaps there was a true lack of available resources financially for food for the family, and so the child might hoard what food they can,\u201d she said. And as adults, people might continue to hoard food in fear there will be a scarcity again. But shortages of other things children need may also lead to food hoarding, Daigle said. \u201cIt could be where food is controlled or a child\u2019s emotional needs are not met,\u201d she said. Safety and security are not guaranteed in families with addiction, physical or emotional abuse, or neglect, she said. \u201cThat can turn into holding comfort objects, whether it\u2019s food or other sentimental objects, to try to take care of those needs,\u201d Daigle said. Curiosity and compassion It\u2019s common for food hoarding to cause shame and drive people into isolation, so remember to approach any loved ones you think might be hoarding with curiosity and without judgment, Daigle said. Instead of focusing on how shocking you may find the behaviors, ask about their emotional experience, she added. If you see this behavior in yourself, know there are ways to feel better, Daigle said. The next step is to find professional support to heal any deep traumas and unmet needs so you can replace the food hoarding with healthier coping mechanisms, she added. The professional you work with should not be a diet coach or someone who shames you over food, however. Instead, look for a licensed professional with expertise in trauma, eating disorders, OCD, anxiety and compulsive behaviors, she said. \u201cThe key thing is how much time and space is this taking up in your life?\u201d Conason said. \u201cIf it feels like it\u2019s stopping you from doing things that you enjoy or into interfering with your quality of life, it\u2019s definitely a good idea to seek out support.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/food-hoarding-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_health_eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness", "text": "While holidays are often marked by parties, shared meals, gift-giving and special outfits, experts say there\u2019s health benefits to remembering the meaning behind the celebration. The three-day holiday of Eid-al-Adha commemorates the story in the Quran of God appearing to Ibrahim, or Abraham, in a dream and commanding him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. The holiday, which starts on Sunday this year, is determined by the lunar calendar, and Saudi Arabia announces the dates according to its time zone. Muslims believe that as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, an angel of God stopped him and gave him a ram to sacrifice in place of his son. A version of the story also appears in both Christian and Jewish scriptures. Many people kick off the holiday by calling and texting Muslims they know throughout the world with \u201cEid Mubarak,\u201d which means blessed feast or festival. Families typically attend a special morning prayer at the local mosque and then gather with loved ones to feast over a holiday meal and exchange money or gifts. Others may make a obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca \u2014 the Hajj pilgrimage \u2014 to visit the holiest sites in Islam, including the mountainous region where Abraham\u2019s feted act took place. Muslims also honor Abraham\u2019s sacrifice with udhiya or qurbani \u2014 sacrificing a cow, sheep or goat and then sharing the meat with friends and family and offering it to those in need. Many people also send donations to or place qurbani orders in Muslim countries to feed disadvantaged people. These traditions are reminders that letting go, having faith and doing good deeds will be rewarded, said Dr. Yasmine Saad, a clinical psychologist and author in New York City. This message and the pious and social acts of Eid, such as celebrating with friends and family and spreading acts of charity exemplify mindfulness and can be helpful when implemented regularly. \u201cEid is a reminder that we should strive to add more of this balance in our day-to-day,\u201d said Dr. Rania Awaad, clinical professor of psychiatry and director of the Stanford Muslim Mental Health & Islamic Psychology lab. Here are some mindful takeaways from the Eid holiday that you can include in your routine \u2013 no matter what you believe in. At its core, mindfulness is staying in the present, focusing on one\u2019s thoughts, feelings and surroundings without judgment. The practice of mindfulness carries multiple health and wellness benefits such as decreasing pain, reducing stress and easing feelings of depression. Stay hopeful and look for silver linings The story of Abraham is not easily transferable to everyday life as it was an example of an extreme hurdle, but the lesson of pushing through a hardship and carrying on with resilience is relatable.\u00a0 \u201cIslam really develops this notion of faithfulness and patience in the face of a trial,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Reynolds, professor of Islamic Studies and Theology at University of Notre Dame. In Islamic spirituality, this mindset \u201cbecomes a real important way for Muslims to carry on through trials, suffering, oppression, evil that they suffer in life.\u201d Reynolds describes this mindset as a \u201csustaining force\u201d for Muslims. And it\u2019s not limited to Islam \u2014 anyone can reflect on one\u2019s current circumstances and look for positivity as a way to get through the hard parts. Do your part and trust the process During Abraham\u2019s challenging ordeal, his wife was also being tested. According to Islamic narrative, she was left alone in the desert in present-day Mecca with their son so that Abraham could follow God\u2019s command. In this story, the baby was in desperate need of nourishment, so the mother ran between two hills seven times to try to procure water for the baby. Eventually water \u2014 of which the well has become the source of holy water for Muslims \u2014 sprung up from the ground where the baby\u2019s feet lay. It sounds like a miraculous happening, but when applied to daily life, one can view it as doing one\u2019s work and trusting that things fall into place. Abraham\u2019s wife did her part by trying her best to search for nourishment for her child. Feeding others \u2018feeds the soul\u2019 Muslims commemorate the day with the sacrifice of an animal, and they take it a step further by making a meal of it for their own families and for people less fortunate. In this way they venerate Abraham while underscoring sharing and giving. At the root of qurbani is creating a shared experience while giving to others. \u201cA lot of people are feeling purposeless, and they feel that what they do in their life doesn\u2019t hit home,\u201d Saad said. \u201cGiving to others, giving to poor (people), sharing, making an impact in other people\u2019s lives always feeds the soul.\u201d You can make cooking for others, volunteering at a soup kitchen and donating your money, time or goods a regular \u2014 but impactful \u2014 part of your routine. Giving can \u201crealign people so their mind will be different, they will think more positive thoughts, their bodies will feel better, they will have a smile on their face,\u201d Saad said. By stepping out of one\u2019s routine and giving to others, it can help make \u201cyou feel you have an impact, you help, you have significance.\u201d This sense of purpose and meaning contributes to living a happier and longer life, according to an expert. In a larger sense, kindness contributes to one\u2019s sense of community and belonging, and donating to others has proven to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health, according to studies. It takes a village Humans are inherently social creatures, and loneliness and social isolationa are not good for one\u2019s brain, body or spirit, according to research. Even the size of a person\u2019s social network can impact health. Smaller networks are linked to larger feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can impact disease and death rates. Further, more positive experiences in social relationships is generally linked to better coping and lower stress. Because Eid is celebrated over a period of three days, the holiday emphasizes socializing and connecting with others for longer than just an afternoon or a day. These kinds of \u201csocial ceremonies\u201d can be helpful, said Dr. David Spiegel, psychiatrist and director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford Medicine. People have survived because \u201cwe\u2019ve formed communities, and support one another, and protect one another,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a community act that gives you a sense of doing something and doing something together with other people does help people to manage stress better.\u201d Connecting with one\u2019s community and expanding that circle, or even in smaller ways such as making time for a friend can be healthy. Fill your cup While going on the Hajj pilgrimage might be spiritually fulfilling for some Muslims, it may not be practical for everyone to take that journey. But creating space that brings in any sort of fulfillment can usher in new, exciting energy. Whether it\u2019s reading a good book or going on a yoga retreat for example, it can be something you do for your growth and gratification. Even a hike can do it for some, Awaad explained. \u201cIt could be something that just fills your cup to where you\u2019re able to then ground yourself and be much more attuned to the people around you and to the work that you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/health/eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "health"}}
