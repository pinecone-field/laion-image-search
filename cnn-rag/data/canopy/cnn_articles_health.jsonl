An umbrella review looks at existing metanalyses of large numbers of studies, providing a high-level view of existing research on a topic. In addition to lowering cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, the umbrella analysis found a \u201cprotective effect\u201d for specific cancers, including \u201cliver, colon, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, melanoma, kidney and non-Hodgkin lymphoma,\u201d said lead author Dr. Angelo Capodici, a graduate student in health science, technology and management at Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna in Pisa, Italy. Vegetarians don\u2019t eat any animal flesh, while the lacto-ovo version of vegetarianism allows dairy products and eggs while excluding all meat, poultry and fish. Veganism, the stricter form of vegetarianism, bans any food products made from meat, poultry and seafood as well as any animal by-products such as gelatin. However, the protective nature of the diets could be sabotaged if poor dietary choices were made, the study authors said via email. \u201cDiets that emphasize consumption of unhealthy plant foods, such as fruit juices, refined grains, potato chips, and even sodas\u201d might counter the positives of a plant-based diet for health, said study coauthor Dr. Federica Guaraldi, medical director of the pituitary unit at the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna in Italy. Fruit juices, which are \u201cfull of sugars or sweetener,\u201d Guaraldi said, \u201c(were) recently demonstrated to have detrimental impact on metabolism as much as or even more than white sugar.\u201d Results may be affected by other lifestyle factors Researchers have long known that people who follow plant-based diets often live healthier lives full of exercise and an avoidance of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains, snacks, alcohol and tobacco, the study said. \u201cWhat is attributed to diet here may be in part due to other lifestyle practices,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThat is a minor concern, however,\u201d Katz said in an email. \u201cThe net effect of plant-predominant dietary patterns is clearly favorable to crucial health outcomes even if some of the observed benefit is attributable to other lifestyle practices.\u201d In fact, adopting a plant-based diet, even without additional exercise, could still yield health benefits, according to a November study on twins by Christopher Gardner, one of the coauthors of the umbrella analysis published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. In the 2023 study, healthy twins who ate a vegan diet for eight weeks had lower \u201cbad\u201d\u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, better\u00a0blood sugar levels and\u00a0greater weight loss\u00a0than siblings who ate a diet of meat and vegetables, according to Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in Palo Alto, California. \u201cThere was a 10% to 15% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 25% drop in insulin, and a 3% drop in body weight in just eight weeks, all by eating real food without animal products,\u201d Gardner told CNN at the time. One reason for that may be the nutritional boost that plants provide, including high levels of vitamins, minerals and other substances with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, while also reducing the inflammatory impact of meat and processed food, the authors said. \u201cPlants have more fiber (animal foods have zero), less saturated fat and zero cholesterol (all animal foods have cholesterol),\u201d Gardner said in an email. \u201cAn entirely separate category is phytochemicals (literally, \u2018plant chemicals\u2019) such as antioxidants. By definition there are no phytochemicals in animal foods.\u201d No meat, poultry or seafood, but dairy and eggs are OK The new review analyzed 48 metanalyses that had investigated the impact of eating a vegetarian or vegan diet on the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease and early death. \u201cWe analyzed reviews considering\u00a0vegan and vegetarian diets that completely exclude(ed) meat, poultry and seafood,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Davide Gori, an associate professor of biomedical and neuromotor sciences at the University of Bologna in Italy. \u201cTo be more precise regarding vegetarian diets, lacto-vegetarian (allowing certain dairy products such as yogurt, cheese and milk), ovo-vegetarian (allowing whole eggs, egg whites and egg-containing foods such as mayonnaise, egg noodles and certain baked goods), (and) lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets were included,\u201d Gori said in an email. However, vegetarian diets limiting but not completely excluding certain types of meat and fish, such as pesco- or pollo-vegetarian diets, were excluded, he said. The review found eating these plant-based diets reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and inflammation by affecting risk factors such as body mass index, fasting glucose and other measures of blood sugar control, and the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) measurements of blood pressure. The diets also significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and \u201cC-reactive protein \u2014 an index of inflammation that is typically higher in cardiovascular and metabolic disease,\u201d Gori said. Metabolic disease is a constellation of symptoms such as obesity, high blood pressure and poor control of cholesterol and blood sugars that can all lead to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. However, there was no benefit in eating plants for pregnant women, an \u201cintriguing finding\u201d that needs further research, said Guaraldi of the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences. It\u2019s also possible that the hormones of pregnancy might affect findings, and \u201cwe cannot rule out that participants have taken supplements during the study period that could have altered the impact of diet on the considered parameters.\u201d Special considerations of plant-based diets Because certain vitamin and minerals are more easily found and absorbed from meat, dairy or fish, vegetarians and vegans must take extra precautions to add those into their diets, experts say. Unless the diet is carefully optimized, additional sources of B12, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin D may be needed to avoid a deficiency, according to the Mayo Clinic. \u201cStrictly vegan diets can be deficient in vitamin B12,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThis is easily resolved by consuming foods fortified with (vitamin) B12 \u2014 easy to do because the recommended daily allowance for B12 is lower than any other vitamin or mineral. \u201cIron is another nutrient that is harder to get from a fully vegan diet,\u201d Gardner added. \u201cMany plant foods are relatively high in iron (beans/legumes). Again, supplements can be helpful.\u201d Protein is also a challenge, but good sources in plants include legumes such as lentils, chickpeas and beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains and soy products such as edamame, tempeh and tofu. Processed meat substitutes are options as well, experts say, but due to the processing can be packed with sodium, so read labels carefully.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_health_mothers-day-less-body-shaming-wellness", "text": "Flowers and brunch are lovely, but there\u2019s an invaluable gift almost every mom would enjoy: a healthier body image. The pressure on women to look perfect isn\u2019t our fault. Recognizing and resisting unrealistic appearance ideals can improve mothers\u2019 lives at every stage of parenthood. While women face appearance pressures throughout their lives, for those who give birth, the postpartum period can be especially fraught. I\u2019ll never forget being the mom of young kids in 2010 when model Gisele B\u00fcndchen posed for Vogue only months after having a baby. During the internet frenzy that ensued, the supposedly reassuring takeaway was that \u201cordinary\u201d women shouldn\u2019t compare themselves to a supermodel. But almost all postpartum moms, celebrity or not, face an unspoken mandate to \u201cbounce back\u201d to their pre-baby body. Even if you had B\u00fcndchen\u2019s genetics and support staff, it\u2019s unreasonable and even cruel to expect you to focus your energy on appearing as if you\u2019ve never been pregnant. The reality is that you\u2019ve just created a human inside your body and physically pushed them out or undergone major abdominal surgery. Despite what we see on magazine covers and social media, \u201cthere\u2019s no bouncing back from growing a human,\u201d said Jen McLellan, a certified birth educator in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \u2018Bouncing-back\u2019 expectations can be harmful Since pregnancy and childbirth are among the biggest physical changes someone can experience, bounce-back expectations aren\u2019t just absurd \u2014 they can threaten new moms\u2019 health and well-being. The impact of these harmful appearance pressures is something we need to take seriously, according to Jill Schwartz, a Los Angeles-based therapist specializing in perinatal mental health. \u201cOur society does such a disservice to moms,\u201d she noted, by bombarding them with rules about how they should look instead of providing much-needed support. These damaging appearance ideals can worsen or even trigger mental health conditions, especially for postpartum women who have a history of depression, anxiety or an eating disorder. If moms feel preoccupied with their appearance, exercise or what they eat (even \u201chealthy eating\u201d), it could be a sign of significant maternal mental health problems. One of the most important steps for new moms is to work toward acceptance of and gratitude for the changes that come with parenthood. \u201cThe body isn\u2019t what it was before. And you\u2019ve done this beautiful, amazing thing that not everybody gets to experience,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cYou can grow and embrace that. But your body isn\u2019t going to be just like how it was before, just like life isn\u2019t going to be how it was before.\u201d When feeling pressure to try to control or shrink their body, moms can start by identifying that these ideas aren\u2019t natural or innate but have been \u201cinherited from the culture,\u201d according to Debra Benfield, a registered dietitian in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who specializes in supporting women\u2019s body image. Awareness of these external diet culture directives can help moms start to push back against unrealistic and harmful ideals. Some women may find strength in actively rebelling against the dominant narrative: \u201cDo the polar opposite of the pressure that society is placing on you,\u201d Schwartz advised. For example, while people may encourage new parents to ramp up exercise quickly, the healthier approach is to \u201cgo slow, be patient, give yourself grace and remember you\u2019re in healing time.\u201d Appearance pressures intensify again leading up to menopause The devastating mismatch between heightened maternal vulnerability and a fresh onslaught of unrealistic appearance expectations peaks again for women in the years leading up to menopause. As with the postpartum period, perimenopause brings new challenges at a stressful time of life. Many midlife women are experiencing hormonal shifts and physical changes, all while raising children and caring for aging parents. \u201cThe collision of motherhood and perimenopause is a very hard thing,\u201d Benfield said. It\u2019s no surprise that negative body image and disordered eating tend to increase again in midlife, when women are expected to look as if they\u2019re \u201cfrozen in time\u201d rather than experience the natural and expected changes that come with age, noted Benfield, who treats people with eating disorders. Women of all ages need to hear her important reminder: \u201cBodies change. And that\u2019s OK. And let\u2019s normalize that.\u201d A positive influence on family Moms may find it easier to reject diet culture and the thin ideal when they recognize the positive influence they can have on their families. \u201cWe are teaching our children how to love themselves,\u201d McLellan said. Even if a mom isn\u2019t overtly dieting or weighing herself in front of her kids, \u201cchildren are listening and watching in more ways than you can imagine,\u201d Benfield said. Benefits to children are compelling, but moms deserve to feel better about their bodies for themselves, Benfield added. By resisting harmful ideals, moms are \u201cless burdened and feel more present and therefore more powerful in their own lives.\u201d A key step in this process involves unlearning a lot of what diet culture has taught us about the importance of thinness. \u201cIt is really important that we unpack our own weight bias,\u201d McLellan said. \u201cWe all have internalized messages because we grew up with them. And the more we\u2019re willing to start doing that work, the more deepened love we can find for ourselves.\u201d One strategy for moms to feel better about their bodies is to practice meaningful self-care. \u201cI don\u2019t mean bubble baths and fuzzy socks. I mean scheduling our pap smears, scheduling our dental work,\u201d McLellan explained. Finding weight-inclusive providers, especially for moms in larger bodies, is essential not only for body image but for overall health. By recognizing weight stigma and truly caring for ourselves, moms can start to \u201cunwrite those messages that we grew up with, thinking that our bodies are wrong or bad and instead really focusing on the importance of our overall wellness,\u201d she added. How can I support other moms? If a mother in your life is struggling with poor body image, it can be tempting to dismiss her concerns and instead offer compliments. While some mothers may appreciate this type of reassurance, it comes with the risk of backfiring because it shuts down her feelings while also reinforcing the importance of how her body looks. Really listening and trying to \u201cdecentralize appearance\u201d can often be the better way to go, according to Benfield. Friends, family and partners can express their unconditional love and even talk directly about the toxicity of our culture\u2019s unrealistic standards for women. One potential way to express empathy and start a deeper conversation could sound like this: \u201cIsn\u2019t it a shame women feel so much pressure to look a certain way, especially in this season of life?\u201d Externalizing and rejecting beauty ideals can be an opening to start resisting the other ways mothers often feel they don\u2019t measure up. There is an important reminder every mom needs to hear all year long, McLellan said: \u201cYou are already worthy. Who you are today is wonderful. You are absolutely enough, and you are doing enough.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/health/mothers-day-less-body-shaming-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_08_27_health_sarin-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s some background information about sarin, a man-made nerve agent developed for chemical warfare.  Facts Sarin is a liquid that is clear, colorless, tasteless and odorless.  Sarin is an extremely volatile nerve agent because of its ability to change from liquid to gas.  If it evaporates into a gas, it can spread into the environment. Sarin\u2019s designation by NATO is GB. People are exposed to sarin through skin contact, eye contact or by breathing it in. Sarin can also be mixed with water or food. Sarin dissipates quickly, presenting an immediate but short-lived threat. Sarin\u2019s main ingredient is methyl phosphonyl difluoride. Effects Mild or moderately exposed people usually recover completely. Severely exposed people are not likely to survive. Symptoms of mild to moderate exposure include (from the CDC) Runny noseWatery eyesSmall, pinpoint pupilsEye painBlurred visionDrooling and excessive sweatingCoughChest tightnessRapid breathingDiarrheaIncreased urinationConfusionDrowsinessWeaknessHeadacheNausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal painSlow or fast heart rate Symptoms of severe exposure include Loss of ConsciousnessConvulsionsParalysisRespiratory failure possibly leading to death Treatment Leave the area of contamination as quickly as possible. Seek fresh air if exposure occurs indoors. If exposure is outdoors, head to higher ground as sarin is heavier than air and sinks. Remove contaminated clothing, flush eyes with water, and wash skin with soap and water.  If ingested, do not induce vomiting or flush with fluids.  Medical care should be sought immediately. Antidotes are available in many hospitals.  Timeline 1938 - Sarin is developed in Germany as a pesticide. April-May 1967 - The US military secretly tests sarin in the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve on the island of Hawaii. The testers detonate sarin-filled 155mm artillery shells to study how the nerve agent disperses in a tropical jungle. The Pentagon confirms the \u201cRed Oak\u201d program in November 2002. March 16, 1988 - The Iraqi air force attacks the northern Iraq town of Halabja with poison gases that were thought to include sarin, VX and other deadly compounds. Reports indicate that 5,000 people died in the attack. Countless others suffer eyesight loss, respiratory ailments and cancers.  June 27, 1994 - In Japan, seven people die and more than 500 are hospitalized when the Aum Supreme Truth (or Aum Shinri Kyo) cult releases sarin from a truck by driving slowly around an apartment complex in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture. Another victim dies in 2008.  March 20, 1995 - The Aum Supreme Truth cult, now known as Aleph, places plastic bags of sarin on trains that converge in the Tokyo government district during rush hour. Thirteen people die and more than 5,000 become ill. May 17, 2004 - A coalition convoy in Baghdad finds sarin gas in an artillery round that had been rigged as an improvised explosive device. The IED detonates as officials attempt to defuse it. Two members of the explosive ordinance team suffer minor exposure. June 23, 2006 - The US Army releases a report to Congress stating that allied forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions containing degraded mustard or sarin gas since the start of the Iraq War in 2003. The weapons were produced before the 1991 Gulf War. However, according to October 2014 reporting by the New York Times, even at the time of the report\u2019s publication the information was \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cunderstated.\u201d  June 15, 2012 - Katsuya Takahashi, 54, the last fugitive suspect in the 1995 sarin attacks on the Tokyo subway, is captured by Japanese police, ending a 17-year manhunt. April 25, 2013 - US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announces that Syria has used sarin on a small scale, killing 150 people in the country.   August 21, 2013 - A new alleged chemical weapons attack kills more than 1,000 people in the Syrian countryside outside its capital, Damascus. Hundreds of those killed are children. September 1, 2013 - US Secretary of State John Kerry announces that samples of blood and hair taken from eastern Damascus have \u201ctested positive for signatures of sarin.\u201d September 16, 2013 - UN weapons inspectors return \u201coverwhelming and indisputable\u201d evidence of the use of sarin in Syria, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says. January 4, 2016 - The UN releases a report that indicates Syrians may have been exposed to a sarin-type gas in 11 instances. The UN based its report on a publication by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Source of the gas and those responsible for its use are being investigated. April 4, 2017 - An airstrike on a rebel-held town in northwestern Syria leaves 89 civilians dead, including children, from a suspected chemical attack, using sarin gas. The US, Turkey and other Western states blame the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who vehemently denies the accusation. The following week, UK scientists claim to have evidence that sarin gas, or a similar substance, was used based on samples from victims. Investigations continue to confirm the gas used and those responsible. April 26, 2017 - French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault announces that samples taken from the attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun matched those from a previous incident, and that the evidence provides proof that the Syrian regime is responsible for carrying out the attack on April 4. July 2018 - Cult leader Shoko Asahara and twelve other members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult are executed for their roles in the 1995 Tokyo sarin attack. May 11, 2022 - In a study, researchers find that exposure to the nerve gas sarin may be the cause of Gulf War illness, a condition affecting US veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War.  July 7, 2023 \u2013 US president Joe Biden announces that the US military has destroyed the last of its stockpile of chemical weapons. The weapons, containing sarin, had been stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky since the 1940s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2013/08/27/health/sarin-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_world_russia-ukraine-war-migrating-eagles-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Greater spotted eagles are already a species under threat. Now, scientists have found that they have been facing yet another danger: the war in Ukraine. Eagles have been exposed to conflict events while migrating through Ukraine, forcing them to deviate from their usual flight path, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. Listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, greater spotted eagles have been largely eradicated from western and central Europe, according to the study. However, Polesia, a large wetland region that borders Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, remains a stronghold for the species. On March 1, 2022, a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, the first of 21 tagged greater spotted eagles crossed into Ukraine on its usual migration, according to researchers from the UK and Estonia. \u201cWhen the conflict started in February 2022, we were kind of watching things unfold on the news like everyone else, but sitting there also with the feeling that we know our birds are about to pass through that area and wondering what that might mean for them,\u201d lead study author Charlie Russell, a conservation scientist and ornithologist who is studying for his PhD at the UK\u2019s University of East Anglia, told CNN Tuesday. Using conflict data and GPS tracking, the researchers quantified the impact of the conflict on the migratory behaviour of 19 eagles who were passing though Ukraine northward to breeding grounds in southern Belarus between March and April 2022. The study authors found that the eagles diverted significantly from their usual flight path when compared to pre-conflict migrations between 2019 and 2021, with the eagles flying further and less directly to breeding grounds. While the researchers did not have direct observational evidence to determine the stimuli the birds could respond to, they thought noise and light from military activities could have affected their behavior. The deviations were found to be greater at areas where the route of migration coincided with more military activity, but it differed for each bird due to varying exposures and responses to conflict, according to the researchers. Due to greater deviations, the birds had to travel further and their migrations also took longer to complete. Females, for example, spent an average of 246 hours travelling to breeding grounds, rather than the pre-conflict time of around 193 hours, according to the study. The eagles travelled 85 kilometers (53 miles) further on average and, in an extreme case, one bird flew an extra 250 kilometers (155 miles) further compared to previous years, Russell said. Males were found to travel more slowly, averaging a speed of around 7.66 meters (25 feet) per second, rather than the pre-conflict average of around 9.75 meters (32 feet) per second. The researchers observed no difference in migration performance and deviation patterns outside of Ukraine, according to the study. Potential breeding risk The other significant finding was that the birds were making less stopovers than in previous years. Stopover sites are essential places for the eagles to get food, water, rest and refuel, and shelter from poor weather during their long journeys, according to researchers. While 18 tracked individuals \u2013 90% of the tracked eagles \u2013 made stopovers in Ukraine while migrating between 2018 and 2021, only six made stopovers in 2022. In the years before the conflict, 11 of the eagles used common stopover sites in Ukrainian Polesia, but these sites were not used at all in 2022. \u201cThe combination of these two things, having to fly forever and expend more energy, and the reduced ability to recover that energy, is something that we think will have had sublethal fitness costs, which might have carried over into the breeding period that year,\u201d Russell added. Reduced fitness and the delayed onset of breeding due to spending more time recovering from the journey could reduce breeding success, which is already relatively low in the population, as well as impact chick provisioning and the fledgling date of young birds, according to the study. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to understand the different stresses that the environment is facing as a result of conflict so that in a post-conflict setting, we can better support not just greater spotted eagles but the wider ecosystems as well to recover,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe know very little about the impacts of human conflicts on wildlife, particularly when it comes to migratory species, so this study plugs an important knowledge gap,\u201d professor Nathalie Pettorelli, an applied ecologist and senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London, told CNN Tuesday. Pettorelli, who was not involved in the study, added that understanding what affects the eagles\u2019 survival is \u201ckey\u201d to ensuring they have a future. \u201cMore broadly, human conflicts are on the rise globally, stressing the need for more research on the impacts of conflicts on biodiversity and, where possible, for the development of effective mitigation policies,\u201d Pettorelli said. Ukraine accused Russia of \u201cecocide\u201d after suffering an environmental catastrophe in July due to the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country that led to more than 100 people being killed, as well as the destruction of farmland and nature reserves. Russell said the war in Ukraine is \u201creally raising the profile of some of the environmental issues caused by conflict. And it\u2019s not just in Ukraine. This is something that\u2019ll be happening to different extents at other conflict zones as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/russia-ukraine-war-migrating-eagles-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_health_maycember-survival-guide-wellness", "text": "When my kids were in elementary school, the weeks between spring break and summer vacation seemed to go by at warp speed, mostly because I spent most of that time running the children from event to event in between work meetings. From Spring Sing to Mother\u2019s Day breakfast to field day and beyond, there was always a reason to be at school, send something to school or procure some special outfit for some event at school. It was exhausting. Cut to the teen years. You might think it\u2019s a little less intense, and perhaps parents of teens are even just a bit nostalgic for a Spring Sing, but sadly that\u2019s not the case. Sugar-fueled class parties were replaced with stress-fueled study groups for Advanced Placement exams, and field day morphed into an endless loop of sports tournaments (all of which require at least 45 minutes of commuting), not to mention prom, volunteer hours, extra credit projects, awards ceremonies, banquets, fundraisers and requests for parent volunteers to assist with a long list of school events. \u201cMaycember\u201d is a term that online content creators the Holderness family coined to describe the sheer chaos of the month of May, much like the month of December. Regardless of the age of your kids, both May and December are packed with social and school-related responsibilities, and it can become overwhelming. Sometimes it feels like Mayhem. Between the nonnegotiables, such as standardized testing and preparing for finals, and the carrots dangled to help them succeed, such as extra credit projects and appearances, teens are running on empty as the school year comes to an end. While it\u2019s certainly a nice gift to earn extra credit points by attending a school event, time off to rest on the weekend is another gift most exhausted teens can use as they crawl toward the finish line. While the teen years are generally characterized by increased independence and spending more time with friends than family, the expectations for parent involvement remain high this time of year. Though I\u2019ve been known to \u201cbuy time\u201d by donating extra funds if I can\u2019t take time off from work to volunteer on campus, there\u2019s still a lot to do before we store the backpacks for the season. While so many of these May obligations are impossible to move, I\u2019ve learned that there are some ways to make this time of year a little less hectic. Try these suggestions if you like \u2014 but don\u2019t make them another obligation! Hold your boundaries Setting boundaries is easy; it\u2019s holding boundaries that can be tricky. I\u2019m always grateful for the people who volunteer their time to head up committees on the PTA or parent board. Schools need parents who can transform ideas into reality and make things happen. It\u2019s their job to seek help (sometimes on repeat) until every action item is accounted for and every event is complete, but not every parent can volunteer for every event. Be clear and confident with your boundaries. If you can\u2019t volunteer for an event, but you can make a financial contribution, do that. If you can\u2019t do either, say that you would love to help another time. It\u2019s important to set boundaries around your time for volunteering, but it\u2019s equally important to set boundaries with your own kids. If attending every event isn\u2019t possible, talk with your kids about the events they hope you\u2019ll attend and why, then make a plan that works for everyone. You might even ask a grandparent or other relative to attend an event on your behalf. Telling your family that you simply can\u2019t do it all might feel like a failure, but it\u2019s a valuable life lesson. When families learn to prioritize, they take the time to consider what an event means to them and why it\u2019s important to attend. One way to start this conversation is to ask each kid to list their top three events for May and discuss them over an ice cream cone. You might even find that the things you thought were important (prom!) come in second place to something completely different (quiz bowl, anyone?). Parent guilt is real, and it can feel like missing these moments will be remembered for a lifetime. But the truth is that kids will remember the time you spent together and how they felt in your presence. Kids crave relational safety from their parents, not a camera roll full of snapshots from school events. Prioritize mental health No good comes from a family running around from event to event without a moment even to enjoy the ones they attend. Just like it\u2019s OK to skip out on some holiday parties in December, families are not required to respond \u201cyes\u201d to every invitation for end of the year celebrations. Particularly with teens, it\u2019s essential to model positive actions that promote mental health. Teens are wired to do all the things, so they don\u2019t always make the choice to slow down and pay attention to their minds and bodies. Parents can help by creating some mental health safe zones. Creating quiet nights to offset the celebrations takes the guesswork out of it for teens. Instead of trying to manage multiple events, they can simply say, \u201cI have a family thing tonight,\u201d and take a break from the action. Will every teen love this approach? No. That\u2019s OK. It\u2019s not your job to win coolest parent ever, but it is your job to help your teens learn to slow down when life gets overwhelming. They\u2019ll thank you for it one day. Watch your social media consumption People love to worry about how scrolling through social media affects teens, but not nearly enough attention is paid to how the same behavior affects parents. Seeing the perfect report cards, perfect test scores and parent attendance at every single thing can really wear you down, but you don\u2019t have to go there. You can set a time limit on your phone to decrease your own scrolling and think about replacement behaviors that feel better. I don\u2019t often feel great after getting lost in social media, but I always feel good after a rousing game of Bananagrams with my teens. It\u2019s an easy swap. Give yourself a break from comparison culture and focus on enjoying the time you can spend with your family during this busy season. In a few short weeks, Maycember will be behind us for another year, and we\u2019ll all breathe a sigh of relief. (Don\u2019t get me started about camp.) Until then, focus on relationship building over checking things off the list. You\u2019ll be glad you did.

{"id": "2024_05_20_health_gene-test-success-weight-loss-medications", "text": "One of the big mysteries with popular GLP-1 medications for weight loss is why some people will lose 20% or more of their starting body weight on the drugs while for others, the scale will barely budge. One study found that about 1 in 7 people who used semaglutide \u2013 which is approved for weight loss under the brand name Wegovy \u2013 for more than a year didn\u2019t lose at least 5% of their starting weight, indicating that the drug didn\u2019t work well for them. Now, research suggests that the answer may lie in a person\u2019s genes. The study shows that a new test that assigns a genetic risk score may be able to help people figure out whether they are likely to be successful on injected weight loss medications. \u201cWe think that the test will be able to explain who will be able to lose weight, and we can predict with 95% accuracy who will lose more than 5% with this genetic test,\u201d said Dr. Andres Acosta, a gastroenterologist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic who helped develop the test. Acosta points out that these medications aren\u2019t cheap.\u00a0They\u2019re not always covered by insurance, and if they are, they may come with a high copay. Being able to predict whether the drugs will work could save people a lot of frustration and money. The test, MyPhenome, was developed by researchers at the Mayo Clinic and was licensed last year by a company called Phenomix Sciences.\u00a0It costs $350 and must be ordered by a health care provider.  It looks for 6,000 changes in 22 genes that lie in the signaling pathway for the GLP-1 hormone, and it uses the results to assign each person a risk score that classifies them as either \u201chungry gut\u201d-positive or \u201chungry gut\u201d-negative. People who are hungry gut-positive have normal responses to hormone signaling in the brain, whereas people who are hungry gut-negative don\u2019t seem to respond as well to hormonal signals from the stomach that tell the brain to stop eating.\u00a0Acosta says the test classifies those people as having a hungry brain, and they may need different types of interventions to lose weight, such as bariatric surgery. In a recent small study of 84 people enrolled in a weight loss registry at the Mayo Clinic, researchers ran the test on stored blood or saliva samples. After nine months on semaglutide, people who were classified as hungry gut-positive had lost significantly more weight than those were hungry gut-negative. After a year, people classified as hungry gut-positive had lost an average of 19% of their starting weight, or nearly twice as much, on average, as the 10% of total body weight lost by people who were classified by the test as hungry-gut negative. The study is slated to be presented Monday at the Digestive Disease Week conference in Washington, DC.\u00a0It has not been scrutinized by outside experts or published in a medical journal, so its conclusions are considered preliminary. \u201cWe do need to test these in a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial that we have done for other medications. That\u2019s the highest gold standard,\u201d Acosta said.  \u201cBut at this point, we can say that these outcomes were in patients who were blinded to the results as well as the investigation,\u201d he added, meaning they didn\u2019t know whether they were hungry gut-positive or -negative while they were using the drug.

The New Shepard rocket and capsule lifted off at 9:36 a.m. CT (10:36 a.m. ET) from the Jeff Bezos-founded company\u2019s facilities on a private ranch in West Texas. NS-25, Blue Origin\u2019s seventh crewed flight to date, carried six customers aboard the capsule: venture capitalist Mason Angel; Sylvain Chiron, founder of the French craft brewery Brasserie Mont-Blanc; software engineer and entrepreneur Kenneth L. Hess; retired accountant Carol Schaller; aviator\u00a0Gopi Thotakura; and Ed Dwight, a retired US Air Force captain selected by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to be the nation\u2019s first Black astronaut candidate. Despite completing training at the Aerospace Research Pilot School\u00a0and receiving an Air Force recommendation, Dwight ultimately didn\u2019t make the NASA Astronaut Corps. He went on to become an entrepreneur and a sculptor; a new National Geographic documentary on Black astronauts, \u201cThe Space Race,\u201d highlights Dwight\u2019s pioneering story. \u201cI had no intention of being an astronaut. That was the last thing on my bucket list,\u201d Dwight said in the documentary. \u201cBut once I was given the challenge, then everything changes.\u201d Dwight completed that challenge and reached the edge of space at the age of 90, making him the oldest person to venture to such heights, according to a spokesperson from Blue Origin. \u201cI thought I didn\u2019t need it in my life,\u201d Dwight said of the experience on Blue Origin\u2019s livestream after the capsule touched down at 9:46 a.m. CT (10:46 a.m. ET). \u201cBut I lied. I really, really did need it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing experience,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody needs to do this.\u201d The rocket booster landed safely a couple minutes prior to the capsule. During the mission, the crew soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. The rocket vaulted the capsule past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, an area 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface that is\u00a0widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot of\u00a0gray area. And at the peak of the flight, passengers experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and striking views of Earth through the cabin windows. The launch followed the success of an uncrewed science mission in December \u2014 the New Shepard program\u2019s first flight since the mishap more than a year earlier. New Shepard\u2019s 2022 failure A New Shepard rocket and spacecraft were set to launch a batch of science instruments on September 12, 2022. But one minute into flight, the rocket endured Max Q \u2014 an aerospace term that refers to a moment of maximum stress on a vehicle. It occurs when the rocket is at a relatively low altitude \u2014 where the atmosphere is still fairly thick \u2014 but the spacecraft is moving at high speeds, creating a moment of intense pressure on the vehicle. Around that time, the rocket appeared to emit a massive burst of flames. The New Shepard capsule, which rides atop the rocket, then initiated its launch abort system \u2014 firing up a small engine to blast itself safely away from the malfunctioning rocket. That system worked as intended, parachuting the capsule to a safe landing. Blue Origin later\u00a0revealed\u00a0that the cause of the failure was a problem with the engine nozzle, a large cone that directs the flaming exhaust at the rocket\u2019s bottom. Onboard computers accurately detected the failure and shut the engine down, according to the company. No injuries were reported on the ground, and Blue Origin said the science payloads and the capsule could be flown again. But the rocket, left without a functioning engine, smashed back into the ground\u00a0and was destroyed. Typically after New Shepard launches, the rocket booster guides itself back to a safe upright landing so it can be flown again. During a December interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Bezos\u00a0said the escape system that jettisoned the capsule to safety is the most difficult piece of engineering in the entire rocket \u2014 but \u201cit is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone go on New Shepard.\u201d \u201cThe (rocket) booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it,\u201d Bezos added. \u201cThe power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. \u2026 So the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. \u201cA tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view \u2026 to be as safe as one can make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it perfectly safe. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Rocket fix and return to service The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches and is charged with ensuring public safety, oversaw an investigation into the failure. The probe revealed that the engine nozzle failed because it experienced higher temperatures than what the company had anticipated. To fix the issue, Blue Origin said it implemented \u201cdesign changes to the combustion chamber\u201d \u2014 the area of the engine where fuel explosively mixes with oxidizer \u2014 and adjusted \u201coperating parameters,\u201d or the data that the company uses to model safe flights. \u201cAdditional design changes to the nozzle have improved structural performance under thermal and dynamic loads,\u201d the company said in a March 2023\u00a0statement. The FAA formally concluded the mishap investigation on September 27, 2023, outlining 21 \u201ccorrective actions\u201d Blue Origin needed to implement before returning to flight. The agency did not reveal details on what those actions were,\u00a0noting the report\u00a0\u201ccontains proprietary data and U.S \u00a0Export Control\u00a0information and is not available for public release.\u201d The changes and New Shephard\u2019s successful December flight teed up the company to restart its trips to space for thrill seekers. Before the September 2022 failure, New Shepard rockets had flown 22 consecutive successful missions \u2014 including six with passengers on board.\u00a0Bezos flew aboard the rocket\u00a0in 2021. Other notable space tourists previously carried by the vehicle include \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor William Shatner and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host Michael Strahan.

{"id": "2024_05_22_health_michigan-bird-flu-human-case", "text": "A case of H5 influenza, also known as avian influenza or bird flu, has been reported in a farm worker in Michigan who had regular exposure to infected livestock, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s the second case reported as part of an ongoing outbreak of the virus in birds and cattle across the country and the third bird flu case ever reported in a person in the US. However, health officials emphasized Wednesday that the risk to the general public remains low. The person was being monitored for the virus because of their exposure to infected cattle, the CDC said in a news release Wednesday. A nasal swab tested negative for influenza at the state health department and later at the CDC, but an eye swab tested positive. The person reported only eye symptoms, and they have recovered. Eye symptoms such as redness, swelling and watering were also the only ones reported in the previous\u00a0human case\u00a0in this outbreak, in a dairy farm worker in Texas. That man took antiviral medications and recovered with no lasting problems. \u201cIt is not unexpected that comprehensive testing identified a human infection,\u201d the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cInformation to date suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person.\u201d The Michigan farm worker was one of about 170 people enrolled in an active monitoring program in which they received a text message from the state health department each day that asks about potential symptoms. When the person indicated the presence of symptoms, public health workers took samples, offered antiviral medications to them and their close contacts, and urged them to isolate. The CDC received the samples on Tuesday and reported the test results to Michigan health officials that night, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC. \u201cThis case was not unexpected,\u201d Shah said Wednesday, emphasizing the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to help farms prepare for the spread of the virus. \u201cIt does not change our assessment of the risk overall. What it does do, however, is it reinforces the message that CDC has been putting out since late March, which is that entities involved with this \u2013 be they local health departments, farms, farm workers and farm worker organizations \u2013 ought to be alert but not alarmed by these developments. \u201cWe have not seen evidence of other cases in this area or elsewhere in any of our monitoring systems, let alone any evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is reassuring, but the work of public health is not done. In the coming days, we\u2019ll have additional information on the genomic sequence or the DNA fingerprint of this particular virus. And we\u2019ll be able to compare it to the virus from infected cows in Michigan, as well as to compare it to the virus from the earlier human case in Texas.\u201d The fact that the nasal specimen tested negative while the eye swab was positive is also, \u201cin a sense, reassuring,\u201d Shah said, as it indicates a reduced likelihood that the virus is spreading through respiration. Although remnants of the virus have been found in samples of dairy products purchased from grocery stores, the US Food and Drug Administration \u201ccontinues to affirm our assessment of the safety of the commercial milk supply,\u201d Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the agency\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said Wednesday. \u201cTo date, the totality of the evidence \u2013 including studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization against multiple pathogens, recent studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] and eggs at lower temperatures than generally used in dairy products, and negative retail sample results to date \u2013 continue to indicate the commercial milk supply is safe. We also continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk\u201d or milk that has not been pasteurized. Testing with a substitute virus in ground beef found some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, but it was present at \u201cmuch, much reduced levels,\u201d according to Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the US Department of Agriculture, and it\u2019s not clear whether it would be enough to make someone sick.

{"id": "2024_05_23_health_weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-young-people", "text": "The number of young people in the US who are prescribed GLP-1 agonist drugs\u00a0like Wegovy and Ozempic for weight loss and diabetes soared 594.4% in just three years, according to new research. Demand for these drugs has skyrocketed for people of all ages recently, but the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal JAMA, found that between 2020 and 2023, the number of prescriptions written for people ages 12 to 25 increased from 8,722 to 60,567. Young women and adolescent girls had the biggest increase in the number of prescriptions. The study looked information from a database that reports prescriptions from more than 93% of retail pharmacies in the United States, although the data cannot capture what exactly the prescriptions were intended to treat and whether the patient actually used the medications. For context, the study authors also looked at prescription trends for other medications and found that there was a 3% decrease in the prescription of other drugs for this age category during this same time period. The study looked at Ozempic (which uses the active ingredient semaglutide), Trulicity (dulaglutide) and Byetta (exenatide), which are approved to treat type 2 diabetes and can help with weight loss, and Saxenda (liraglutide) and Wegovy (semaglutide), which are approved for weight management. Each can be prescribed for children as young as 10 or 12. Tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, is approved only for adults. The authors from the University of Michigan Medical School and Yale University said that, given how many young people are being prescribed these medications, efforts to promote safe and appropriate prescribing should include endocrinologists, doctors who practice family medicine and nurse practitioners. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are affecting an increasing number of young people. The number of people ages 10 to 19 with type 2 diabetes doubled just over the past two decades in the US, a 2023 study found. The study predicted that by 2060, the number of young people with type 2 diabetes will increase 673%. Obesity is also a significant problem for young people in the US, where the average young adult is now overweight, according to a 2023 study. About 1 in 6 adolescents is overweight, and almost 1 in 5 has obesity, studies show. Obesity alone affects 14.4 million children and teens in the US. Having obesity as a young person significantly increases a person\u2019s chance of weight problems when they are older, research shows. Obesity and overweight can also be a significant risk factor for other health conditions like heart disease, kidney problems and even cancer, studies show, in additional to mental health conditions. Dr. Melanie Cree, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado who has been working with this class of medication in clinical trials with children for almost a decade, says the drugs have been a game-changer not just to help kids lose weight and lower blood sugar, but also to  lower liver fat and improve cardiac and kidney function \u2013 \u201call of those conditions that go with type 2 diabetes.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s not only that they\u2019re lowering blood sugars. It\u2019s that they appear to be decreasing the complications that we see from type 2 diabetes, so that they\u2019re really affecting multiple aspects,\u201d said Cree, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cThey\u2019re really changing the face of what diabetes looks like in an individual and in the field of diabetes across the board.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics updated its guidelines for managing obesity last year and said that, in addition to behavior and lifestyle treatments for the whole family, the use of weight loss medications is appropriate for children 12 and over. Cree said she sees few downsides to these drugs. Some of her patients have had to stop taking them or can\u2019t take as much because of side effects like nausea, and she\u2019d like to see more research on that topic. When her patients can get access, Cree said, the positive changes have been significant. Many have experienced \u201cprofound\u201d weight loss, she said, transforming their lives. The most significant downsides have nothing to do with the physical impact of the medications; rather, it\u2019s that the medicine can be expensive and many of her patients can\u2019t get insurance to cover the cost, particularly if they\u2019re used for weight loss. Additionally, many patients have had a hard time filling prescriptions because of drug shortages. One parent of a child who lost a significant amount of weight told Cree that the medicine gave her her daughter back. \u201cI had another girl who, after some weight loss, went to prom last fall, and it was the first dance she had ever gone to, because it was the first time she felt comfortable wearing a dress,\u201d Cree said. \u201cSo really, really poignant stories from these adolescents. I just feel privileged to be a part of their life and be able to share in these transformations and moments with them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-young-people/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_health_flirt-covid-variants-summer-wave-risk", "text": "Covid-19 levels are about the lowest they\u2019ve ever been in the United States, but another new crop of virus variants once again threatens to disrupt the downward trend as the country heads into summer. KP.2 \u2014 one of the so-called FLiRT variants \u2014 has overtaken JN.1 to become the dominant coronavirus variant in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data through May 11 shows that it\u2019s responsible for more than a quarter of cases in the country, which is nearly twice as many as JN.1. A related variant, KP.1.1, has caused about 7% of cases, CDC data shows. FLiRT variants are offshoots of the JN.1 variant \u2014 all part of the broader Omicron family \u2014 that caused this winter\u2019s wave. The acronym in the name refers to the locations of the amino acid mutations that the virus has picked up \u2014 some in places that help it evade the body\u2019s immune response and others that help it become more transmissible. Covid-19 variants are \u201caccumulating mutations that do one of two things: They either cause antibodies that you\u2019ve accumulated from vaccination or infection to no longer bind to the to the virus \u2014 we call that escape from immunity \u2014 or they increase the strength in which the viruses bind to cells,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This has become a familiar pattern in the way the virus that causes Covid-19 continues to evolve, but experts say we still don\u2019t know enough to predict exactly where the changes will occur next or how they will affect the way the virus moves through the population. The mutations of the FLiRT variants make increased transmissibility \u2014 and a possible summer wave \u2014 a real threat. Covid-19 is settling into some seasonal patterns, which have included a summer bump in years past, but the exact level of risk for this year is unclear. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some variants in the past that start out kind of strong and then don\u2019t take over. These subvariants could progressively become dominant, or they could get up to accounting for somewhere between 20% and 40% of the cases and then just stay there. We just have to see,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThe virus continues to be in charge. It\u2019s going to tell us what it\u2019s going to do. All of our crystal balls are rather cloudy.\u201d Covid-19 surveillance has scaled back significantly since the US public health emergency ended a year ago, which also adds to the uncertainty. But the data that is available is consistent. For now, wastewater surveillance suggests that viral activity is very low and decreasing in all regions of the country, and Covid-19 hospitalization rates remain extremely low. \u201cWe learned from the laboratories that FLiRT variants appeared, so far, to be as transmissible as the other Omicron subvariants, which means they\u2019re really quite contagious. But they do not appear to be producing more severe disease or any sort of illness that\u2019s distinctive from the point of view of clinical presentation symptoms,\u201d Schaffner said. As of May 1, the requirement for all hospitals to report Covid-19 data to the federal government has expired. But Schaffner\u2019s Vanderbilt University Medical Center is part of a CDC-run surveillance network that continues to track trends based on a sample of hospitals that cover about 10% of the US population. Covid-19 hospitalization rates have fallen from nearly 8 new admissions for every 100,000 people in the first week of the year to about 1 new admission for every 100,000 people at the end of April, the data shows. While the FLiRT variants pose some risk this summer, experts remain focused on what might happen in the fall. \u201cIf I were to predict, I would say that this might result in a few extra cases, a small surge this summer. But it\u2019s really going to be about which variant is around when we get to the fall,\u201d Pekosz said. \u201cThe fall is probably when we should expect to see a surge of Covid cases. And if we have a variant around there that has a lot of these mutations that avoid immunity, then the potential in the fall to have a larger surge is greater.\u201d The fall and winter pose a greater risk because of the immunity that has built up in the population, he said. \u201cThe virus now needs better conditions to transmit, and those better conditions to transmit are probably going to happen in the fall when weather gets cooler, people are spending more time indoors and they\u2019re more likely to be in environments where respiratory virus transmission occurs more efficiently.\u201d Research published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA is a reminder of the burden that Covid-19 continues to have in the US. This winter, while Covid-19 hospitalization rates were far lower than they were in earlier years, it was still deadlier than the flu. A study of thousands of hospital patients found that 5.7% of Covid-19 patients died, compared with 4.2% of those hospitalized for influenza. In other words, Covid-19 carried about a 35% higher risk of death than flu. People who received the latest Covid-19 vaccine this past fall may still have some protection against the latest variants; that vaccine targeted a different strain but was found to be similarly effective against JN.1, and experts say that some of those benefits may extend to its FLiRT relatives. People who had a recent infection \u2014 especially since the start of the year, when JN.1 was prominent \u2014 may also have some protection. But immunity wanes over time. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee will meet to discuss recommendations for the version of the Covid-19 vaccine that will be available this fall. The meeting was postponed by about three weeks in order to \u201callow for additional time to obtain surveillance data\u201d to have \u201cmore up-to-date information when discussing and making recommendations,\u201d according to a post on the federal agency\u2019s website. For now, experts say, risk remains relatively low. \u201cAs with all things Covid, our outlook may change in a week or two. But at the moment, we\u2019re in really a very good place \u2014 the best place we\u2019ve been in for a long, long time,\u201d Schaffner said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/flirt-covid-variants-summer-wave-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}

Why you have a short attention span How can that be? \u201cIf we look at work in terms of switching projects, as opposed to the micro view of switching screens, we find people spend about 10\u00bd  minutes in any work project before being interrupted \u2014 internally or by someone else \u2014 and then switch to another work project,\u201d Mark said. Yes, but then we go back to the original work, right? Wrong, Mark said. Instead, when we are interrupted on project two, we switch yet again to a different task \u2014 call it project three. Unbelievably, her research has shown we are also interrupted on project three and move on to project four.   \u201cAnd then you go back and pick up the original interrupted project,\u201d Mark said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019re interrupted and you do nothing. For over 25 minutes, you\u2019re actually working on other things.\u201d  (At least I can tell my boss that when I miss my deadline.) \u201cHowever, there\u2019s also a switch cost,\u201d Mark added. \u201cA switch cost is the time it takes you to reorient back to your work: \u2018Where was I? What was I thinking of?\u2019 That additional effort can also lead to errors and stress.\u201d How to focus Why is all of this a problem? After all, it\u2019s called multitasking, thought by many to be a highly prized skill for coping with the demands of the information age.  \u201cWith the exception of a few rare individuals, there is no such thing as multitasking,\u201d Mark said. \u201cUnless one of the tasks is automatic, like chewing gum or walking, you cannot do two effortful things at the same time.\u201d For example, she said, you can\u2019t read email and be in a video meeting. When you focus on one thing, you lose the other. \u201cYou\u2019re actually switching your attention very quickly between the two,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd when you switch your attention fast, it\u2019s correlated with stress.\u201d  Blood pressure rises. Heart rate speeds up. Psychological measures of stress also show negative outcomes, she said, such as more fatigue and mistakes and less productivity: \u201cThe more people multitask, the more errors they make.\u201d  Who did this to us? We did, of course, with the help of tech culprits such as social media, tablets and television. But Mark blames email the most.    \u201cTo me, email is probably the worst because it\u2019s become a symbol of work,\u201d she said, adding that her research has found a direct correlation between email and more stress. \u201cWe cut off email for some workers in an organization for one workweek,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing heart rate monitors, we found that they became significantly less stressed and were able to focus significantly longer.\u201d  (I find myself pausing to look up flights to Bora Bora. Oh, right. They have email there, too.) \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a person can just completely cut off from technology and work in today\u2019s world,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSo let\u2019s learn how to live with it in a way that maintains our positive well-being.\u201d How to increase your attention span Regaining your focus requires you to be mindful of how you are using technology, Mark said, a daunting task if you consider the average American spends at least 10 hours a day on screens. Paradoxically, you can use technology to help, she said. Schedule rote work for the first part of the day when you\u2019re not fully alert, then use technology to block distractions when you\u2019re at your mental best. At night, offload tasks from your brain by writing them down and then put the list away. Distracted by social media sites? Hide them, Mark said: \u201cTake the icons off your desktop and bury the apps on your phone inside folders, where it takes an extra effort to find them. Leave your phone in another room or put it in a drawer and lock it.\u201d    It\u2019s also important to learn when to take a break. \u201cIf you have to read something more than once or if the words are just not registering, it\u2019s time to stop and replenish,\u201d she said. The best break is a walk in nature: \u201cJust a 20-minute walk in nature can help significantly relax people,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd we found it can help people produce significantly more ideas \u2014 it\u2019s called divergent thinking.\u201d Too cold to walk outside? Do something engaging that takes no mental effort. \u201cI have a friend who is an MIT professor, and his favorite activity is matching socks,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnother friend likes to iron. Ideas can incubate and then we come back to the hard work, and we see it with fresh eyes.\u201d  ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/01/11/health/short-attention-span-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness", "text": "One may think young people are the main group enjoying the freedom of legalized weed, but in Canada, the greatest increase in users after legalization was among older adults \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s sending them to the hospital, according to new research. The rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults during the period of legalization of dried cannabis flower and edibles \u2014 October 2018 through December 2022 \u2014 in Canada was significantly higher than that of the pre-legalization period, according to a research letter published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Edibles, which include baked goods, candies and beverages, are increasingly popular, said lead research author Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician and clinician scientist at Sinai Health in Ontario. But some older adults may be unaware of the strength of today\u2019s weed, and little is known about the health effects of legalizing edible cannabis on older adults \u2014 the age group with the largest growth in overall cannabis use a year after dried cannabis flower was legalized in Canada, Stall said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an age-related bias that many health care practitioners, and frankly society, hold that older adults are not using drugs. And that\u2019s not true,\u201d Stall said. \u201cWe found that the largest increases in emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning among seniors occurred after edible cannabis became legal for retail sale in January 2020.\u201d The authors used the Ontario Ministry of Health\u2019s administrative data to examine the rates of emergency room visits for cannabis poisoning among older adults during the pre-legalization period \u2014 January 2015 to September 2018 \u2014 and the two legalization periods: October 2018 through December 2019, which permitted the sale of dried cannabis flower only, and January 2020 through December 2022, which marked the legalization of cannabis edibles. When people have cannabis poisoning, according to Stall, they may experience confusion; psychosis, including hallucinations; anxiety or panic attacks; rapid heartbeat; chest pain; nausea; and vomiting.\u00a0 During the eight-year study period, there were 2,322 emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults who were age 69 on average. Nearly 17% of those adults were simultaneously intoxicated with alcohol, about 38% had cancer and 6.5% had dementia. Compared with pre-legalization, legalization period No. 1 saw a twice higher rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning. The rate during the second legalization period tripled that of pre-legalization. \u201cThis study provides a cautionary tale of legalization of substances without adequate research, education, and counseling of users regarding adverse effects and safe usage, particularly in older adults,\u201d said Dr. Lona Mody and Dr. Sharon K. Inouye, who weren\u2019t involved in the research, in a commentary on the research. Mody is the Amanda Sanford Hickey Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Inouye is director of the Aging Brain Center at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research in Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The sneaky effects of edibles When it comes to explaining the higher rates, both unintentional and intentional use of edible cannabis are worth discussing, experts said. \u201cEdible cannabis products may be particularly dangerous because they are often indistinguishable from non-cannabis containing foods and may contain high amounts of THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), the major active ingredient in both medical and recreational cannabis,\u201d Mody and Inouye said. In his own practice, Stall has seen a common scenario resulting from the lack of distinction, he said: An emergency department doctor is not able to figure out why an older adult patient is neurologically impaired via any typical tests \u2014 only for a toxicology screen to come back positive for cannabis, much to the patient\u2019s surprise. \u201cThe other thing is that cannabis today is very different than cannabis was as recently as the early \u201990s and mid \u201980s,\u201d Stall explained. \u201cToday\u2019s cannabis extracts contain as much as 30 times more THC. \u2026 Older adults who may not have used cannabis in decades and are now trying again in this post-legalization era may not be aware.\u201d Additionally, age-related changes in organ function and how the drug is distributed throughout the body \u2014 as well as having health conditions or being on prescription drugs, especially psychoactive ones \u2014 can make it easier for an older adult to experience cannabis poisoning, Stall added. Some people who intentionally consume cannabis edibles may not be aware that this form has a more delayed effect than an inhalant, which goes straight to the bloodstream, he said. Thinking the edible isn\u2019t working, they take another one too soon and end up getting more than they bargained for. There are also people whose prescription medications for pain management, insomnia or dementia symptoms aren\u2019t effective, so they consume edibles for therapeutic purposes but without consulting a doctor first, Stall said. Reducing harm from cannabis use Abstaining from cannabis use may be \u201cappropriate\u201d for some individuals, but \u201cI would be hesitant to give a blanket recommendation (that) no other adults should be using this because there are people who are going to use it even if that recommendation is given,\u201d Stall said. Therefore, preventing cannabis-related harms in older adults requires a multipronged approach, he added, including storing cannabis edibles in locked locations and in clearly identified packaging. Products older adults intentionally use should have dosing information with specific guidance for older adults, \u201crecognizing that the amount of drug they may need is a lot less than younger populations,\u201d Stall said. \u201cIn geriatric medicine, we have a mantra: Start low and go slow. That same mantra applies here.\u201d The amount at which cannabis can become poisonous can depend on multiple personal factors, but some studies have indicated people should wait at least three hours before taking a second dose, Stall said. Health care providers should also have open and judgment-free conversations with older adults about cannabis use and its benefits and risks, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging doctors to be on the lookout for potentially deadly meningococcal disease linked to travel to Saudi Arabia. Since April, there have been 12 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease associated with travel for Umrah, an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad in Saudi Arabia. Believers in the Muslim faith make Umrah trips to Mecca throughout the year to receive blessings. Muslims also make a longer, more ritualized pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime during a set time of year called Hajj. This year\u2019s Hajj is June 14 to 19. Five of the pilgrims who got sick this year live in the United States. France has had four cases, and the United Kingdom has had three. Ten of the people who got sick had been to Mecca, and two had a close association with someone who did. Meningococcal disease is highly contagious among unvaccinated people. Of the patients whose vaccination status is known, nine were unvaccinated. Meningococcal disease, including meningitis, is an uncommon illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. It can cause infection in the lining of the brain and spinal cord that can cause a lifetime of medical problems such as memory and concentration issues, seizures, balance problems, hearing loss and blindness. The disease can also lead to a serious blood infection called septicemia or blood poisoning. Research shows that\u00a0an estimated\u00a010% to 15% of cases end in death, even with appropriate treatment. The number of cases in the US has been on the rise, according to the CDC. This year, 143 cases were reported as of the end of March, compared with 81 for the same period last year. There were 422 cases in all of 2023, the most since 2014, according to the CDC. Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics if it\u2019s caught early enough. However, diagnosis is often delayed because the symptoms can mimic those of other infectious diseases like Covid-19 or the flu. Symptoms include fever, a headache, nausea or vomiting, trouble walking, a stiff neck, a skin rash, sensitivity to light and brain fog. Tests of the bacteria in the newly confirmed cases showed that in one case in the US and one in France, it was resistant to ciprofloxacin, one of the first-line antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease. Eight cases responded to treatment with penicillin or ciprofloxacin. Vaccines and boosters available Saudi Arabia requires all Umrah or Hajj pilgrims age 1 and older to have gotten the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine, also known as the meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccine.\u00a0It protects against four variations of the bacteria that are in wide circulation:\u00a0A, C, W, and Y. Overall, most cases in the US are related to serogroup Y. In the US, doctors may also recommend the MenB vaccine to protect against the B-variation of the bacteria. A shot made by Pfizer that was approved in the US last year, Penbraya, protects against all five of these most common serogroups that cause meningococcal disease. Most of the pilgrims who got sick tested positive for the W variation. One case in the United States was caused by serogroup C. In the US, the vaccine is routinely recommended for all preteens and teens\u00a0and for some younger children and adults under specific circumstances. One such instance is before travel to countries where meningococcal disease is more common. This includes a recommendation for a booster if the last time a traveler got the shot was three to five or more years before their trip. The CDC said Monday that health care providers should work with patients who are considering travel for Hajj or Umrah to make sure they have received the MenACWY vaccine within the past five years or get the shot at least 10 days before they leave for their trip. In the new notice, which was issued through the CDC\u2019s Health Alert Network, the agency also reminded providers to suspect meningococcal disease in anyone who has symptoms after recent travel for Hajj or Umrah. The CDC told health departments and providers to consider using several of the preferred antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease in people associated with travel to Mecca. People who come into close contact with someone with meningococcal disease should get an antibiotic as soon as possible after exposure, regardless of their vaccination status, the CDC said, and ideally within a day after the initial patient has been identified. The most recent outbreak connected to a mass gathering was in 2000-01, the CDC said, and it was primarily caused by the W variation of the bacteria. It\u2019s only since 2002 that Saudi Arabia has required all pilgrims to provide proof of vaccination against meningococcal disease, but vaccination coverage among these travelers is \u201cknown to be incomplete,\u201d the CDC said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness", "text": "The nightmares are intense and often horrifying, sometimes lasting well into the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a serial killer after me and the last few years I have the same one,\u201d according to a Canadian patient. \u201cHe\u2019s got my legs or something I can still feel something on my legs even when I\u2019m then awake.\u201d Another English patient described nightmares \u201cwhere I can\u2019t breathe and where someone is sitting on my chest.\u201d Yet another shared stories of \u201creally nasty\u201d violent visions in their sleep. \u201cHorrific, like murders, like skin coming off people,\u201d said one Irish patient about his nightmares. \u201cI think it\u2019s like when I\u2019m overwhelmed which could be the lupus being bad \u2026 so I think the more stress my body is under then the more vivid and bad the dreaming would be.\u201d Nightmares and \u201cdaymares,\u201d dreamlike hallucinations that appear when awake, may be little-known signs of the onset of lupus and other systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to a new study published Monday in the journal eClinicalMedicine. Such unusual symptoms may also be a signal that an established disease may be about to intensely worsen or \u201cflare\u201d and require medical treatment, said lead study author Melanie Sloan, a researcher in the department of public health and primary care at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. \u201cThis is particularly the case in a disease like lupus, which is well known for affecting multiple organs including the brain, but we also found these patterns of symptoms in the other rheumatological diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and systemic sclerosis,\u201d Sloan said in an email. Lupus is a long-term disease in which the body\u2019s immune system goes haywire, attacking healthy tissue and causing inflammation and pain in any part of the body, including blood cells, the brain, heart, joints and muscles, kidneys, liver, and lungs. \u201cCognitive problems and many of these other neuropsychiatric symptoms we studied can have a huge influence on people\u2019s lives, ability to work, to socialize, and just to have as much of a normal life as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThese symptoms are often invisible and (currently) untestable but that shouldn\u2019t make them any less important to be considered for treatment and support.\u201d Jennifer Mundt, an assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who was not involved in the study, said in an email she was pleased the study focused on nightmares. \u201cAlthough nightmares are a very distressing problem in many medical and psychiatric conditions, they rarely get focused on except in the context of PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome),\u201d Mundt said. \u201cA\u00a0recent study\u00a0showed that 18% of people with long-COVID have (frequent) nightmares, and this compares to a general population prevalence of about 5%,\u201d she said. \u201cHearing the patient perspective is critical so that research and clinical care can be guided by what is most important to patients themselves.\u201d Doctors and patients need to know While research in the field is rather new, a March 2019 study found patients with inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases also experienced nightmares and other REM sleep disorders such as sleep paralysis. REM is short for rapid eye movement, the stage of sleep in which people dream and information and information and experiences are consolidated and stored in memory. In that study, one 57-year-old man recalled being \u201cthreatened by feral birds of prey\u201d in his nightmares, while a 70-year-old woman dreamed her nephew was in grave danger but she could do nothing to help him. The new study surveyed 400 doctors and 676 people living with lupus and also conducted detailed interviews with 50 clinicians and 69 people living with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including lupus. Researchers found 3 in 5 lupus patients, and 1 in 3 patients with other rheumatology-related diseases, had increasingly vivid and distressing nightmares just before their hallucinations. These nightmares often involved falling or being attacked, trapped, or crushed or committing murder. \u201cI\u2019d be riding a horse, going around cutting people out with my sword. One of them was somebody attacking me and I ended up slitting their throat,\u201d the English patient said. \u201cI\u2019m not a violent person at all. I don\u2019t even kill an insect,\u201d the patient continued. \u201cAnd I came to the conclusion that\u2019s probably me fighting my own (autoimmune) system. \u2026 I\u2019m probably attacking myself, that\u2019s the only thing I can logically make sense out of it. Systemic autoimmune diseases often have a range of symptoms, called prodromes, that appear as signs of a sudden and possibly dangerous worsening of the condition. In lupus, for example, headaches, an increase in fatigue, painful, swollen joints, rashes, dizziness and a fever without an infection are well-known signs of an upcoming flare. Recognizing these warning signs are important, Sloan said, because they allow \u201cearlier detection and therefore treatment of flares, some of which can be organ damaging and even fatal in lupus patients.\u201d However, unique warning symptoms such as nightmares and daymares are not in the diagnostic criteria for lupus or other diseases, Sloan said. The study found doctors infrequently ask about such experiences, and patients often avoid talking about them to their physicians. \u201cWe are strongly encouraging more doctors to ask about nightmares and other neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 thought to be unusual, but actually very common in systemic autoimmunity \u2014 to help us detect disease flares earlier,\u201d said senior study author David D\u2019Cruz, a consultant rheumatologist at Guy\u2019s Hospital and Kings College London. Connect the dots to autoimmune disease On first glance, it would make sense that such neurological manifestations as nightmares would occur if the autoimmune disease impacts the brain, which lupus often does, Sloan said. But that\u2019s not what the study uncovered. \u201cInterestingly, we found that lupus patients who were classified as having organ involvement other than the brain, such as kidneys or lungs, often also reported a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the lead up to their kidney/lung flare,\u201d Sloan said via email. \u201cThis suggests that monitoring these symptoms \u2014 such as nightmares and changing mood \u2014 as well as the usual rashes and protein in the urine (due to inflammation in the kidneys), etc., may help with earlier flare detection in many patients, not just those who go on to develop major brain involvement,\u201d she said. However, there is no reason for people with occasional nightmares or daytime dreams to be worried they may have an inflammatory autoimmune disease, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. \u201cThis study could alarm the general public into believing or worrying\u00a0about whether they have lupus or a related autoimmune disorder if they have nightmares or hallucinations, which are what doctors call \u2018nonspecific symptoms,\u2019 meaning that a variety of conditions (medical and psychiatric) can manifest with these symptoms,\u201d Schenck said in an email. It is indeed \u201cperfectly normal\u201d to have occasional nightmares and even daymares, or hallucinations, which \u201care also more common than we think,\u201d Sloan said. However, if those are intense, upsetting and occur around other symptoms such as extreme fatigue, headaches and other signs of autoimmune disorders, they \u201cshould be discussed with a doctor,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be afraid or embarrassed to talk about these symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases, reporting these symptoms earlier, even if they seem strange and unconnected, may lead to the doctor being able to \u2018join the dot\u2019s\u2019 to diagnose an autoimmune disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_world_episodic-memory-mental-time-travel-eurasian-jays-scn", "text": "Real quick \u2014 what did you have for lunch yesterday? Were you with anyone? Where were you? Can you picture the scene? The ability to remember things that happened to you in the past, especially to go back and recall little incidental details, is a hallmark of what psychologists call episodic memory \u2014 and new research indicates that it\u2019s an ability humans may share with birds called Eurasian jays. With episodic memory, \u201cyou\u2019re remembering an event or an episode, hence the name,\u201d said James Davies, first author of the study that appeared May 15 in the journal PLOS One. \u201cYou kind of mentally relive it. It also involves other kinds of details that make up that experience, so sounds, sights, even your thoughts or your mood at the time.\u201d Episodic memory differs from semantic memory, which is the recall of factual information, added Davies, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Comparative Cognition Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s often helpful to think about episodic memory as remembering, whereas semantic memory is just knowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really a conscious recall involved.\u201d While episodic memory is integral to how most people experience the world, it can be difficult for scientists to prove whether nonhuman animals share this ability \u2014 after all, they can\u2019t tell us what they\u2019re thinking. However, for several decades, scientists have been devising experiments to delve into animals\u2019 ability to remember previous events, and they have found evidence of episodic-like memory in creatures as varied as pigeons, dogs and cuttlefish. Corvids \u2014 the group of birds that includes crows, ravens and jays \u2014 are famously smart, and previous studies have suggested that they are capable of episodic-like memory, which may help them find bits of food that they\u2019ve hidden for later. In 1998, Dr. Nicola Clayton devised an experiment with scrub jays in which the birds appeared to remember what kinds of foods they\u2019d hidden in different spots and how long ago. This means of finding evidence of episodic-like recall \u2014 called a \u201cwhat, when, where\u201d protocol \u2014 has become standard among scientists studying animal memory. But Davies, who is Clayton\u2019s advisee, wanted to find other ways to test for this cognitive capability. \u201cIf you\u2019re only using one methodology, then potentially there\u2019s some error in that method,\u201d Davies said. \u201cIf you use multiple different methodologies that test the same thing in quite different ways, then that leads to much more conclusive evidence.\u201d The researchers devised a fresh approach involving Eurasian jays,\u00a0and what they found could have implications for the study of human memory. Testing incidental memory Davies and Clayton\u2019s new experimental design drew upon the concept of incidental memory. \u201cThe idea is that with human episodic memory, we remember details of events that, at the time, weren\u2019t necessarily relevant to anything. We weren\u2019t actively trying to remember this,\u201d Davies said. \u201cBut then if you were to be asked about it a few days later, you might remember those details.\u201d It\u2019s a seemingly unimportant bit of information that you didn\u2019t consciously commit to memory \u2014 for instance, remembering what you had for lunch yesterday. This aspect of episodic memory is sometimes referred to as \u201cmental time travel.\u201d To find out whether Eurasian jays are capable of mental time travel, the researchers worked with birds that had been trained to find food hidden under cups. Davies set out a row of four identical red plastic cups and allowed the birds to observe him putting a piece of food under one of the cups. The jays then had to recall which cup the food had been hidden under. Easy enough. For the next step of the experiment, Davies made little changes to the cups\u2019 appearances, such as adding stickers or colorful strings, but once again hid the food under the same cup in the lineup. For a bird looking for a treat, those strings and stickers were seemingly unimportant incidental info \u2014 at this point, they only needed to worry about the position of the cup to find the food. But in the final stage of the experiment, those little details of cup decoration became unexpectedly important. Davies changed the position of the cups so that the birds could no longer rely on the once-crucial information of which cup in the row contained food. (The treats had since been removed from the cups, to rule out the possibility that the birds were just finding the food by scent.) However, after a 10-minute break, the jays were still able to find the cups with the treats. Davies suggested that the birds\u2019 mental process might have involved asking themselves, \u201c\u2018Where\u2019s the food? I remember going to the one with the black square on it. I\u2019ll go to that one,\u2019\u201d Davies said. The jays appeared to be going back in their memories to retrieve details about the cup decorations, and they were highly successful in using that information to find the hidden food. \u201cThis study provides strong evidence for episodic memory in Eurasian jays,\u201d said Dr. Jonathon Crystal, a provost professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Indiana Bloomington who was not involved with the project. \u201cIf you can answer that unexpected question after incidental encoding, that becomes a strong argument that you can remember back in time to the earlier episode, which is at the heart of documenting episodic memory.\u201d Crystal said that studies such as this one, which aim to identify animals\u2019 abilities to form episodic memories, are important in part because of their potential role in the field of human memory research. \u201cThe big disease of memory is Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and of course, the most debilitating aspect of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a profound loss of episodic memory,\u201d Crystal said. Since Alzheimer\u2019s drugs for humans invariably undergo animal testing before they reach human trials, he noted that it\u2019s important for scientists to be able to drill down into whether these drugs actually affect the kind of memories that Alzheimer\u2019s patients lose. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just improve memory, we need to improve episodic memory,\u201d he said, and a better understanding of how to test for episodic-like memory in animals could help make that possible.

{"id": "2024_05_22_health_bird-flu-wastewater-monitoring-texas", "text": "In early March, Dr. Blake Hanson and his colleagues at the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute were preparing for a fire drill of sorts. What if a virus with the potential to spark the next pandemic turned up in the wastewater they monitor?\u00a0And what if that virus was the bird flu, H5N1, which has killed millions of animals and about half the nearly 900 people it has infected worldwide over the past two decades? They gamed out this what-if exercise on a Monday.\u00a0By Thursday of that same week, Hanson\u2019s colleague, Dr. Michael Tisza, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was ringing the alarm. This time, it was not a drill. \u201cMike had called me and said, \u2018Hey, I think I found it,\u2019\u201d said Hanson, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston who uses big data methods and genomics to investigate infectious diseases. That was March 7, about three weeks before the US Department of Agriculture announced that H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas for the first time. A different kind of wastewater monitoring Over the past two years, as the idea of sampling sewer systems for the virus that causes Covid-19 and other pathogens has caught on across the country, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute \u2014 or TEPHI \u2014 took a different approach. Rather than looking only for specific viruses, researchers there decided to use advanced techniques and computers to help sift through the vast soup of genetic material in their wastewater samples.\u00a0By doing this, they\u2019re able to find viruses they expect to see as well as ones they don\u2019t know to look for. \u201cWe can capture every known virus that that\u2019s in the sample, and then the computational team will analyze the data comprehensively and see signals for many viruses, and that\u2019s the benefit, I think, of what we\u2019re doing relative to other sites,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Maresso, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who envisioned the system. At least two other organizations have also been looking for signs of H5N1 in wastewater. The WastewaterSCAN network, which is directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory Universities and Verily, recently posted a preprint study showing that it could detect the H5N1 virus in wastewater by looking for one specific part of the virus. In addition to that early data, the team has since tested three additional sewer systems: one in North Carolina near a known H5N1 cattle outbreak, one in a California city that was having an unseasonably high number of human influenza A cases and one in a city in Hawaii where there are no dairy processing plants and no known cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In each case, the test correctly ruled in or out H5N1 infections. It was so successful that WastewaterSCAN plans to start using the test at all 190 wastewater sites it monitors. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently launched a dashboard showing sites where influenza A viruses are being detected at unusually high levels. H5N1 is an A strain of the flu virus, like some types of seasonal flu.\u00a0Detecting A strains now, in the offseason, is a reasonable proxy for H5N1, Maresso said, but it will be a less useful approach when seasonal influenza picks up again in the winter. TEPHI\u2019s system, on the other hand, could serve as a first alert for new viruses, the holy grail of pandemic prevention.\u00a0Since the team started monitoring in 2022, they have found over 400 viruses in Texas wastewater. Data at the flush of a toilet Unlike taking a swab of a person\u2019s \u2014 or a cow\u2019s \u2013\u2014bodily secretions, wastewater monitoring is passive and doesn\u2019t depend on getting permission to test or having a person come into a clinic or emergency room, care that may be out of reach for farmworkers.\u00a0Researchers get data every time someone flushes a toilet or perhaps when wastewater systems treat agricultural waste, such as the permitted disposal of discarded milk.  The biggest drawback of wastewater monitoring is that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the pathogen. Since March 4, the date of the sample in which H5N1 was first detected by the TEPHI group, the researchers have found it all over the state, in the wastewater of nine cities in Texas and in 19 of the 23 sites they monitor.\u00a0They did not name the cities they tested in the study but said they did notify local public health authorities and the CDC about their results. Their findings were published recently as a preprint study, ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. Source of the signal is still a mystery \u201cWe don\u2019t really know where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d said Dr. Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHouston School of Public Health and director of TEPHI. \u201cWe can all guess, and some people have their favorite ideas,\u201d he said, noting that Texas is in the path of two major flyways for migratory birds and has a large agricultural industry that includes farmed birds and cows. But H5N1 has been tearing through wild and commercially farmed bird flocks in the US since 2022, when the team started monitoring wastewater, and they haven\u2019t seen it in any of their samples until now. \u201cCertainly, something that\u2019s different now,\u201d Tisza said, \u201cis that it\u2019s commonly infecting dairy cows.\u201d Only one person has tested positive for H5N1 in connection with the cattle outbreak.\u00a0That person, a farm worker who had close contact with infected cows and developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or redness and swelling of the eyes, but no breathing problems or congestion.\u00a0He was treated with antiviral medications and has recovered, public health officials said. The CDC says the current risk to public health is low, but it\u2019s keeping a close eye on the situation. The FDA recently tested 297 samples of dairy products purchased at grocery stores across the country. In expanded test results released Monday, the agency said, it found samples that were positive for dead fragments of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 15 of the 38 states where products were processed. About 1 out of every 5 samples had some traces of the virus, indicating that the outbreak might be more widespread than previously known. TEPHI\u2019s Maresso says they can\u2019t rule out that what they are seeing is virus from milk that\u2019s been poured down the drain or even asymptomatic human infections.\u00a0He notes that they are not seeing an increase in flu cases in hospitals, which would alert them to severe infections. \u201cIt would be maybe a more easily solvable puzzle if it was just one or two sites and we had some dairy or other processing plants right near that that plant where we\u2019re sampling from. It would explain things. but we have essentially detected the signal on in nearly every site and certainly every city to this point,\u201d Maresso said \u2013 even big cities in the state that aren\u2019t near dairy farms. As far as the direction of the Texas outbreak, whether it\u2019s getting worse or going away, Tisza says, it\u2019s hard to say.\u00a0At first, he said, some cities his group monitors had a signal from H5N1 that was as strong as the one they see from seasonal influenza over the winter. \u201cBut overall, it\u2019s been only maybe about 25 percent of that signal,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as the overall trajectory, it\u2019s really kind of at a plateau right now. Not spiking up, not going away. So that in and of itself is interesting,\u201d said Tisza, who notes that they\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear from us again if there\u2019s a big spike.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/bird-flu-wastewater-monitoring-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_breastfeeding-mom-public-shame-sinf-cec", "text": "It\u2019s spring, and the air is filled with the melodies of mating songbirds. But when I walk down a tidy street near my suburban Virginia home, the jarring memory of another sound echoes in my mind: my daughter\u2019s piercing screams. Those desperate cries jolted me out of a daydream as I pushed her stroller down this very sidewalk back in December 2022. My daughter was home sick from daycare, and I\u2019d taken her on a walk hoping the cooler air would calm her cough. It seemed to be working, until suddenly, it clearly wasn\u2019t. There are so many moments as a parent when you find yourself doing something you vowed you\u2019d never do \u2014 especially when your child is having a meltdown in public. This was one of those moments for me, but that alone is not why it\u2019s seared in my mind. I will never forget that day, not because of what my child did, or even how I handled it, but because of the surprising way a stranger responded. On that December afternoon, my usually sweet 17-month-old was erupting into a full-blown meltdown. As her face reddened with rage, I tried handing her the bottle I\u2019d brought. She swatted it to the ground and kicked her feet so hard one of her shoes flew off. Even though she was still learning her first words, she had no trouble expressing herself. She didn\u2019t want milk from a bottle. She wanted it direct from the source: me. The way I saw it, that was simply impossible here \u2014 and the idea of it was mortifying. I hadn\u2019t brought my nursing cover, the tasteful shawl I made a point of wearing while feeding her in public.\u00a0Whenever she needed to nurse, I tried to cover up politely or slip away out of view. On this street, we were exposed. There was nowhere to hide. It\u2019s only as I describe it now that I realize how bizarre that sounds. There are so many parts of the world where women and children truly need to take cover to survive. I was lucky to be somewhere safe. And besides, I was proud to be a mom and loved feeding my daughter, so why was I acting so ashamed? Long before I ever had a child of my own, I\u2019d heard comments from TV personalities who\u2019d slammed breastfeeding in public, I\u2019d read news stories about women who were told to cover up, and I\u2019d even heard some snide remarks from members of my own family about the way moms nursed their kids. Of course, I\u2019d also read about celebrities and seen friends who defied these antiquated expectations. And once I started breastfeeding in public myself, most people didn\u2019t really notice \u2014 or at least, they acted like they didn\u2019t. But still, whenever I fed my daughter outside our home, part of me felt anxious about whether anyone was going to be offended. The years of comments I\u2019d heard sent a message so clear that I\u2019d developed a sense of shame around my body, and around feeding my child, without even realizing it. So even as my daughter\u2019s cries grew louder on that December afternoon, breastfeeding her seemed out of the question. In every direction I looked, there were blocks of houses and nicely manicured lawns, with no benches or parks in sight.\u00a0Plopping down in the middle of the sidewalk and lifting up my shirt was something I\u2019d NEVER do. Returning home was the only escape route I could see. I did a quick calculation. If I walked fast, we could probably get home in 10 minutes. Imagining the large number of houses we\u2019d have to pass with her screaming at the top of her lungs, I plowed ahead. But the meltdown only intensified with each step. And as I saw my daughter gasping to catch her breath with tears streaming down her face, and as I thought about how hard the past few nights had been, with coughing fits keeping her up for hours, I realized that giving her what she needed was the only thing that mattered. So suddenly, there I was \u2014 after months of trying to be discreet so I wouldn\u2019t make anyone else uncomfortable while I fed my child \u2014 sitting cross-legged in the middle of a sidewalk, lifting up my shirt and praying no one would notice us. I was relieved to see how quickly she relaxed, but I braced myself every time I heard a car engine rumbling or the jangle of a dog\u2019s leash. Someone was going to see us and say something. I wished I could sink into the ground and hide. In the distance, I saw a woman walking brusquely in our direction. I steeled myself for the criticism I knew had to be coming. Why was I blocking the sidewalk? Why was I flashing the neighbors rather than feeding my daughter at home? Why couldn\u2019t I get it together and control my child? But once she reached our stretch of the sidewalk, this stranger didn\u2019t ask any of those questions. Her words were kind and compassionate. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d she asked. I was stunned. I\u2019d been so certain she would judge me. \u201cYes,\u201d I said a bit sheepishly. \u201cShe just melted down, and I had to feed her.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t glare. She smiled. Then she told me how beautiful my daughter and I looked sitting there together, paired with the classical music piping through her headphones. She was standing a few feet away, but her words were an embrace I hadn\u2019t even realized I needed. In a matter of moments, I started to see the same beauty she did. I let go of the pressure and shame that had been weighing on me and found myself opening up. It\u2019s been more than a year since our paths crossed, and I can no longer remember this woman\u2019s face, but I can still feel her warmth. That day, I told her that we\u2019d been on a peaceful walk when suddenly the situation turned. My daughter had been home sick all week, I explained, and she was simply exhausted. The stranger nodded knowingly. She could see I was exhausted, too. She asked me how I was holding up. Tears welled up in my eyes. I told her I was OK, because thanks to her, I was.

{"id": "2024_05_17_health_ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness", "text": "The ultraprocessed foods your kids eat now may be putting them a greater risk for cardiometabolic problems \u2013 like heart attack, stroke and diabetes \u2013 in adulthood, a new study suggests. \u201cOur study highlights the importance of promoting the substitution of ultra-processed foods with healthier alternatives, such as unprocessed or minimally processed options, in efforts to prevent further cardiometabolic health problems in children,\u201d said lead author of the study Dr. Nancy Babio, associate professor of Rovira I Virgili University and researcher from Institut d\u2019Investigaci\u00f3 Sanit\u00e0ria Pere Virgili and CIBEROBN in Spain. From this study, families and institutions should take away how early life lays the foundation to problems dealt with in adulthood, said Dr. Stuart Berger, a pediatric cardiologist and chair of the section of cardiology and cardiac surgery for the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the research. The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, analyzed data from more than 1,400 children ages 3 to 6 recruited from schools across seven cities in Spain. The children\u2019s caregivers met with researchers in person and completed questionnaires at home on physical activity, food consumption and demographics from 2019 to 2022, according to the study. Researchers divided the data from the children into three groups based on the amount of ultraprocessed food they ate. Children who consumed the most ultraprocessed foods were more likely to have risk factors like a higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure and waist-to-height ratio, the study showed. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, chicken nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. \u201cAmericans eat ultraprocessed foods every day,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. A group of Americans in a study published on May 8 ate at least three servings of ultraprocessed food a day, with one group eating an average of seven daily servings, the study showed. Many studies have shown the negative health effects of ultraprocessed foods in adults, but Friday\u2019s study is among the first to show the impact they can have on the cardiometabolic health of young children, said Berger, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago. \u201cThis particular topic, ultraprocessed food consumptions and risk, is a very important topic in kids,\u201d he said. Starting young The study is observational, meaning that while researchers can identify an association between how much ultraprocessed foods children eat and their health, they cannot say that one causes the other, Berger said. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be mindful of ultraprocessed foods for young children, because how they eat for the rest of their lives is greatly impact by their early nutrition, he said. \u201cWhat we know is people who eat a certain way, even moms who eat in utero, set up baby\u2019s preferences,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere are a ton of publications that have shown that what we eat early in life \u2026 actually sets the stage for what happens in the future.\u201d Shifting your child\u2019s diet away from ultraprocessed foods and toward more fresh options is easier to do when they are very young, Berger said. Ultra-convenient The problem is that avoiding ultraprocessed foods is not equally easy for everyone. The study found that the children with the highest amount of ultraprocessed foods in their diet had mothers who were younger, had a higher BMI and had lower levels of education and employment. In places where fresh food might be harder to obtain, ultraprocessed foods are more accessible and inexpensive, Freeman said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are also ultra-convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, people reach for them when they feed their kids, and their kids aren\u2019t hungry, but they\u2019re filled with all these different chemicals and substances and seasonings and salts of sugars and whatever that they become very addicted to.\u201d Freeman stressed that giving kids ultraprocessed foods without also providing fresh fruits and vegetables sets them up for problems down the road. Adding in more nutritious foods and encouraging physical activity as much as possible is critical, Berger added. \u201cIf you can do something to create a healthy lifestyle early, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that you can you can eliminate metabolic syndromes later in life like diabetes, obesity, and all the complications associated with diabetes and obesity,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_health_kp2-covid-flirt-variant-wellness", "text": "There is a\u00a0new coronavirus variant\u00a0in town. KP.2, a member of the so-called FliRT variants, nicknamed after their mutations, has become the dominant coronavirus strain in the United States, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These FliRT variants have certain mutations in common but are still part of the Omicron family of\u00a0the coronavirus. For the period from April 28 to May 11, nearly 30% of new cases were caused by\u00a0KP.2, up from less than 16% in the two-week period before that. What should people know about this new variant? What are the symptoms of infection? Do vaccines still work against the new strain? Is a home test still reliable? How long should people isolate if they contract KP.2? Who should take antiviral treatments if they contract this type of Covid-19? And what is the guidance for immunocompromised individuals \u2014 should they start masking again? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen.\u00a0Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0What should people know about this new variant, KP.2? Dr. Leana Wen:\u00a0Since the start of Covid-19, we have been discussing new variants. The original strain of the virus was displaced by the Alpha variant. Then we had Beta, then Delta and then Omicron. KP.2 is part of the Omicron family. It appears to be displacing JN.1 and similar subvariants, which previously were the dominant variants in the United States. Whenever there is a new variant, there are three key questions to ask: Is it more contagious? Does it cause more severe disease? And do existing vaccines and treatments work on it? One reason a new strain displaces the previously dominant ones is that it is as contagious or more so. That means KP.2 could spread very easily, which is something we have seen throughout Covid-19: that the coronavirus is extremely contagious and thus difficult to avoid. The good news is that KP.2 does not appear to cause more severe disease. Indeed,\u00a0hospitalizations associated with Covid-19\u00a0are at record lows. And there is no reason to believe that existing vaccines and treatments would stop working against it. CNN: What are the symptoms of infection with KP.2? Wen:\u00a0Most people who contract the coronavirus will never know what variant is causing their symptoms. Symptoms of Covid-19 infection include runny nose, sore throat, headache, fevers, cough and body aches. Some people may experience more severe symptoms such as shortness of breath. Covid-19 could also exacerbate underlying conditions such as heart failure. None of these symptoms are specific to KP.2, which so far has not been reported to be associated with unique symptoms that distinguish it from other coronavirus infections. It\u2019s important to remember that in many individuals, Covid-19 symptoms may be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections, such as the flu or common cold. CNN: Is a home test still reliable? Wen:\u00a0Rapid antigen home tests are an easy and convenient method to screen for Covid-19, though they are not as reliable or accurate as laboratory PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing. There is no indication that home tests are less effective in picking up this new variant compared\u00a0with\u00a0past variants. I recommend that people take a home test if they have symptoms and could be eligible for antiviral treatment. If someone is very concerned that they could have Covid-19, they could take multiple home tests on different days, and they could consider getting PCR testing as well. CNN: Do existing vaccines work against KP.2? What about the vaccine expected to come out in the fall? Wen:\u00a0Existing vaccines should still have activity against KP.2. The CDC has issued guidance\u00a0recommending a second\u00a0shot of the vaccine that first came out in fall of 2023 for those 65 and older. Federal health officials are expected to recommend a newly formulated version of the Covid-19 vaccine in the fall. The new ones are expected to be different from the current vaccines in that the latest vaccines will target the variants predicted to be in circulation over the fall and winter. If health officials predict that KP.2 will be among these variants, fall vaccines will probably be even more effective against KP.2. CNN: How long should people isolate if they contract Covid-19? Wen:\u00a0Earlier this year, the\u00a0CDC dropped\u00a0its five-day isolation requirement. Now, the agency recommends that people diagnosed with Covid-19 stay home until they are fever-free for at least 24 hours and their symptoms are improving. For the next five days, they should still try to take additional precautions such as masking and limiting close contact with others. CNN: Who should take antiviral treatments if they contract Covid-19? Wen:\u00a0People at high risk for developing severe illness from Covid-19 should consider antiviral treatments. That high-risk category includes older individuals, people who are immunocompromised and those with serious underlying medical conditions. There are two\u00a0oral medications\u00a0available, and there is also an injection of a third antiviral. I advise everyone to ask their health care provider to determine if they should take an antiviral treatment\u00a0if they contract the coronavirus, and if so, which one and how to access it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/kp2-covid-flirt-variant-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_health_colon-cancer-blood-test", "text": "To screen for colon and rectal cancers, most people have colonoscopies, which can feel invasive and require anesthesia, or they may take an at-home stool test, which can be more convenient but also awkward \u2014\u00a0and not appealing for the squeamish. But a simple blood test could soon become more broadly available. Palo Alto, California-based biotechnology company Guardant Health has applied for US Food and Drug Administration approval of Shield, its blood test to screen for early signs of colorectal cancer, and on Thursday, a panel of expert advisers to the FDA gathered to discuss data on the screening test. The FDA\u2019s Molecular and Clinical Genetics Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee met to discuss the benefits and risks of the test and vote on whether it\u2019s safe and effective. The panel voted 8-1 that the Shield test is safe for use in people who meet the criteria for testing, 6-3 that the test is effective for use in those meeting the criteria and 7-2 that the benefits of the test outweigh the risks. The discussions and voting outcomes will be shared with the FDA, which takes into consideration but does not have to follow the committee\u2019s advice when deciding whether to approve the test. If Shield receives FDA approval, it will be the first approved blood screening test for colorectal cancer that meets requirements for Medicare reimbursement, said Dr. Craig Eagle, chief medical officer at Guardant Health. Current options for colorectal cancer screening for people at average risk include a stool-based test done either annually or every three years; a traditional colonoscopy every 10 years; a virtual colonoscopy every five years; or a sigmoidoscopy procedure, which involves using a tube-like instrument called an endoscope to examine the lower part of the colon, every five years. The Shield blood test is already available as a laboratory-developed test or LDT, so it does not necessarily require approval by the FDA to be performed under current regulations. However, the agency\u2019s approval could make the test more widely available and broadly covered as another primary screening option. The test would not replace the other screening methods that are commonly used. Rather, according to Guardant, it could be another noninvasive option, which could help boost the number of people who complete recommended screenings. \u201cCurrent primary non-invasive screening options are limited to stool-based tests,\u201d Eagle wrote in an email. \u201cOur Shield blood test offers patients a convenient option that has a proven level of performance within range of non-invasive tests.\u201d Several research teams and companies have been working to develop simple blood tests to screen for colon and rectal cancers. \u201cThe argument is that a point-of-care blood test can actually significantly reduce the incidence rate of very advanced disease and save lives, even if it has lesser potential to prevent the disease,\u201d said Robert Smith, senior vice president of early cancer detection science at the American Cancer Society. A blood-based test would not be able to identify concerning lesions or polyps in the colon or rectum, as a colonoscopy would. With visual exams, like colonoscopies or sigmoidoscopies, a lesion or polyp that has the potential to develop into cancer can be identified and removed, thus preventing the disease. \u201cMost people would like to see a blood-based option that was more accurate with respect to finding precursor lesions in addition to cancers. But the rather remarkable thing about colorectal cancer screening is that people vary in their readiness to do one test or another,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou have to give people a choice.\u201d Guardant\u2019s Shield test would be for colorectal cancer screening in people 45 or older who are at average risk of the disease, according to FDA meeting materials. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that screening for colorectal cancer start at age 45 for people at average risk. The test would not be recommended for high-risk people, such as those with personal or family histories of the disease, and people who receive an \u201cabnormal\u201d test result using Shield would be referred for a colonoscopy. Since the launch of the lab-developed version of the Shield test in May 2022, it has been used by more than 20,000 people, and more than 90% of those who were prescribed the test have completed it, according to Guardant Health. \u201cAny test developer knows that they have to get their test approved by the FDA for it to really gain traction,\u201d Smith said. Mixed vote on effectiveness At Thursday\u2019s meeting, the FDA advisers indicated some division about the test when answering three questions about its safety and effectiveness and whether the benefits outweigh any risks. \u201cI voted yes on all three, with the indication that this is to be used in asymptomatic individuals for the detection of colon cancer. I did feel like it met that indication,\u201d panel member Dr. Sean Spencer, a gastroenterologist and physician scientist at Stanford University, said in the meeting. \u201cI think in the labeling, it should clearly indicate that this is not to detect adenomas and it is not designed as a preventive strategy,\u201d Spencer said. Adenomas are\u00a0tumors that are not cancerous. Panel member Dr. Charity Morgan also voted yes to all three categories. \u201cMy reasoning was very similar to Dr. Spencer\u2019s: the indication is for detection of colorectal cancer. If the indication had said something about advanced adenomas, that would have changed my vote,\u201d said Morgan, a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201cI was on the fence about the effectiveness because of the limited sensitivity for stage I. I think if the labeling was very clear that this test is strong as for detecting stages II, III and IV, that would turn my vote from a weak yes to a strong yes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut ultimately, I concluded that they did show effectiveness as well as safety and a good risk-benefit profile.\u201d Meanwhile, panel member Dr. Padma Rajagopal voted that she thinks the test is safe and that the benefits outweigh the risks, but she does not think the test is effective due to its limitations in detecting advanced adenomas and says it\u2019s not as effective in detecting stage I cancers as in detecting more advanced disease. \u201cIf there were refinements to that indicated use or refinements in the way that providers and patients were educated, I will change my vote to a yes,\u201d said Rajagopal, a physician-scientist at the National Cancer Institute. Panel member Dr. William Brugge voted that, while he thinks the Shield test is safe, he does not think that it\u2019s effective or that the benefits outweigh the risks. \u201cMy primary concern here is that I don\u2019t think Shield is a particularly good screening test for colon cancer,\u201d said Brugge, a gastroenterologist at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He added that he thinks \u201cmany of the other existing tests\u201d are better. The FDA advisers\u2019 votes will not immediately change or shift the American Cancer Society\u2019s screening recommendations, Smith said. \u201cThe American Cancer Society typically looks for FDA approval at this higher level before we would include a test in our guidelines,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe really want to hear how the FDA thinks about this test, and then with respect to guidelines, I can\u2019t tell you what any one organization \u2013 including ours \u2013 is going to do, because it\u2019s a process that requires a great deal of literature review and evidence review and consideration of the FDA decision, as well as the implications,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process that takes some time.\u201d How the test works The Shield test works by detecting tumor DNA in blood samples, and a physician would need to order the test and kit for their patient. The test was found to have around 83% sensitivity and 90% specificity in a study published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine. Sensitivity\u00a0refers to a test\u2019s ability to accurately identify people with disease, designating them as positive. Specificity refers to its ability to accurately designate people without a disease as negative. That study, which included nearly 8,000 people, was among the data that the FDA panel members reviewed in Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cFDA seeks the Panel\u2019s input on whether the information submitted by Guardant is adequate to support the safety and effectiveness of the Shield for the proposed intended use,\u201d the meeting materials say. The study found that about 83% of participants who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer via colonoscopy tested positive for the disease on the Shield test, compared with about 17% who had a false negative. The test showed about 88% sensitivity in detecting stage I, II or III colorectal cancer and a lower sensitivity, around 13%, in detecting precancerous lesions. About 90% of the study participants without advanced colorectal cancer or precancerous lesions tested negative on the blood test, compared with about 10% who had a false positive test result. Many people skip screening The FDA meeting materials note that colorectal cancer occurs in about 150,000 people in the United States each year and is associated with more than 50,000 deaths annually. The disease is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and it\u2019s estimated that more than 75% of people who die from colorectal cancer were not up to date with their screenings. For the average person, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women, according to the American Cancer Society. Signs and\u00a0symptoms of colorectal cancer\u00a0include changes in bowel habits, rectal bleeding or blood in the stool, cramping or abdominal pain, weakness and fatigue, and weight loss. The share of colorectal cancer diagnoses among adults younger than 55 in the US\u00a0has been rising since the 1990s, and when it comes to screening methods, new research suggests that the use of at-home stool tests for the disease has become more popular, especially among younger adults. Data released last week by Epic Research, owned by the health-care software company Epic, shows that in early 2018, colonoscopies accounted for about 96% of colorectal cancer screenings, but that proportion fell below 70% by the third quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the use of DNA stool tests significantly rose in the second quarter of 2020, reaching 31% of screenings by the fourth quarter of 2023. The study included data on more than 1.4 million first-time colorectal cancer screenings conducted by colonoscopy or DNA stool testing between 2018 and 2023. Despite the current colorectal cancer screening recommendations, \u201ca significant portion of the eligible population hesitates to participate in screenings. Common deterrents include the discomfort associated with stool-based tests, the preparation required for procedures, and anxiety surrounding colonoscopy examinations,\u201d Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt, a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and past president of the Florida Urological Society, wrote in a CNN opinion piece in March. \u201cThis apprehension may contribute to only\u00a0about 60% of those eligible\u00a0for colorectal cancer screenings staying up to date on the recommended tests,\u201d Brahmbhatt wrote, adding that when it comes to blood-based screening tests, \u201cthe hope is, once approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, this blood test would increase screening for colorectal cancer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/colon-cancer-blood-test/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_06_08_health_pets-air-quality-wildfire-smoke-safety-wellness-climate", "text": "More than 100 fires are burning across Canada, with some wildfires forcing evacuations and affecting air quality in Canada and the northern tier of the United States \u2014 and experts have noted that pets could be at risk, too. Dr. Gabrielle Fadl of the Bond Vet Clinic in New York City told CNN last year that her practice has had a \u201csignificant influx of calls\u201d from concerned clients seeking guidance on how to protect their animals from the poor air quality outside. It also received a few calls from patients, particularly pregnant and older people, requesting to reschedule appointments. \u201cExposure to polluted air can have a profound impact on our pets\u2019 health, leading to respiratory issues, allergies, and even exacerbating existing conditions such as asthma,\u201d Fadl said. To ensure pets\u2019 well-being, Fadl advised considering the following precautions. Limit outdoor activities Reduce the time your pets spend outdoors as much as possible, especially during periods of unhealthy air quality. Doing so can help minimize their exposure to harmful pollutants and allergens, Fadl said. You also shouldn\u2019t run with your dog outdoors, said Dr. Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the department of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIf you can, just walk a little bit more slowly so you\u2019re not breathing as deeply,\u201d he added. \u201cThat can help.\u201d Avoiding strenuous activity is important for pets as well since they can\u2019t breathe as deeply as humans, said Dr. Jessica Bell, an assistant professor in the college of veterinary medicine at Washington State University. Animals also can experience difficulty breathing, asthma-like symptoms and bronchitis. If you must take pets outside, do so when air quality is best, Bell said. \u201cThat might be early in the morning before the air quality changes with settling of moisture.\u201d New York City\u2019s Emergency Management advised wiping your pet\u2019s muzzle, feet and coat with a damp cloth after being outside. Create a safe environment indoors Even pets kept indoors can be affected by the air quality outside, Bell said, so make sure you have proper ventilation in your home. Keep the windows closed to prevent outdoor pollutants, such as fine particulate matter, from entering. These particles are the tiniest, yet most dangerous, of pollutants, and have been linked to health problems such as heart disease, asthma and other respiratory illnesses. \u201cA major difference between wildfires and, for example, a fire that you might burn in a backyard bonfire is that often there are synthetic materials being burned that produce compounds that can be dangerous like hydrogen cyanide,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Kornreich, director of the Cornell Feline Health Center in Ithaca, New York. \u201cCarbon monoxide can also get into the bloodstream, and those two interfere with the delivery of oxygen to organs,\u201d Kornreich added. \u201cIn some cases, these fires can also produce chemical irritants. So the chemicals can actually trigger inflammation in the airways.\u201d Additionally, use air purifiers or filters to improve air quality inside. When keeping pets indoors, activities for them can be important, Bell said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of puzzle games that dogs and cats can do,\u201d she said. \u201cFill the puzzles (with) their treats or their dog food and hide it in the house. They have to hunt for them or have to roll them around or they knock all the kibbles out.\u201d Also ensure pets have access to clean water both indoors and outdoors so it\u2019s not tainted with smoke, Bell added. Monitor animals\u2019 symptoms Be on the lookout for any signs of respiratory distress or discomfort in your pets such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing or trouble breathing. Pay attention to any changes to their normal behavior, such as wanting to play fetch for 10 minutes instead of an hour as usual, Bell said. \u201cThat decrease in activity \u2014 we just have to pay attention to (it) and not force them to be active when their body says not to be.\u201d Indoor cats should be monitored for these same symptoms, she added. \u201cIf you notice any concerning symptoms, seek prompt veterinary care,\u201d Fadl said. Consult with a veterinarian Reach out to a trusted veterinarian for expert guidance catered to your pet\u2019s needs. Vets can also recommend appropriate preventive measures or treatments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/06/08/health/pets-air-quality-wildfire-smoke-safety-wellness-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta", "text": "I\u2019ve been reporting on Alzheimer\u2019s disease for more than two decades, and any progress in the field has seemed incremental at best, leaving most patients and their loved ones with few options. But in the process of filming a new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I met with people all across the country who had been diagnosed with or who are at high risk of the disease. With lifestyle changes alone, I saw levels of amyloid plaque decrease in their brains, their cognition improve and even signs of reversal of the disease. It was extraordinary and it also made me start to think about my own brain, because I have a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. So with some trepidation, I decided to learn more about my risk for dementia. It was one of the most personal and revealing\u00a0experiences I have ever gone through. To start, I underwent an intensive exploration of my brain, far deeper than I even thought possible. This wasn\u2019t a simple look at the anatomy or even the genetics that might predispose me to a particular type of dementia. The goal was to obtain a complete story of my brain, from my earliest days through my education and formative years to now: a man in his mid-50s. Most importantly, the in-depth testing could give me a clearer idea of where I was headed and how to steer my path in the most favorable direction. Even as a brain surgeon myself, I was surprised at how well the health of your brain can be measured. With the heart, it is pretty well-accepted that a battery of tests can help give us a clear idea of how to predict, prevent and treat heart disease. Until recently, however, we really could not say the same about the brain. Many brain doctors still struggle even to define the criteria for a healthy brain. The general consensus was that the \u201cblack box\u201d in your skull was pretty fixed and that there was little you could do to assess it, let alone optimize it. Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist, convinced me otherwise, and it led to one of the most fascinating \u2014 and somewhat frightening \u2014 days I have had in my life. I\u2019ve known Richard for a long time, and we are friends. We have had great conversations about our shared love for the brain, and I often turn to him to get his thoughts on neurological developments in the news. What has always struck me about Richard is that he is consistently unwilling to accept the status quo in medicine, almost more as a matter of justice rather than scientific pursuit, although he is that rare individual who is stellar at making a difference in both. So I immediately thought of him when considering the idea of a preventive neurology visit. To be clear, I wasn\u2019t going to Richard because I thought I had any sort of problem. But that is the point: When people refer to the US medical field as a \u201csick-care\u201d system instead of a health-care system, this is what I think they mean. Richard would certainly see me if I were sick, but he preferred to see me now, while I was healthy, fully believing he could help me maintain my brain, reduce my chance of dementia and even optimize my function, as he described in a 2018 study. I flew into Boca Raton, Florida, to see Richard at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases of Florida clinic on a beautiful day in March. He had advised me ahead of time to not exercise or eat that morning and to prepare for a day of intense mental gymnastics. Although this wasn\u2019t an IQ test, he said, in some ways, it would be far more personal. I must say that it felt very meta to get an assessment of my own brain and find out whether it was functioning as it should or if there were problems I had not yet noticed. Was I getting rusty? Maybe I was making errors that my family, friends and colleagues were too polite to tell me about. If there were gaps in processing speed or executive judgment, they might now be uncovered and unmasked. When I got to the clinic, I first underwent a battery of blood tests, checking my phosphorylated tau ratio, better known as the Alzheimer\u2019s blood test, and measures of my lipids, inflammation and glucose levels, to name just a few. I was also tested for my genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. If I was a carrier of the APOE4 gene, it could carry significant higher risk of the disease. I spit into a tube to check my oral health. After that, I stepped on a body composition scale to figure out where and how much bone, fat and muscle I had in my body. I was a little surprised to catch Richard in the corner, looking at the readout and saying, \u201cInteresting \u2026\u201d while stroking his chin. Nobody likes to see their doctors do that. Not even doctors like to see other doctors do that. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked across the room. \u201cOh,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably fine.\u201d He later told me that he saw evidence of an old left arm injury and accurately predicted that I had had an intense leg workout the day before. It was a real reminder of how clearly the body keeps score. Even though I hadn\u2019t thought about that injury in years, it had clearly left its mark on my body and still triggered a finding on this test. After that came the cognitive testing. This was perhaps the most surprising. At first, I was told to relax and listen to the detailed short story of an Atlanta football team captain, a quarterback who had injured his finger on a fishing trip before the big game. I thought I had been paying attention but suddenly realized I probably wasn\u2019t as engaged as I thought. \u201cWhat day did he injure himself, and how many stitches did he need? What was the player\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked 15 minutes later. Could I even be certain if it was his thumb or left ring finger? Quick: Recite as many words as you can starting with the letter \u201cG\u201d and then immediately rattle off as many animal names as possible, both in one-minute increments. The longer the words and the more unusual the animals, the better. There were lists of words to remember, three-dimensional cubes and clocks to be drawn, and dozens of faces to match with their names. I had to scratch and sniff 50 different smells and determine, in one instance, if something smelled more like gasoline, acetone or a forest fire. In another instance, it was lavender or lilac. I found myself suddenly being unsure and trying to summon up a memory of that smell to try to answer correctly. I felt like my brain was being cross-examined by a very skilled prosecutor. It wasn\u2019t just about the number of errors I made but the types of errors, how long I took to respond and whether I simply lost my attention. There are obvious red flags that pop up if someone draws a clock backward or if they have lost their ability to distinguish certain smells. The more subtle concerns were around visual-spatial construction or an ability to ignore incongruent stimuli in the Stroop Color and Word Test, such as identifying the color red, even if that word appears in purple on the screen. Although I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with dyslexia, Richard thinks it might be something I have. \u201cDo you count on your fingers?\u201d he asked me. I have always done that and never considered it to be notable or suggestive of something significant. Turns out I was less likely to remember words with lots of Bs and Ds in them because I may have always shied away from letters I more easily confused. These types of insights about my own brain, big and small, were all so fascinating (and a bit unsettling) to me. For Richard, however, they represented opportunities for early intervention, some of which are remarkably simple. \u201cMost doctors would look at your results and say you are doing fine,\u201d Richard explained before he showed me the results of my lab testing. \u201cBut what they are really saying is that you are probably fine \u2013 for the next few years. I am playing the long game here, and I think you are going to see a lot of areas we can start to address now, today.\u201d I am a pretty competitive guy, so I am used to having all \u201cgreens\u201d pop up when I review my lab testing results. After all, I take great pride in my health and approach it with the same rigor that I approached my grades in medical school. I wanted to do really well, certainly as well as I could possibly do. So when Richard flipped over my lab results and showed me a page that had not only a considerable amount of yellow but even a few reds, my heart dropped. My homocysteine level was elevated, but my B12 level was low. That wasn\u2019t surprising to Richard, because he had also found a mutation in my MTHFR gene, which meant that I probably didn\u2019t process homocysteine well. My omega-3 levels were all right, but not when you compared them with my omega-6 levels. My DHEA levels were a little low, which might partly explain why I have had more trouble putting on muscle than I did a decade ago. And I was surprised to learn that I was carrying more inflammation in my body than I expected, especially given that I felt fine. What was most revealing to me was how clearly these blood test abnormalities could be associated with neurological function. Richard told me that issues of metabolism, such as even slight insulin resistance, can accelerate amyloid deposition, which can lead to amyloid plaques, those telltale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, down the line. He also said that, in his experience, cholesterol and lipid abnormalities can be associated with problems with executive function and speed of processing. He added that he associates depression with lower attention and slower processing speeds. I\u2019ve been practicing neurosurgery for 30 years, and I had never heard of this. Richard was able to draw a link between very functional aspects of the brain to very specific problems in the body. And, more important, he has presented scientific evidence showing that optimizing those physical targets is associated with improved cognitive function. Richard also wanted to address an activity I did on a daily basis: my neighborhood walk with my three dogs. \u201cKeep doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now with a weighted vest.\u201d Why? Not having enough lean muscle mass is problematic. He told me people typically do a good job addressing their arms and legs, but loading the spine with additional weight helps activate core muscles, such as abdominals and obliques, as well as stimulating the growth of new bone cells. This could lead to a critical redistribution of the fat, muscle and bone in my body and help drive down any insulin resistance that I may be genetically predisposed to and eventually lower my risk of developing amyloid in the brain. On Richard\u2019s advice, I started to make a few changes to my nutrition and day-to-day routine. Over the years, I had gone back and forth on fish oil, not overly impressed with the data on heart health and finding it challenging to keep the pills refrigerated, especially when I was on the road. For Richard, though, it was clear. As healthy as my diet is, he had no doubt that I needed to take the extra steps to supplement with omega-3 fatty acids to help my omega-3/omega-6 ratio in the pursuit of better brain health. This would also help with the absorption of B vitamins, he added. Those needed to be supplemented as well, and Richard was very specific about this. \u201cMake sure to get the bottle with 1,000 micrograms of B12 and 400 micrograms of methylfolate along with 1.5 milligrams of B6.\u201d Those fairly straightforward recommendations to improve my fatty acids could probably make an impact with my executive function, he told me. In the recommendation about brain health, I did not expect an intervention involving my feet, but the nerves that run to the feet are the longest in our body. When you don\u2019t move your toes and feet regularly and freely, Richard says, you can lose sensory awareness, also known as proprioception, leading to a \u201csensory paralysis.\u201d Over time, the nerve connections that run from your feet to your brain start to disappear. Once your feet are weak, your weight will be unevenly distributed when walking and exercising. The better your feet can tolerate a load evenly, the more options they have for movement, the better and more cooperative things will be up the chain, including your knees, hips and lower back. Consider wearing toe spacers occasionally, he told me. Start with 10 minutes a day every few days, and increase the time as you get used to them. Some of the recommendations were more sophisticated. For example, Richard would ideally want even more testing. He\u2019d like to get a detailed DEXA scan of my entire body, not just for bone health but to get a clear look at how much visceral fat I am carrying. Visceral fat is not the subcutaneous fat that you can pinch between your thumb and your forefinger. Rather, it\u2019s the problematic stuff that chokes off the internal organs in your belly. Because visceral fat is so buried and woven into your internal organs, it\u2019s actually quite hard to assess how much someone has. A person could be skinny and still have a lot of visceral fat. Because I had some inflammatory elevations, he worried that I might be one of those people. He also suggested a brain MRI. He was worried that there might be cerebral blood vessel injury because of a slightly elevated fibrinogen level, a protein that can help the blood clot. The concern was that I might be making more frequent micro clots, which could put me at increased risk of vascular dementia later in life. And finally, a coronary calcium CT scan to detect coronary artery disease at its earliest stages, because as a general rule, what is bad for the heart is also bad for the brain. To be clear, most of these tests aren\u2019t part of routine care, and I struggle with the cost of it all. They can be expensive and probably wouldn\u2019t be covered by a person\u2019s insurance, especially if they aren\u2019t showing symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia or mild cognitive impairment. That is why Richard is also working to make much of it available for free at home. Nearly all the cognitive testing could be available in the future through a free app. Even the blood work could be done via finger-prick testing, if all goes as expected with Richard\u2019s research trial. Although a complete DEXA scan requires a facility, there are home scales that do a reasonably good job at measuring overall body composition, not just weight, and can help follow those trends over time. When I first visited with Richard after all my testing, I honestly expected to be told I was doing fine \u2013 even excellent. That is what every doctor had told me before. But the evidence is clear that when it comes to your brain, prevention and even optimization are possible. We know that in so many areas of medicine, there is a very large white space between being totally healthy and being sick. And it\u2019s an area that a sick-care system would not spend much time addressing, especially if the recommendations are as simple and wildly effective as a few vitamins, toe spacers and a rucksack. Going through this experience for \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient\u201d was more revealing and jarring than I could have imagined. After all, nobody wants bad news from a doctor, especially when it comes to your brain. But I can take comfort in knowing these tests aren\u2019t laying out a certain future or preparing me for inevitable catastrophe but rather giving me the personalized knowledge that I can use to take action toward a longer, healthier life and a sharper, healthier brain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_health_prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness", "text": "Chemical toxins are everywhere \u2014 in our water, food, air and soil. Exposure to those toxins during pregnancy can create serious health issues in elementary school children that can affect their lives for years to come, a new study found. Children born to European mothers exposed to four families of chemicals that disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine (hormone) system had elevated levels of metabolic syndrome at ages 6 to 11. Metabolic syndrome can include obesity, elevated blood pressure, and abnormally high cholesterol and insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Within the group of children exposed to the highest levels of chemicals, 62% were overweight or obese, compared with 16% of children within the low-risk group, said first author Nuria Gu\u0308il-Oumrait, a Fulbright scholar at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cMoreover, the levels of blood insulin and triglycerides, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group,\u201d G\u00fcil-Oumrait said in an email. \u201cIn contrast, HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group.\u201d HDL cholesterol is considered a \u201cgood\u201d blood fat as it helps clear ateries. Metabolic syndrome is typically associated with adult cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, but the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has seen symptoms appearing in kids at younger and younger ages. Having metabolic syndrome as a child is highly predictive of chronic disease as an adult, experts say. \u201cThis research stands out as one of the most comprehensive endeavors delving into early-life environmental origins of metabolic risk, further bolstering prior toxicological and epidemiological evidence in this area,\u201d said Vicente Mustieles, Mariana Ferna\u0301ndez and Carmen Messerlian in an editorial published with the study that appeared Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Mustieles and Fern\u00e1ndez are investigators at the Biomedical Research Center at the University of Granada, Spain. Messerlian is an assistant professor of environmental reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. CNN reached out to the International Council for Chemical Associations for comment but did not hear back before publication. A spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, however, provided the following statement. \u201cWe will review the details of this study once it\u2019s released. ACC\u2019s members are serious about their responsibility to produce chemistries that offer important safety, product performance and durability benefits and that can be used safely. Our members undertake extensive scientific analyses to evaluate potential risk of their chemicals, from development through use and safe disposal.\u201d Dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals The research team behind the new study performed blood and urine tests on 1,134 mothers during their pregnancies and later repeated those tests on their children between the ages of 6 and 11. The tests were looking for mixtures of nine chemical classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly found in the environment. Endrocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants with the \u201cability to cross the blood-placenta barrier and interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance,\u201d the study said. These and other chemicals \u201cend up in the blood, tissue, and organs of fetuses and infants through maternal transplacental and breastfeeding pathways in a never-ending cycle,\u201d Mustieles, Fern\u00e1ndez and Messerlian wrote. The study tested for pesticides; heavy metals; flame retardants; plasticizers such as phthalates and phenols; and PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are found in surface and groundwaters around the world at levels much higher than many international regulators allow. Called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because\u00a0they fail to break down fully in the environment, PFAS have been used since the 1950s to make consumer products nonstick, oil- and water-repellent, and resistant to temperature change. Some of the most studied PFAS, such as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone disruption,\u00a0according to the EPA. Toxic heavy metals in the soil and water include lead and arsenic  \u2014 studies have found alarming levels in manufactured baby food. There is no safe level of lead, while arsenic, mercury and other heavy metals can harm the body and brain at relatively low doses, experts say. A December 2014 meta-analysis of studies on arsenic\u00a0found that a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15. Flame retardants have been linked to a 300% higher risk of cancer. These chemical toxins are the greatest contributor to intellectual disability in children worldwide, resulting in a total loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability, according to an\u00a0August 2020 study. Phthalates, found in hundreds of consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys, have been connected to premature death among people ages 55 to 64\u00a0in the United States. Prior research has connected phthalates with\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and\u00a0undescended testicles in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and testosterone levels in adult males. Phthalates are also linked in studies to\u00a0childhood obesity,\u00a0asthma,\u00a0cardiovascular issues\u00a0and\u00a0cancer. In the study, phthalates were the only group of chemicals that were associated with a lower level of metabolic syndrome. All of the other chemical families increased risk. People are exposed to a mixture of chemicals daily Chemicals may vary in their impact on the body. For example, certain PFAS compounds tend to accumulate in the liver, contributing to fatty liver disease and high cholesterol. And flame retardants and other chemicals may be stored in body fat, contributing to obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, according to the editorial. Since people are exposed to numerous types of potentially toxic substances each day, designing a study that could capture the cumulative impact on different parts of the body would provide a more realistic picture of any potential health impact. By focusing on metabolic syndrome, which combines measurements of blood sugars, lipids such as cholesterol, the existence of fat tissue and the impact on the heart, the current study was one of the first to accomplish this goal, the editorial said. \u201cWe almost always consider health risks from single chemicals, one at a time, as if we are exposed to just one chemical at a time,\u201d said Jane Houlihan, the national director of science and health for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies\u2019 exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. \u201cHere the research team shows that children\u2019s risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life can be driven by the complex mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the body at any moment and it highlights the particular risk of chemical exposures during pregnancy,\u201d she said. Healthy Babies Bright Futures\u00a0published a report in 2019\u00a0that found toxic metals in 95% of the baby foods randomly pulled off supermarket shelves, which led to the introduction of The Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, a bill that would allow the US Food and Drug Administration to set stricter standards and allow the FDA to monitor these standards through access to the records of food suppliers and manufacturers. \u201cGiven the steep rise in metabolic syndrome in the US, health officials and companies should be doing all they can to tighten safety standards and to get these chemicals out of commerce and out of our everyday products,\u201d Houlihan said. How to limit exposure There are ways to minimize exposure to plastics and other toxins, which is especially critical during pregnancy and childhood as developing fetuses and small bodies are more easily damaged, Houlihan said. Reduce rice intake for infants and children, and be sure to rinse grains well before using as this removes up to 60% of the arsenic, she said. Limit juice and be sure to carefully wash and peel vegetables and fruits, and if possible, buy organic. Stay away from stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and don\u2019t use waterproofing sprays. Check your local area for levels of PFAS and other chemicals in your drinking water. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy nonprofit, has created a national tap water database\u00a0searchable by zip code\u00a0that lists PFAS and other concerning chemicals, as well as a\u00a0national map\u00a0that illustrates where PFAS has been detected in the US. If your drinking water is of concern, consider purchasing a reverse osmosis filter, the most effective kind, EWG said. NSF, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, has\u00a0a list of recommended filters. Tap water is often a better choice than bottled water, however, which is packed with nanoplastics that can invade cells and tissues and leach toxic chemicals into the body. At home, one easy change is to use glass or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones when heating food. If possible, try to cook with ceramic, cast iron, or stainless-steel pans and avoid cookware treated with chemicals to avoid food sticking. Another good choice is to use stainless steel or glass bottles instead of plastic ones. \u201cChoose cosmetics that are free from endocrine disruptors such as parabens, benzophenone, triclosan, and phthalates,\u201d Gu\u0308il-Oumrait suggested. Consider the same for food, sunscreens, household cleaners and other everyday products encased in plastic. The EWG has several consumer databases that provides links to consumer products with fewer chemicals, including food scores, personal care products, sunscreen recommendations and a healthy living app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_hiv-breastfeeding-recommendations-aap", "text": "Each time LaTonya looks at framed photos of herself breastfeeding her baby son for the first time, she swells with emotion. As a mother living with HIV in Colorado, it was a moment she wanted to commemorate. \u201cThat\u2019s how important it was to me to be able to breastfeed,\u201d LaTonya said about the photos. \u201cSo, I wanted to make sure we had that forever.\u201d For the first time, the American Academy of Pediatrics has changed its position to say people with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, can breastfeed their infants with \u201cvery low\u201d risk if they follow certain guidelines with support from their medical care team. Avoiding breastfeeding is the only option with zero risk for HIV transmission, but going forward, pediatricians should offer support and counseling for women who wish to breastfeed, who are receiving antiretroviral treatment, known as ART, as prescribed and who are maintaining an undetectable amount of virus in the body, according to a new clinical report from AAP that was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. Previously, the academy recommended that mothers with HIV in the United States not breastfeed their infants, regardless of their viral load and antiretroviral therapy use. Recommendations against breastfeeding for people with HIV date to about 1985, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that women with HIV infection avoid breastfeeding. \u201cThe AAP recommends that for people with HIV in the United States, replacement feeding (with formula or certified, banked donor human milk) is the only option that is 100% certain to prevent postnatal transmission of HIV,\u201d the new report says. \u201cHowever, pediatric health care professionals should be prepared to provide infant feeding counseling and a family-centered, culturally sensitive, harm reduction approach for people with HIV on ART with sustained viral suppression who desire to breastfeed.\u201d HIV is a virus that attacks the body\u2019s immune system, and if not treated, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. LaTonya has been living with HIV for about 20 years, she said, but as soon as she gave birth to her son, she knew that she wanted to breastfeed because of the health benefits breastfeeding has for infants, including being associated with a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes and sudden infant death syndrome. \u201cBeing a mom is absolutely amazing. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world,\u201d LaTonya said, adding that every parent desires to give their child \u201cthe best shot\u201d at being the best person that they can be. \u201cI feel like breastfeeding was a step towards me being able to provide that for him,\u201d she said of her son. After she talked talking about her decision with her doctors, they developed a plan for her to breastfeed since her viral load is undetectable and she is taking antiretroviral medications. They discussed \u201cconstant monitoring of viral loads\u201d to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a spike\u00a0in her viral load and that \u201ccomplete adherence to medication was essential,\u201d LaTonya said. CNN is not publishing her full name to protect her medical privacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s essential for people to understand the science behind it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re undetectable, you cannot transmit it to your partner. It\u2019s essential for people to understand that, as well as, if you\u2019re adhering to your medication, that it\u2019s not going to transfer through the breast milk to your child. And so therefore, why deprive your child of \u2026 having that benefit?\u201d \u2018This has been a long evolution\u2019 Although HIV can be passed to infants through breastfeeding, research has shown that the use of antiretroviral drugs can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission, and these medicines are found to be safe during breastfeeding. In the absence of the mother taking ART or the infant taking preventive antiretrovirals, the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk appears to be highest in the baby\u2019s first four to six weeks of life, ranging between 5% and 6%, according to the AAP report. But the risk is \u201cestimated to be less than 1%\u201d if the mother is taking antiretroviral medications and the virus is suppressed in her body, meaning there is no detectable viral load, the report said. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is that the AAP for the first time is explicitly saying that pregnant people with HIV who are on treatment and undetectable can be supported to breastfeed,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Abuogi, lead author of the report and a pediatrician in Colorado who works with people with HIV during their pregnancies. \u201cThis has been a long evolution, and people living with HIV have been a part of advocating for this change,\u201d Abuogi said. \u201cSome women feel shame or distress or feel like they\u2019re not fulfilling their role as a mother if they can\u2019t breastfeed, and some are really worried that that discloses their HIV status in their community \u2014 if breastfeeding is the norm and you have to explain why you\u2019re not doing it.\u201d It\u2019s estimated that about 5,000 people with HIV give birth in the United States each year. \u201cSo having the opportunity to offer women the choice, as all women have, and to support their decision is really empowering,\u201d Abuogi said. \u201cPeople living with HIV should have all of the same infant-feeding options as anyone else, and we\u2019re really working to make that a safe decision for women.\u201d Last year, an advisory panel to the US Department of Health and Human Services made similar updates to its recommendations around infant-feeding, saying that \u201cindividuals with HIV who are on ART with a sustained undetectable viral load and who choose to breastfeed should be supported in this decision.\u201d The new AAP position now aligns with those updated recommendations from the HHS panel, said Dr. Rana\u00a0Chakraborty,\u00a0a pediatric infectious disease specialist and researcher\u00a0at\u00a0Mayo Clinic\u00a0in Minnesota, who is a\u00a0member of HHS\u2019  Panel on Treatment of\u00a0HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s been under discussion for a few years now. It began with the Department of Health and Human Services panel, and I think the authors of this report from the AAP have really summarized very nicely the current\u00a0national guidelines\u00a0in the US,\u201d said Chakraborty, who was not involved in the new AAP report. \u201cA number of investigators, including many from the US working in relatively resource-limited settings, were\u00a0previously\u00a0able to demonstrate that\u00a0breastfeeding\u00a0could be\u00a0undertaken\u00a0safely if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and maintains undetectable HIV viral loads \u2014 in other words, the amount of virus in one drop of blood needs to be less than 50 copies per milliliter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the US, this is\u00a0also doable. But\u00a0breastfeeding during\u00a0maternal HIV infection\u00a0does need a\u00a0supporting\u00a0multidisciplinary team of providers to make sure that this can be done safely for\u00a0both\u00a0mom and baby.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re seeing a consensus\u2019 The AAP recommendations signal that there is now a consensus among leading medical groups that mothers living with HIV can be supported and counseled in safely breastfeeding their babies, said Dr. Elaine Abrams, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, who has treated people living with HIV during their pregnancies and postpartum but was not involved in the new AAP report. \u201cAll of the bodies that provide guidelines to clinicians are now saying the same thing. We\u2019re seeing a consensus, and the consensus also puts the mother right up-front central in the conversation and decision-making,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s moved away from telling her what to do, to rather understanding what she wants to do, providing her with evidence and information and then supporting her in her decision,\u201d Abrams added. \u201cIn the old days, that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case.\u201d In the early 2000s, studies emerged showing that infants born to women with HIV in low-income countries had increased risks of illness and death when they were given formula \u2014 and that was found to be associated with the mothers not having safe drinking water to mix with the formula, according to the new AAP report. That prompted the World Health Organization to recommend that people with HIV should breastfeed their babies in places without safe drinking water and accessible formula. As more mothers with HIV breastfed, more studies then found that when the mother took ART or the infant was given antiretrovirals preventively, that effectively reduced the risk of HIV transmission. The new AAP report noted that there is no consensus on the optimal regimen of preventive antiretrovirals for infants during breastfeeding. Also, people who breastfeed are recommended to do so exclusively, because mixing breastfeeding and formula or solid foods\u00a0has been associated with increased HIV transmission. \u201cThis increased rate may be a result of disrupted infant gut integrity associated with consuming substances other than human milk, decreases in the amount of antiviral or anti-inflammatory substances typically consumed in human milk, or other mechanisms,\u201d according to the AAP report. LaTonya said that among the guidance that her medical team discussed with her for breastfeeding was to not incorporate formula but to breastfeed exclusively. \u201cOne of the guidelines that we went over is, if we were going to breastfeed, that was the only thing that we could do,\u201d LaTonya said. \u201cWe could not mix formula and breastfeeding.\u201d Along with supporting and counseling patients with HIV who wish to breastfeed, the AAP also recommended in the new report that pregnant people be routinely tested for HIV and those living with HIV or newly diagnosed should be linked to treatment. LaTonya said that she hopes the new AAP recommendations encourage health-care providers to educate the public more about what an undetectable level of HIV means, how infections can be treated and how the virus can be suppressed. \u201cIt\u2019s something people live with, and it\u2019s not something to be afraid of,\u201d LaTonya said. The time for doctors to have those types of educational discussions with their patients would be when someone has a routine HIV test, she said. \u201cThey will talk to you about gonorrhea and chlamydia, but the HIV portion is missing. And so therefore, a lot of people are still stuck in the \u201880s with their mentality of HIV and AIDS,\u201d LaTonya said. \u201cI believe that is mostly due to lack of education.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/hiv-breastfeeding-recommendations-aap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_world_boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn", "text": "A Saturday launch for the highly anticipated crewed maiden voyage of Boeing\u2019s Starliner is off the table \u2014 and NASA has announced a new target date. Starliner\u2019s first flight carrying astronauts is now expected to lift off no earlier than June 1 at 12:25 p.m. ET, with several backup opportunities in the days following, according to a statement from NASA late Wednesday. \u201cMission managers from NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) continue to evaluate a path forward toward launching the agency\u2019s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station,\u201d the space agency said in the statement. The update comes after several previous delays this month, and a week after Starliner mission teams\u00a0reported a small helium leak\u00a0in the service module of the spacecraft. They traced the leak to a part called a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. Just days ago, NASA announced that teams were aiming to launch no earlier than May 25, saying the additional time before launch would give specialists more time to evaluate the issue, though tests had found that the leak doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the mission. \u201cWork continues to assess Starliner performance and redundancy following the discovery of a small helium leak in the spacecraft\u2019s service module,\u201d the space agency noted. \u201cAs part of this work, and unrelated to the current leak which remains stable, teams are in the process of completing a follow-on propulsion system assessment to understand potential helium system impacts on some Starliner return scenarios.\u201d This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The historic crewed flight was about two hours from liftoff on May 6 when it was scrubbed due to\u00a0an issue with the a valve\u00a0on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families, Boeing said last week. They remain in pre-flight quarantine and continue to practice in Starliner simulators, the space agency said.  Boeing\u2019s historic goals The Crew Flight Test is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand US options for ferrying astronauts to the space station. A rocky start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. Williams and Wilmore were already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule May 6 when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the latest issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket caused\u00a0further delay. \u201cThere has been a great deal of exceptional analysis and testing over the last two weeks by the joint NASA, Boeing, and ULA teams to replace the Centaur Self Regulating Valve and troubleshoot the Starliner Service Module helium manifold leak,\u201d\u00a0said Steve Stich, manager of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, in NASA\u2019s Wednesday statement. \u201cIt has been important that we take our time to understand all the complexities of each issue including the redundant capabilities of the Starliner propulsion system and any implications to our Interim Human Rating Certification,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will launch Butch and Suni on this test mission after the entire community has reviewed the teams progress and flight rationale at the upcoming Delta Agency Flight Test Readiness Review.\u201d If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit, as Starliner begins firing its own engines. The vehicle will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The history-making crew will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn", "text": "Maybe you spotted one crawling up your leg after a hike through tall grass or felt one on your dog\u2019s back as you ran your hand through its fur. If you\u2019re unlucky, maybe you found one already burrowing into your skin, engorged with your blood. Ticks are parasitic bloodsuckers, capable of spreading deadly disease, and they\u2019re becoming increasingly common. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. Ticks 101 Ticks are arachnids, close cousins of mites and more distant cousins of spiders. There are\u00a0more than 800 species of ticks found around the world, and 84 that have been documented in the United States. However, only a handful in the US bite and transmit diseases to humans. The most common ones are blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks, but they feed on lots of animals besides deer), lone star ticks, American dog ticks and brown dog ticks. After a tick egg hatches, it goes through three life stages: larva, nymph and adult. Both male and female ticks feed on blood by inserting their barbed, straw-like mouthparts into the skin of their host (unlike mosquitoes, which only bite if they\u2019re females preparing to lay eggs). However, only female ticks drink to the point that they become engorged. \u201cWhen you see a super big and engorged female, that means she\u2019s going to be laying eggs and starting that life cycle process over again,\u201d said Kait Chapman, an extension educator and urban entomologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These arachnids change dramatically in size and appearance based on how old they are and how much blood they\u2019ve drunk. \u201cThe nymph blacklegged tick, if you put these unfed ones on a poppy seed bagel, they blend in quite nicely,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island and director of that school\u2019s Center for Vector-Borne Disease and its TickEncounter Resource Center. Meanwhile, an engorged adult female of the same species can swell to the size of a pea. Tick bites and diseases While there are some months when different species and life stages are more active, it\u2019s possible to get bitten by a tick any time of year. If you find a tick attached to you (or your pet), you should remove it carefully. \u201cThe recommendation is that you use a pair of tweezers, get the tick by its head as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to twist, because we could leave part of that mouthpart embedded in the skin. And we don\u2019t want to grab the body because if you squeeze the body the tick could regurgitate more, which means that you\u2019re increasing your chance of getting tick-borne illness.\u201d Your impulse might be to squash the freshly removed tick, but it\u2019s better if you drown it with hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol and keep it to show to an expert or at least take a photo. That way, you can identify what kind of tick it is and how long it\u2019s been feeding; the University of Rhode Island\u2019s\u00a0TickEncounter website has tools\u00a0based on coloration, size and geographic location. It\u2019s important to identify the tick because certain species carry different diseases. They pick up bacteria, viruses and other microbes from the blood of infected hosts, and when they bite a new victim, they can pass those pathogens along. Blacklegged tick larvae and nymphs, for instance, often feed on white-footed mice,\u00a0which can carry a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. When a tick that\u2019s fed on one of these infected mice then feeds on a human, it can pass along that bacterium, which causes Lyme disease. Lone star ticks, on the other hand, don\u2019t feed on white-footed mice and consequently aren\u2019t carriers of Lyme. (They do carry other disease-causing microbes, though, and their bites can introduce a sugar molecule into the bloodstream that\u00a0makes people allergic to red meat.) In\u00a0a September 2023 study, researchers identified a protein that appears to play a big part in how some ticks \u2014 including the deer tick and the Western blacklegged tick \u2014 get infected by the harmful bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum before spreading it to human hosts and causing anaplasmosis, which is different from Lyme disease. Anaplasmosis can cause severe headaches, fever and chills, vomiting, and fatigue,\u00a0according to Cedars-Sinai. Understanding this protein may give scientists a better sense of how to stop the spread of the disease through ticks, the study said. But there is still a lot of research ahead before they get there. Preventing tick bites The diseases carried by ticks can be debilitating or even life-threatening, and the risk of infection increases the longer a tick has been on you. While there are some treatments available, it\u2019s best to avoid getting bitten in the first place. Various studies have suggested factors that could play a role in tick attraction, including a recent paper showing a\u00a0connection between tick attraction and static electricity\u00a0in a laboratory setting. And while ticks are attracted to cues such as the carbon dioxide exhaled by animals, they tend to lie in wait rather than actively seeking out their prey. \u201cContrary to popular belief, they don\u2019t fall from trees. They simply sit at the edge of a tall blade of grass, for example, that\u2019s maybe hanging over someplace, and they\u2019ll put their front leg out. We call that questing,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey will wait for that host to brush right by them, and so that\u2019s primarily how people get ticks: They brush by it; it attaches to their leg or their clothes.\u201d Insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus have been\u00a0approved by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0to protect against ticks. However, these chemicals work differently against ticks than they do against mosquitoes. For instance, DEET \u201cburns the feet of ticks, and they fall off because their feet are burning,\u201d as opposed to interfering with the tick\u2019s ability to find its prey the way DEET affects mosquitoes, Mather said. What\u2019s more, \u201cas soon as the product is dried, it doesn\u2019t burn as much, so it really doesn\u2019t last very long for ticks.\u201d Instead, Chapman recommends preventing tick bites by covering your skin and tucking the bottoms of your pants into your socks. Ticks also are killed by half an hour in the dryer, so toss your clothes in as soon as you get home, even before you wash them. What\u2019s more, \u201cwe favor\u00a0wearing treated clothes with permethrin\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s far, far more effective\u201d than bug spray, Mather said. \u201cIt blocks nerve conduction in ticks, and it makes them hyper-excited and then they just lose function pretty quickly, and it actually ends up killing them.\u201d Depending on where you live, he said, it might also make sense to investigate exterminating ticks living in your yard. These precautions might seem extreme, but to Mather, they\u2019re the way of the future, because \u201cwe live in a \u2018more ticks in more places\u2019 world, and more people are being exposed.\u201d Climate change may play some role\u00a0in the spread of ticks, but Mather said he believes that the influx of the parasites has more to do with white-tailed deer becoming more common in areas where higher densities of people live. As a result, he said, \u201cMore people are being exposed to the ticks that are reproducing on white-tailed deer.\u201d Despite the spread of ticks and the severity of illnesses that they can cause, Chapman stressed that with proper precautions (for you and your pets \u2014 ask your vet for tick preventatives), they shouldn\u2019t hold you hostage inside your home. \u201cYes, ticks exist. Yes, they can be a public health concern, but we don\u2019t want you to let ticks keep you indoors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should still be able to go outside and enjoy nature, but you just have to, once again, perform those tick checks. So take a little bit of time. Do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}

Read on for five essential strategies to correct improper movement patterns, enhance movement quality and minimize your risk of injury. What are \u2018wrong moves\u2019? The most significant way you can move wrong is by not moving enough.The clich\u00e9d saying \u201cmove it or lose it\u201d is sage wisdom. Human bodies are inherently designed for movement. Yet in our modern, sedentary lifestyles, we often neglect the importance of moving both regularly and well. The less we move, the less we can, and the more susceptible we are to hurting ourselves by moving in a way our body is not accustomed or intended. Understanding what constitutes right and wrong movement is crucial in preventing injury. The unique blueprint of the human body ensures the ability to move in all directions based on using the joints as they were designed. For example, certain joints, such as the hips and shoulders are ball and socket, enabling 360 degrees of rotation, while knees are hinge joints that have more limited mobility. Likewise, the middle of your spine, known as the thoracic spine, is designed for rotating, while the lower back or lumbar spine is not. Core muscles need to support and stabilize any carrying or lifting to avoid low-back stress. If you attempt to twist from your lumbar spine to get out of your car or ask your knees to compensate for a lack of hip mobility in your golf swing, you are moving wrong. Bending over to pet your cat without hinging from your hips and bending your knees or carrying heavy grocery bags without engaging your core to stabilize your spine are also examples of wrong moves. All these actions put unnecessary stress on your muscles, ligaments and joints. As you continue to adopt improper movement patterns, you not only increase your risk of injury but also compromise your body\u2019s functional performance long term. Editor\u2019s\u00a0note:\u00a0Consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Stop immediately if you experience pain. How to make the right moves Developing and maintaining proper movement patterns and training to enhance your movement quality are essential to enhance functional mobility so you can navigate your life pain- and injury-free. Here are five key strategies to make the right moves: 1. Master primary movement patterns Consider the movements required to function during daily life. To get to anything on the floor, you need to squat down and hinge from your hips. When you reach for something, you push your arm or arms forward. To open a door, you grasp the handle and pull back. You rotate to grab and latch your seat belt in the car, and you must stabilize through your core to sit, stand and walk. As such, the six generally accepted primary functional movements are squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling and rotating, as well as core stabilization. By mastering these patterns of bodyweight movements and regularly performing them with good form, you develop a strong foundation for safe and efficient movement in all aspects of life. 2. Practice moving in all planes of motion As you go through daily life, performing different variations of the primary movement patterns noted above, you are also moving your body forward, backward, side to side and twisting around. These directions cover what are known as the three planes of movement: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). It\u2019s important to incorporate intentional exercises within each of these planes into your training regimen. This comprehensive approach ensures that your body is prepared for the demands of all your daily activities and sports. 3. Train for better balance Adding balance training to your workouts will improve stability and proprioception (the ability to perceive the position of your limbs). This type of training helps you to better navigate uneven terrain and sudden changes in direction to reduce the risk of falls and injury. Unilateral exercises that focus on one side of the body at a time, such as single-leg Romanian dead lifts and lunging variations, challenge your neuromuscular system, enhancing coordination and spatial awareness. Because good balance is an essential part of moving well, you should incorporate some form of unilateral balance exercises into all your workouts. 4. Include strength training in your workouts Regular strength training builds more than muscle; it also increases bone density, joint stability, endurance, metabolism and overall durability. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends adults strength train two or more days per week. Aim to incorporate resistance exercises targeting different muscle groups through all the primary movement patterns using good form to ensure safe and effective strength development. Strong muscles support the joints in functional movement to reduce the risk of injury. 5. Cultivate your mind-body connection Another key to moving better and avoiding injury is to move with intention. While exercising, focus on your breath and what you\u2019re feeling to stay connected to your body\u2019s experience. By maintaining awareness of your body\u2019s movements and associated sensations, you can set a safe and effective foundation of mindfulness and focus on proper form during exercise. This mind-body connection enhances movement efficiency and reduces incidences of injury through unintentional \u201cwrong moves.\u201d Progressive muscle relaxation is a great exercise for cultivating your mind-body connection. I recommend practicing it several times per week. Are you ready to start moving better and safeguarding your physical fitness? Try the 10-minute single dumbbell workout featured at the top of this article, which incorporates all five strategies. Remember, injury prevention begins with understanding proper movement mechanics and consistently practicing functional movement patterns. Incorporating the five keys outlined above into your fitness routine and daily life can significantly improve your movement quality and reduce the risk of avoidable injuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/how-to-move-better-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}

Those benefits and drawbacks include valuing online platforms for social connection, self-expression and information, while also feeling the brunt of social media\u2019s effects on their attention span, confidence and contentedness, according to the report released Tuesday by Common Sense Media and Hopelab, a social innovation lab and impact investor aiming to support the well-being of young people. READ MORE: How to know if you have \u2018phone addiction\u2019 \u2014 and 12 ways to address it \u201cMost conversations and headlines surrounding social media and youth mental (health) focus solely on the harms, portraying young people as passive consumers. This research shows that it\u2019s much more complex,\u201d said Amy Green, head of research at Hopelab, in a news release. \u201cIf we truly want to improve the well-being of young people, we need to listen to their experiences and ensure that we do not inadvertently remove access to crucial positive benefits.\u201d Also driving the research is the national youth mental health crisis, the authors said, marked by increasing rates of mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and antidepressant medications prescribed to youth. In conversations about these phenomena, social media has consistently been at the center, though mental health issues can have multiple contributing factors.\u00a0 Conducted by the NORC \u2014 previously called the National Opinion Research Center \u2014 at the University of Chicago, the research includes 1,274 teens (ages 14 to 17) and young adults (ages 18 to 22) recruited online between October and November 2023. The young people \u201cprovided direction and input regarding survey content\u201d and participated in focus groups and interviews to help the research team prioritize and interpret results, according to a news release. The report is the third in a series tracking the influence of social media on well-being among youth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The researchers found the rate of depressive symptoms among youth is about 10% down from pandemic highs but is still high and comparable to the elevated levels of 2018. Nearly half of young people reported experiencing any severity of depression, and nearly a third (28%) said they had moderate to severe symptoms. Additionally, about half of LGBTQ+ youth reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, compared to nearly one-quarter of their non-LGBTQ+ peers. Those with depression were more susceptible to social comparison and pressure to show their best selves on social media. But they were also more likely to find resources to support their well-being and curate their feeds for this purpose \u2014 done by selecting a \u201cnot interested\u201d button on content they don\u2019t like, flagging inappropriate or offensive content, or blocking someone whose content bothered them. These youth also positively curated feeds by \u201cliking\u201d and spending more time on content they did enjoy, since many social media algorithms work by giving you more content based on your level of engagement with certain topics. This was especially important for LGBTQ+ youth who, along with Black and Latinx young people, faced more exposure to harassment and stress online. \u201cIn focus groups, Black youth told us their experiences with in-person harassment lowered their tolerance for similar behavior on social media, and meant they were more willing to give up the benefits to protect themselves from hateful comments,\u201d said lead researcher Amanda Lenhart, head of research at Common Sense Media, via email. The findings confirm what many researchers have seen scientifically and anecdotally, said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association, via email. Prinstein wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Social media and mental health Many participants also revealed the positives they gain from social media, citing online platforms as a place to seek support and advice; decompress; connect with loved ones and others who share their experiences, interests or identities; stay informed; and keep up with their favorite influencers or content creators. \u201cAnother important finding is the importance of social media as a space of connection, creativity and professional opportunities for Black youth,\u201d Lenhart said. Dr. Douglas Gentile, distinguished professor of psychology at Iowa State University, encouraged being \u201ccareful about interpreting (self-reported) data like these,\u201d he said via email. \u201cPeople are surprisingly bad at actually knowing what the effects of media use are on themselves,\u201d Gentile, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, added. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that anyone is lying. Just that we only see little pieces of how the media influence us.\u201d Nearly one-fourth of participants reported using social media almost constantly throughout the day, up 7% from the rate the authors found in their 2018 report, the authors found. Many young people reported an inability to control their use, social media distracting from other activities and unconsciously reaching for social media when bored. To counteract these behaviors, on top of customizing their feeds, many have also taken breaks from social media to avoid the temptation or deleted their accounts permanently. \u201cSocial media could offer (more) benefits to youth if it was designed with a primary focus on youth well-being rather than a focus on keeping kids engaged for as long as possible to make a profit from their data,\u201d Prinstein said. While, or after, using social media, try doing an emotional check-in, Lenhart said. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018How am I feeling right now? Did I see anything that made me feel sad?\u2019\u201d Taking a temporary or permanent break from the content causing the most distress could be helpful, Lenhart added, especially if you already struggle with depression. If you\u2019re a parent or guardian wondering how to best manage your teen\u2019s social media use, one of the most important things you can do is \u201ckeep communication channels open,\u201d Lenhart said. Parental involvement is important, as young adults have expressed regret that their parents allowed them to use social media so young, wishing they could go back and tell their parents to not give in to their demands, Prinstein said. Ask the teens in your life what they like about these platforms and what types of connections or activities support their mental health, Lenhart said. Let them know you\u2019re there to help figure out a solution if social media is upsetting them or interfering with other responsibilities. Respect \u201cthat each young person is an expert in their own lived experience,\u201d Lenhart said. \u201cYoung people are valuable teachers in their own right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-treatment-real-world-effectiveness", "text": "Demand for Wegovy and other GLP-1 drugs used to treat obesity and diabetes has skyrocketed, but a new report suggests that many people may not be sticking with their weight-loss treatment long enough. An analysis of health insurance claims released Tuesday found that most people using GLP-1 medications \u2013 about 58% \u2013 were on their treatment plan for less than 12 weeks, falling short of a key benchmark in the weight-loss treatment timeline. Professional organizations have set this as a guideline for when to reassess whether a treatment is providing clinically meaningful weight loss. Users start with a low dose of these medications and gradually increase it over time until they reach a targeted dose. But the analysis shows that nearly a third of people \u2013 more than 30% \u2013 dropped out after the first four weeks of treatment, before reaching the targeted dose. The findings are based on pharmacy and medical claims data for about 170,000 people with insurance coverage under Blue Cross Blue Shield plans who were prescribed GLP-1 medications that were approved to treat weight management between 2014 and 2023. \u201cThese are long-term medications to treat a chronic disease,\u201d said Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist and director of obesity medicine at Endeavor Health in Chicago, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cThis is absolutely a marathon, not a sprint. And when we do treat this as a sprint, I think patients are likely to get off of medication much faster.\u201d Experts say that impatience with results is one of many reasons patients might stop treatment. Only about two-thirds of adults who have used injectable weight-loss drugs say they feel that they were effective, according to a new KFF poll. And people who stopped using the medications were significantly less optimistic about their benefits: Only about half of those who had used injectable weight-loss drugs in the past said they were effective, compared with nearly three-quarters of those who were actively using the treatments. Side effects \u2013 such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation that are common early on \u2013 may also drive people away. Data from the longest clinical trial of Wegovy showed that 17% of people using the drug decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects. But experts say that many deterrents can be managed with appropriate counseling from a provider. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have frequent touchpoints, frequent interactions, then it\u2019s really it\u2019s hard to manage side effects. It\u2019s hard to manage expectations. It\u2019s hard to see if there\u2019s improvement in some of these other metabolic comorbidities,\u201d said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new research.  Each person will respond to treatment differently and assess the balance of costs and benefits to their heath differently. \u201cThere\u2019s not a line in the sand for every single person. Physicians and patients have to just look at all the data and make a decision about treatment together,\u201d she said. Findings from the Blue Cross Blue Shield data emphasize the important role that providers can play in helping patients stick with their treatment with GLP-1s. People who met with their providers less frequently \u2013 and those living in underserved regions with broader health inequities \u2013 were more likely to discontinue GLP-1 treatment sooner. Each additional follow-up visit increased a patient\u2019s chances of staying on the treatment by 60%, said Dr. Razia Hashmi, vice president of clinical affairs for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. And although most prescriptions came from primary care physicians, those who were prescribed GLP-1s by endocrinologists or others with expertise in weight management were more likely to reach at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment. \u201cWraparound support services really make a difference \u2013 whether a person has lifestyle support management, nutrition, diet and side effect management,\u201d Hashmi said, and \u201chealth equity matters. Social drivers of health \u2013 transportation, access to food, socioeconomic status \u2013 all of that also makes a difference.\u201d Cost can often be a prohibitive factor for these medications \u2013 a month\u2019s supply of GLP-1 medications can often cost about $1,000 \u2013 but the analysis included only people who had insurance plans that covered weight-loss medication prescriptions. Insurance plan copays may have affected cost considerations, but the individuals in this analysis were not paying out-of-pocket for their treatment. But using GLP-1 treatments are still an investment in many ways. \u201cWhether it\u2019s an employer trying to make a decision or an individual patient trying to make a decision, it\u2019s really important to understand the success factors,\u201d Hashmi said. \u201cWe want the investment to pay off.\u201d Another new report supports the claim that the benefits of GLP-1s are extended with long-term, consistent treatment. One of the first reports offering real-world data on GLP-1 efficacy found that people using the medicines had lost an average of about 1.4% of their starting body weight after three months, which steadily increased to an average of about 3% weight loss after a full year on the treatment. The analysis from Dandelion Health, a health care analytics firm, is based on the electronic health records of nearly 17,000 people who were prescribed a GLP-1 from 2019 through 2023. Compared with a group of people with a similar set of clinical characteristics \u2013 matched closely on demographic factors such as age and ethnicity, treatment indicators such as average body mass index and diabetes prevalence, history of treatments such as bariatric surgery and prevalence of related comorbidities \u2013 the analysis found that those on GLP-1s lost about twice as much weight. These injected medications, called GLP-1 agonists, are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss.\u00a0In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose\u00a0at least 10% of their starting weight.\u00a0But the new report suggests that the real-world efficacy is not as promising as clinical trial data would suggest. And experts warn that the GLP-1 treatment process can be different for everyone. \u201cThere are some people who are under-responders, there are some people who are over-responders, and there\u2019s some that respond as expected to the medication,\u201d Narang said. \u201cStudies are still happening to understand why.\u201d The data from Dandelion Health showed that the 10% of people with the best response to GLP-1s had results that mirrored what clinical trials found, but the 10% with the least success with the treatments had no weight change, or even an increase in weight, over time. Still, GLP-1 medications may have benefits far beyond weight loss \u2013 for heart and liver health, for example \u2013 which may extend even to people who don\u2019t lose as many pounds as they might have expected, experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to not use the scale as the only outcome of whether you should stay on this medication. People might be making slow but steady progress, which could warrant ongoing treatment,\u201d Dushay said. \u201cThere may be some direct benefits of the medication in the absence of significant weight loss, which is also why you should be talking to your doctor at length about why you\u2019re using this medication.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-treatment-real-world-effectiveness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
