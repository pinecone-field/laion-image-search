The commission, which launched an inquiry into the opaque pharmacy benefit manager or PBM industry in 2022, found that a handful of dominant players \u201cwield enormous power over patients\u2019 ability to access and afford their prescription drugs, allowing PBMs to significantly influence what drugs are available and at what price.\u201d Also, \u201cPBMs hold substantial influence over independent pharmacies by imposing unfair, arbitrary, and harmful contractual terms that can impact independent pharmacies\u2019 ability to stay in business and serve their communities,\u201d according to the agency. The six largest managers handle nearly 95% of the prescriptions filled in the US. Most of them, including the three largest \u2013 CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx \u2013 are owned by or connected to health insurers, as well as affiliated with pharmacies. PBMs, which serve as middlemen in the drug supply chain by negotiating rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and others, could be steering patients to their own pharmacies and away from independent pharmacies, the report found. Pharmacy benefit managers have been in the spotlight in recent years, with the Biden administration and Congress seeking to increase transparency into the industry\u2019s operations. PBMs, which keep an undisclosed amount of the rebates they negotiate, are among the players in the drug industry blamed for the rising cost of medications, which plagues many Americans. The PBM industry\u2019s trade group blasted the commission\u2019s report, saying that it \u201cfalls far short of being a definitive, fact-based assessment of PBMs or the prescription drug market\u201d and that it \u201cis based on anecdotes and comments from anonymous sources and self-interested parties, and supported only by two cherry-picked case studies that are implied to be representative of the entire market.\u201d \u201cThe report completely overlooks the volumes of data that demonstrate the value that PBMs provide to America\u2019s health care system by reducing prescription drug costs and increasing access to medications,\u201d Pharmaceutical Care Management Association CEO JC Scott said in a statement. One of the agency\u2019s own commissioners also took issue with the report, saying it failed to live up to the FTC\u2019s rigorous standard. The report was plagued by process irregularities and concerns over the substance, Commissioner Melissa Holyoak wrote in her dissent. CVS Caremark, which handles about one-third of the market, said it stands by \u201cour record of protecting American businesses, unions, and patients from rising prescription drug prices.\u201d \u201cOur efforts have resulted in members on average paying less than $8 per 30-day supply of medication,\u201d CVS Caremark said in a statement. \u201cIndependent analyses show net brand drug prices have declined six years in a row despite significant inflation across the U.S. economy and egregious list price increases from drug makers.\u201d The pharmaceutical industry\u2019s main trade group, on the other hand, said the commission\u2019s report shows how PBMs are driving up costs. \u201cThe veil continues to lift exposing the ugly truth that PBMs put profits before patients at every turn,\u201d PhRMA spokesperson Alex Schriver said in a statement. \u201cThe FTC report makes it clear: PBMs have outsized control over what medicines people can get and the price they pay\u202fat the pharmacy counter.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/ftc-report-pbm-pharmacy-healthcare/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_bird-flu-cases-extreme-heat", "text": "Searing heat may have played a role in the infections of five workers who fell ill last week while culling a large flock of chickens infected with the H5N1 virus in Colorado, health officials said Tuesday. \u201cAt the time transmission is thought to have occurred, Colorado was experiencing 104-plus-degree heat,\u201d and it was probably hotter inside the barns, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0The CDC is investigating the outbreak along with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. This made the use of personal protective equipment a challenge, Shah said. In addition, to bring down temperatures in the sweltering barns, large industrial fans were blowing, moving air as well as dust and feathers.\u00a0Feathers from infected birds are known to carry the H5N1 virus. \u201cWe understand those large fans \u2026 were moving so much air \u2026 the workers were finding it hard to maintain a good seal or a good fit either between the mask or with eye protection,\u201d Shah said. Four of the Colorado cases have been confirmed by the CDC. A fifth tested positive at a state lab and has been sent to the CDC for confirmation. The incident has quickly doubled the number of farm workers known to be infected with H5N1 virus in the United States, and it is the largest number of workers known to be infected in connection with a single farm. In 2022, a poultry worker tested positive for H5N1 in Colorado.\u00a0This year, four other farm workers have tested positive \u2014 one in Texas, two in Michigan and another in Colorado \u2014 after working with infected dairy cattle.\u00a0Cases are believed to be undercounted because farm workers are often reluctant to be tested for fear of losing work and income. Genetic analysis of the virus from one of the recent human cases involved in the poultry culling was reassuring, Shah said, because it didn\u2019t show any mutations that might indicate the virus is spreading more readily to people. Testing also showed that the virus was closely related to the strain spreading in cattle. At the state of Colorado\u2019s request, the CDC has sent a 10-person team to assist with the investigation and contact tracing in the outbreak.\u00a0Sixty people have shown symptoms consistent with bird flu, and all but five have tested negative at a state laboratory, Shah said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen strong uptake of testing across this particular farm in Colorado,\u201d he added. None of the workers was hospitalized, and many had traditional flu symptoms, including conjunctivitis or eye infections, fever, chills, coughing and sore throats.\u00a0The workers have been offered an antiviral medication and are recovering. Altogether, about 160 people are involved in the culling, or killing, of 1.8 million egg-laying chickens on the Colorado farm, which is a \u201csignificant\u201d egg-producing operation that officials didn\u2019t name.\u00a0The culling operation is expected to continue another 10 to 14 days. It is not clear how the birds became infected, but viruses isolated from the birds are closely related to the same strain that\u2019s infecting dairy cattle, said Dr. Eric Deeble, the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s acting senior adviser of the H5N1 response. The CDC maintains that the threat to the public of the H5N1 bird flu virus is low. However, farm workers are at higher risk of catching the infection, which has recently spread from domestic and wild birds to dairy cattle and other mammals. To stay safe, the CDC recommends that people working with sick or dead cattle or birds wear personal protective equipment, or PPE, which includes waterproof coveralls, a face mask, goggles or a face shield, boots, gloves and a head covering. Workers involved in the culling of the chickens in Colorado were required to wear the full uniform, but environmental conditions made it difficult to keep on. \u201cWe understand that PPE use was not optimal, particularly the masks and the eye protection,\u201d Shah said. The United Farm Workers labor union has questioned whether the CDC\u2019s recommendations are practical given the record-breaking heat enveloping much of the United States this summer.\u00a0It had called on the CDC to rethink its PPE guidance so more people could follow it. \u201cThese are people that are being asked to put their lives on the line for a virus we don\u2019t understand all that well when they have no reasonable way of protecting themselves from either the virus or from heat illness,\u201d Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers, said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re being put in an impossible position.\u201d Workers wear fluid-proof coveralls, Strater points out, which prevent sweat from cooling their bodies, making it easy to overheat.\u00a0In dirty, wet environments like a barn, masks and respirators can become clogged or soggy within minutes. The CDC said it is working to refine its PPE recommendations to account for the heat.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve sent, as part of our team, a specialist in these matters, an industrial hygienist who can help implement improved engineering controls that may make PPE use more uniform as well as more palatable,\u201d Shah said. Strater said it\u2019s time for the CDC to consider vaccinating farmworkers, as Finland is, to give them \u2013 and the general public \u2013 an added layer of protection from the virus and from the threat of another pandemic if it spreads. \u201cThey need to be prioritized, not just because it\u2019s moral to protect their lives by prioritizing vaccination, but it\u2019s a relatively small group of people, when you think about the sort of firewall they\u2019re creating around the rest of the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a huge number of people we need to be protecting. These are people who are on the front lines and who are so intimately exposed.\u201d Although US health officials have stressed that they have no plans to distribute an H5N1 vaccine, they are getting several candidates ready to be deployed in case the virus becomes more dangerous. In May, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was ordering 4.8 million doses of H5N1 vaccine to be manufactured from bulk ingredients in the country\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile. Those doses are expected to be ready by the end of the month. In early July, HHS announced that it had paid Moderna $176 million to support the development of an mRNA-based vaccine against H5N1. The agency said it expects to see phase 1 clinical trial results on the safety of that vaccine by the end of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/bird-flu-cases-extreme-heat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_988-suicide-lifeline-numbers", "text": "Two years after the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched, the service has answered over 10 million texts, calls and chats, according to new data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The lifeline, formerly a 10-digit number, transitioned to three digits in July 2022 as part of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s\u00a0strategy\u00a0to \u201caddress our national mental health crisis.\u201d Since 2022, the administration has invested over $1.5 billion in the effort, including expanding access to services for Spanish speakers, LGBTQI+ youth and young adults, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing, according to HHS. Those in crisis can reach the lifeline through a phone call, text, web chat and video chat. This year, text messages to 988 have increased 51% and calls 34% from the year before, a sign of the effects of expanded services, according to senior administration officials. Last year,\u00a0text messages through the lifeline increased 1,135%, chats answered increased 141% and calls answered increased 46%, a report from the department showed. The lifeline has made 110,000 contacts in Spanish and 475,000 with LGBTQI+ youth and young adults this year, the new report says. About 20,000 videophone contacts in American Sign Language were made, and 1.2 million calls were answered by the Veterans Crisis Line through 988\u2019s Press 1 option. \u201c988 is available to everyone,\u201d emphasized Andrea Palm, deputy secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cHaving someone on the other end of the line to listen and provide support makes a difference. It really does save lives, and that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d This year, HHS expects to roll out georouting technology to route 988 callers and texters based on their physical location versus their area code, the agency says. The move, which would follow an April\u00a0proposal\u00a0from the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to improve cell phone users\u2019 connectivity to local services and maintain additional privacy. The agency also pointed to the bolstering of a national backup system. Funneling federal funding to this system will help ensure that all contacts to 988 are able to be answered, regardless of a state\u2019s local capacity. A 911 for mental health crises In 2022, the year 988 debuted, suicide deaths reached a\u00a0record high\u00a0in the US, according to provisional\u00a0data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, the US surgeon general called for the implementation of a national prevention strategy in response to suicide rates that have been rising for decades. 988, like 911, is easy to remember. The switch to the three-digit lifeline saw an over\u00a045% increase\u00a0in overall contact volume in just the first month, according to HHS. \u201cTo remember 10 digits to call for help is not easy. That\u2019s why 911 is only three digits.\u201d said Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer at the National Alliance on Mental Illness or NAMI. \u201cTransitioning to a shorter number and a number that is focused on our wider array of mental health crises, not just suicide, opens up the door for people to reach out and be connected to the support they need.\u201d The hundreds of thousands of people who have contacted 988 in the past two years and the growth in its usage reflect the need for increased mental health services nationwide, she said. Behind the numbers Despite 988\u2019s growth, 3 in 4 Americans say they are not content with mental health treatment in this country, a July poll from the National Alliance on Mental Illness found. The NAMI/Ipsos poll also found that only 23% percent of Americans say they are familiar with 988. This is an increase from 17% in June 2023 but has not changed since October. \u201cWe need that number much higher,\u201d Wesolowski said. \u201cThis data speaks to the urgency of having awareness so people who need help can get connected to that help.\u201d However, the poll showed 72% of Americans said they are comfortable contacting the lifeline. Of those who had contacted 988 this year or whose loved one had done so, nearly 7 in 10 said they had received some or all of the help they needed. This sentiment is up 55% from June 2023, according to NAMI. HHS is prioritizing raising awareness about the lifeline and emphasizing that 988 is available not only for crises but for anytime someone needs to talk, according to senior administration officials. What happens when you contact 988 When someone calls 988, they first hear a greeting message. They are given the option to connect with specialized services and subsequently routed to a national network or local 988 Lifeline network crisis center. According to the\u00a0Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a trained crisis counselor answers the phone, listens to the caller, works to understand how the problem is affecting them, provides support and shares resources, if needed. Similarly, users can receive care through texting 988, an increasingly popular option. On a call with reporters Tuesday, Palm shared anecdotes from the progress the lifeline has made, emphasizing the real-life impact of the calls that make up this year\u2019s 988 data. \u201cA really important point are countless stories of real people whose lives have been changed forever,\u201d she said, sharing the story of Florida 988 counselor Kelly, who joined the service after losing her 18-year-old son to suicide. \u201cShe believes that if 988 had been in existence for her son, that it would have saved his life,\u201d Palm said. After the call The lifeline has reached millions in crisis since its debut, but what happens after they hang up the phone? Although the vast majority of calls do not escalate to emergency services being dispatched, users who need more help than can be provided over the phone or by chat may be contacted by local services, including mobile crisis and law enforcement teams. \u201cWe know [a police response] is not the best response for people in crisis,\u201d Wesolowski said, pointing to the need for mental health professionals to respond to cases of mental health crisis. According to senior administration officials, one of the goals of the lifeline is to divert from unnecessary police response and to ensure that users are safe while providing support based on individual needs, something that may require coordination between 988 and law enforcement. Next steps for 988 According to Palm, the administration still has more work to do to reach people who need help. \u201cNot everyone can access the support they need. And in other cases, stigma prevents them from reaching out at all,\u201d she said. Studies have shown that after speaking with a trained crisis counselor, most callers feel more hopeful and less depressed, suicidal and overwhelmed. Collaboration on the federal and state level for continued support of 988 is necessary for the success of the program to continue this impact, according to Palm and senior administration officials. \u201cIn the two years since we launched 988, it\u2019s become one of the most effective first line responses that we have to help individuals who feel alone and without options,\u201d she said. \u201cMake no mistake, 988 saves lives,\u201d Neera Tanden, White House domestic policy adviser, said on Tuesday\u2019s call. \u201cAs a country, we have a moral obligation to be there for each other, to reach out to offer help for just a listening ear.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/988-suicide-lifeline-numbers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_psilocybin-brain-study-wellness", "text": "As he began the brain scan, neurologist Dr. Nico Dosenbach wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d been given a psychedelic or a placebo as part of a new clinical trial that would capture how the brain works on psilocybin, the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms. Suddenly he felt a faster heartbeat, a flush of energy and a change in vision. It wasn\u2019t until his brain morphed into a computer, however, that he knew for sure he was on a psychedelic trip. \u201cUntil it kicks in, nobody in the trial knew if they had taken psilocybin or Ritalin (the stimulant methylphenidate), which was picked to be a placebo because it\u2019s also arousing, like drinking a coffee or two,\u201d said Dosenbach, a professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cBut then I was like, no, this is not placebo,\u201d Dosenbach said. \u201cI was the computer tablet, and my thoughts were like computer thoughts, which of course makes no sense. I was aware this was not normal, but it wasn\u2019t frightening.\u201d Dosenbach is the co-senior author of a very small, pilot study that conducted up to 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of healthy participants\u2019 brains before, during and three weeks after a psychedelic trip on psilocybin. \u201cWe found that psilocybin desynchronizes the brain,\u201d said co-senior author Ginger Nichols of the study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. \u201cWhen psilocybin is on board, the brain is disconnecting from its typical pathways and reconnecting to different parts of the brain,\u201d said Nichols, an associate professor of psychiatry at\u00a0Washington University\u00a0School of Medicine in St. Louis. These new pathways may be responsible for the success of some psychedelics in treating mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Also known as shrooms, psilocybin is illegal according to federal law, although in 2020 Oregon became the first US state to legalize psilocybin\u00a0for personal use for those age 21 and older. However, the US Food and Drug Administration has allowed psilocybin to be treated as a breakthrough medicine, a process that fast-tracks the development and review of promising drugs. Greater access to the sense of self The new study\u2019s scans highlighted an increase in connections to the anterior hippocampus, responsible for emotional memory, perception and imagination, Nichols said. Parts of the default mode network, which impacts a person\u2019s sense of self, time and space, also lit up on the scans. Antidepressants also target the default mode network, trying to interrupt the \u201cnegative thought loop, or stuck thinking that can occur with depression,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cA lot of antidepressants do work on the default mode network connecting to other parts of the brain, just a lot more slowly than psychedelics do,\u201d she said. Small clinical trials\u00a0have shown that\u00a0one or two doses of psilocybin can make dramatic and long-lasting changes in people who have treatment-resistant\u00a0major depressive disorder, which typically does not respond to traditional antidepressants. Psilocybin is also showing promise in combating\u00a0cluster headaches,\u00a0anxiety,\u00a0anorexia nervosa,\u00a0obsessive-compulsive disorder\u00a0and various forms of\u00a0substance abuse. Typically, clinical trials use trained psychotherapists who sit with the person during the psychedelic trip. In many trials, the therapist meets with the person in the weeks before and after the event to help guide and integrate any insights from the experience. The new study uses multiple brain scans to illustrate how psilocybin may make connections in the brain more malleable, thus helping people overcome \u201crigid maladaptive patterns\u201d of thought and behavior, said Dr. Petros Petridis, a professor of psychiatry at the NYU Langone Center for Psychedelic Medicine in New York City. He was not connected to the study. \u201cPsilocybin could open the door to change, allowing the therapist to lead the patient through,\u201d Petridis wrote in a review published with the study. \u201cUltimately, however, large clinical trials with diverse patient populations and factorial study designs (which enable more than one intervention to be evaluated simultaneously) will be needed to examine the efficacy of psychedelics such as psilocybin and the role of talk therapy in treatment,\u201d he added. \u2018No words, just the feeling\u2019 The study was extremely small, with only seven volunteers. Each person ingested either 25 milligrams of pharmaceutical-grade psilocybin or a 40 milligram dose of methylphenidate, a stimulant often prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Some participants returned for a second dose of psilocybin 6 months to 12 months later. All of the participants in the study had prior experience with psychedelics or \u201cmystical experiences,\u201d loosely defined as an altered state of consciousness. At the peak of his trip, Dosenbach began to feel as though he was present in the minds of people he knew, experiencing their thoughts as his own. \u201cI was in the brain of famous neuroscientists, including my most senior colleague that I work with, and literally surfing the brain waves,\u201d he said. \u201cScience doesn\u2019t fully understand the brain yet, but I felt as if I suddenly knew exactly how the brain works. Yet if you were to ask me how it worked, I would have no words, just the feeling.\u201d Each of the participants had different experiences, with only one not entering a state of mysticism, Dosenbach said. \u201cMy sense of self stretched like I was the universe,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people reported they saw God, and if I was very religious, I could see that, but for me it was more like \u2018Oh, I\u2019m the universe.\u2019 \u201cAnd then it disappeared in what I think psychiatrists call ego death,\u201d he said. \u201cSimultaneously with that I lost my sense of place, and time stopped. It felt like I was literally there for days and then weeks figuring things out.\u201d One man was able to pinpoint the specific time during the fMRI scan that he had his most vivid mystical experience, Nichols said. \u201cHe felt the light of God was shining on him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were able to actually go to that spot on the scan and pinpoint when he felt that \u2014 it happened at the peak of desynchronization (from the brain\u2019s typical pathways).\u201d A window for change Scans showed that in the days after the psilocybin trip, most brain networks returned to normal. However, connections between the default mode network and the anterior hippocampus persisted for up to three weeks, Nichols said. It\u2019s possible that this lingering effect could explain part of the therapeutic impact of psilocybin, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive effect initially, and when it\u2019s gone, a pinpoint effect remains,\u201d Dosenbach said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d want to see for a potential medicine. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want people\u2019s brain networks to be obliterated for days, but you also wouldn\u2019t want everything to snap back to the way it was immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want an effect that lasts long enough to make a difference.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/psilocybin-brain-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_summer-covid-rise-wellness", "text": "Covid-19 levels have been rising in the United States again. Emergency department visits associated with Covid-19 have been trending up for weeks, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0The most recent data shows that during the week ending July 6 there was a 23.5% increase in emergency visits for Covid-19\u00a0compared with the previous week. The CDC also reports the viral activity level for Covid-19 in wastewater is high nationally as of July 6. I have seen these trends reflected in my own social group. Two friends have gotten Covid-19 this month while traveling. And we\u2019ve seen more coronavirus infections being reported in public figures, with second gentleman\u00a0Doug Emhoff recently testing positive and major sporting events such as the\u00a0Tour de France\u00a0affected with riders being diagnosed. It\u2019s time to reset our understanding about Covid-19\u2019s summer spread. Why is this summer wave happening, and do I really have to worry about infection again? What should people do to reduce their chance of infection while living their normal life? What if I\u2019m traveling? Should I get the vaccine now versus waiting for an updated one? Do tests still work? And what should I do if I get Covid-19 \u2014 do I still have to sequester myself and stay away from family? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0How much should people worry about Covid-19 infection now that there is a resurgence of cases? Dr. Leana Wen:\u00a0Based on CDC numbers, it does appear that we are in the midst of a\u00a0summer wave\u00a0of Covid-19 infections. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Ever since the start of the pandemic, we have seen multiple waves of infections every year, including one that peaks in the summer. This could be due to increased travel as well as more people gathering indoors due to hot weather. Whether people should worry about Covid-19 infection depends on their specific medical circumstances. People who should be especially concerned are those who are older or\u00a0immunocompromised or those with multiple underlying heart, lung, kidney and other medical conditions. They should be sure they are up-to-date with vaccines, have a plan for\u00a0accessing\u00a0antiviral\u00a0treatment\u00a0and consider additional precautions such as masking in crowded indoor spaces and trying to gather outdoors instead of indoors. CNN:\u00a0What should people do to reduce their chance of infection while living their normal life around town?\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0Many people have returned to their full pre-pandemic lives and are thinking of Covid-19 the way they consider other respiratory viruses:\u00a0They don\u2019t want to get these viruses, but they also don\u2019t want to stop socializing and going to restaurants, the theater and religious services. I think the risk calculation will depend on the individual and their personal medical circumstances. One thing to consider is to reduce your chance of infection prior to visiting an especially vulnerable family or friend. For the week or so before that visit, you could avoid indoor gatherings and mask while on public transit and in other crowded spaces. Taking a rapid test just before the visit can also reduce your risk of infecting that vulnerable person. CNN: Speaking of tests, are home tests still a good way to diagnose Covid-19 if someone develops symptoms? Wen:\u00a0Rapid antigen home tests are not as accurate as laboratory PCR testing, but they are a convenient way to screen for Covid-19. People who have symptoms and could be eligible for antiviral treatment should take the rapid test. If it\u2019s initially negative, take it again the next day to be sure. Remember that this test only looks for the coronavirus. You could have\u00a0one of\u00a0a whole host of other viruses that cause respiratory symptoms. If you have symptoms, you should stay away from vulnerable people, even if you test negative for Covid-19. CNN: Do you have any recommendations for reducing risk while traveling? Wen:\u00a0While in crowded spaces that aren\u2019t well-ventilated, consider wearing an N95 or equivalent mask. For instance, mask while boarding the plane and on standing-room-only trains. Also, try to dine outdoors rather than indoors when possible. Bring rapid tests with you. And always have a plan for what happens if you get Covid-19. How will you access antiviral treatments if you are eligible for them? Where will you stay? Travel insurance is something I highly recommend; it can help with medical care and with allaying costs if plans must change. CNN: A lot of people are eager to get another Covid-19 vaccine to best protect them during the summer wave. But there is a\u00a0new vaccine coming out in the fall. Who should get the vaccine now, and who can wait to get the new one? Wen:\u00a0There is a new formulation of the Covid-19 vaccine coming out soon. It should be available in September and could be available as early as August. The\u00a0CDC has recommended\u00a0that everyone 6 months and older receive this vaccine when it\u2019s out. Since we are so close to the release of the new vaccine, I think it\u2019s reasonable to wait for the new formulation. This one should more closely target the variants currently circulating and, ideally, be a better match for the strains expected to be dominant in the fall and winter. People should keep in mind that the primary purpose of the vaccine is to reduce the chance of severe illness \u2014 of needing hospitalization and of dying. The vaccine is not as effective at reducing infection. It does have some effectiveness at reducing the infection rate, but that effectiveness wanes quickly. People who need additional protection against infection \u2014 which always carries the risk of severe illness as well as of long Covid \u2014 should take additional precautions as we discussed. CNN: Finally, at this point, what should I do if I get Covid-19 \u2014 do I still have to isolate and stay away from family? Wen:\u00a0Several months ago, the\u00a0CDC dropped\u00a0its five-day isolation requirement. Now, the recommendation is that people diagnosed with Covid-19 stay home until they are fever-free for at least 24 hours and their symptoms are improving. For the next five days, they should still try to take additional precautions such as masking and limiting close contact with others. The way I interpret this is that it depends on the medical situation of other members of your family. If others are generally healthy and not taking additional precautions to reduce their risk of Covid-19, I think you could follow the advice from the CDC as above. However, in my view, if you live at home with someone who is extremely vulnerable \u2014 for instance, an older parent who has had a kidney transplant \u2014 you should really avoid that person until you test negative for Covid-19. That means not dining indoors with them and not sharing common spaces during that period. The bottom line is that while many people can go about living their lives during this summer wave, people who are vulnerable to severe illness still should take additional precautions. Those around them should also take precautions to help protect those at highest risk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/summer-covid-rise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_tampons-lead-arsenic-plastics-wellness", "text": "The average menstruating person will spend about five years of their total reproductive lifespan using an estimated 11,000 tampons, sanitary pads, panty liners and other menstrual products, experts say. What if some of those menstrual aids contain heavy metals or potentially toxic chemicals linked to chronic diseases and reproductive and developmental problems? Past research has found tampons and other menstrual products may contain chemicals such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS; plasticizers, also known as phthalates; and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, emitted as gas or fragrances from many consumer products. All these chemical groups have been shown to disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine system, which regulates sexual development, metabolism, blood sugar, mood, sleep and more. Recently, a small pilot study found arsenic and lead in organic and nonorganic tampons \u2014 and while the levels were small, there is no safe level of exposure to lead, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, that study was unable to determine whether heavy metals might leach from tampons into the body, thus making any potential health impact unknown, said senior study author Kathrin Schilling, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. \u201cI do not want people to panic, but to be aware that heavy metals have been found in these menstrual products,\u201d Schilling said. \u201cObviously, the next step is to do research that would show if the metals leach from the tampon into the body.\u201d The study was also unable to determine whether any metal, even if released into the body, can be absorbed into the vaginal lining and subsequently into the bloodstream, said Amanda Hils, a spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration, which regulates tampons and other menstrual products as medical devices. \u201cWe plan to evaluate the study closely, and take any action warranted to safeguard the health of consumers who use these products,\u201d Hils said in an email. Vaginal tissue is more permeable than other parts of the body, so if studies were to find that heavy metals \u2014 or worrisome chemicals \u2014 do leach from menstrual products into the body, it could be a significant problem, said Anna Pollack, associate professor of global and community health at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. She was not involved in the pilot study. \u201cI am most concerned with menstrual products that are used inside the body,\u201d said Pollack, who coauthored a review of 10 years of studies on contaminants in tampons, sanitary pads, menstrual cups and other products. \u201cHowever, there is no reason for people to be afraid to use menstrual products at this time,\u201d she added. \u201cI would just be aware of the issue and monitor any research that develops.\u201d Heavy metals in tampons Schilling and her team tested 30 tampons from 14 brands purchased from major online retailers and stores in the United States, United Kingdom and Greece. The researchers conducted a blinded study, so they did not know the brands. The team ran tests for 16 heavy metals: arsenic, barium, calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, strontium, vanadium and zinc. \u201cWe found an average of 100 nanograms per gram of lead, and 2 nanograms per gram of arsenic in the tampons,\u201d Schilling said, \u201cbut there was no detectable level of chromium and no detectable level of mercury, which is very good.\u201d Organic tampons contained higher levels of arsenic, while nonorganic tampons had higher levels of lead, the study found. \u201cThe average lead concentration in\u00a0tampons\u00a0was about 10 times higher than the maximum levels currently allowed in drinking water,\u201d Schilling said, adding that arsenic levels were five times lower than current limits for drinking water. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that arsenic shouldn\u2019t be present in\u00a0tampons\u00a0at all, and we don\u2019t yet understand the effects of vaginal exposure since it hasn\u2019t been studied,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no safe level of lead exposure, and it has been shown to cause reproductive health issues in women.\u201d How did detectable levels of these heavy metals get into tampons in the first place? First, most tampons are made of cotton or a mixture of cotton and rayon, a semi-synthetic fiber made from\u00a0wood pulp. Arsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, while lead and other heavy metals are a natural part of Earth\u2019s crust \u2014 so plants can easily absorb metals as they develop. Additional chemicals found in menstrual products The soil and water of the United States and other parts of the world are also heavily contaminated with both metals and chemicals used to produce plastic products, experts say. Heavy metals can be byproducts of manufacturing plants, mining facilities and smelting processes, while PFAS and other chemicals enter the air, soil and groundwater from human waste, consumer products discarded in landfills and byproducts from fluorochemical manufacturing plants. Nearly half of the drinking water in the US is contaminated with some of the 12,000 types of PFAS, according to an August 2023 study by the US Geological Survey. Chemicals called phthalates have been discovered in sanitary pads, panty liners and tampons, according to Pollack\u2019s review. Phthalates are in consumer products such as shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys and have been linked to\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and undescended testes\u00a0in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and\u00a0testosterone levels\u00a0in adult males. Both phthalates and PFAS have also been linked to the rise in early menarche in teens and preteens. In 2022, advocacy groups Mamavation and Environmental Health News, in collaboration with the Institute for Green Science\u00a0at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, looked at levels of PFAS in menstrual products. The investigation found 48%\u00a0of sanitary pads, incontinence pads and tested panty liners contained PFAS, as did\u00a022%\u00a0of tampons and\u00a065%\u00a0of period underwear. Manufacturers use PFAS, often called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they\u00a0do not easily break down\u00a0in the environment, in\u00a0food packaging\u00a0to prevent grease and water from soaking through food wrappers and beverage cups. The chemicals are also used to make carpeting, clothing and furniture resistant to stains, water and grease damage. A February 2023 study found PFAS may alter hormonal and metabolic pathways needed for growth and development in young children, teens and young adults. PFAS chemicals have also been linked to an increased risk of adult kidney cancer and abnormally high cholesterol levels and decreased antibody response to vaccines in both adults and children. However, the mere presence of a chemical is not an indication of risk or adverse effect, according to the American Chemistry Council, an industry association. \u201cAs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0emphasizes, \u2018The measurement of an environmental chemical in a person\u2019s blood or urine is a measure of exposure; it does not by itself mean that the chemical causes disease or an adverse effect,\u2019\u201d a spokesperson for the council told CNN. How to protect yourself Tampon makers and the FDA recommend that tampons not be used at night or for longer than eight hours due to a greater risk of toxic shock syndrome, a deadly bacterial infection that can cause organ failure and death if not treated. That advice also applies to anyone concerned about heavy metals or chemicals in their menstrual products, said Nancy King Reame, professor emerita of health promotion and risk reduction at the School of Nursing at Columbia University Medical Center. \u201cBut because the vaginal microbiome, including menstrual fluid, is the least understood organ system in the body, real world advice on the use of period products based on these findings is premature to say the least,\u201d said Reame, who assisted on the tampon study. Other recommendations include washing your hands before and after inserting or removing a tampon to reduce bacterial spread, changing tampons every four to eight hours and using the lowest absorbency possible. \u201cIf you can wear one tampon up to eight hours without changing it, the absorbency may be too high,\u201d the FDA noted on its website. Signs of toxic shock, which include a sudden high fever, diarrhea, dizziness, vomiting or a rash that looks like a sunburn, need immediate medical attention. In addition, \u201cif you have discomfort, pain or other unexpected symptoms like unusual discharge when trying to insert or wear a tampon, or if you have an allergic reaction, stop using tampons and contact your provider,\u201d the FDA said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/tampons-lead-arsenic-plastics-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_science_strawberry-full-moon-june-scn", "text": "Despite its name, June\u2019s full moon will not look like a strawberry. But the bright orb could still turn heads Friday night with an appearance that is bigger and more colorful than the average moon. The full moon \u2014 which will reach the crest of its fullness\u00a0at 9:08\u00a0p.m. ET Friday\u00a0\u2014 comes one day after the\u00a0summer solstice, the day of the year when the sun appears the highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. Since a full moon is opposite the sun, this strawberry moon will shine lower in the sky than usual, according to\u00a0NASA. Because of this \u201clower than average path across the sky,\u201d the full moon could have an \u201corange- or amber-colored appearance, for the same reason sunsets appear orange or reddish,\u201d said Preston Dyches, a science communicator with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. Dyches said the effect is the result of the moon\u2019s reflected light having to travel a longer distance throughout Earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering away most blue wavelengths (which are shorter than red wavelengths). Native American tribes across North America gave the strawberry moon its name to mark the in-season ripeness of strawberries, according to\u00a0The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The moon\u2019s low placement in the sky could also cause the orb to appear bigger than usual, according to\u00a0NASA,\u00a0due to an effect dubbed the moon illusion. Scientists don\u2019t really know why this optical illusion happens, but it\u2019s believed to be a combination of how our brain processes visual information and the moon\u2019s size in comparison with smaller objects near the horizon, such as trees or the roofs of houses. For optimal viewing, Dyches recommends looking when the moon is rising or setting to see the effects of the moon illusion. No equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features, according to\u00a0NASA\u2019s Moon Viewing Guide. \u201cWhenever something beautiful about the natural world can be experienced from your doorstep, it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time,\u201d Dyches said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to marvel at the sight of another giant world. \u2026 I like to gaze up and think of it as a place people will live and work someday.\u201d How to see the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019 in the night sky Because the moon appears full for three days a month surrounding its peak, the strawberry moon will be visible to almost everyone worldwide. However, it will be more difficult to observe for those farther north, such as in Alaska or Denmark, where the low-traversing moon will only briefly rise above the horizon, Dyches said. Besides the full moon, those in the Northern Hemisphere can spot the \u201cSummer Triangle,\u201d an arrangement of three bright stars whose presence in the sky symbolizes summertime in the north, said Dyches, who also produces the space agency\u2019s monthly sky-watching highlights video called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up.\u201d To find the triangular pattern, it is easiest to look for the brightest of the three stars, Vega, which will be near the east in the sky, according to EarthSky. The second brightest, Altair, will be to the lower right, and the star Deneb, to the lower left of Vega, will finish off the sides of the triangle. Those away from bright city lights can spot the center of the Milky Way as a \u201chazy band of dim clouds arching across the sky,\u201d and the constellation Scorpius can be seen as it \u201cpoints the way to the galaxy\u2019s core,\u201d Dyches added. Remaining moons of 2024 There are six more full moons set to shine bright in the sky this year,\u00a0according to EarthSky. Here are the remaining full moons of 2024 and their peak dates: July 21: Buck moon August 19: Sturgeon moon September 17: Harvest moon October 17: Hunter\u2019s moon November 15: Beaver moon December 15: Cold moon", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/science/strawberry-full-moon-june-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_sleep-eating-disorder-wellness", "text": "Jill was in middle school when she began eating in her sleep. Despite carrying the food back to her bed to devour night after night, she didn\u2019t have a clue about what she had done until the next morning. \u201cI would wake up with these containers or wrappers from an entire box of crackers or cookies on my bed or by the side of my bed,\u201d said Jill, now 62, who lives an hour away from Minneapolis. Due to stigma and misunderstanding about sleep eating, CNN\u00a0agreed not to use her last name. \u201cA lot of people think this condition is, \u2018Oh, you get up and you have a snack and then you go back to bed.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not what this is. This is a whole other animal,\u201d Jill said of her unconscious nocturnal behaviors. \u201cI don\u2019t just get up once and take a bite of this or that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can eat a whole package of cookies, then get up again and have four bowls of cereal, then get up again and have an entire box of graham crackers. And it is always junky junk food, never, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have an apple.\u2019\u201d Over time, nights of poor nutrition and dysfunctional sleep can take a toll, Jill said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how sick you feel,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten up countless times during the night, so you\u2019re not rested, and you\u2019ve consumed enormous amounts of garbage food. Then you wake up and boom, you have to function the rest of the day. And that\u2019s what I did for years and years and years.\u201d Jill is living with sleep-related eating disorder, also known as sleep eating \u2014 an arousal condition in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Sleep eating is a parasomnia, an abnormal or unusual behavior during sleep, similar to sleepwalking, sleep talking, sleep terrors, and sleep sex, or sexsomnia. \u201cOf all the parasomnias, sleep-related eating disorder has the worst impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThese people have disinhibited eating almost every night. They gain weight. They feel miserable in the morning. It affects their whole life and is just horrendous,\u201d said Schenck, who specializes in treating parasomnias. While it may seem as if people are acting out their dreams, parasomnias most often occur during the slowest, deepest stage of sleep called delta sleep, he said. \u201cSomething triggers an alarm in the central nervous system, and your body is activated while your cognition is deeply asleep,\u201d he said. No control or restraint In the mixed state of sleep and wakefulness that is sleep eating, the ancient brain takes over, searching out foods that might satisfy the body\u2019s need for gratification. Ultraprocessed foods such as candy, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, chips and crackers are preferred choices during sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any control, you don\u2019t have any restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can consume foods they\u2019re allergic to and then have an allergic reaction. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. \u201cAnd because they choose foods like peanut butter, chocolate, leftover banana cream pie or pasta \u2014 fattening, overly processed comfort foods \u2014 they can develop or aggravate their diabetes or hypertension.\u201d Of all the parasomnias, sleep eating is the most challenging to treat, with a success rate of only two-thirds, Schenck said. In comparison, treatment success is more than 75% for patients with sexsomnia, sleepwalking or night terrors. \u201cYou can have someone who\u2019s been a sleepwalker for many years, but once they start eating during the night, before long, eating becomes the only sleepwalking behavior,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s something irresistible about consuming food during the night and sleepwalking \u2014 who wants to rearrange the furniture or just wander around the house when you can go eat?\u201d \u2018The doctors didn\u2019t understand it\u2019 Married in her early 20s, Jill continued to eat in bed at night alongside her new husband. Thankfully, she said, he was a heavy sleeper. \u201cHe would wake up in the morning to a bed full of crumbs and wrappers and say, \u2018What is wrong with you?\u2019 He thought I was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand. And I didn\u2019t understand because I wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose.\u201d Jill\u2019s health suffered. Not only did she gain weight from all the extra calories, but the quality of her diet dropped dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m a healthy eater, but I often felt so sick throughout the day, the last thing I wanted was food, even healthy food,\u201d Jill said. \u201cWho would when you ate the equivalent of six Thanksgiving dinners back-to-back every night?\u201d Embarrassed by her behavior, Jill kept her sleep habits to herself for decades. It wasn\u2019t until her son developed a disorder called idiopathic hypersomnolence, in which he would sleep for 18 or more hours at a time, that she began asking doctors about her own condition. Unfortunately, she said, broaching the topic didn\u2019t go well. \u201cMany doctors I spoke to had no idea what was wrong with me, or they just didn\u2019t get it. One doctor said, \u2018Well, maybe have a piece of bread before you go to bed.\u2019 Oh, right, that\u2019s sure to solve it,\u201d Jill said disdainfully. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this disorder or aren\u2019t living with it, you\u2019re not going to have a full understanding, but I really thought that doctors would know more,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the problem was then I felt alone, believing something was wrong with me \u2014 because the doctors didn\u2019t understand it, it must be my fault.\u201d Causes of sleep eating After years of disappointing doctor visits, Jill discovered Schenck\u2019s treatment center in Minneapolis. For the first time, she underwent a lab sleep study, which showed that she had restless legs syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes unpleasant sensations in the legs along with an irresistible urge to move them.\u00a0The sensations often begin in the evenings and can last throughout the night. \u201cIt\u2019s now become restless body syndrome,\u201d Jill said. \u201cIt\u2019s a twitching, almost like a bug is crawling inside that travels through my whole body.\u201d To ease the constant twitching during the evenings before sleep, Jill may walk around the house, flailing her arms and legs in a desperate bid to stop the sensation. \u201cYou just become so miserable, so uncomfortable, that you\u2019re swinging your body parts, kind of trying to tire them out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some nights that the twitching is just, oh, I can\u2019t even tell you, I\u2019m in tears it\u2019s so bad.\u201d Restless legs syndrome is one of four potential causes of sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou can develop sleep eating from sleepwalking, from sleep apnea, from certain insomnia medications, or like Jill, from restless legs syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those can be the ultimate causes of sleep-related eating disorder, and that\u2019s why in medicine, we call that a final common pathway disorder. All roads lead to Rome basically.\u201d Jill, however, was sleep eating long before restless legs syndrome became a key complaint. Research has shown sleep eating may occur first, Schenck said. \u201cWe studied a group of sleep-related eating patients in the lab, and they had periodic limb movements along with the sleep eating,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, lo and behold, five or 10 years later they developed classic restless legs syndrome. So sleep-related eating can be the first indicator of future restless legs syndrome.\u201d Other risk factors for sleep eating include a family history of eating disorders of any kind as well as the person\u2019s sex, Schenck said. \u201cSleep-related eating is like 70% female predominant, while sexsomnia, for example, is 80% male predominant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that society\u2019s emphasis on dieting may contribute; if someone restricts their eating during the daytime and doesn\u2019t get enough calories, that may drive more sleep-related eating.\u201d Jill\u2019s mother was always on a diet, she recalls, and wonders if that factor might have contributed to her behavior. \u201cYou know, the big thing was you had to be thin, and I wonder if as a kid I was picking up on it. But I really don\u2019t know,\u201d Jill said. Families may try to help their loved ones by waking them while they are sleep eating, Schenck said. At times, however, doing so can backfire. \u201cThe person may get irritable and angry and say, \u2018Don\u2019t stop me from doing what I have to do.\u2019 I once treated a single mother with three teenage kids who paid her three children to sleep in sleeping bags in the kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she would come into the kitchen during the night, her children would say, \u2018Stop, you paid us to have you stop!\u2019 Guess what happened? She got so frustrated she paid her children more money to go back to their own beds and let her eat in peace.\u201d \u2018Just don\u2019t give up\u2019 It has been more than 20 years since Jill first visited Schenck\u2019s clinic. Today, her restless legs syndrome and sleep-related eating disorder are mostly under control, she said, thanks to a cocktail of three medications Schenck prescribed. \u201cI take them early at night because it takes awhile for the meds to work \u2014 even Dr. Schenck was surprised I take them as early as I do to get my system to calm down by bedtime. \u201cThe medications work 95% of the time, but then I will have the occasional bad day and night,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t work, it\u2019s just exhausting.\u201d She does her best to keep overly processed trigger foods out of her home, a desire that is at times sabotaged by the treats she has on hand when her grandchildren visit. But life is enormously better than before she began treatment. \u201cI\u2019m very, very, very grateful that I finally found someone who understands what I am going through,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI know there are thousands of people out there suffering just like me, and my heart goes out to them. It is a tough journey to go through.\u201d Her advice to others? Be your own best advocate, she said. Do research and read what you can about the disorder so you know the right questions to ask the doctor. And above all, she said, request a prescription for a sleep study to find out what is triggering the behavior. \u201cDon\u2019t let doctors put you down, blow you off or make you feel bad,\u201d she said. \u201cOne doctor might not want to do a sleep study, so find another doctor that will. \u201cJust keep fighting until you get the right doctor. Get a second opinion, even a third opinion if you think you need to. Just don\u2019t give up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/sleep-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_boys-mental-health-niobe-way-wellness", "text": "Not again. My mind repeated what I had said many times before as I learned of another shooting perpetrated by a young man, this time at a weekend rally hosted by former President Donald Trump. I was angry because another shooting had come into our lives. I live in Kansas City, where there was a mass shooting during the Super Bowl parade. That day, I quickly checked with neighbors, family and friends to make sure they were safe. I have two sons, and I\u2019ve wondered what the difference is between them and the juveniles under arrest for these shootings. Is there something more that I need to do? What is the world of these young men that makes violence on such a scale seem an appropriate response? What are we all missing? \u201cThere\u2019s another story to that,\u201d said Dr. Niobe Way, professor of developmental psychology at New York University and author of the newly released book, \u201cRebels with a Cause: Reimagining Boys, Ourselves, and Our Culture.\u201d Way, who has been conducting research on the social and emotional development of teenagers for nearly four decades, realized that boys were \u201ctelling what I\u2019m calling a thick story, which is a story that reveals their full humanity.\u201d For Way, thin stories are surface-level understandings of boys and men that play into stereotypes and clich\u00e9s. We believe these narratives because they are easier to understand. By a thick story, she means obtaining an in-depth understanding of our boys and young men and the culture that leads to an AR-15. I sat down with Way to discuss her book and find out the questions we aren\u2019t asking. I, and many other fathers, don\u2019t want excuses for the inexcusable. We want to know what can be done so we never have to be here again. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\u00a0 CNN: What are we getting wrong in the conversations about shootings? What don\u2019t we understand? Dr. Niobe Way: We don\u2019t know how to deal with it. We don\u2019t understand it. We think there must have been something wrong with his mother or his father or them. We don\u2019t see the water in which we swim, and as long as we don\u2019t see it, we don\u2019t feel like we can do anything about it. And the positive message that I\u2019m trying to communicate is once you see it, once you see that it\u2019s a culture that clashes with our nature, we already have within us the capacity to solve our own problems. CNN: You say in your book that boys and men are in a crisis of connection. Explain what you mean. Way: As boys get older, and as many people at this point get older, we disconnect from our soft sides because of a boy culture that doesn\u2019t encourage and support those skills. You need your ability to listen to yourself and others with curiosity about what\u2019s going on \u2026 You need your incredible emotional and relational intelligence, which is your soft side, to be happy and connected to yourself and others. The question could still be why that disconnection from the soft side leads to depression, anxiety and loneliness. CNN: What are some of the effects of this lack of connection? Way: We start to disconnect from ourselves because we can\u2019t express our soft side, which is natural and necessary for connection. Hence the depression, the anxiety, the loneliness. Sometimes we develop a sense of alienation in isolation that builds into anger. You have to be willing to be vulnerable and soft to be connected to other people. So, once you\u2019re not willing to do that, you have a hard time with other people. Then that can lead to anger and frustration. What mass shooters reveal to us is the root of the crisis of connection and the root of violence. I am arguing in the book that this (crisis) leads those most isolated to a kind of mental illness, which essentially is delusions of power. What if they could get on top of the hierarchy of humanness? If they can only get to be among those guys who are valued, then they will have arrived. And oftentimes in their isolation, anger, and mental illness, they convince themselves that they kill people who they perceive to have done them damage. They\u2019ll get on top of the hierarchy by believing their actions say, \u201cI\u2019m powerful and you\u2019re not.\u201d So, in their mental illness, they convince themselves that this violence will get them on top of the hierarchy. CNN: You brought up this idea of hierarchy of humanness. How does this work with the isolated loner who commits these senseless acts of violence? Way: They\u2019re (the mass shooters are) putting themselves on top of the hierarchy by flipping it and by putting who they perceive to be on the bottom. Nobody wants to be on the bottom. Whether you\u2019re poor, White or a person of color, I don\u2019t care what your identity is: Nobody wants to be on the bottom. Many mass shooters believe they live in a culture that doesn\u2019t value them or have those relationships, and it potentially leads to mental illness and then to violence. It\u2019s an unreal sense of reality that they can get on top through violence. We have a crisis of connection (and of disconnection from the self), and one of the symptoms is a mental health crisis. The crisis of connection is fundamentally caused by boy culture that privileges the hard over the soft, over feeling, over stoicism, over vulnerability, autonomy, over connectedness, when in fact we need both sides of our humanity to survive. But secondly, the hierarchy is about being hard over soft and not caring and not listening and not valuing friendships and not doing anything when boys aren\u2019t having good friendships and just ignoring it and saying it\u2019s irrelevant. CNN: Is there any sort of solution that we, as a society, can begin implementing? Way: It\u2019s a matter of creating a culture that aligns with our nature and our needs. Sensitivity and stoicism work together. We have to recognize the culture in which we swim. We have to recognize that we\u2019re doing it to ourselves. It\u2019s not the Republicans\u2019 fault. It\u2019s not the Democrats\u2019 fault. It\u2019s not men\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not women\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not an immigrant\u2019s fault. I don\u2019t care who you\u2019re blaming right now, it\u2019s not someone\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the culture that we have created together. But the point is, is that we\u2019re all perpetuating this culture that\u2019s getting in the way. Next, we have gendered and sexualized what is simply human. We have gendered thinking and feeling. So, thinking as masculine and feeling as feminine, stoicism as masculine and vulnerability as feminine. We have gendered what is fundamentally human. We have the capacity to listen with curiosity \u2014 What can I learn about you from you? But also what can I learn about me from you? \u2014 and so to look at each other with wonder \u2026 This natural relational intelligence is in some ways the root of cultural change. And once we begin to do that (actively listen with curiosity to each other), we begin to see ourselves better, and we begin to see each other better outside of a set of damaging stereotypes. We begin to see our common humanity, not just our similarities, but our differences, and we start to see people as we see ourselves.

{"id": "2024_07_15_health_colorado-bird-flu-humans-confirmed", "text": "Five cases of bird flu have been identified among workers culling poultry at a farm in northeast Colorado, the state department of health said on Sunday. The commercial egg operation was impacted by H5N1 outbreaks that have also affected wild birds and dairy cows in several states. Three of the five human cases were announced Friday, and all of those have now been confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A fourth case was also confirmed, and a fifth is presumed positive based on state testing. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in a statement on Sunday that no additional test results are pending. The workers are believed to have caught the virus through direct work with infected birds. They had mild symptoms including conjunctivitis or pink eye and respiratory problems, but none of them were hospitalized, the state said Sunday. The investigation into the cases is ongoing with support of a team sent by CDC at the state\u2019s request. The CDC said Friday its risk assessment for the general public remains low. \u201cThere are no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity otherwise in Colorado or in other states affected by H5 bird flu outbreaks in cows and poultry,\u201d it said. Four people in the US had previously tested positive for bird flu in connection with the ongoing outbreak: one in Colorado, one in Texas and two in Michigan. All were workers at dairy operations. Colorado\u2019s agriculture industry has been hit hard by bird flu, with Gov. Jared Polis\u00a0declaring\u00a0a disaster emergency July 5 to ensure that the state can offer support and resources for farms in Weld County. Poultry products are still safe to eat if they have been properly handled and cooked, the Colorado health department said. The CDC advises that everyone avoid close or long exposure to sick or dead animals, animal poop or bedding. Experts also recommend against consuming unpasteurized or raw milk due to the potential for contamination. Another state finds bird flu in cattle Until the Colorado cases were announced, recent human H5N1 cases in the US had been linked to dairy cattle. On Friday, the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced that a dairy cattle herd in the state had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, raising the number of states that reported impacted herds to 13. The positive sample was collected in April, the state said, and the herd has fully recovered. It\u2019s not clear why it took the so long for the state or federal government to report the results. Since the first cattle infections were reported in late March, 157 herds have tested positive for H5N1 across 13 states.\u00a0Four states have had more than 20 herds impacted \u2014\u00a0Texas, Colorado, Michigan and Idaho\u00a0\u2014 according to the US Department of Agriculture.

{"id": "2024_07_16_health_teens-mental-health-support-parent-gap-wellness", "text": "As a youth mental health crisis persists in the US, a new report highlights a significant gap between the level of support that teenagers feel and the amount that parents think their children have. Only about a quarter of teens said they always get the social and emotional support they need, but parents were nearly three times more likely to think they did, according to a report published Tuesday by the National Center for Health Statistics. The findings are based on nationally representative surveys of nearly 1,200 children ages 12 to 17 and their parents, conducted in 2021 and 2022. Parents responded to survey questions from trained interviewers, while children responded to survey questions online after their parents gave approval. The study authors note that the presence of an interviewer may have biased parents to respond more favorably, but significant discrepancies between perceptions of parents and children were found across demographic groups. \u201cThis suggests a systematic bias where parents consistently report higher levels of social and emotional support compared with their teenager\u2019s perception, and in doing so may underestimate their teenager\u2019s perceived need for social and emotional support,\u201d the study authors wrote. Teens are often thinking about their feelings, along with their identity and place in the world, but they might not want to share that with their parents, said Dr. Jeffrey Arnett, a developmental psychologist and senior research scholar at Clark University. He was not involved in the new study. \u201cThis is sometimes something they discuss with their parents, but to a large extent, it\u2019s an individual project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to start developing an independent identity. They sometimes feel like they should be independent, so it can get more difficult to talk openly with their parents about how they\u2019re feeling.\u201d Defining support in different ways There also may be a disconnect between the support parents think they\u2019re offering and the type that their teenage children are seeking \u2013 even when there are the best of intentions on both sides, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a psychologist who was not involved in the new study but who has written books on related topics and who co-hosts a parenting podcast. A parent\u2019s first instinct is often to provide advice or guidance, while teens tend to want empathy and reassurance, she said. \u201cWhen teenagers come to adults with concerns, I think above everything else, what they\u2019re looking for is for the adult to serve as a steady presence to maintain perspective about what\u2019s happening and help the teenager gain a sense of perspective,\u201d Damour said. \u00a0\u201cSo when we go with our common instinct to offer advice or guidance or ask questions, I think sometimes that feels to teenagers like we are confirming that the problem is every bit as bad as it feels to them, and it doesn\u2019t have the intended effect.\u201d The surveys from the new report did not define social or emotional support, so it was up to teens and their parents to determine what that meant to them. And this disconnect between parents and their teens may be exacerbated by broader anxieties that parents have about the mental health crises the US is facing, Damour said. \u201cParents may now, more than in recent years, be quick to try to jump in with solutions or corrections because they are anxious about adolescent mental health overall,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the net effect is that it is probably harder than it\u2019s ever been for parents to feel like a steady presence in the face of teenage hiccups and bumps, and that may be trickling down to their kids.\u201d Overall, 93% of parents thought their children always or usually had the social and emotional support they need, but only about 59% of teens felt that to be true, according to the new report. Instead, 20% of teens said that they rarely or never had the support they need, compared with only about 3% of parents who thought the same. Links with mental health concerns Support systems are important for everyone but particularly for adolescents, who are experiencing a period of major biological and social transition, experts say. It\u2019s important for parents to encourage open lines of communication with their teens because, despite the push for independence, they are still reliant on them in many ways, Arnett said. \u201cThe relationship that adolescents have with their parents is central to life for almost all of them. They\u2019re growing up, but they\u2019re still children in many ways,\u201d he said. And the new report shows that teens who did not feel that they always or usually had the support they need were significantly more likely to report a number of poor health effects than those who did feel supported. Depression and anxiety were nearly three times more common among teenagers who did not feel emotionally supported than among those who did; nearly a third of those who did not feel supported reported symptoms, according to the new study. Two-thirds of teens who did not feel supported reported poor sleep, compared with about a third of those who did feel supported. And nearly 14% of teens who did not feel supported said that they had poor health or low life satisfaction, compared with less than 5% of those who did feel supported. Groups of teens who were among the least likely to feel they had the support they need were also among those with the largest gaps in parent perception, according to the new report. Less than half of Black teens (42%) and LGBTQ+ teens (44%) said they always or usually had the social and emotional support they need, while their parents perceived this to be the case more than twice as often. Teenage girls were less likely than boys to say they always or usually had the support they need, and there was a larger gap in perception between teen girls and their parents. Experts say it\u2019s important for adults to make intentional time to connect with teenagers in their life. This is especially true in the age of technology and social media, when physical togetherness may not always bring emotional connectedness, Arnett said. The US surgeon general has emphasized the importance of protecting youth mental health, most recently calling for a warning label to be put on social media platforms. \u201cOften, supporting teenagers is as simple as being curious about what they bring our way and then offering empathy,\u201d Damour said. \u201cTake comfort in the knowledge that helping a teenager feel heard and understood is overwhelmingly the most useful and therapeutic thing an adult can do.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/teens-mental-health-support-parent-gap-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_endometriosis-ovarian-cancer-higher-risk-study-wellness", "text": "The risk of developing ovarian cancer appears to jump about fourfold among women with endometriosis, compared with women who haven\u2019t been diagnosed with the condition, a new study finds. Scientists have known that endometriosis may be linked with an increased ovarian cancer risk, but the study details how that risk can vary by subtypes of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common and often painful condition that happens when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus itself. It\u2019s estimated to affect more than 11% of women between the ages of 15 and 44 across the United States. Women with severe forms \u2014 either deep infiltrating endometriosis, ovarian endometriomas or both \u2014 have an overall ovarian cancer risk that\u2019s \u201cmarkedly increased,\u201d at about 9.7 times higher, relative to women without endometriosis, according to the study, published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA. The form of endometriosis that is deeply infiltrating is found deep within the tissue or organ and ovarian endometriomas, sometimes called \u201cchocolate cysts,\u201d are cysts that form in the ovary. And women with deep infiltrating endometriosis, ovarian endometriomas or both appear to face nearly 19 times the risk of type I ovarian cancer, which tends to grow more slowly, compared with women without endometriosis, according to the study. But people with endometriosis should not panic about the new study findings, experts say, because ovarian cancer itself is still rare. About 1.1% of US women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer at some point in their lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, it is estimated that there will be nearly 20,000 new cases of ovarian cancer, and about 13,000 people will die of the disease. \u201cIt should be noted that, because of the rarity of ovarian cancer, the association with endometriosis only increased the number of cancer cases by 10 to 20 per 10,000 women,\u201d said Karen Schliep, senior author of the new study and an associate professor in the Division of Public Health at the University of Utah School of Medicine. \u201cWe would not recommend, at this point, any change in clinical care or policy,\u201d she added. \u201cThe best way of preventing ovarian cancer is still the recommendation of exercise, not smoking and limiting alcohol.\u201d Other than age, having a family history of ovarian cancer, breast cancer or colorectal cancer is also an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. Overall, people with endometriosis should be aware of the warning signs of ovarian cancer, including bloating, abdominal pain and changes in bowel or bladder function, Dr. BJ Rimel, a gynecologic oncologist and medical director of the Cancer Clinical Trials Office at Cedars-Sinai, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. \u201cIf a person has endometriosis and oral contraceptive pills have been recommended by their doctor for either treatment or for just plain old contraception, then I would definitely consider taking them,\u201d Rimel said. \u201cOral contraceptive pills are associated with a 50% risk reduction of ovarian cancer which is great news.\u201d Researchers find \u2018shocking\u2019 increases For the new study, a team of researchers in the United States analyzed data on nearly 500,000 women in Utah, ages 18 to 55. The data came from the Utah Population Database at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, and the researchers took a close look at how many women were identified as having endometriosis in their electronic health records as well as how many developed ovarian cancer between 1992 and 2019, based on the Utah Cancer Registry. The researchers found that the risk of all ovarian cancer types was 4.2-fold higher among women with endometriosis than in women without the condition. The risk of type I ovarian cancer specifically was \u201cespecially high,\u201d according to the study, at around 7.5-fold higher among women with endometriosis, and the risk of developing type II ovarian cancer \u2013 which can be more aggressive \u2013 was about 2.7 times more likely. \u201cMagnitudes of these associations varied by endometriosis subtype. Individuals diagnosed with deep infiltrating endometriosis and/or ovarian endometriomas had 9.66 times the risk of ovarian cancer when compared with individuals without endometriosis,\u201d the researchers wrote. The researchers found that, relative to women without any type of endometriosis, women with deep infiltrating endometriosis had the highest risk of ovarian cancer overall \u2014 around 18.8 times higher \u2014 and women with deep infiltrating endometriosis along with ovarian endometriomas had the second-highest risk, about 13-fold higher. Those dramatic increases were surprising to Schliep and her colleagues. \u201cTo see this jump tenfold, with fairly tight confidence intervals between eightfold and 12-fold, and then a 19-fold higher risk, as an epidemiologist, you don\u2019t always see those types of relationships,\u201d Schliep said. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that was shocking to me, just from an epidemiology point of view.\u201d The study data did not indicate which women with endometriosis were treated specifically with oral contraceptives or with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, which could slightly skew the data, as birth control pills are associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer and it remains unclear what associations gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists may have with cancer risk. Additionally, some women indicated as not having endometriosis in the data could have been undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. But overall, the study adds to the body of research suggesting a link between endometriosis and ovarian cancer risk, Dr. Michael McHale of the University of California, San Diego, wrote in an editorial accompanying the new study in JAMA. \u201cMoreover, these data support the importance of counseling women with deep infiltrating and/or ovarian endometriosis regarding the increased risk for ovarian cancer. Although the absolute number of ovarian cancers is limited, the increased risk is significant,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn those women who have completed childbearing or have alternative fertility options, consideration for more definitive surgery should be discussed and considered. As always, shared decision-making is essential given these evolving data.\u201d \u2018Risk is, overall, still on the lower side\u2019 The new study shows the strongest association to date between endometriosis and ovarian cancer risk, said Dr. Tatnai Burnett, a\u00a0minimally invasive gynecology surgery specialist at Mayo Clinic\u00a0in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the research but whose work focuses on endometriosis. He added that this association could be driven by a number of factors. \u201cWe know that an abnormal proliferation of cells \u2014 so in endometriosis, we\u2019re seeing cells where they\u2019re not supposed to be \u2014 and that\u2019s a genetic phenomenon. Cells gain the ability to move or be in places, and there probably is some relationship there genetically,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cBut then there\u2019s a host of other potential connections, from inflammatory connections to immunological factors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe are multiple potential associations, so I don\u2019t think we can effectively guess at one particular thing.\u201d Still, people who have endometriosis should not panic about the association, Burnett said. \u201cThe risk is, overall, still on the lower side of cancer risks,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently, even with the known risk levels, we haven\u2019t recommended any universal screening for patients with endometriosis, and I don\u2019t see that necessarily changing. We already do follow women with endometriomas or cystic endometriosis with ultrasound, to rule out the development of malignancy. So I don\u2019t see this changing our recommendations at this point.\u201d Endometriosis itself is a diagnosis that\u2019s not fully understood, which makes the association with ovarian cancer difficult to completely comprehend as well, said Dr. Deanna Gerber, a gynecologic oncologist at the Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Hospital\u2013Long Island in New York, who was not involved in the new study. There could be a genetic factor driving the association, or the inflammation that is often seen with endometriosis could increase ovarian cancer risk, she said, but hormonal factors could be driving the association, as well. Patients should remember that \u201cthe risk of ovarian cancer is extremely low in the general population. It\u2019s less than 2%, which is much, much less than a common cancer like breast cancer,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cSo, in the study, a fourfold increased risk in ovarian cancer still keeps women at a very low risk.\u201d The new study demonstrates an association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer but not causation \u2013 and what exactly drives that association remains unclear, according to Rimel of Cedars-Sinai. \u201cThere are several proposed mechanisms but none are completely proven. Some mutations in genes such as ARID1A are associated with endometriosis and endometrial cancer, which may link the two,\u201d Rimel wrote in an email. She added that another possible mechanism could involve the way in which endometriosis forms and how that formation may damage tissue, creating a more prone environment for cancer \u2014 but more research is needed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/endometriosis-ovarian-cancer-higher-risk-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_fda-ftc-thc-snacks-letters", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission issued warnings to five companies Tuesday as part of a joint effort to crack down on illegal sales of copycat food products containing delta-8 THC. Delta-8 THC\u00a0is the psychoactive cannabinoid from the Cannabis sativa plant, of which marijuana and hemp plants are two varieties. The packaging for the THC edibles looks strikingly similar to that of popular foods such as Froot Loops cereal and Chips Ahoy! cookies. The FDA has said it is concerned that these products can be easily mistaken for traditional foods, leading to accidental ingestion or overconsumption. The agency specifically cited concerns about the easy availability of these products to young people and potential impurities or unpredictable effects from processes used to synthesize delta-8 THC. \u201cInadequate or confusing labeling can result in children or unsuspecting adults consuming products with strong resemblance to popular snacks and candies that contain delta-8 THC without realizing it,\u201d Dr. Namandj\u00e9 Bumpus, FDA principal deputy commissioner, said in a news release Tuesday. A spokesperson for Earthly Hemps, one of the companies that were issued letters, said it has not sold any Dr. Blaze THC Delta-8 Slushers, Doweedos Delta-8 Chips or Delta-8 Weedos this year. The other companies have not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The FDA says it has given the companies 15 working days to submit written responses detailing how they will address these violations and prevent future ones. If the violations are not promptly addressed, the agency may take legal action. The FDA and the FTC say they are continuing to collaborate to \u201cprotect consumers against companies illegally selling copycat delta-8 THC food products.\u201d The agencies have previously issued similar\u00a0warnings\u00a0to six other companies selling products containing THC, and those companies no longer have such products in stock, the agencies noted. From January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023, the FDA received over 300 adverse event reports involving children and adults who consumed delta-8 THC products, prompting the agency to issue a\u00a0warning\u00a0to customers in June 2022. These adverse effects have included hallucinations, vomiting, tremor, anxiety, dizziness, confusion and loss of consciousness, the agency said. Nearly half of the cases involved hospitalization or emergency department visits. Between January 1, 2021, and May 31, 2022, national poison control centers handled 10,448 single substance exposure cases involving edible products containing THC, 77% of them for people 19 or younger, the FDA said in the warning. Of those cases, 65% were due to unintentional exposure to edible THC-containing products, and 91% of those were children. One of these pediatric cases ended in death after the person consumed a suspected delta-8 THC edible, according to the FDA. \u201cCompanies that market and sell edible THC products that are easily mistaken for snacks and candy are not only acting illegally, but they are also putting the health of young children at risk,\u201d Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in Tuesday\u2019s release. \u201cThose that prioritize profits in front of children\u2019s safety are at serious risk of legal action.\u201d Consumers who notice a reaction or illness after using a product are advised to immediately stop using it and contact a health care provider. Adverse reactions associated with FDA-regulated products can be reported to the FDA using\u00a0MedWatch\u00a0or the\u00a0Safety Reporting Portal. \u201cAs accidental ingestion and/or overconsumption of delta-8 THC containing products could pose considerable health risks, the companies who sell these illegal products are demonstrating complete neglect for consumer safety,\u201d Bumpus said. \u201cThe FDA will continue to work to safeguard the health and safety of U.S. consumers by monitoring the marketplace and taking action when companies sell products that present a threat to public health.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/fda-ftc-thc-snacks-letters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_election-stress-effects-sexual-health-wellness", "text": "Election season \u2014 with all its arguments about debates, political ads and fundraising text messages \u2014 brings a roller coaster of emotions. Whether you\u2019re glued to the news, debating with friends or scrolling through social media, stress and anxiety at this time can be overwhelming. If you feel that stress, you\u2019re in good company: Some 62% of Americans feel worn out by election coverage, according to a Pew Research Center survey in May. While you might know that stress from the presidential campaigns can affect your mood, energy and temper, it may surprise you to know it can also affect you below the belt. Here is what you can do about it. The connection between stress and sexual health Stress is a well-known libido killer because it triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with both sexual desire and performance. Elevated cortisol levels can lead to a decrease in testosterone, further affecting libido. The emotional fatigue and heightened stress from the current presidential campaigns can lead to an increase in cortisol and a decrease in testosterone levels, making it more challenging for people to feel in the mood. Chronic stress can also lead to other health issues that indirectly affect sexual health, such as cardiovascular problems, sleep disorders and mental health issues. All these factors combined can create a cycle in which stress has a negative impact on sexual health, leading to further stress and health complications. Erectile dysfunction and anxiety Anxiety is another common byproduct of election stress. Constant worrying about the future can trigger performance anxiety, leading to erectile dysfunction, or ED. Men with high levels of anxiety are more likely to experience ED, according to a 2021 study in the International Journal of Impotence Research. So if you\u2019re finding it difficult to perform in the bedroom, the anxiety induced by the campaign might be to blame. Election scrolling can disrupt sleep patterns Poor sleep quality is directly linked to sexual dysfunction, as it can lower testosterone levels and increase stress hormones such as cortisol. So try not to stay up late to catch every news update on the campaigns. And this recommendation isn\u2019t limited to election coverage; any form of prolonged screen time and stress-inducing content can similarly affect sleep and, consequently, sexual health. Prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule and reducing nighttime screen exposure can help maintain your overall well-being and sexual health. The humor in political stress Picture this: You\u2019re in bed, trying to get intimate, but all you can think about is the latest polling data or what one of the candidates said at a rally. It sounds ridiculous, but it\u2019s a reality for many of my patients. Humor can be a great stress reliever, so don\u2019t be afraid to laugh at the situation. Cracking up with your partner about the craziness of the election season can help break the tension and bring you closer together. Embracing humor in stressful times can not only ease anxiety but also strengthen your bond. READ MORE: Sex \u2014 does it actually improve your life? How to get election stress out of your sex life To manage election stress and maintain sexual health, it\u2019s essential to engage in relaxing activities. Take breaks from politics to read a book, take a walk, practice yoga or do whatever you enjoy to help you calm down. Practicing mindfulness through techniques such as meditation and deep breathing can also help you stay grounded. Staying active is another natural stress reliever. Regular physical activity can boost your mood, improve sleep and enhance your sexual health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Open communication with your partner about how you are feeling can help reduce stress and anxiety. Walk together, discuss your worries and find ways to support each other during these tense times. The importance of voting Even with all this stress, it\u2019s important to remember the power and privilege of voting. Not everyone around the world gets to vote. Your voice matters, and participating in the democratic process is an essential way to contribute to the future you want to see. If you haven\u2019t registered to vote, you can do so at vote.gov. Even when you\u2019ve done all you can do, know that election stress is real and can have surprising effects on your sexual health. By acknowledging the problem and taking proactive steps to manage your stress, you can maintain a healthy and satisfying sex life, even during the most turbulent political times.

{"id": "2024_07_10_travel_camp-stove-cooking-wellness", "text": "You know what I love doing in the summer? I\u2019ll give you three things: \u2022 Taking road trip vacations\u2022 Eating well on my road trips\u2022 Not going over my food budget while on a road trip That last one is a little tricky to pull off because \u2014 and I admit this might be an obvious statement \u2014 the cost of eating adds up over the course of a vacation. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who loves to fill up on a big, leisurely brunch, finding affordable but memorable options for every meal during a long trip can be challenging. I used to make do with deli sandwiches and brought-from-home snacks, but now I have a secret weapon for quick but satisfying road trip lunches: my Coleman camp stove. Despite my outdoorsy hippie reputation among friends, this was the first time I dove into cooking on an outdoor propane stove before renting a camper van for a cross-country trip with my husband on Route 66. But once we were on the road and figured out the logistics of our travel routine, I realized the stove\u2019s versatility and utility, not to mention the genuine fun of being able to cook lunch on the go. With a two-burner stove and pump sink in the back of our camper van, we could pull over and cook lunch pretty much anywhere during each day\u2019s adventures. I made pesto rotini in the parking lot of Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s historic home in Missouri, flipped grilled cheese sandwiches in a local park in Baxter Springs, Kansas, and slurped up cheesy zoodles outside the Painted Desert Inn in Petrified Forest National Park. Now I\u2019m a seasoned outdoor cook and have invested in a full mini kitchen setup for my camping excursions. I\u2019ve fallen in love with camp stove cooking so much that I now bring it with us on most of our summer road trips \u2014 whether we\u2019re camping or not. Coupled with my trusty 10-inch cast-iron skillet, the camp stove gives me a way to save a few bucks and eat well during the day so we can have a big dinner out. I might get a few stares in hotel parking lots and patio areas, but it\u2019s worth it for the convenience and reassurance of a good meal while sticking to my frugal budget. Hey, I own all these items already \u2014 why not use them? My road-trip stove setup Along with my stove and skillet, I also bring a few basic tools for cooking and cleaning. I keep a crate packed with the following: \u2022 Metal tongs\u2022 Fish spatula (slotted spatula)\u2022 Silicone spoonula\u2022 Silicone trivet\u2022 Olive oil (in a small squeeze bottle)\u2022 Kosher salt\u2022 Bar towels\u2022 Washcloth\u2022 Laundry tub\u2022 Castile soap Because I\u2019m using a propane stove, I only cook in well-ventilated outdoor areas and bring a foldable metal table to make sure there is a safe cooking surface no matter where I\u2019ll be. Keep meals simple with pre-prepped ingredients Simplicity is the key to easy camp stove lunches. When I\u2019m planning these meals, I don\u2019t want to complicate my prep with anything that requires chopping on-site. Remember, all equipment needs to be washed in your hotel bathroom, so this is no time to get fancy. To accomplish this, I turn to pre-prepped ingredients, a departure from my usual higher-maintenance home cooking. However, these items are easy to find in many US grocery stores, so they don\u2019t need to be packed in advance. With these versatile building blocks, I can make a variety of meals. I start with a base of shelf-stable carbs, such as bagged, ready-to-eat pasta, rice or grain blends. Protein comes in the form of beans, whether canned or bagged, frozen mini meatballs or seasoned tofu or seitan from the refrigerated section. The frozen and refrigerated produce sections offer a cornucopia of quick-cooking vegetable choices, including zoodles, cauliflower rice and stir-fry blends, pre-chopped onions and peppers, green beans, snap peas, baby spinach, and broccoli florets. Sauces can be as varied as pesto, marinara, salsa, salad dressings, or simply a bit of butter and salt. I\u2019ve also been known to bring some cheese powder from my pantry to make a macaroni and cheese meal as well. Don\u2019t forget that a one-skillet meal can also be as easy as a quesadilla, nachos, flatbreads or a homemade grilled cheese that beats the pants off a basic cold deli sandwich. Mix and match these ingredients and find the fun in cooking outdoors on your camp stove for your next road trip.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/travel/camp-stove-cooking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_long-covid-risk", "text": "With a summer wave of Covid-19 infections sweeping the country, a timely new study has looked at the risk of getting long Covid and whether those odds have changed over time. It found that the likelihood of developing long Covid has dropped since the start of the pandemic but remains substantial, especially for people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against the coronavirus. About 7% of American adults, roughly 18 million people, have ever had long Covid, according to an analysis by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that was published in June.\u00a0Harvard economist David Cutler estimated in 2022 that the total cost of long Covid to the nation was $3.7 trillion, or 17% of the country\u2019s pre-Covid gross domestic product. The new study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggests that the human and financial toll will only grow.\u00a0The investigation leaned on computers and advanced machine learning to sift through the data in millions of medical records maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis and the VA Health System set out to find people who caught Covid over different points in the pandemic \u2013 before vaccines were available, during the period when the Delta variant was dominating transmission and after the Omicron family of variants entered the picture \u2013 to see whether the risk of lingering symptoms related to long Covid had changed. They also considered vaccination status. People were considered vaccinated if they\u2019d had at least their initial series of shots and unvaccinated if they had not. The study included more than 441,000 people who caught Covid-19 between March 2020 and the end of January 2022 and who lived at least 30 days after infection. Their records were compared with those of more than 4.7 million people who didn\u2019t catch Covid but who were seen at the VA for other reasons over the same time period. The researchers found that in the first year, when the ancestral coronavirus strain was circulating and there was little immunity against the virus, 1 out of every 10 people who caught Covid went on to have symptoms consistent with long Covid. Symptoms were counted across 10 disease categories as part of long Covid if they were new and developed between 30 days and a year after an initial Covid infection. Vaccines were a game-changer, cutting the risk of long Covid by half during the Delta wave, which struck in the summer of 2021. The risk remained high during Delta for people who were not vaccinated, however. Roughly 10% continued to have symptoms that lingered after their initial infection. During Omicron, which started after Thanksgiving in 2021, 3.5% of people who were vaccinated went on to develop long Covid after the acute phase of infection, while 7.7% of people who were unvaccinated did. The study has some limitations.\u00a0People treated at the VA are mostly White men, so the study population isn\u2019t as diverse as the general population, and its findings may not apply to everyone. For example, a recent study found that nearly 1 in 10 people who get Covid-19 for the first time while pregnant will go on to develop long Covid, an incidence that may be higher than in the general population. The new study doesn\u2019t account for possible differences in people who stopped after their primary series of Covid-19 vaccines and those who went on to get recommended boosters to keep their immunity up to date as the virus mutated over time. It also doesn\u2019t consider the immunity that people might develop after infection and reinfection, although that\u2019s a question senior study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, who is chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, said he is looking into as a follow-up. Al-Aly estimates that nearly three-quarters of the drop in long Covid risk since the early days of the pandemic can be attributed to vaccines. Although the cause or causes of long Covid symptoms aren\u2019t completely understood, there\u2019s some evidence that people with long Covid continue to have active virus hiding out in their bodies long after their initial infections. \u201cVaccines actually help your immune system to get rid of the virus,\u201d Al-Aly said. \u201cThey help the immune system suppress the viral load and clear the virus faster.\u201d The importance of vaccination is a key takeaway from the study, said Dr. Hector Bonilla, who is co-director of Stanford\u2019s Post-Acute Covid-19 Syndrome Clinic. Bonilla said that when Covid vaccines first became available, most people were eager to get vaccinated, and doctors saw a large drop in the number of new patients coming to them with lingering symptoms. Now, instead of a flood, they have more of a steady influx of new patients at his clinic, some of whom develop long Covid after a second or third infection. \u201cLong Covid is a bad illness,\u201d Bonilla said. And many people are caught off-guard when they experience it. But at this point, most have made their minds up about whether to stay up-to-date with their shots. He says more people need to understand that vaccination is a critical way to lower long Covid risk. \u201cVaccination is still a very important piece to prevent long Covid symptoms,\u201d Bonilla said. After the impact of vaccination, the study says, the other 30% of the drop in risk over time is probably to due to changes in the virus itself. \u201cThe virus is changing, is evolving, and it has, even among unvaccinated people, led to less risk of long Covid-19 over time than the original or the very early era of the pandemic,\u201d Al-Aly said. So according to the latest data, about 3 people out of 100 who are vaccinated with at least their primary series and catch Covid-19 now will go on to have long Covid, Al-Aly said. That\u2019s important progress but still amounts to a large number of people living with disability and poor health. Experts who were not involved in the study agree that 3.5% means the risk of long Covid is still substantial and serious. \u201cLarge numbers of new infections and reinfections are still translating into a huge number of persons with long Covid,\u201d Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University who treats people with long Covid, said in an email. \u201cWhile numbers have dropped from the early days of the pandemic, we are still seeing new patients with long Covid that developed after a recent infection,\u201d he added. Al-Aly said this study and others underscore the need for more funding for coordinated and continuing care for long Covid patients as well as the need for more urgency in the search for treatments. \u201cI don\u2019t think the US is doing enough to address this problem,\u201d Al-Aly said. \u201cI understand the desire to move on and put it all behind us, but the fact is, there are literally millions of people who are suffering from long Covid, and then even with the decline in number, there will continue to be millions more. \u201cThere is really no plan to tackle this issue, and that cannot be.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/long-covid-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death", "text": "Lisa Pisano, the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney, died Sunday,\u00a0according to\u00a0NYU Langone Health, where she had the surgery. Pisano\u00a0received the transplant on April 12, but the organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed May 29. Her case was the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the animal\u2019s thymus gland. Pisano\u00a0was brave and altruistic, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute,\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday. She had said\u00a0during a news conference after the procedure that even if the organ transplant didn\u2019t work for her, it might for the next person. \u201cAt least somebody is going to benefit from it,\u201d she said. Montgomery said Tuesday that \u201cLisa\u2019s contributions to medicine, surgery, and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. \u2026 Lisa helped bring us closer to realizing a future where someone does not have to die for another person to live.\u201d Every eight minutes, another person is added to the transplant waiting list, and 17 people from this list die each day waiting for an organ, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Xenotransplantation, which involves using organs from other species, is a potential solution to the shortage of available donor organs, experts say. Doctors in the US perform xenotransplants in rare cases, with permission from the US Food and Drug Administration. For Pisano, the permission came through the agency\u2019s expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policy, which allows terminally ill patients who have no other treatment options to access experimental medical products. Due to Pisano\u2019s heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, she couldn\u2019t have a standard transplant, NYU Langone said in a news release. Before the xenotransplant, Pisano\u00a0said,\u00a0she had \u201ctried everything else\u201d and, with the surgery, was hoping to spend time with her grandkids and play with them. The pig kidney she received was genetically altered to evade human antibodies, which typically detect and attack foreign organs. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed beneath the pig kidney\u2019s cover to further help Pisano\u2019s body accept the organ. However, the kidney was removed in May after it was determined that it was \u201cno longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen,\u201d Montgomery said at the time. Pisano\u2019s \u201cbravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs,\u201d he said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cHer legacy as a pioneer will live on and she will forever be remembered for her courage and good nature.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_science_fireball-sighting-sonic-boom-nyc-nj", "text": "A meteor bright enough to be spotted in broad daylight streaked across the sky on Tuesday morning, catching the attention of several East Coasters who documented their sightings. The fireball, defined as a meteor\u00a0brighter than the planet Venus, is estimated to have soared over New York City before traversing a short path southwest and disintegrating about 31 miles (50 kilometers) above Mountainside, New Jersey, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA\u2019s Meteoroid Environment Office. The meteor was likely about 1 foot (0.3 meter) in diameter, which would have made the rock bright enough to see during the day, Cooke said. Spying a meteor of this size is a rarer occurrence than catching sight of the smaller particles a few millimeters (less than an inch) in size typically seen in the night sky. The American Meteor Society received over 40 reports of a fireball sighting at around 11:15 a.m. ET over New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and a few other states in the US Northeast. The society confirmed that two videos submitted to AMS included footage of the fireball. One clip came from a home security camera in Wayne, New Jersey, and the other from a dedicated meteor camera system positioned in Northford, Connecticut. During the same time eyewitnesses said they observed the fireball, several other spectators reported a loud sound as well as shaking in the area. A meteor can make an explosive sound when the rock breaks apart into smaller pieces, creating a \u201cpressure wave,\u201d Cooke said. This type of fracturing could also have caused the ground to shake. But NASA cannot confirm whether the meteor\u2019s appearance was linked to these two events, since infrasound detectors used to pick up low-frequency sound in the area were oversaturated by military activity simultaneously happening in the south, he added. Did the fireball leave behind meteorites? It\u2019s also possible for a meteor to travel fast enough to create a sonic boom if fragments survive entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and reach the lower layer, said Robert Lunsford, the fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society. \u201cWhen sounds are heard from a fireball, this indicates that some fragments survived down to the lower atmosphere and may have left small remnants of the original fireball on the ground. These remnants are traveling much faster than the speed of sound,\u201d Lunsford said in an email. However, this fireball likely did not create any meteorites, the term for a meteoroid that makes it to the ground, as it had disintegrated in the sky due to its size and speed, Cooke said. The last fireball reported in daylight over the area was about a year and a half ago, Cooke said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a maybe once a year\u2013type occurrence,\u201d but the timing of the fireball was ideal to spark a lot of attention, he added. \u201cPeople were out walking, doing their daily lunchtime thing, and all of a sudden this streak flashed across the sky \u2014 it was in the right place and the right time.\u201d If sky-gazers are looking to catch more glimpses of fireballs, there are several meteor showers set to peak within the next few weeks. The Southern Delta Aquariids could offer a sight of 20 meteors per hour at the end of July, and the Perseids could bring upward of 100 meteors per hour in mid-August, according to the\u00a0American Meteor Society.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/science/fireball-sighting-sonic-boom-nyc-nj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli", "text": "Children in Ivory Coast received the first doses of a new, relatively cheap malaria vaccine on Monday, a step that has been hailed as a major milestone in the battle against one of the world\u2019s most deadly diseases. The R21 vaccine, developed by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India (SII), has been sent to several African countries and will also be administered in South Sudan Tuesday, the University of Oxford said in a statement sent to CNN. The vaccine costs less than $4 a dose, making it \u201crealistic to roll out in many tens of millions of doses from now on,\u201d and it has high efficacy levels of around 75%-80% in young children, Professor Adrian Hill, director\u00a0of the\u00a0Jenner Institute\u00a0at\u00a0Oxford University, who led the development of the vaccine, said in an interview with BBC Radio on Monday. Up to 500,000 child deaths could be saved every year with the widespread implementation of R21, alongside its counterpart RTS,S vaccine, according to modeling by the World Health Organization (WHO). Spread by some types of mosquitoes, malaria is preventable and curable but still killed around 608,000 people around the world in 2022, according to WHO. About 95% of those deaths occurred in Africa, where children under the age of 5 account for around 80% of all malaria deaths across the continent. The SIII has already manufactured more than 25 million doses and has committed to producing up to 100 million doses a year, a scale that allows the vaccine to remain affordable, according to the statement from the University of Oxford. There are enough doses that 250,000 children under the age of 2 will initially be vaccinated in Ivory Coast, while Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic have all authorized the vaccine, too, the university said.   R21 will be used alongside the RTS,S vaccine, which has already been delivered to more than 2 million children over a four-year pilot program in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, where it reduced all-cause mortality by 13%, according to UNICEF. Both these vaccines have been approved by the WHO and are expected to have a hugely positive impact on public health, alongside other prevention strategies like mosquito nets. Hill added that there is still \u201ca lot of work for people in-country to get set up, particularly when you\u2019re aiming to distribute millions of doses from this year.\u201d \u201cThis is a three-dose vaccine, typically (given at) five, six, seven months of age and then a booster a year later. That\u2019s not a time point that other vaccines are usually given at, so there\u2019s training required in these largely relatively low income countries.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_voice-box-transplant", "text": "A Massachusetts man has regained his voice after surgeons removed his cancerous larynx and, in a pioneering move, replaced it with a donated one. Transplants of the so-called voice box are extremely rare, and normally aren\u2019t an option for people with active cancer. Marty Kedian is only the third person in the U.S. ever to undergo a total larynx transplant \u2013 the others, years ago, because of injuries \u2013 and one of a handful reported worldwide. Surgeons at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona offered Kedian the transplant as part of a new clinical trial aimed at opening the potentially lifechanging operation to more patients, including some with cancer, the most common way to lose a larynx. \u201cPeople need to keep their voice,\u201d Kedian, 59, told The Associated Press four months after his transplant \u2013 still hoarse but able to keep up an hourlong conversation. \u201cI want people to know this can be done.\u201d He became emotional recalling the first time he phoned his 82-year-old mother after the surgery \u201cand she could hear me. \u2026 That was important to me, to talk to my mother.\u201d The study is small \u2014 just nine more people will be enrolled. But it may teach scientists best practices for these complex transplants so that one day they could be offered to more people who can\u2019t breathe, swallow or speak on their own because of a damaged or surgically removed larynx. \u201cPatients become very reclusive, and very kind of walled off from the rest of the world,\u201d said Dr. David Lott, Mayo\u2019s chair of head and neck surgery in Phoenix. He started the study because \u201cmy patients tell me, \u2018Yeah I may be alive but I\u2019m not really living.\u2019\u201d Lott\u2019s team reported early results of the surgery Tuesday in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. The larynx may be best known as the voice box but it\u2019s also vital for breathing and swallowing. Muscular tissue flaps called vocal cords open to let air into the lungs, close to prevent food or drink from going the wrong way \u2013 and vibrate when air pushes past them to produce speech. The first two U.S. larynx transplant recipients \u2013 at the Cleveland Clinic in 1998 and the University of California, Davis, in 2010 \u2013 had lost their voices to injuries, one from a motorcycle accident and the other damaged by a hospital ventilator. But cancer is the biggest reason. The American Cancer Society estimates more than 12,600 people will be diagnosed with some form of laryngeal cancer this year. While today many undergo voice-preserving treatment, thousands of people have had their larynx completely removed, breathing through what\u2019s called a tracheostomy tube in their neck and struggling to communicate. Although the earlier U.S. recipients achieved near normal speech, doctors haven\u2019t embraced these transplants. Partly that\u2019s because people can survive without a larynx \u2013 while antirejection drugs that suppress the immune system could spark new or recurring tumors. \u201cWe want to be able to push those boundaries but do it as safely and ethically as we can,\u201d Lott said. Head-and-neck specialists say the Mayo trial is key to helping larynx transplants become a viable option. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a \u2018one-off,\u2019\u201d but an opportunity to finally learn from one patient before operating on the next, said Dr. Marshall Strome, who led the 1998 transplant in Cleveland. This first attempt in a cancer patient \u201cis the next important step,\u201d he said. Other options are being studied, noted Dr. Peter Belafsky of UC Davis, who helped perform the 2010 transplant. His patients at high risk of larynx loss record their voice in anticipation of next-generation speech devices that sound like them. But Belafsky said there\u2019s \u201cstill a shot\u201d for larynx transplants to become more common while cautioning it likely will take years more research. One hurdle has been achieving enough nerve regrowth to breathe without a trach tube. Kedian was diagnosed with a rare laryngeal cartilage cancer about a decade ago. The Haverhill, Massachusetts, man underwent more than a dozen surgeries, eventually needing a trach tube to help him breathe and swallow \u2014 and struggled even to muster a raspy whisper through it. He had to retire on disability. Still the once gregarious Kedian, known for long conversations with strangers, wouldn\u2019t let doctors remove his entire larynx to cure the cancer. He desperately wanted to read bedtime stories to his granddaughter, with his own voice rather than what he called robotic-sounding speech devices. Then Kedian\u2019s wife Gina tracked down the Mayo study. Lott decided he was a good candidate because his cancer wasn\u2019t fast-growing and \u2013 especially important \u2013 Kedian already was taking antirejection drugs for an earlier kidney transplant. It took 10 months to find a deceased donor with a healthy enough larynx just the right size. Then on Feb. 29, six surgeons operated for 21 hours. After removing Kedian\u2019s cancerous larynx, they transplanted the donated one plus necessary adjoining tissues \u2013 thyroid and parathyroid glands, the pharynx and upper part of the trachea \u2013 and tiny blood vessels to supply them. Finally, using new microsurgical techniques, they connected nerves critical for Kedian to feel when he needs to swallow and to move the vocal cords. About three weeks later, Kedian said \u201chello.\u201d Soon he\u2019d relearned to swallow, working up from applesauce to macaroni and cheese and hamburgers. He got to say hi to granddaughter Charlotte via video, part of his homework to just keep talking. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Kedian, who moves back to Massachusetts soon. His tracheostomy remains in place at least a few more months but \u201cI\u2019m pushing myself to make it go faster because I want these tubes out of me, to go back to a normal life.\u201d And just as Lott had assured him, Kedian retained his beloved Boston accent.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/voice-box-transplant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_science_ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white", "text": "During the Cretaceous Period, a genus of sharks roamed the sea with rows of unusual teeth. Mostly large and rounded, these chompers were not meant to slice through their prey, but to grind and crush shelled creatures. However, since the sharks\u2019 presence in the fossil record has mostly consisted of isolated teeth, scientists have been left to speculate on what the rest of this ancient predator looked like since its\u00a0discovery in the 18th century. Now, remains uncovered from limestone quarries in northeastern Mexico are finally giving researchers a clearer idea of the shark\u2019s appearance, including one fossil that shows almost all skeletal elements and an outline of the specimen\u2019s soft-tissue body. The find also reveals where the genus, known as Ptychodus, sat on the shark evolutionary tree, and other previously unknown traits of this \u201clong-standing enigma,\u201d according to a study published in April in the journal\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. \u201cThe finding of the skeletal remains in Mexico not only allow us to unite these teeth that have been searching for a long time for a skeleton, but also allow us as scientists to revise our previous hypotheses regarding its biology and relationships and see what we got right and what we got wrong,\u201d said study coauthor\u00a0Dr. Eduardo Villalobos Segura, an assistant professor in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna, Austria, in an email. The discovery also provides insight into the evolutionary history of sharks found in our oceans today, experts say. Ancient relative of the great white shark Most species of Ptychodus lived between 100 and 80 million years ago during the\u00a0late Cretaceous period. The deposits in which the fossils were discovered \u2014 in Nuevo Le\u00f3n near the municipality of Vallecillo \u2014 date back to\u00a0approximately 93.9 to 91.85 million\u00a0years ago, Villalobos Segura said. Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage, they do not fossilize well, typically leaving archaeologists only teeth and few skeletal remains to find. But evidence suggests the\u00a0Nuevo Le\u00f3n fossils ended up in mostly stagnant conditions that would have allowed for an oxygen-deficient zone, resulting in the preservation of the soft skeletons, Villalobos Segura said. In the study, the researchers analyzed six fossils found at the site, including the complete specimen. Three other fossils were almost complete, and two were incomplete. With these remains, the study authors determined that Ptychodus belonged to the order of sharks known as Lamniformes, or mackerel sharks, the same group that the extinct\u00a0Otodus megalodon\u00a0and the modern great white shark belong to. Lamniformes also includes the modern species of megamouth, sand, goblin and basking sharks,\u00a0among others. \u201cPresent-day\u00a0sharks represent just a vanishingly minimal portion of the astonishing biodiversity that occurred throughout their entire evolutionary history (spanning almost 400 million years) \u2026 studying fossil\u00a0sharks is crucial to understand fully the evolutionary phenomena related to current groups,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Manuel Amadori, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna in Austria, in an email. The existence of mackerel sharks with crushing teeth was unknown until now, Amadori said. \u201cThere is still much more to discover, but we can say that we have taken another important step forward in understanding the complex evolutionary history of mackerel sharks,\u201d he added. The outline of the body, which revealed the shark\u2019s shape and fin location, also provides evidence that the prehistoric fish was not just a bottom-dweller as previously believed, but instead, a fast-swimming predator that might have hunted and eaten sea turtles and large ammonites instead of only eating mollusks found on the ocean floor, according to the study authors. Although the shark\u2019s exact diet is still unknown, the researchers suggest that this revised hypothesis about what it ate could be a hint at the cause of Ptychodus\u2019 extinction, since it puts the shark in competition with other Late Cretaceous marine predators with similar diets. \u201cWithout a complete specimen (hard evidence), what was known about Ptychodus beyond the teeth was largely scientific guesswork,\u201d said Michael Everhart, an adjunct curator of paleontology at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas, and an expert on\u00a0Late Cretaceous marine fossils, in an email. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThe new specimens answer questions that go back 180+ years to the 1830s when\u00a0Louis Agassiz\u00a0(an early renowned scientist and paleontologist)\u00a0first coined the name Ptychodus,\u201d which means rugous or\u00a0wrinkled tooth, Everhart added. Massive shell-crushing sharks The findings also suggested that the largest species of Ptychodus may have been slightly smaller than previously thought, reaching a maximum length of 9.7 meters (nearly 32 feet). Previous estimates of a species known as Ptychodus mortoni put it at 11.2 meters (nearly 37 feet), but the revised size is still larger than modern apex shark predators, the authors note in the study. Great whites today reach up to\u00a06 meters (20 feet)\u00a0in length. There are modern shell-crushing species, the largest being the Zebra shark, which reaches a maximum length of a little over 3.5 meters (12 feet) \u2014 not near as gigantic as Ptychodus. \u201cThe crushing teeth together with the gigantic size make Ptychodus a very unique shark,\u201d Amadori said. \u201c(In the fossil record) some teeth are massive, polygonal and almost flat, while others have strange, rounded protuberances or pointed cusps on the top surface. All these were joined together to form massive tooth plates, which this predator of the past could have used to crush almost anything it encountered.\u201d A new fossil revealing the complete side view of Ptychodus measured nearly 1.5 meters (about 5 feet) in length, suggesting it was from was of a much smaller shark. This could be due to the remains belonging to a younger shark, or because the Ptychodus genus included various species of different sizes, Villalobos Segura said. According to the nonprofit Mindat.org database, there are 22 species of Ptychodus currently known. Most species and individuals of Ptychodus were likely smaller than the largest Ptychodus mortoni specimen discovered, but there could also be the possibility of larger species yet to be found, Everhart said. Often, researchers can tell apart the different species of Ptychodus by varying features in the teeth, but the study authors were unable to identify which\u00a0species of Ptychodus\u00a0the six fossils studied belonged to due to the teeth being too worn down, Villalobos Segura said. The researchers said they hope future research reveals more about the ancient shark, including its diet and its role in past marine food chains and ecosystems. \u201c(The April study) is a comprehensive review of some remarkably complete fossils of the strange Cretaceous shark, Ptychodus,\u201d said Dr. Bretton Kent, an emeritus principal lecturer in the department of entomology at the University of Maryland, who has\u00a0studied and lectured\u00a0on the diversification of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). He was not involved in the study. \u201cOur present world can act like a set of blinders, limiting the scope of possible lifestyles we can envision for extinct animals. \u2026 Modern durophagous sharks (that consume hard-shelled organisms) are demersal, feeding on or near the bottom. And their bodies are frequently small and not particularly streamlined. So a gigantic, streamlined, high speed durophage that was much larger than a modern great white shark is quite remarkable,\u201d Kent added, in an email.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/science/ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_geriatrician-healthy-aging-wellness", "text": "Longevity isn\u2019t just about living a long life but also about living well. More than 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 or older by 2040, the Department of Health and Human Services projects. And more than 56% of those turning 65 will need some sort of long-term service. Fortunately, there are things you can do at any age to ensure that you will maintain your health as the years go on, according to Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Batsis, an associate professor at UNC\u2019s School of Medicine and Gillings School of Global Public Health, spoke with CNN about what people should know about healthy aging. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: Some people may find it hard to relate their health behaviors now to outcomes in their later years. Why should people start to think about healthy aging early? Dr. John Batsis: There will be individuals who may become sick and frail. There will be individuals who are robust into their 90s. I have patients who are still extremely fit and active \u2014 they may not be as active as they were 20 years ago, but they are still doing the things that they want to do. You have to find a sense of self, a sense of purpose. You have to find a sense of what makes you happy, and it may be different at each stage of life. You can\u2019t change your genetics; you can\u2019t change your past. You can try to change your future with things that are modifiable. If it means altering what you\u2019re eating or how much you\u2019re exercising or engaging in the community, or stopping smoking or drinking \u2014 these are things that are in your control. And there are tools \u2014 like working with your health care team and community resources \u2014 that may be available to be able to help you achieve those. Part of it is really getting to a point that you\u2019re saying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m willing to change.\u201d You have to be willing to change to effect that change. CNN: What are the things you would like people to change earlier in their lives to impact how they age? Batsis: That\u2019s a really great question, and one that often is asked to me \u2014 not only by my patients but their children and by my own family and friends as well. There are a number of factors that have been shown time and time again to lead to healthy aging, but really you can kind of drill it down to kind of a couple. First is proper nutrition, and that really starts from infancy to childhood into adolescence and throughout even into old age. Secondly, regular physical activity and exercise are critically important. And then the third big category is social connections. We often think about these independently as silos, and really you need to be thinking about these jointly and together and synergistically. One can affect the other, but it\u2019s really kind of the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. CNN: What do you mean by proper nutrition? Batsis: We often think of healthy nutrition as having a balanced diet, a Mediterranean-type diet. The food environment often can be challenging, particularly in Western industrialized societies. The fast-food industry is very difficult to get away from. But home-cooked meals \u2014 cooking your own fresh fruit and vegetables, thinking about having these types of meals \u2014 is really, really important and nutritious. Really try to stay away from processed foods and think about more holistic type of foodstuffs. This is really thinking about it more consistently. Food is medicine, and I think this is a concept that is increasingly being sought and advocated by both health and nonhealth providers. And this kind of goes beyond aging. Start young, start early, get it into schools and start to engage individuals and children early on, so they develop skills and practices that are sustainable over their lives. It becomes part of the routine, and it\u2019s not thought to be a chore. CNN: What kind of exercise is most important? Batsis: Regular walking, regular activity. The 150 minutes of activity per week divided by 30 minutes over five days of moderate activity is what\u2019s really recommended. In addition to that, one should think about not only aerobic activity but resistance-based activities. This is more important as one ages to maintain muscle mass and muscle strength, because we know that you lose that capability to maintain that as you age. CNN: Why is social connection so important? Batsis: The importance of social connection in aging is often overlooked, understudied and underappreciated. One of the challenges here in our country is that a lot of us are spread out. And this is not seen as much in other countries that are geographically not as dispersed, or where family units are right next door or within the same neighborhood. It\u2019s not uncommon where I have patients whose children may be on opposite ends of the country, for instance, or their friends may be on opposite ends of the country. The social networking is really helpful to engage in stimulating conversations. And it\u2019s a sense of self, it\u2019s a sense of well-being, it\u2019s a sense of purpose, it\u2019s sharing stories, sharing community. It\u2019s having fun. It helps one\u2019s mental health. We know that depression in individuals can be a risk in old age, and it\u2019s really challenging. CNN: What about the older adults who are reading this? Does the advice still apply? Batsis: Healthy aging can occur at any stage of life. It\u2019s not only as a young adult or middle-aged adult, not only around retirement age. It still can occur well into one\u2019s 80s and 90s. The definition of what constitutes healthy aging may differ, and it\u2019s really about asking what does it mean to you? What\u2019s important to you at this stage of life? How can we achieve what is important to you, and then coming up with a plan and strategies to help our individual patient achieve that? That is the key, and it shouldn\u2019t be a top-down approach. It really needs to be engaging the patient, figuring out from within what is important to them, and helping them and giving them strategies to help them achieve what\u2019s important to them. It comes from within.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/geriatrician-healthy-aging-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness", "text": "Vegetables are great not only\u00a0for their versatility\u00a0\u2014 they can be eaten raw or cooked, whole or chopped \u2014 but also for their health benefits. However, those looking to incorporate more veggies into their diet may be overlooking one in particular. Eating three servings of baby carrots a week can give a significant boost of important nutrients found in the\u00a0orange root vegetables, according to a new unpublished study presented June 30 in Chicago at\u00a0Nutrition 2024,\u00a0the annual meeting of the\u00a0American Society for Nutrition. Surveys found separately in 2015 and 2019 that only\u00a0about 1 in 10 American adults ate the recommended 2 to 3 cups of vegetables daily, according to a 2022 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0report\u00a0on fruit and vegetable intake. That statistic inspired lead study author Mary Harper Simmons and her colleagues to investigate a simple solution that could increase a person\u2019s weekly vegetable intake. \u201c(Baby carrots) are grab and go, great with things like ranch, hummus \u2014 I\u2019ve even seen people dip them in peanut butter \u2014 some people like them plain,\u201d said Simmons, a graduate student in nutrition at Samford University in Alabama. \u201cI would really like to show people that improving your health can be (done) with small simple changes. \u2026 It does not have to be one drastic change overnight.\u201d For the study, one serving of baby carrots \u2014 chopped into smaller pieces and commonly sold at grocery stores \u2014 was around eight to 12 carrots, the equivalent of 100 grams or half a cup, Simmons added. The unpublished study looked at 60 young adults who were either assigned to eat the servings of carrots three times a week, eat no carrots and instead take a multivitamin supplement, consume a combination of the carrots and the multivitamin, or consume neither the carrots or supplement as a control group. After four weeks, the researchers found those who ate the carrots had a 10.8% increase in carotenoids in their skin, natural antioxidants found to have\u00a0health benefits, such as preventing inflammation and promoting heart health, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Additionally, the researchers found those who only took the multivitamin (containing the same carotenoid found in carrots) did not see any changes in carotenoid levels. But those who consumed the carrots and the supplement saw the most benefits and increased their skin carotenoids by 21.6%. \u201cPeople might think, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m getting a multivitamin supplement, (that should be enough),\u2019 but that alone did not increase the carotenoid accumulation. It was a combination that seemed to increase it,\u201d said Dr. Suresh Mathews, the principal investigator for the new study and a professor and chair of Samford\u2019s department of nutrition and dietetics. \u201cThe \u2018food first\u2019\u00a0philosophy always works. But for populations that may be unable to just do only foods or are limited, the combination of the food and the supplements seems to have an even bigger effect in this case,\u201d he added. The benefits of eating carrots and other vegetables \u201cHigh vegetable intake is associated with all kinds of positive health effects \u2014 the risk of all kinds of chronic diseases are lowered with increased fruit and vegetable consumption,\u201d said Dr. Sander Kersten, the director of the division of nutritional sciences and Schleifer Family Professor\u00a0at Cornell University, who was not involved in the new study. Eating vegetables can protect against heart disease, some cancers, diabetes and obesity,\u00a0according to the CDC. But carrots and other orange and red-toned vegetables such as squash and sweet potatoes are unique in that they\u2019re high in beta-carotene, the carotenoid that the body converts into vitamin A, Kersten said. Dark leafy greens, such as spinach and kale, are also high in beta-carotene, he added. Vitamin A is important for keeping your heart, lungs and other organs healthy and also for supporting various bodily functions, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health. Vitamin A deficiency is not common in the United States,\u00a0but people should still look to eat fruits and vegetables to reap the benefits of the natural low-calorie, high-in-fiber foods, Kersten said. Young adults eating vegetables While a reminder to include vegetables in a healthy diet is good for everyone, Simmons said the message is particularly important when it comes to young adults. According to the\u00a02022 CDC report, around 7% of adults\u00a0ages 18 to 30 eat the recommended amount of vegetables, while a 2023\u00a0National College Health Assessment\u00a0from the American College Health Association found that about 1 in 4 college students surveyed said they ate three or more servings of vegetables per day. \u201cYou hear the thing we tell kids, \u2018Eat the rainbow,\u2019 and I feel like for any age that really does stand,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt is good to have a variety of colors on your plate, and if not every single time you eat, just having a variety throughout your day and throughout your week is definitely very beneficial to getting all those key nutrients that our body needs to function.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_long-term-care-residents-texas-power-outage-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "As Tina Kitzmiller sat inside her sweltering apartment, windows and doors open in the hope of catching even the slightest breeze, she was frustrated and worried for her dog and her neighbors. It had been days since Hurricane Beryl blew ashore from the Gulf of Mexico on July 8, causing widespread destruction and knocking out power to more than 2 million people, including the Houston senior independent living facility where Kitzmiller lives. Outdoor temperatures had reached at least 90 degrees most days, and the heat inside the building was stifling. Kitzmiller moved there not long ago with Kai, her 12-year-old dog, shortly after riding out 90-plus-mph winds from a\u00a0May derecho\u00a0under a comforter on the floor of the 33-foot RV she called home. She didn\u2019t need medical care, as a nursing home would offer, and thought she and Kai could be safer at an independent senior facility than in the RV. She assumed her new home would have an emergency power system in place at least equivalent to that of the post offices she\u2019d worked in for 35 years. \u201cI checked out the food. I checked out the activities,\u201d said Kitzmiller, 61, now retired. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I needed to inquire about a generator.\u201d Even after multiple incidents of extreme weather \u2014 including a\u00a02021 Texas winter storm\u00a0that caused widespread blackouts and prompted a\u00a0U.S. Senate investigation\u00a0\u2014 not much has changed for those living in long-term care facilities when natural disasters strike in Texas or elsewhere. \u201cThere has been some movement, but I think it\u2019s been way too slow,\u201d said\u00a0David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWe keep getting tested and we keep failing the test. But I do think we are going to have to face this issue.\u201d A power outage can be difficult for anyone, but older adults are especially vulnerable to temperature extremes, with medications or medical conditions affecting their bodies\u2019\u00a0ability to regulate heat\u00a0and\u00a0cold. Additionally, some medications need\u00a0refrigeration while others cannot get too cold. Federal guidelines require nursing homes to maintain safe indoor temperatures but do not regulate how. For example, facilities face no requirement that generators or other alternative energy sources support heating and air conditioning systems. States are largely responsible for compliance, Grabowski said, and if states are failing in that regard, change doesn\u2019t happen. Furthermore, while nursing homes face such federal oversight, lower-care-level facilities that provide some medical care \u2014 known as assisted living \u2014 are regulated at the state level, so the rules for emergency preparedness vary widely. Some states have toughened those guidelines. Maryland\u00a0adopted rules for generators\u00a0in assisted living facilities following Hurricane Isabel, which left more than 1.2 million residents in the state without power in 2003. Florida\u00a0did so for nursing homes and assisted living facilities\u00a0in 2018, after Hurricane Irma led to deaths at one facility. But Texas has not. And no requirements for generators exist in Texas for the roughly 2,000 assisted living facilities or the even less regulated independent living sites, like Kitzmiller\u2019s. Generally, apartment complexes marketed to senior citizens, known in the industry as independent living facilities, don\u2019t have any special regulations in Texas and many other states. Nationally, assisted living facilities and independent living facilities have been the fastest-growing sectors in senior living. Residents at such facilities often have medical needs, Grabowski said, but for a variety of reasons have chosen to live in an environment that allows more independence than a nursing home, which would provide medical care. That doesn\u2019t mean the residents in these lower-care-level facilities are any less susceptible to extreme temperatures when the power goes out. \u201cIf you\u2019re overwhelmed by the heat in your apartment, that\u2019s unsafe,\u201d he said. Republican state Rep.\u00a0Ed Thompson\u00a0tried several times since 2020 to pass legislation requiring assisted living facilities in Texas to have backup generators. But the bills failed. He is not seeking reelection this year. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible what the state of Texas is doing,\u201d said Thompson, blaming corporate greed and politicians more interested in stirring up their base and raising their national profile than improving the lives of Texans. \u201cHow we treat our elderly says something about us \u2014 and they\u2019re not being treated right.\u201d Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said at\u00a0a July 11 press conference\u00a0that senior facility operators are accountable if they do not keep residents safe. \u201cThat location is responsible for the health, safety, and welfare of the patients and residents that are there,\u201d he\u00a0told reporters. \u201cIt is that facility\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Under\u00a0Texas law, power restoration is supposed to be prioritized for nursing, assisted living, and hospice facilities. The resistance to adding oversight or more governmental protections has not surprised\u00a0Gregory Shelley, a senior manager at the Harris County Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program at UTHealth Houston\u2019s Cizik School of Nursing. He said that while he believes the safety and health of residents are paramount, he recognizes that installing generators is expensive. He also said some people within the industry continue to believe extreme events are rare. \u201cBut all of us in Houston this year already learned that they\u2019re happening more frequently,\u201d Shelley said. \u201cThis is already the third time since May that big portions of Houston have been without power for long periods of time.\u201d After the 2021 blackouts, Texas\u2019 Health and Human Services Commission conducted a\u00a0voluntary survey\u00a0that found 47% of the assisted living and 99% of the nursing care facilities that responded reported having generators. The U.S. Senate investigation following the 2021 Texas storm recommended a national requirement that assisted living facilities have emergency power supplies to both maintain safe temperatures and keep medical equipment running. A\u00a02023 annual report\u00a0from Texas\u2019 long-term care ombudsman, Patty Ducayet, also recommended requiring generators at assisted living centers. The report suggested that all long-term care facilities maintain safe temperatures in a location that can be accessed by every resident. The report recommended requiring assisted living facilities to annually submit emergency response plans to state regulators to be reviewed by state officials. The recommendations have not been adopted. On July 15 \u2014 more than a week after Beryl hit \u2014 Kitzmiller said she just wanted the power back on. She praised the staff at her facility but said she worried for residents who were isolated on her building\u2019s second and third floors, which were hotter amid the outage. Some were unable to keep required medicine refrigerated, she said. And without functioning elevators, many couldn\u2019t get to the first floor, where it was cooler. Mostly, Kitzmiller said, she was frustrated with companies and politicians who hadn\u2019t yet fixed the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s their mothers, their grandmothers, and their family in these homes, these facilities,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I can think is \u2018Shame on you.\u2019\u201d KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 an independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/long-term-care-residents-texas-power-outage-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}

Now, she says, the race is on to reach children who missed shots during the pandemic and to restore and strengthen immunization services beyond pre-pandemic levels. WHO and UNICEF\u2019s 2023 immunization coverage report, released Sunday, is the world\u2019s largest dataset on immunization trends for vaccinations against 14 diseases. It analyzed estimates from 185 countries and used a third dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine \u2014 which is recommended for 1-year-olds \u2014 as the global marker for immunization coverage. The data revealed that\u00a0previous progress\u00a0in reaching pre-pandemic immunization levels has stalled. Worldwide DTP3 coverage was 84% in 2023, the same as in 2022 but below 86% recorded in 2019. The report\u2019s authors say this is a derailment on the trajectory toward the Immunization Agenda 2030\u00a0goal\u00a0of 90% coverage for essential childhood and adolescent vaccines. This stagnation reflects ongoing challenges with disruptions in health-care services, logistical challenges, vaccine hesitancy and inequities in access to services, the organizations said in a news release. The new report also showed that the number of children who had not received a single dose of DTP3 increased by 600,000 from 2022 to 2023, leaving 2.7 million more children un- and under-immunized than before the pandemic. \u201cToday\u2019s release highlights that we are off track and need to accelerate efforts to meet this challenge,\u201d said Dr. Ephrem T. Lemango, associate director for health and global chief of immunization at UNICEF. Bright spots around the globe Amid the overall challenge, however, \u201cthere are places where there are positive signs,\u201d Lemango told CNN. The data showed that the African region made the most progress last year in overall coverage, and countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria made notable strides in recovering post-pandemic, according to O\u2019Brien and Lemango. \u201cLow-income countries \u2026 where the health systems were hit the hardest by the pandemic \u2026 are starting to see some improvement compared with 2022,\u201d O\u2019Brien said at a news briefing. In Africa, vaccine coverage in the first year of life increased despite a rising number of births, which required more vaccinations to maintain the same coverage level, according to O\u2019Brien. The 2023 report also found HPV vaccine coverage in girls increased 7%, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Studies\u00a0have shown that the vaccine can reduce cervical cancer rates in women by 87%. However, current coverage remains well below the 90% target to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, reaching only 56% of adolescent girls in high-income countries and 23% in low- and middle-income countries, according to the news release. All eyes on measles WHO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that global immunization efforts have saved 154 million lives \u2014 6 lives every minute \u2014 over the past 50 years. About 60% of that can be attributed to the measles vaccine, the organization says, projecting it to be the \u201ctop contributor to preventing deaths in the future.\u201d But the 2023 data revealed that measles coverage in countries with large or disruptive outbreaks after the pandemic is too low to control further outbreaks. Nearly 35 million children were left with no or only partial protection, a decline the report called \u201cconcerning,\u201d even for countries that have not had outbreaks in the past five years. Low vaccination coverage was a major factor in outbreaks in 103 countries \u2013 accounting for roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s infant population \u2013 in the past five years, said the report. Cases of the highly contagious virus have also reemerged in the United States. In 2023, the 92% of US children that have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2 fell below the federal target of 95%, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that year. \u201cMeasles outbreaks continue to rise as measles vaccination coverage stalls,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cThe world saw over 300,000 confirmed measles cases in 2023, which is an almost threefold increase compared to what we had in 2022.\u201d According to the organizations, there is hope that the introduction of new and underutilized vaccines, through partnerships such as\u00a0Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will expand protection against infectious diseases like measles. \u201cThis progress is crucial in reducing the burden of diseases that have long plagued communities,\u201d Lemango added. Immunizations in conflict zones Over half of unvaccinated children in 2023 lived in countries experiencing fragility, conflict and vulnerability, the data shows, even though these places account for only 28% of new births worldwide. Many of these countries have had \u201cworrying declines in performance since 2019,\u201d the report says. Of children who did not receive any vaccines in 2023, 59% were in only 10 countries. Places such as Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan are new to this list, the report says. \u201cThe protection of children in any conflict setting is of critical importance,\u201d WHO\u2019s O\u2019Brien said. \u201c[Conflict] creates an environment where infectious diseases have a big risk of causing large and impactful outbreaks.\u201d Some countries that experienced conflict, such as Ukraine, had initial dips in immunization coverage but did not see an overall drop in vaccinations. But in other areas, such as Sudan and parts of the Middle East, that wasn\u2019t the case. There was a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in vaccine coverage in Gaza in 2023, one not seen to the same extent in Israel, according to O\u2019Brien. Data in the report from Gaza was submitted for only January through September, and it \u201cdoesn\u2019t cover what is happening in 2024,\u201d Lemango noted. Analyzing immunization coverage in other areas of conflict is \u201ca mixed picture,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019ll give the example, however, of Ukraine, which has had an improvement in coverage. Not all conflict areas result in a reduction in coverage,\u201d she said, referencing resilient programs, the nature of conflict and the safety of health workers. According to Lemango, there is a \u201cclear pattern\u201d in Ukraine where service availability typically decreases at the beginning of a conflict and resumes once assistance and resources flow in. The issue, he said, is how to maintain this improved state. Global reach of local vaccines Vaccine coverage in the United States ranges between 95% and 98%, an indication of good availability of health services, according to Lemango. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Americans are entirely protected. \u201cUntil everyone or every country has the ability and the reach for every child to be vaccinated, the vulnerability to have outbreaks, epidemics and potentially pandemics is always imminent,\u201d he said. In April 2023, WHO and UNICEF partnered with organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to launch The Big Catch Up initiative in response to declining levels of vaccine coverage after the pandemic. The effort aims to boost childhood immunizations and fill gaps between pre- and post-pandemic work, according to the partnership. Achieving these goals and aiming for those outlined in Immunization Agenda 2030 will require collaboration and investment in innovation, according to the IA2030 Partnership Council. \u201cThe future is likely to be a future where we\u2019ll have many vaccines that are able to prevent preventable diseases,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cImmunization stands as one of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/immunization-rates-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness", "text": "About 40% of new cancer cases among adults ages 30 and older in the United States \u2014 and nearly half of deaths \u2014\u00a0could be attributed to preventable risk factors, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society. \u201cThese are things that people can practically change how they live every single day to reduce their risk of cancer,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Arif\u00a0Kamal, chief patient officer with the American Cancer Society. Smoking was the leading risk factor by far, the study found, contributing to nearly 1 in 5 cancer cases and nearly a third of cancer deaths. Other key risk factors included excess body weight, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, diet and infections such as HPV. Overall, researchers analyzed 18 modifiable risk factors across 30 types of cancer. In 2019, these lifestyle factors were linked to more than 700,000 new cancer cases and more than 262,000 deaths, the study found. Cancer grows because of DNA damage or because it has a fuel source, Kamal said. Other things \u2014 such as genetics or environmental factors \u2014 can also create these biological conditions, but modifiable risks explain a significantly larger share of cancer cases and deaths than any other known factors. Exposure to sunlight can damage DNA and lead to skin cancer, for example, while fat cells produce hormones that can feed certain cancers. \u201cWith cancer, it oftentimes feels like you have no control,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cPeople think about bad luck or bad genetics, but people need to feel a sense of control and agency.\u201d Certain cancers are more preventable than others, the new study suggests. But modifiable risk factors contributed to more than half of new cases for 19 of the 30 types of cancer evaluated. There were 10 types of cancer where modifiable risk factors could be attributed to at least 80% of new cases, including more than 90% of melanoma cases linked to ultraviolet radiation and nearly all cases of cervical cancer linked to HPV infection, which can be prevented with a vaccine. Lung cancer had the largest number of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors \u2014 more than 104,000 cases among men and 97,000 among women \u2014 and the vast majority were linked to smoking. After smoking, excess body weight was the second largest contributor to cancer cases, linked to about 5% of new cases in men and nearly 11% of cases in women. It was associated with more than\u00a0a third of deaths from cancer\u00a0of the endometrium, gallbladder, esophagus, liver and kidney, the new study found. Another recent study found that the risk for certain cancers was significantly reduced for people taking popular weight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy. \u201cObesity is emerging, in some ways, as just as potent of a risk for people as smoking is,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. He was not involved in the new study, but has prior experience working on cancer prevention initiatives. Intervening on a set of \u201ccore behavioral risk factors\u201d \u2014 quitting smoking, eating well and exercising, for example \u2014 can make a \u201cdramatic difference in the rates and outcomes of chronic diseases,\u201d Plescia said. And cancer is one of those chronic diseases, just like heart disease or diabetes. Policymakers and health officials should work to \u201ccreate environments where it\u2019s easier for people, where the healthy choice is the easy choice,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s particularly important for people who are living in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods, where it might not be safe to exercise or easy to get to a store with healthy food. As rates of early-onset cancer rise in the US, it\u2019s especially important to create healthy habits early, experts say. It\u2019s harder to quit smoking once you\u2019ve started or lose weight that you\u2019ve gained. But \u201cit\u2019s never too late to make these changes,\u201d Plescia said. \u201cTurning (health behaviors) around later in life can make a profound difference.\u201d And making lifestyle changes to minimize exposure to certain factors can reduce cancer risk relatively quickly, experts say. \u201cCancer is something your body fights every single day as your cells divide,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that you face every day, and that also means that the reduction of the risks can benefit you every day as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_confidence-success-anxiety-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Everyone has encountered them: people who always appear to know what they are doing. They gladly take control of a situation, express their opinions as if they were established facts or plunge into a project believing they are going to succeed \u2014 with or without the required experience. What magic dust was sprinkled on their breakfast cereal to give them this superpower? \u201cConfidence \u2014 it is probably the most important resource in human well-being and human performance, I believe,\u201d neuroscientist and psychologist Ian Robertson told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast Chasing Life. Robertson is a professor emeritus of psychology and the codirector of the Global Brain Health Institute at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and the T. Boone Pickens Distinguished Chair\u00a0at the Center for BrainHealth at the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cConfidence is a belief with two strands to it,\u201d said Robertson, the author of \u201cHow Confidence Works: The New Science of Self-Belief.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the belief you can do something, and it\u2019s the belief that if you do that thing, you will get a reward or get an outcome you desire.\u201d When you feel confident, you are more likely to succeed because confidence activates brain circuits that produce an elevated mood, lower anxiety and sharper thinking \u2014 all of which raise the odds of success, Robertson said. These are the same brain circuits that get activated when you do succeed. So whether you have confidence or succeed, even at a small task, it leads to success and then even more confidence. \u201cThe greatest source of success is success,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd success, like confidence, acts like compound interest: It\u2019s exponential. A little bit grows steadily.\u201d You can listen to the full episode here. If confidence is on one end of the spectrum, anxiety is at the other, Robertson said. \u201cIf you lack confidence, if you don\u2019t think you can do that thing, then that will generate anxiety because of the prospect of failure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe greatest source of anxiety is the fear of the negative evaluation of other people, and almost all anxiety has to do with other people.\u201d Additionally, anxiety activates circuits that disrupt \u201cthe fluid synchronization of different brain regions that are critical for elite or top performance,\u201d he noted. Research shows\u00a0that people who are chronically anxious do less of everything, Robertson said. \u201cThey do less \u2026 socially, they do less in work, they do less in hobbies and interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because their brains are primed into a threat mindset, where they\u2019re anticipating and focusing their attention on potential negative outcomes and threat. And that inhibits those systems of the brain that do the opposite with confidence.\u201d For example, Robertson said, take two 5-year-old girls: They are equally intelligent and capable, but one has slightly more confidence than the other. \u201cThat slight difference in confidence will mean that that little girl is more likely to try something new. A tiny thing: Ask a question, (be) less frightened to make a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that will result more likely in a small success. That means she\u2019s then more likely to do the next step. And by the time these two girls are 25, there\u2019s a yawning gap in their achievement and their well-being because of the exponential nature of the mathematics of confidence.\u201d All is not lost if you were not born brimming with confidence. Robertson has five tips for building up confidence, even under daunting circumstances. Take action Taking steps to do something and then doing it (no matter how shaky you feel) will result in a burst of confidence. \u201cConfidence is linked to the action systems of the brain,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cThe great Persian poet Rumi said the road only appears with the first step. And people who lack confidence and have anxiety tend to hold back from taking action because they see \u2018threat.\u2019\u201d Taking action, in spite of feeling anxious, is very important for building confidence, Roberston said. \u00a0 Choose your focus carefully What you pay attention to determines your emotional state, so pick wisely, Robertson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re giving a talk to a group of people and there\u2019s a couple of people on their phones or frowning, your attention will lock on to them because \u2026 that\u2019s what we do when we feel under threat,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHowever, if you deliberately choose to pay attention to the majority of people, or to one person who is looking interested in the front row, who is smiling \u2026 you will feed your brain with positive thoughts and images that will help you remember past successes rather than past failures.\u201d He said that being intentional in this way will not only reduce your anxiety and decrease the effort you have to put into the task, it\u00a0will also build up your confidence. Adopt a growth mindset Your attitude toward yourself and your abilities can make a difference. \u201cYou have to believe that change is possible,\u201d Robertson said. People with a \u201cgrowth\u201d mindset believe that with effort you can learn abilities and cultivate talents; conversely, those with a \u201cfixed\u201d mindset believe talents and abilities are innate \u2014 you either have them or you don\u2019t. \u201cIf you have a fixed mindset \u2014 that is, you believe that your abilities or your emotions are determined by genetics or inheritance \u2014 then you\u2019re not going to engage in \u2026 the slow ups and downs that learning entails,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cYou can learn to be more confident \u2014 but not if you cripple yourself with a fixed mindset.\u201d Fixed theories about yourself are \u201calways wrong\u201d because the human brain is enormously plastic at all ages, he explained. Deal with your anxiety Anxiety is corrosive to confidence, so reframe anxiety as excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to control anxiety by not becoming frightened of it and not treating it as some alien force coming, but rather seeing it as a form of energy that you can harness,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIn fact, the bodily and brain symptoms of anxiety are identical to those of excitement.\u201d Robertson recommends that if faced with a situation that makes you feel anxious, such as a difficult conversation or an interview, adopt a \u201cchallenge\u201d mindset. \u201cYou can actually change your frame of mind to one of \u2018Oh, can I perform here?\u2019 versus \u2018Oh, terrible things are going to happen,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can help yourself do that by the words you say to yourself: \u2018I am excited.\u2019\u201d Robertson said that doing so doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to feel nervous, but by using language, you are harnessing a form of energy. Affirm your values Define yourself and what you stand for, he said. \u201cBecause who you are as a person is grounded in what you stand for and what\u2019s important to you, what your values are,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd if you can just take a few seconds to even write down what your values are and why they\u2019re important to you and what they mean to you, the evidence shows that your brain will be then more resilient and protected against the fear of criticism, of humiliation, of failure.\u201d In other words, Robertson said, you will be protected from the destructive anxiety that eats away at confidence. We hope these five tips help you build up confidence. Listen to the full episode here.

{"id": "2024_07_09_health_women-cancer-colon-breast-screening-wellness", "text": "An estimated 72 million women in the United States have skipped or delayed a recommended health screening,\u00a0according to a new survey. This poll, conducted by Gallup for medical technology company Hologic, found that 90% of women acknowledged the importance of regular health screenings \u2014 but more than 40% have skipped or delayed a test. Women have trouble prioritizing their own health, the survey found, with over 60% of women responding that it was hard to make their own health a priority. The numbers are particularly striking among younger women;\u00a074% of women in Generation Z and 70% of millennials said it was hard to prioritize their health, compared with 52% of baby boomers and 39% of the Silent Generation. Struck by these numbers, I wanted to speak with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen to learn more about why they are a cause for concern. What are the preventive screenings that younger women should receive? And what steps can women take to prioritize their health and well-being? Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What were the parts of the poll that stand out most to you? Dr. Leana Wen: I was disheartened, though not surprised, to see that it was so common for women, especially young women, to forgo health screenings. According to the results, most women in the survey mentioned factors such as caring for other family members first, struggling with work and other pressing matters. This is consistent with my experience as a clinician and\u00a0a\u00a0public health official. Unfortunately, too many women focus on their health only after they have been diagnosed with a chronic illness. Our society places too little emphasis on prevention, and there are many barriers in the way of people obtaining preventive care. CNN: Why are regular health screenings so important for women, including young women? Wen:\u00a0This study focused on health screenings for cancer, so let\u2019s start there.\u00a0One in five\u00a0women\u00a0around the world\u00a0will develop cancer over our lifetimes. Early treatment is key to improving survival rates, and that hinges on early diagnosis. This is why screenings are so important. Cancer screenings are conducted before people develop symptoms. There is a disturbing global trend of a\u00a0rise in early-onset cancers,\u00a0which is defined as cancer cases diagnosed in people younger than 50. Between 1990 and 2019, early-onset cancers increased by\u00a079%. In the US, while people older than 50 have experienced a drop in overall cancer rates between 1995 and 2020, the cancer incidence\u00a0has increased in people younger than 50. All of this\u00a0makes the survey results of young women neglecting their health screenings even more distressing. According to the survey, 41% of US women delayed or skipped screenings for breast cancer, 35% for cervical cancer and 33% for colorectal cancers. CNN: What cancer screenings are recommended for younger women? Wen:\u00a0Here are the recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force. For\u00a0breast cancer, the USPSTF recommends that women get screened every other year, starting from age 40 and continuing through age 74. This is a recent change. Previously, the recommendation was to start between age 40 to 50. For\u00a0cervical cancer, the task force recommends that women who are ages 21 to 29 get screened every three years with a Pap test that looks at cervical cells. For women ages 30 to 65, the recommendation is to get screened every three years with the Pap test, or every five years with either testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (a virus that could cause cervical cancer) or the virus testing combined with the Pap test. For\u00a0colon cancer, the USPSTF recommends that both women and men begin screenings at age 45. This also represents a change in response to the rise in colon cancer among younger individuals; until a few years ago, the recommendation was for colon cancer screenings to start at age 50. All the above recommendations apply to women at average risk of developing these cancers. Individuals at higher risk by virtue of family history, personal cancer history or other risk factors should speak with their physicians about whether they should start screening at earlier ages and more frequently. They may also need additional testing; for instance, women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer may be recommended for an MRI in addition to a mammogram and may be referred to genetic testing. CNN: What else should women know about regular screenings? Wen: Ideally, every woman has a primary care provider whom they visit every year. These appointments should keep track of what screenings have been done and when to do the next set of screenings. First, women should know whether they have personal medical circumstances that put them at higher risk compared with other people. Everyone should try to find out their family history of common ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Bring up lifestyle factors that may influence risk factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and physical activity. Second, discuss screening tests. What\u2019s recommended now and why? We\u2019ve spoken today mainly about cancer screening, but there are screenings for other chronic diseases that should be done. For instance, you should be getting your blood pressure checked at annual visits to screen for hypertension. The USPSTF also recommends screening for\u00a0diabetes\u00a0in adults ages 35 to 70 who have a body mass index that places them in the category of overweight or obesity and for\u00a0high cholesterol\u00a0in women ages 45 and older who are at increased risk of heart disease. Third, women should discuss issues regarding their reproductive health. If they want to become pregnant, they should optimize their health in preparation for pregnancy. If they do not, they should discuss contraceptive options. We have not yet discussed screening for\u00a0sexually transmitted infections, but this is also a part of routine health screening that should be discussed at the annual checkup. Last but certainly not least, it\u2019s important to discuss mental health issues. Mental health is a crucial determinant of overall health. Women should be sure to discuss concerns such as\u00a0depression,\u00a0anxiety\u00a0and\u00a0stress\u00a0with their providers. Many treatment options exist \u2014 no one should have to suffer in silence. CNN: How can women keep track of their screenings and what they need coming up? The problem is that many women do not have a regular provider. They may also neglect to see that person due to the issues highlighted in the survey \u2014 maybe these women are busy with other life circumstances and then only see a provider once something is wrong. The other issue highlighted in the survey is that providers may not be bringing up the screenings. Women are more likely to be screened if they and their provider have a discussion about the importance of screenings, the poll says. Yet these conversations are sometimes not happening for a variety of reasons. We need to have a better health care system that ensures access and continuity of care for all people, and clinicians must have adequate time to address crucial issues like prevention during the annual visit. In the meantime, I recommend that women keep track of what screenings they have received and have an idea of when the next one is due. Bring that list with you when you are going for your annual checkup and ask your doctor if you are up to date.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/women-cancer-colon-breast-screening-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_gratitude-benefits-longer-life-wellness", "text": "Appreciating the little things in life can leave a lasting impact on your health. Experiencing gratitude is beneficial for physical health and emotional well-being, past research has shown. Now, a new study has found those who experience more gratitude also have a lower risk of dying. The report is the first to examine the effects of gratefulness on longevity, experts say. The researchers used data from the\u00a0Nurses\u2019 Health Study,\u00a0which included nearly 50,000 women between ages 69 and 96 who completed a six-item\u00a0gratitude questionnaire\u00a0in 2016. By asking participants to rank how strongly they agreed with statements such as \u201cI have so much in life to be thankful for\u201d and \u201cI am grateful to a wide variety of people,\u201d the research team was able to determine the percentage of women who had the highest and lowest feelings of gratitude. When the researchers reviewed the data three years later, they found the women who had the highest levels of gratitude experienced a 9% lower risk of death of any cause, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disease, according to the study published July 3 in the\u00a0journal JAMA Psychiatry. \u201cGratitude is powerful: powerful for happiness, powerful for addressing at least more minor depressive symptoms, powerful for improving health, powerful for protecting against premature death \u2014 and it is something that anyone can do,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Tyler VanderWeele, who is the John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. During the three years of follow-up in the study, there were 4,608 deaths among participants \u2014 2,153 of those were women who reported experiencing the lowest amount of gratitude, while 1,273 deaths were of women who were in the middle tier. There were 1,182 deaths among women who reported the highest amount of gratitude. The study also found those who reported feeling more gratitude were more likely to be slightly younger, have a partner, participate in social or religious groups, or have overall better health. \u201cI think things that are going well in life, whether that\u2019s one\u2019s health or one\u2019s social relationships, (it\u2019s) going to make one more grateful,\u201d said VanderWeele, who is also director of the\u00a0Human Flourishing Program, which aims to study and promote human well-being, and codirector of the\u00a0Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion\u00a0at Harvard. For the analysis of longevity, researchers controlled the data group by comparing similar women who only differed in their gratitude scores, VanderWeele said.\u00a0The researchers controlled for factors such as psychological well-being, health issues and other demographics including social and religious participation. \u201cIt\u2019s still quite meaningful \u2014 even after controlling for social connectedness and other aspects of psychological well-being and a host of baseline health characteristics and money and income and so on \u2014 you\u2019re still finding those who are grateful versus those who are not with about a 10% reduced mortality risk,\u201d VanderWeele said. \u201cThose other things are important, but it doesn\u2019t explain away the whole of the effect of gratitude.\u201d The authors noted in the study that the participants were mostly White, older women in the United States, and future studies with a more representative sample would be needed to find out more on the effects of gratitude and longevity for other demographics. How to practice gratitude \u201cIt\u2019s not completely surprising to me, just given what we know on the health benefits\u00a0of positive emotions\u00a0more generally, that a person\u2019s disposition for gratitude might actually even lengthen their life,\u201d said Dr. Philip Watkins, a professor of psychology at Eastern Washington University and author of the book \u201cGratitude and the Good Life: Toward a Psychology of Appreciation.\u201d Research has found that gratitude benefits individuals\u2019 happiness and flourishing, added Watkins, who was not involved with the new study. Having more gratitude has been linked to improving\u00a0physical health, such as strengthening the\u00a0immune system, lowering blood pressure and benefiting the\u00a0heart. Those who are more grateful also tend to get a better night\u2019s sleep and have\u00a0increased self-esteem\u00a0and lower anxiety, stress and\u00a0depression\u00a0levels. While the new study looked at people who are naturally more grateful, there are ways to practice having more gratitude on a day-to-day basis, said Dr. Emiliana\u00a0Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center \u2014 a research institute that studies the psychology, sociology, and\u00a0neuroscience of well-being\u00a0\u2014 at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for each individual to start from a place of their own comfort zone,\u201d said Simon-Thomas, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cIt is unfair to demand gratitude from anyone if they\u2019re feeling particularly impoverished. But it\u2019s not unfair to point out some of the simple and easy immediate factors that are actually a source of goodness. \u201cIt could be (as simple as) the feeling of warm sun through a window on your shoulder \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of really noticing that there are things around you even in moments that are difficult,\u201d she added. There are three strategies Simon-Thomas recommends for those looking to implement more feelings of gratitude. First, keep a gratitude journal where you can write a few things you are grateful for, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a washing machine in your home, or electric light, or the opportunity to go on a camping trip with friends \u2014 the list could go on.\u201d Another way to practice gratitude is by writing letters to others who have had a positive impact on your life; the sense of gratitude is even more pronounced when those letters are delivered to the other person, Simon-Thomas said. A third way to feel more gratitude is to be more specific when giving out thanks \u2014 when someone gets you a coffee to start your day, instead of just saying, \u201cThank you,\u201d try to extend it to something like, \u201cI really appreciate that you brought me a coffee today, I know you have a lot of other things to do \u2026 and I got a lot of stuff done, because you brought me back coffee,\u201d Simon-Thomas said. There\u2019s no clear consensus on how often one should practice gratitude, Simon-Thomas said. She recommends trying out different methods for what feels right to you. Practicing gratitude is not only key for health and well-being, but it is also important to try to be more grateful because it is a good virtue and can positively affect your relationships, too, Watkins said. Having more gratitude has also been linked to being more optimistic in general, and people who express higher levels of gratitude tend to look more for the good in life, Watkins added. \u201cResearch shows we have a lot more good stuff happen to us than bad stuff, but we very easily focus on the bad stuff,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons gratitude \u2026 and being a grateful person is so important is because they help us have a more balanced view of life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/gratitude-benefits-longer-life-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "health"}}
