The two recalled products \u2013 4-ounce packages of honey roasted peanuts and 8.75-ounce cans of deluxe lightly salted mixed nuts \u2013 were distributed to retailers in five Southern states: Publix warehouses in Florida, Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina and Dollar Tree warehouses in South Carolina and Georgia. The peanuts have a \u201cbest if used by\u201d date of April 11, 2025, and the mixed nuts have a \u201cbest if used by\u201d date of April 5, 2026. As of Friday, there were no reported illnesses related to this recall. However, the company says it is conducting an investigation to identify the potential source of the contamination. Consumers who purchased these products are urged to throw them away or return them to the store where purchased for an exchange or full refund. Listeria monocytogenes bacteria can cause a serious infection, though the symptoms may vary by the type of infection and person affected, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While often mild, symptoms of intestinal illness can include diarrhea and vomiting that develop within a day of eating contaminated food and last for a few days. Intestinal illness can spread, leading to a more severe illness with flu-like symptoms \u2013 such as muscle aches, fatigue and fever \u2013 that usually start about two weeks after eating contaminated food. Listeria is most dangerous to pregnant women and newborns, seniors and others with weakened immune systems. Illness may appear mild in pregnant people but could lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. About 1,600 people get listeriosis each year in the United States, causing about 260 deaths, according to the CDC. Listeria can be detected through a lab test. Most people recover without treatment, but more serious cases can be treated with an antibiotic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/planters-nuts-recall-listeria/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_sleep-talking-fixes-wellness", "text": "Do you or a loved one talk in your sleep? It\u2019s a common sleep issue for many, experts say. About 50% of children will talk in their sleep \u2014 and typically outgrow it \u2014 while only about 5% of adults are nighttime blabbermouths, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. However, about 60% to 65% of adults will experience at least one episode of nighttime speech during their lifetime, the academy said. Sleep soliloquies can occur at any stage of sleep, not just in rapid eye movement (REM), the\u00a0stage when dreams occur, experts say. These one-sided conversations are typically harmless and can include mumbled whispers, groans and nonsense words as well as vulgar language and outright yelling. At that point, a bed partner may cease to view the chatter as amusing and start looking for ways to protect their own sleep, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThere are some things you, the bed partner, can do to save your sleep,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cBut first make sure there are no hidden issues that might be causing the problem.\u201d Sleep talking, or somniloquy, can be connected to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. Medications to treat depression, and other mental health disorders, high blood pressure, seizures, asthma and, oddly, other sleep disorders can also cause sleep talking, according to the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cIf your partner has never been a sleep talker and suddenly starts sleep talking after the age of 50, and it becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should reach out to your doctor for a neurological evaluation,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIt could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder, such as Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds to two minutes 30 or more times an hour \u2014 can also cause the brain to partially wake and begin to jabber. Bed partners are often the first to notice sleep apnea, observing a total cessation of breathing, followed by a gasp of air. Acid reflux or it\u2019s more serious cousin, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can also create a partial arousal that can trigger the brain into speech, Schenck said. Tips for handling sleep talking A white noise generator or loud fan is a great defense, said Jennifer Mundt, assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \u201cEarplugs or comfortable noise-canceling headphones\u00a0may also help,\u201d she said. Earplugs come in several forms: expandable foam, pre-molded versions and custom molded, which are created to precisely fit the shape and size of the ear canal. \u201cThen try to go to sleep before the person who sleep talks so that you are not easily awakened. That\u2019s where a white noise generator or loud fan can be very, very helpful,\u201d Schenck said. Now, it\u2019s time for some detective work. Work with your bed partner to discover triggers for their sleep talking, such as stress, the use of alcohol, being sleep-deprived, not sticking to a normal sleep schedule or even sleeping in a new environment, experts say. For some people, something as benign as being on vacation or sleeping somewhere new can cause an episode, Mundt said. \u201cAt these times your brain is a little more vigilant because you\u2019re in a new environment, and that means you\u2019re more likely to have this partial awakening, where one part of the brain is awake and the other part is asleep,\u201d Mundt said. In the end, it\u2019s the responsibility of the person who sleep talks to take ownership of their disorder and find solutions to quit disturbing a partner\u2019s sleep, Schenck said. \u201cThe person who is sleep talking has to be very considerate of the partner,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIf sleeping on your back makes it worse, then get a nightshirt where you can put a tennis ball in the back of the shirt so you can\u2019t sleep on your back.\u201d And if drinking alcohol is a trigger, that should be stopped or diminished as well, he said. \u201cCut out alcohol so you can share your consideration for the bed partner who is disturbed by your sleep talking.\u201d What causes sleep talking? Sleep talking is a parasomnia, in the same category as sleep terrors, sleep eating, sleep paralysis and sleep sex. All are disorders of arousal, in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Parasomnias often run in families, and you are more likely to have one if you had one as a child. If more than one first-degree relative has a parasomnia, then it\u2019s much more likely that childhood sleep behaviors will remain or reoccur as an adult, Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to predict that you will develop a parasomnia. Some people who have sleep talking or walking as children do return to the behavior as adults, but many others do not,\u201d he said. Sleep talking often occurs spontaneously \u201cin a rather unpredictable fashion,\u201d Schenck said, although at times it can occur after fevers or emotional stress. However, \u201csleep talking should be differentiated from catathrenia, a sleep-related breathing disorder typically characterized by moaning during sleep.\u201d Many people who talk in their sleep do not need medical treatment, but if the disorder is severe, there are treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy, designed to help identify and reduce stress triggers and negative thoughts about sleep. Good sleep hygiene, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day, avoiding caffeine after 3pm and eliminating light from the bedroom, including screens such as smartphones, laptops and televisions can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/sleep-talking-fixes-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_health_breast-cancer-screening-mammogram-guidelines-wellness", "text": "An influential group of medical experts, the US Preventive Services Task Force,\u00a0recommended last week\u00a0that most women receive a mammogram starting at age 40. Women should continue\u00a0to\u00a0get a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer until age 74, the task force said. This is a marked difference from the task force\u2019s previous guidance, which was to start biennial mammograms\u00a0by\u00a0age 50. Women in their 40s were counseled to make individual decisions together with their health\u00a0care\u00a0provider, but there was no explicit recommendation for them to start until they turned 50. I wanted to learn more about why these changes were made. Who should follow this updated guidance, and are there women who need to receive screening even earlier or more often? What other tests besides\u00a0a mammogram may be needed? And are there preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0How common is breast cancer? Dr. Leana Wen:\u00a0In the United States, breast cancer is\u00a0the second most common cancer\u00a0in women, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death\u00a0in women. According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetimes. About\u00a042,000 women\u00a0die every year from this cancer. It\u2019s crucial that women know their risk factors and receive screening accordingly. Screening, by definition, is done before there are any symptoms. Screening can help detect cancers at an early stage, before it has spread, when there is the best chance for successful treatment. CNN: Why did the US Preventive Task Force make these changes? Wen:\u00a0In recent years, there has been a\u00a0disturbing trend\u00a0of cancer diagnoses increasing among young people. This is the case with colon cancer as well as with breast cancer. In fact, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages\u00a020 to 49. Younger women tend to have more aggressive cancers upon diagnosis compared to older women. This is especially true for Black women. the rate of deaths from breast cancer among Black women in their 40s was 27 per 100,000 person-years, compared to 15 per 100,000 person-years among White women, according to a 2023\u00a0JAMA Network Open\u00a0study. According to a study in the journal\u00a0Lancet Oncology, the mortality from breast cancer could be lowered by starting mammograms earlier, at age 40. The\u00a0US Preventive Task Force\u2019s change\u00a0now makes its recommendations closer to those of other major national organizations. The\u00a0American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for instance, recommends screening every one or two years starting at age 40 and continuing until at least age 75. The\u00a0American Cancer Society\u00a0gives women ages 40 to 44 the option to receive a mammogram every year and recommends those 44 and 55 to get them annually. (Those over 55 can switch to every other year or can continue annual mammograms.) CNN: Who should follow this updated guidance?\u00a0\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0I would encourage woman to be aware of this updated guidance and discuss it with their physicians. The key is that this guidance is for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those at average risk should begin mammograms by age 40. This guidance does not apply to people with higher risk. Everyone needs to evaluate their own risk to see if they may be at elevated risk; if so, they may need additional tests and at greater frequency than these recommendations. The updated guidance also applies to all people assigned female at birth, which includes not only cisgender women but also transgender men and nonbinary people. These individuals should also have discussions with their health\u00a0care providers to evaluate their risk factors and therefore how frequently they should receive screenings. CNN: How should people determine if they need screenings more often or earlier in their lives? Wen:\u00a0The most important factor is personal or family history of breast cancer. If someone had breast cancer themselves, they need to consult their oncologist or primary care provider to figure out what testing they need and at what frequency to monitor for cancer recurrence. The same goes for individuals who had prior radiation to the chest from other cancers. Family history is also a key determinant of risk. A woman who has a sister, mother or other first-degree relative with breast cancer has double the average risk\u00a0of breast cancer. A woman who has two first-degree relatives has five times the risk of developing breast cancer. CNN: What should women expect at their first mammogram? Wen:\u00a0A mammogram is an x-ray of the breasts. Generally, what happens is that a technician will lead to you to a room where you take off your bra and shirt, wipe off deodorant from your armpit area that could interfere with results and change into a gown that will cover you from the waist up (you don\u2019t need to remove your underwear, pants, or shoes). You are then led to a mammogram machine. The technician will position you so that the machine can best capture images of your breasts. The part of the mammogram that may cause some discomfort is when the technician positions your breasts between two plastic imaging plates that apply pressure while the images are being taken. However, the discomfort is generally over within seconds. Those who are concerned about potential discomfort could consider taking Tylenol or ibuprofen an hour before the mammogram. CNN: What other tests besides mammograms may be needed? Wen:\u00a0Someone who has a family history of breast cancer may be recommended for genetic testing. They and others at higher-than-average risk of breast cancer may need to start mammograms at an earlier age or may need them at more frequent intervals. Other tests may be used along with the mammogram. These include breast ultrasound, breast MRI, or both. I want to mention that there are experts who advocate for additional testing to be done in women who have average risk but have dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the screening test of choice in these women, but there are instances where they need additional imaging to better look for possible masses. The\u00a0American College of Radiology, for example, recommends a breast MRI in some women at intermediate risk but who have dense breast tissue. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not make this recommendation, which has implications for insurance coverage for imaging. Someone very concerned about breast cancer risk should be sure to discuss this situation with their physician, who can help decide what is best for them based on personal and family medical history and whether it is the worth additional cost they may incur. CNN: What about women over 74? Why are they supposed to stop screening for breast cancer? Wen:\u00a0The US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mammography in women 75 years or older. However, other major medical societies have continued to recommend mammography in people 75 or above, especially if they are in generally good health and have long life expectancies. This, once again, is an issue to be discussed with one\u2019s individual provider, who can take into consideration other aspects of health and the patient\u2019s wishes. CNN: Are there steps younger people can do to reduce their cancer risk? Wen:\u00a0Risk factors for developing breast cancer include smoking and heavy alcohol use, so quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption will help to reduce risk. Studies have shown that\u00a0exercise\u00a0can lower cancer risk in general, as well as eating more whole foods and less\u00a0ultraprocessed\u00a0substances. Women should also seek care if they develop\u00a0any concerning symptoms, such as a new mass or lump in the breast or armpit, redness or flaky skin on the breast, nipple discharge other than breast milk, or pain or swelling anywhere in the breast.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/breast-cancer-screening-mammogram-guidelines-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_01_health_anger-blood-vessels-study-wellness", "text": "Does it ever feel as if your anger courses through your veins? Well, that isn\u2019t too far off, according to new research. Feelings of anger adversely affect blood vessel health, according to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association. \u201cThere have been some studies in the past that have linked the feelings of anger, the feelings of anxiety and the feelings of sadness to heart disease risk in the future,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Daichi Shimbo, professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at Columbia University in New York City. \u201cThis study was meant to figure out, \u2018why is that?\u2019\u201d he said. In the randomized trial, researchers divided 280 participants and gave them a task that made them recall feelings of anger, sadness, anxiety or neutrality for eight minutes. Before and several times after the task, the researchers took measures of the individuals\u2019 vascular health. Sadness and anxiety tasks didn\u2019t show a significant change in those markers compared with the neutral task \u2014 but anger did, Shimbo said. \u201cIt looks like anger\u2019s adverse effects on health and disease may be due to its adverse effects on vascular health \u2026 the blood vessel health itself,\u201d he said. While the new research is not the first study to make a connection between emotions and cardiovascular impacts, it does shed light on how the connection operates, said Dr. Joe Ebinger, an associate professor of cardiology and director of clinical analytics for the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. He was not involved in the research. \u201cThis is one of the first well-done randomized studies and placebo-controlled studies has really shown us that there are changes in our vasculature that occur acutely in response to the emotions that we\u2019re feeling,\u201d Ebinger said. How 40 minutes could turn into a longer problem Researchers in this study observed three major ways that anger impacted blood vessel health, Shimbo said. First, it made it harder for blood vessels to dilate in response to ischemia, or a restriction, he said. Anger also affected cellular markers of injury and their ability to repair themselves, Shimbo said. After the eight-minute task meant to induce anger, the impacts on blood vessels were seen for up to 40 minutes, he said. That might not sound so bad on its own, but Shimbo said we should be concerned about a cumulative effect. \u201cWe speculate that if you\u2019re a person that gets angry over and over again, that you\u2019re chronically impairing your blood vessels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t study this, but we speculate those kinds of chronic insults from anger can lead to chronic adverse effects of blood vessels.\u201d Don\u2019t just grit your teeth through anger Another question that the study didn\u2019t investigate but should be asked next is: What do you do about it? Anger is a human emotion, and you can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t avoid feeling it all together, Ebinger said. The best approach is to learn to process feelings of anger without letting it fester, said Dr. Brett Ford, associate professor of psychology at the University of Toronto Scarborough, in a previous CNN article. Ask yourself: \u201cWhat might be impeding on your energy or thoughts? What are you protecting yourself from? What do you need that isn\u2019t being met?\u201d said Deborah Ashway, a licensed clinical mental health counselor based in New Bern, North Carolina. Neither Ford nor Ashway was involved in the study. \u201cAnd then once you\u2019re aware of it, you\u2019re in control of it. It\u2019s no longer going to control you now,\u201d she said, adding that is the place from which you can decide how to move forward. This latest study on just how anger affects the body might help in encouraging people who experience a lot of anger to seek behavioral therapies, Shimbo said. Maybe there are ways \u2014 such as exercise or medication \u2014 to treat the adverse effects of anger on blood vessels, he speculated. \u201cUnderstanding that the mechanism that\u2019s there is the first step in being able to help to treat it,\u201d Ebinger said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about denying anger. We\u2019re all going to experience anger but (it\u2019s about) finding ways for us to be able to both control it and minimize it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/01/health/anger-blood-vessels-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_health_gender-inclusive-language-wellness", "text": "The use of phrases such as \u201cpregnant people\u201d or \u201cpenis owners\u201d in cultural or political discourse is sometimes met with confusion, or even anger. Why use these terms when, as some people ask, \u201conly women can get pregnant\u201d or when \u201conly men have penises?\u201d Those people and institutions using gender-neutral language aim to be cognizant of the fact that sex doesn\u2019t always align with gender identity, said psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, past president of the Group for Advancement of Psychiatry and clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University in New York City. And it\u2019s the most inclusive, streamlined way to refer to everyone who, regardless of their gender identity, has certain anatomy or biological abilities. \u201cWe need to be doing a better job of educating people and realizing that sex and gender are a bit of a spectrum \u2026 and that they\u2019re not the same,\u201d said Keygan Miller, director of public training at The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ youth. READ MORE: Gender identity: The difference between gender, sex and other need-to-knows Here\u2019s what experts have to say about these linguistic changes and concerns that have been raised. What is sex versus gender? A person\u2019s sex is what they were assigned at birth based on biological characteristics of maleness or femaleness as indicated by chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitals. Gender, however, is a social construct and social identity marked by certain attitudes, feelings and behaviors a culture associates with someone\u2019s biological sex, according to the American Psychological Association. There are at least more than 1.6 million adults and youth \u2014 ages 13 to 17 \u2014 who identify as transgender in the United States, or 0.6% of people ages 13 and older, according to the University of California, Los Angeles\u2019 Williams Institute, a UCLA Law center for research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy. Gender identity is an aspect of gender that describes a person\u2019s psychological sense of their gender, which may or may not align with one\u2019s sex, according to the American Psychological Association. Someone whose gender identity conforms with what has been culturally associated with the sex they were assigned at birth is known as cisgender, while those whose identities don\u2019t align may be transgender or a nonbinary gender (someone who doesn\u2019t exclusively identify as either of the binary genders). Pinpointing the beginning of these linguistic shifts away from centering only cisgender people is difficult, but they have amped up over the last two decades, and especially in the last five years or so, said Miller and Dr. Dennis Baron, professor emeritus of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAs our understanding of gender has evolved, and our understanding of inclusion has evolved, we\u2019re starting to see more and more of these terms being used,\u201d Miller added. Why gender inclusivity matters at the doctor\u2019s office In addition to acknowledging the difference between gender and sex, using phrases like \u201cpregnant people,\u201d for example, also recognizes intersex people (who have reproductive anatomy or genes that don\u2019t fit into a male-female binary, which is often discovered at birth) and the various ways gender-diverse people affirm their gender identity, Miller said. Some people may think a trans man can\u2019t get pregnant based on assumptions he has undergone surgical gender-affirming care that would remove, add or alter the appearance of some sex characteristics such as a vagina or breasts. But every trans or nonbinary person is different in terms of what care they want, if any, Miller said \u2014 so a trans man who hasn\u2019t received this care can still get pregnant. And sometimes this happens even when a trans man has been taking testosterone. In the context of health care, \u201cit\u2019s not just a matter of (being) inclusive or polite, it\u2019s a matter of medical accuracy,\u201d Baron said. That applies to various medical scenarios, including something as simple as the prescription of antibiotics, which can diminish the effectiveness of birth control. If someone who was assigned female at birth, yet presents as a man, is on birth control and hormones and is given antibiotics because the doctor assumed the patient has a penis based on their appearance and identity, the patient could unwillingly end up pregnant. Labeling people by what anatomy or biological functions they have allows medical professionals to \u201cbe more inclusive and consider those clinical impacts,\u201d Miller added. In addition to the American Psychological Association, several other medical associations have recognized the difference between gender and sex and support the use of gender-neutral terms \u2014 including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Institutes of Health. \u201cPresumably, it makes the patient feel like they\u2019re being seen, that they\u2019re being paid attention to appropriately,\u201d said Baron, author of \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Pronoun?: Beyond He and She.\u201d Whether this openness exists in medical professions can affect whether a gender-diverse person seeks care, Drescher said. Are cisgender people being erased? A common critique of gender-inclusive language is that it \u201cerases women.\u201d But there are parallel euphemisms for the genitalia or biological functions of those assigned male at birth, too \u2014 it\u2019s just that phrases such as \u201cpregnant people\u201d or \u201cpeople with uteruses\u201d have been amplified in public discourse due to constant political discussions around reproductive rights, experts said. \u00a0 Given the fact that there are \u201cso many ciswomen and cismen and that they actually are a very large majority, language is not going to erase them,\u201d Drescher said. These experts also aren\u2019t saying the issues facing certain groups of people are unimportant, they said \u2014 broader language is just a way to include people who haven\u2019t been included before. \u201cYou can\u2019t just wave it away and say, \u2018Oh, these are made up terms so they\u2019re no good,\u2019\u201d Baron said. \u201cAll language is made up, and it\u2019s made up because we have a need to say things.\u201d And contrary to what some may think, saying things like \u201conly women can get pregnant\u201d excludes more than just intersex people or those in the LGBTQ community, Miller said \u2014 that\u2019s because such statements can also convey that a ciswoman who can\u2019t get pregnant is no longer fully a woman. Gender-inclusive language may seem to be just words, but research has shown that acceptance can be lifesaving for transgender and nonbinary people, Miller said, both for medical and psychological reasons. \u201cVerbalizing,\u201d Baron added, \u201cis an act of important recognition that then gives people a sense that, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m here and I can talk about this. And other people can talk about me and to me and with me in ways that maybe weren\u2019t so easy before or were impossible before.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/gender-inclusive-language-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_health_into-the-gorge-emily-halnon-wellness", "text": "When my mom died, I spent a lot of time trying to stuff away my grief. Like, cramming another pile of bills into the junk drawer, so no one could see the mess inside. I went to a friend\u2019s house for dinner a month after her funeral. I hovered on the outskirts of the evening. Snippets of conversation floated around me, but my brain was foggy with grief. I couldn\u2019t quite grasp onto anything through the haze. My gaze caught on a framed photo of my friend and her mom, snapped in front of a rose bush in Eugene, Oregon, their arms pulled tight around the other. The picture reminded me of the last time my mom visited me in Oregon. She posted Facebook updates from all three of the airports between Vermont and Eugene. A photo of a book cracked open on her lap in Salt Lake City, a coffee cup next to her. \u201cThree hours and 17 minutes until I see my girl.\u201d When I picked her up, she bounced through the terminal to get to me. We spent the weekend running along the Willamette River, visiting covered bridges in the foothills of the Cascades, finding the best pastries in a 50-mile radius. She raced a half-marathon. She was 64. I thought we had decades left together. A thousand more miles to run. The memories unleashed a rush of grief. I walked to the bathroom at my friend\u2019s house as fast as I could, trying to conceal why I needed an escape route. My throat tightened. My eyes grew glassy with tears. I slid into the bathroom, sat on the lid of the toilet and shoved a handful of toilet paper into my eyes. An ache gnawed at my heart. I pictured my friend and her mom. I thought about all the years and visits and miles I had lost with my mom. I swallowed back a sob, aware of the thin door between me and a room full of laughing people. It was a familiar move. One I pulled at work, at the climbing gym, in the line at the brewery on the north side of town. I tried to hide my grief, so others didn\u2019t have to see it. I bit my lip and pinched my eyes when I felt a wave of tears coming on. I pretended I was OK when I was anything but. I learned to almost never provide an honest answer to the question, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d My grief made people uneasy My mom had been sick with a rare uterine cancer for 13 months before she died. I\u2019d already been the Sad Girl for too long. I felt the ways it was uncomfortable for people to be too close to my hardest emotions. And the ways society wanted me to grieve in isolation and to accelerate my journey through loss. I\u2019d faced many uncomfortable silences and quick goodbyes when someone wanted their own escape route away from me. I\u2019d had friendships fade over the last 14 months and watched coworkers avoid my cubicle when I got back from any trip to Vermont. A relationship ended when my then-boyfriend didn\u2019t want anything to do with my emotional reality. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you\u2019re being positive enough,\u201d he said after my mom was diagnosed with an aggressive, late-stage cancer. I\u2019d just learned my mother would probably die within a year. Positivity felt like it was on another planet. When my mom died in January 2020, I felt moved to do something to celebrate her life and her bold and brave spirit. She\u2019d run her first marathon at 50. She learned how to swim when she turned 60, so she could do her first triathlon. She jumped out of a plane that same year to celebrate her birthday. And she lived through her 13 months of cancer with extraordinary courage and joy. My mother felt the weight of cancer, but she insisted on continuing to live in her wholehearted way. She walked the dirt roads around her house in Vermont nearly every day she was sick, even through the harsh side effects of chemotherapy. She\u2019d text me and tell me about the friends who joined her and how blue the sky was over the rolling hills. \u201cIt\u2019s what keeps me going,\u201d she said. Running in my mother\u2019s honor I decided to run the 460-mile section of the Pacific Crest Trail that crosses Oregon \u2014and to try and do it faster than any human before me. My mom was every reason I was a runner because I watched her run that first marathon and felt wildly inspired to do one myself. I got hooked on exploring my limits through running and kept going. Doing a big run in her honor felt like an obvious path to take through the upheaval of her death. But when I started training for it, I wondered if it was a terrible idea to attempt such a huge run while trudging through the heaviest grief. On one of my first days of training, I went through the motions to get ready. Every move was weighed down by grief. I laced my shoes like my fingers were dragging through molasses. I walked out the door like I was wading through mud, questioning my decision. I headed to the wooded hills behind my house. When I stepped onto the soft dirt that weaves through the pine trees, I exhaled. My breath flowed through me like a river, finally escaping the logjam that\u2019d kept it wound tight inside me. The soft dirt cradled my footsteps as I ran. A breeze rustled pine needles and wrapped around me. I remembered bringing my mom to this trail and felt a hot tear roll down my cheek and fall to the earth below. The fierce longing for her was lockstep with me on the trail. As I ran, I thought about that first marathon I did with my mom. I had gone out way too fast and hit a wall of fatigue about halfway through the race, where I felt like I couldn\u2019t keep going. As I struggled, I saw my mom bounce past around mile 14 \u2014 and I was amazed that her stride was strong and confident. I called to her, \u201cMommmmm!\u201d like I was 5 years old again and wailing for my mother. But the race was too crowded for her to hear me. I cried again, \u201cMommmm!\u201d I made no attempt to hide how I was feeling in that moment. Very few people do, while running a marathon, or any long distance on the roads or trails. If you stand on the sides of a marathon course, you\u2019ll see the rawest human emotions on display. It\u2019s one of the things I love most about running. No hiding your grief when running Like, in a 100-mile race, you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to hit a low. Almost no one makes it to the finish line without getting slapped with something rough: debilitating self-doubt, obliterated muscles, a sour stomach, crushing overwhelm. And when that happens, we don\u2019t run to the bathroom to hide our feelings behind a closed door. We confront those lows in front of our fellow runners, our friends, the volunteers, the spectators. When I bonked at mile 40 of my first 100-mile run, I told members of my crew, \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time right now,\u201d and they didn\u2019t flinch in the face of my struggle. They helped me into a camp chair, brought me slices of quesadilla and stayed by my side. They held space for me to work through my low. When we stand on the start line of a marathon or a 100-mile race, we embrace the vulnerability that goes with the distance. We know it might get hard. We know we might turn into a running billboard, advertising our toughest moments. And we run straight into that reality. We promise the humans standing alongside us that we\u2019ll bear witness to what they endure and not turn away from them. There are so few spaces that invite that kind of emotional honesty \u2014 and create space for it. Pressure not to feel grief I got five days of bereavement at work. In this culture, there\u2019s an expiration date on our time as the Sad Girl, in the company of anyone but our closest friends and family. There\u2019s pressure to travel quickly from the center of Griefville to the streets of perfectly OK. Even though I am not. On the trail, I am free to feel my feelings. When I step into the woods, I\u2019m like a snake shedding my skin, leaving a more tender part of me exposed. I can let my guard down and allow my rawest emotions to bubble to the surface. I was worried the Pacific Crest Trail run would be too much. But as I kept training, I discovered that running was one of the best places to process my grief. I could move through my sorrow, instead of swallowing it back and trapping it inside me. Running gave me something I desperately needed after losing my mom. Something that\u2019s way harder to find than it should be. Running gave me a place where I didn\u2019t have to stuff anything away, where I could let my love for my mother and my grief over losing her far too soon unfold with the miles and take up as much space as the ground beneath my feet and the wide, open sky above.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/health/into-the-gorge-emily-halnon-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_world_whale-communication-coda-alphabet-scn", "text": "Scientists have accomplished a whale of a feat. They\u2019ve identified previously unknown complexity in whale communication by analyzing thousands of recorded sequences of sperm whale clicks with artificial intelligence. Variations in tempo, rhythm and length of the whales\u2019 click sequences, called codas, weave a rich acoustic tapestry. These variables hint that whales can combine click patterns in multiple ways,\u00a0mixing and matching phrases to convey a broad range of information to\u00a0one another. What sperm whales are saying with their clicks remains a mystery to human ears. Still, uncovering the scope of whales\u2019 vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking whale calls to specific messages or social behaviors, the scientists reported May 7 in the journal Nature Communications. \u201cThis work builds on a lot of prior work focused on understanding the calls of sperm whales. However, this is the first work that has started to look at sperm whale calls in their wider communicative context and in the context of exchanges between whales, which has made some of the findings possible,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Daniela Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, in an email. \u201cUnderstanding what aspects of their codas they can control and vary helps us understand how they can encode information in their calls,\u201d Rus said. The researchers dubbed their catalog of sound combinations a \u201cphonetic alphabet\u201d for sperm whales, comparing variations in the whales\u2019 click sequences to the production of different phonetic sounds in human speech. But while the team\u2019s findings are interesting, that term offers a misleading perspective on whales\u2019 vocal interactions, said Dr. Luke Rendell, a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom whose work focuses on communication in marine mammals, in an email. \u201cThe presentation of the \u2018phonetic alphabet\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s nothing of the sort,\u201d said Rendell, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe way the tempo variation is used is completely different to how, say, we use elements of an alphabet to construct linguistic expression,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of that, and it\u2019s not a super helpful interpretation because it forces everything into a restricted and somewhat over-sold perspective of \u2018is it like human language or not,\u2019 when there are a much broader range of interpretations available.\u201d Pattern recognition Sperm whales produce their clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels \u2014 louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums \u2014 another team of scientists previously reported in the journal Scientific Reports. For the new study, the researchers used machine learning to detect patterns in audio data collected by The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, a repository for observations of sperm whales that inhabit the Caribbean Sea. The recordings represented the voices of approximately 60 sperm whales \u2014 a subset of a group of about 400 whales known as the Eastern Caribbean clan \u2014 and the vocalizations were recorded between 2005 and 2018. Prior research had identified 150 types of codas in sperm whales worldwide, but the Caribbean whales used just 21 of those codas. The scientists examined the timing and frequency of 8,719 coda sequences\u00a0\u2014 in solitary whale utterances, in choruses and in call-and-response exchanges between whales. When visualized with artificial intelligence, previously unseen coda patterns emerged. The study authors defined four features in codas: rhythm, tempo, rubato\u00a0and ornamentation. Rhythm describes the sequence of intervals between clicks. Tempo is the duration of the entire coda. Rubato refers to variations in duration across adjacent codas of the same rhythm and tempo. And ornamentation is an \u201cextra click\u201d added at the end of a coda in a group of shorter codas, Rus explained. These so-called ornament clicks \u201coccur more towards the beginning and end of turns\u201d during vocal exchanges between whales, \u201cbehaving like discourse markers,\u201d Rus said. The discovery that whales could synchronize variations in coda tempo was \u201ca really interesting observation,\u201d\u00a0Rendell said. \u201cI am less convinced by the \u2018ornamentation,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt occurs very rarely, and I think we need more evidence that they aren\u2019t just production glitches,\u201d or filler sounds, \u201clike when we say \u2018um\u2019 or \u2018err.\u2019\u201d In all, the program detected 18 types of rhythm, five types of tempo, three types of rubato and two types of ornamentation. These coda features could all be mixed and matched to form an \u201cenormous repertoire\u201d of phrases, the study authors reported. What\u2019s more, meaning could be tweaked even further depending on the placement of a coda \u2014 following or overlapping other codas \u2014 within an exchange or chorus involving two or more whales. Interactive experimentation \u201cActually, many of us have been waiting for advanced technology to allow us to do something like this for decades!\u201d said Dr. Brenda McCowan, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, in an email. McCowan, who was not involved in the research, was part of another team that, in 2021,\u00a0conducted an interactive \u201cconversation\u201d with a humpback whale in waters near Alaska. For about 20 minutes, a curious whale repeatedly responded to a recording of a humpback song transmitted from the scientists\u2019 boat. \u201cThis particular playback (with the humpback in 2021) was an opportunistic experiment with an inquisitive whale engaging us both behaviorally and vocally, and completely at her own volition,\u201d McCowan said. Such interactive experimentation with whales, along with observations of whale behavior, could be an important part of unraveling the syntax of sperm whale click sequences, the authors wrote in the study. Their machine learning method may also prove useful for studying other types of animal vocalizations, McCowan added. \u201cTempo, rhythm, rubato and ornamentation are likely to be found in other species of whales,\u201d McCowan said. \u201cWe already know this is true of humpback song. But there is also evidence for this type of patterning in other aquatic, terrestrial and arboreal species to which this approach could be applied.\u201d But although this technique is helpful for identifying certain aspects of communication, it\u2019s no Rosetta stone, Rendell cautioned. \u201cMachine learning is great for finding patterns in large datasets,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t create meaning.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/world/whale-communication-coda-alphabet-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_health_super-bowl-parade-survivors-bullets-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "James Lemons, 39, wants the bullet removed from his thigh so he can go back to work. Sarai Holguin, a 71-year-old woman originally from Mexico, has accepted the bullet lodged near her knee as her \u201ccompa\u201d \u2014 a close friend. Mireya Nelson, 15, was hit by a bullet that went through her jaw and broke her shoulder, where fragments remain. She\u2019ll live with them for now, while doctors monitor lead levels in her blood for at least two years. Nearly three months after the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting left at least 24 people injured, recovery from those wounds is intensely personal and includes a surprising gray area in medicine: whether the bullets should be removed. Medical protocol offers no clear answer. A 2016 survey of surgeons found that\u00a0only about 15%\u00a0of respondents worked at medical facilities that had policies on bullet removal. Doctors in the U.S. often leave bullets buried deep in a person\u2019s body, at least at first, so as not to cause further trauma. But as gun violence has emerged as a public health epidemic,\u00a0some researchers wonder\u00a0if that practice is best. Some of the wounded, like James Lemons, are left in a precarious place. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to get it out, and it\u2019s safely taken out, get it out of the person,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cMake that person feel more secure about themselves. And you\u2019re not walking around with that memory in you.\u201d Lemons, Holguin, and Nelson are coping in very different ways. Pain Became a Problem Three days after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Lemons drove the 37 miles from Harrisonville, Missouri, to downtown Kansas City to celebrate the victory. The warehouse worker was carrying his 5-year-old daughter, Kensley, on his shoulders when he felt a bullet enter the back of his right thigh. Gunfire erupted in the area packed with revelers,\u00a0prosecutors later said, after a \u201cverbal confrontation\u201d between two groups. Detectives found \u201cmultiple 9mm and .40 caliber spent shell casings\u201d at the scene. Lemons said he understood immediately what was happening. \u201cI know my city. We\u2019re not shooting off fireworks,\u201d he said. Lemons shielded Kensley\u2019s face as they fell to the ground so she wouldn\u2019t hit the concrete. His first thought was getting his family \u2014 also including his wife, Brandie; 17-year-old daughter, Kallie; and 10-year-old son, Jaxson \u2014 to safety. \u201cI\u2019m hit. But don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Lemons recalled telling Brandie. \u201cWe gotta go.\u201d He carried Kensley on his shoulders as the family walked a mile to their car. His leg bled through his pants at first then stopped, he said. It burned with pain. Brandie insisted on driving him to the hospital but traffic was at a standstill so she put on her hazard lights and drove on the wrong side of the road. \u201cShe\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m getting you to a hospital. I\u2019m tired of people being in my way,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen my wife like that. I\u2019m looking at her like, \u2018That\u2019s kinda sexy.\u2019\u201d Lemons clapped and smiled at his wife, he said, to which she replied, \u201cWhat are you smiling for? You just got shot.\u201d He stayed in quiet admiration until they were stopped by a sheriff, who summoned an ambulance, Lemons said. He was taken to the emergency room at University Health, which\u00a0admitted 12 patients\u00a0from the rally, including eight with gunshot wounds. Imaging showed the bullet barely missed an artery, Lemons said. Doctors cleansed the wound, put his leg in a brace, and told him to come back in a week. The bullet was still in his leg. \u201cI was a little baffled by it, but I was like, \u2018OK, whatever, I\u2019ll get out of here,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. When he returned, doctors removed the brace but explained they often leave bullets and fragments in the body \u2014 unless they grow too painful. \u201cI get it, but I don\u2019t like that,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you take it out if you could?\u201d University Health spokesperson Leslie Carto said the hospital can\u2019t comment on individual patient care because of federal privacy laws. Surgeons typically do remove bullets when they encounter them during surgery or they are in dangerous locations, like in the spinal canal or risking damage to an organ, said\u00a0Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children\u2019s. Campbell also chairs the Injury Prevention and Control Committee of the American College of Surgeons\u2019 Committee on Trauma, which works on firearm injury prevention. LJ Punch, a trauma surgeon by training and the founder of the\u00a0Bullet Related Injury Clinic\u00a0in St. Louis, said the origins of trauma care also help explain why bullets are so often left. \u201cTrauma care is war medicine,\u201d Punch said. \u201cIt is set to be ready at any moment and any time, every day, to save a life. It is not equipped to take care of the healing that needs to come after.\u201d In the survey of surgeons, the most common reasons given for removing a bullet were pain, a palpable bullet lodged near the skin, or an infection. Far less common were lead poisoning and mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. What patients wanted also affected their decisions, the surgeons said. Lemons wanted the bullet out. The pain it caused in his leg radiated up from his thigh, making it difficult to move for more than an hour or two. Working his warehouse job was impossible. \u201cI gotta lift 100 pounds every night,\u201d Lemons recalled telling his doctors. \u201cI gotta lift my child. I can\u2019t work like this.\u201d He has lost his income and his health insurance. Another stroke of bad luck: The family\u2019s landlord sold their rental home soon after the parade, and they had to find a new place to live. This house is smaller, but it was important to keep the kids in the same school district with their friends, Lemons said in an interview in Kensley\u2019s pink bedroom, the quietest spot to talk. They\u2019ve borrowed money and raised\u00a0$6,500 on GoFundMe\u00a0to help with the deposit and car repairs, but the parade shooting has left the family in a deep financial hole. Without insurance, Lemons worried he couldn\u2019t afford to have the bullet removed. Then he learned his surgery would be paid for by donations. He set up an appointment at a hospital north of the city, where a surgeon took measurements on his X-ray and explained the procedure. \u201cI need you to be involved as much as I\u2019m going to be involved,\u201d he remembered being told, \u201cbecause \u2014 guess what \u2014 this ain\u2019t my leg.\u201d The surgery is scheduled for this month. \u2018We Became Friends\u2019 Sarai Holguin isn\u2019t much of a Chiefs fan, but she agreed to go to the rally at Union Station to show her friend the best spot to see the players on stage. It was an unseasonably warm day, and they were standing near an entrance where lots of police were stationed. Parents had babies in strollers, kids were playing football, and she felt safe. A little before 2 p.m., Holguin heard what she thought were fireworks. People started running away from the stage. She turned to leave, trying to find her friend, but felt dizzy. She didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been shot. Three people quickly came to her aid and helped her to the ground, and a stranger took off his shirt and made a tourniquet to put on her left leg. Holguin, a native of Puebla, Mexico, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018, had never seen so much chaos, so many paramedics working under such pressure. They were \u201canonymous heroes,\u201d she said. She saw them working on Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a well-known DJ and 43-year-old mother of two. Lopez-Galvan died at the scene, and was the sole fatality at the parade. Holguin was rushed to University Health, about five minutes from Union Station. There doctors performed surgery, leaving the bullet in her leg. Holguin awoke to more chaos. She had lost her purse, along with her cellphone, so she couldn\u2019t call her husband, Cesar. She had been admitted to the hospital under an alias \u2014 a common practice at medical centers to begin immediate care. Her husband and daughter didn\u2019t find her until about 10 p.m. \u2014 roughly eight hours after she\u2019d been shot. \u201cIt has been a huge trauma for me,\u201d Holguin said through an interpreter. \u201cI was injured and at the hospital without doing anything wrong. [The rally] was a moment to play, to relax, to be together.\u201d Holguin was hospitalized for a week, and two more outpatient surgeries quickly followed, mostly to remove dead tissue around the wound. She wore a wound VAC, or vacuum-assisted closure device, for several weeks and had medical appointments every other day. Campbell, the trauma surgeon, said wound VACs are common when bullets damage tissue that isn\u2019t easily reconstructed in surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical injuries,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cMany times it\u2019s the emotional, psychological injuries, which many of these patients take away as well.\u201d The bullet remains near Holguin\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019m going to have it for the rest of my life,\u201d she said, saying she and the bullet became \u201ccompas,\u201d close friends. \u201cWe became friends so that she doesn\u2019t do any bad to me anymore,\u201d Holguin said with a smile. Punch, of the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis, said some people like Holguin are able to find a way to psychically live with bullets that remain. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to make a story around what that means for that bullet to be in your body, that gives you power; that gives you agency and choice,\u201d Punch said. Holguin\u2019s life changed in an instant: She\u2019s using a walker to get around. Her foot, she said, acts \u201clike it had a stroke\u201d \u2014 it dangles, and it\u2019s difficult to move her toes. The most frustrating consequence is that she cannot travel to see her 102-year-old father, still in Mexico. She has a live camera feed on her phone to see him, but that doesn\u2019t offer much comfort, she said, and thinking about him brings tears. She was told at the hospital that her medical bills would be taken care of, but then lots of them came in the mail. She tried to get victim assistance from the state of Missouri, but all the forms she had were in English, which made them difficult to comprehend. Renting the wound VAC alone cost $800 a month. Finally she heard that the Mexican Consulate in Kansas City could help, and the consul pointed her to the Jackson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, with which she registered as an official victim. Now all of her bills are being paid, she said. Holguin isn\u2019t going to seek mental health treatment, as she believes one must learn to live with a given situation or it will become a burden. \u201cI have processed this new chapter in my life,\u201d Holguin said. \u201cI have never given up and I will move on with God\u2019s help.\u201d \u2018I Saw Blood on My Hands\u2019 Mireya Nelson was late to the parade. Her mother, Erika, told her she should leave early, given traffic and the million people expected to crowd into downtown Kansas City, but she and her teenage friends ignored that advice. The Nelsons live in Belton, Missouri, about a half hour south of the city. Mireya wanted to hold the Super Bowl trophy. When she and her three friends arrived, the parade that had moved through downtown was over and the rally at Union Station had begun. They were stuck in the large crowd and quickly grew bored, Mireya said. Getting ready to leave, Mireya and one of her friends were trying to call the driver of their group, but they couldn\u2019t get cell service in the large crowd. Amid the chaos of people and noise, Mireya suddenly fell. \u201cI saw blood on my hands. So then I knew I got shot. Yeah, and I just crawled to a tree,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know where I got shot at, at first. I just saw blood on my hands.\u201d The bullet grazed Mireya\u2019s chin, shot through her jaw, broke her shoulder, and left through her arm. Bullet fragments remain in her shoulder. Doctors decided to leave them because Mireya had already suffered so much damage. Mireya\u2019s mother supports that decision, for now, noting they were just \u201cfragments.\u201d \u201cI think if it\u2019s not going to harm her the rest of her life,\u201d Erika said, \u201cI don\u2019t want her to keep going back in the hospital and getting surgery. That\u2019s more trauma to her and more recovery time, more physical therapy and stuff like that.\u201d Bullet fragments, particularly ones only skin-deep, often push their way out like splinters, according to Punch, although patients aren\u2019t always told about that. Moreover, Punch said, injuries caused by bullets extend beyond those with damaged tissue to the people around them, like Erika. He called for a holistic approach to recover from all the trauma. \u201cWhen people stay in their trauma, that trauma can change them for a lifetime,\u201d Punch said. Mireya will be tested for\u00a0lead levels in her blood\u00a0for at least the next two years. Her levels are fine now, doctors told the family, but if they get worse she will need surgery to remove the fragments, her mother said. Campbell, the pediatric surgeon, said lead is particularly concerning for young children, whose developing brains make them especially vulnerable to\u00a0its harmful effects.\u00a0Even a tiny amount\u00a0of lead \u2014 3.5 micrograms per deciliter \u2014 is enough to report to state health officials, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mireya talks about cute teenage boys\u2019 being \u201cfine\u201d but also still wears Cookie Monster pajamas. She appears confused by the shootings, by all the attention at home, at school, from reporters. Asked how she feels about the fragments in her arm, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care for them.\u201d Mireya was on antibiotics for 10 days after her hospital stay because doctors feared there was bacteria in the wound. She has had physical therapy, but it\u2019s painful to do the exercises. She has a scar on her chin. \u201cA dent,\u201d she said, that\u2019s \u201cbumpy.\u201d \u201cThey said she was lucky because if she wouldn\u2019t have turned her head in a certain way, she could be gone,\u201d Erika said. Mireya faces a psychiatric evaluation and therapy appointments, though she doesn\u2019t like to talk about her feelings. So far, Erika\u2019s insurance is paying the medical bills, though she hopes to get some help from the United Way\u2019s\u00a0#KCStrong fund, which raised nearly $1.9 million, or a faith-based organization called\u00a0Unite KC. Erika doesn\u2019t want a handout. She has a job in health care and just got a promotion. The bullet has changed the family\u2019s life in big ways. It is part of their conversation now.

{"id": "2024_05_09_health_adult-autism-diagnosis-wellness", "text": "John Frizzell always had a feeling he was different. The Hollywood film score composer could rattle off facts about chess puzzles, Immanuel Kant\u2019s synthetic a priori knowledge and other esoteric subjects. He could go down philosophical rabbit holes and regale friends and family members with anecdotes about David Hume. His friends playfully referred to him as \u201cUseless Information Man.\u201d In 2021, when one of his friends suggested that Frizzell get evaluated for autism, he decided he had nothing to lose. Several weeks later, a positive diagnosis provided an answer to the question with which he had wrestled for years. \u201cIf you can imagine a mountain without a path, somehow I now have made the inklings of a road,\u201d said Frizzell, who has scored films including \u201cOffice Space\u201d and \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe.\u201d He also has composed music for \u201cUnderstanding Autism,\u201d a documentary film about autism coming out later this year. \u201cIt was the first time in my life that I felt that someone liked the parts about me that were hard for me.\u201d The catharsis that Frizzell experienced is common among adults who are diagnosed with autism later in life. For some, an adult autism diagnosis is an inflection point \u2014 the moment in which a clearer and more fulfilling existence starts anew. For others, it brings a blurred picture into focus. Whatever the perspective, an adult autism diagnosis is an identity builder, instantaneously minting new members of the growing autism community. This, in turn, can create a sense of belonging \u2014 a big deal for a community that continues to grapple with chronic loneliness. An adult\u2019s experience of autism Autistic adults are everywhere. There are more than 5.4 million adults with autism in the United States, about 2.2% of the population, according to the most recent survey by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017. A subsequent peer-reviewed study in 2022 estimated that about 1 in 45 adults in the United States are autistic \u2014 about 5.7 million people, based on 2020 census data. While support services exist for autistic children, autistic adults are generally underserved, according to Lindsay Naeder, vice president of services and supports and community impact at Autism Speaks, a national autism support and advocacy group. A 2023 report from the\u00a0US Bureau of Labor Statistics demonstrated how stark this problem really is. Data indicated only about 21% of people with disabilities (including those with autism) are employed \u2014 the lowest employment rate for that subset of the population since data collection began in 2008. This finding echoed a 2016 National Autism Society report that indicated the adult autism community was experiencing an unemployment rate as high as an estimated 85%. There are other serious challenges to the mental health of autistic adults. Research indicates that autistic people are more likely to experience feelings of loneliness compared with those who aren\u2019t autistic. What\u2019s more, studies have shown that up to 66% of autistic adults have thought about taking their own life, and an alarming 35% have attempted suicide. \u00a0 \u201cWithout some form of intervention, many autistic adults really struggle,\u201d said Dr. Michael Chez, research pediatric neurologist at the Sutter Institute for Medical Research in Sacramento, California. \u201cThis is why a diagnosis can be so important.\u201d An autism diagnosis can be everything Adults are seeking formal autism diagnoses in record numbers, according to providers and practitioners who specialize in autism. While they report that no formal data on diagnosis rates exists, these experts said interest in evaluations is higher than ever. In many cases, waiting lists for evaluations and assessments can be anywhere from six months to two years long, and adult autism evaluations can cost anywhere from $3,800 to $5,800, according to providers. Depending on insurance, patients may have to cover some or all of this expense. \u201cDemand has increased many times over,\u201d said Dr. Ingrid Boveda, a psychologist and founder of a Salt Lake City practice called The Hive. Boveda credited social media with driving this trend, adding, \u201cThe more people are on social media, the more they are getting exposure to neurodivergent adults and what their experiences are like, and the more these young people are saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m like that\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s me.\u2019\u201d And while there are well-established procedures of diagnosing autism in children, few specific diagnostic tests exist for adults. Over the last decade, certain evaluations have become more prevalent in adult assessments; generally speaking, the names of these evaluations are convoluted. Some studies have suggested that Module 4 of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (psychologists call it ADOS-2), is useful for diagnosing autism in adults. Many providers use that and the Social Responsiveness Scale for Adults, Second Edition (SRS-2).\u00a0 But assessments are not essential for a diagnosis, experts say. Adults can be diagnosed by psychiatrists, psychologists and general practitioners who specialize in autism. Dr. Quinten Harvey, owner of Harvey Psychological Services in Salt Lake City, said the evaluation of an adult leans heavily on standardized testing and direct observation, and should also incorporate feedback and observations from people who know the patient well. \u201cWe don\u2019t want only a single track of information; we want a global picture,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to have information from those who are familiar.\u201d Because there are no set diagnostic tests, many adults have opted to self-administer evaluations and lean on the results to diagnose themselves. Self-diagnosis has pros and cons. On one hand, achieving an autism diagnosis of any kind can connect an individual to a broader community and help stave off loneliness. On the other hand, some within the autism community question the legitimacy of this approach and sometimes criticize those who do it. Dr. Vanessa Bal, associate professor at Rutgers University\u2019s Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology, said another potential negative aspect to self-identifying is that it does not allow access to resources that require professional diagnoses. She added self-diagnosis could unintentionally trigger other issues as well. \u201cSelf-identifying individuals sometimes assume that their experiences are mostly attributable to autism,\u201d said Bal, who is also the Karmazin and Lillard Chair in Adult Autism at Rutgers. \u201cTherefore (they) could miss out on opportunities to get support for co-occurring conditions that could improve their mental health.\u201d Bridging the gaps As autism and neurodivergence become more prevalent in society, more and more organizations are stepping in to provide equal opportunities for autistic adults. Autism Speaks has an Autism Response Team that answers questions and provides tools and resources. Team members are also trained to help autistic individuals connect with post-secondary programs and employment services that specialize in neurodivergence as well as any other services and supports across the lifespan. According to Naeder, the ART phone line logs nearly 65,000 calls per year; the program is set up to handle calls in Spanish, too. In Los Angeles, The Ed Asner Family Center, a community center that provides programs for special needs individuals, has partnered with toy manufacturer Funko to provide a job training program through which young adults can gain real-world experience by working at the Funko store on Hollywood Boulevard. The program launched in January 2023. Spencer Harte is one of the young adults in the program. Every Tuesday and Thursday, Harte works a regular shift at the registers, scanning prices and taking payments. Harte, 25, described the experience as a \u201cdream come true\u201d and a great way to learn. \u201cI was into Funkos before this, but now, I\u2019m really into them,\u201d Harte said. \u201cI\u2019m also learning valuable skills for the work world. That will help me down the road.\u201d There are other efforts to make autistic adults feel included. The Bay Area Autism Collective, based in San Francisco, offers weekly autism-affirming Zoom peer support groups led by autistic individuals. Founder and Executive Director Bird Sellergren said they started the group and the weekly support gatherings to make the adult autistic experience seem more connected, less isolated and something to celebrate. \u201cGetting an autism diagnosis, becoming part of the autism community, has completely recontextualized my life,\u201d said Sellergren, who was diagnosed in 2021 at age 44. \u201cI can look back at things that were confounding, put them in the context of autism, and they all make sense. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I have to fix myself. I don\u2019t have this inherent sense that something is wrong with me. The diagnosis has allowed me to find my community and my people. That has been more validating than just about anything in my life.\u201d Matt Villano is a writer and editor in Northern California.

{"id": "2024_05_09_health_fda-blood-donations-malaria", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration is considering a requirement for blood banks to use a new test that can detect the parasites that cause malaria in certain donors\u2019 blood, and it\u2019s seeking the opinion of its independent advisers on the best way to meet its goal of zero transfusion-related cases without unnecessarily prohibiting some people from donating blood.  The World Health Organization says malaria is a significant global health issue, with 249 million cases and more than 608,000 deaths in 2022 alone. Malaria is not considered a big threat to the US blood supply like it is in some other countries. But nearly 28 million US residents travel to parts of the world where malaria is common each year, the FDA says, and as more Americans travel and as the planet gets warmer, scientists have predicted that the disease could\u00a0become more likely in the US, even with aggressive mosquito control. As late as the 1940s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday in a presentation to the FDA\u2019s advisory committee, the US had about 65,000 cases of malaria a year \u2013 but that changed when the country needed healthy service members to fight in World War II. Knowing that many would train in malaria-prone areas in the South, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s government waged a war on mosquitoes that paid off. By 1949, according to the CDC, malaria was no longer considered a significant health problem in the US, and WHO declared the US free of the disease in 1970. The US still has about 2,000 cases a year, according to the CDC, but most are travel-related. The CDC noted that although the risk of locally acquired malaria in the US continues to be \u201cextremely low,\u201d just last summer, it warned doctors to watch for locally acquired cases. There were a handful of non-travel-related cases in Texas, Florida, Maryland and Arkansas last year, the first locally acquired malaria cases in the US since 2003. In March, the FDA approved the first test intended to screen donor blood for the evidence of malaria. The Cobas malaria test, made by Roche, can detect RNA and DNA from the parasite that causes malaria in donor blood, organs and tissue. Malaria transmission through a blood transfusion is not common, but an infection can trigger severe symptoms and even death, studies show. A CDC study found that from 1963 through 1999, there were just 93 cases spread through donated blood in the US, but 10 of those people died. Another study found 13 malaria cases related to blood donations between 2000 and 2021, the FDA said, but seven of the cases involved\ufeff donors who met current FDA eligibility criteria. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, and it doesn\u2019t prevent all cases,\u201d Jennifer Scharpf, associate director for policy in the agency\u2019s Office of Blood Research and Review, said of the current guidelines. The FDA told the committee Wednesday that its current guidance comes with a high level of \u201ccomplexity\u201d and that blood bank workers must assess several potential risk factors. Blood banks use a donor history questionnaire to screen for people who have had malaria or who lived in a country where the disease is endemic in the past three years. People are also deferred from donating if they have traveled to a country with endemic malaria in the previous three months; or if they were a resident of a malaria-endemic country, if they have spent less than three consecutive years in a country where malaria is endemic, or if they have a history of travel to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three years. The rules are slightly different for platelet and plasma component collection. \ufeffThese questionnaires have limitations, and the screening process is \u201cerror-prone,\u201d the FDA said. Deferral periods may also not be sufficient to catch asymptomatic donors, particularly for residents of countries where malaria is common, because they may have partial immunity from a previous infection\ufeff. On the other hand, the current guidance disqualifies a large group of healthy potential donors, the FDA said. Some estimates say that between 1% and 3% of all donors are turned away based on travel history alone, and blood banks say they can never get enough donors. Scharpf told the committee that about 50,000 to 160,000 donors may be deferred annually, and studies show that many\ufeff people who are deferred often don\u2019t return, even when they are eligible to donate. The FDA is considering a couple of strategies to update its guidelines. The first consideration is to do selective testing of a donor\u2019s blood based on their history of malaria infection, having traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months or having ever lived in a malaria-endemic country. Another option is to test all donors at least one time and then to selectively test donations from people at risk of exposure, including those who had ever had malaria and those who had traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months. Most of the advisory\ufeff committee members seemed to favor the first option, saying the second seemed like overkill. \u201cIt\u2019s such a low incidence of disease, and it\u2019s treatable,\u201d said committee member Dr. Richard Scanlan, a professor, vice chair of the Laboratory Medicine Transfusion Service and medical director at Oregon Health & Science University. The FDA is also considering requiring testing of all blood donated in areas where there was even one locally transmitted malaria case recently, but the committee members seemed less sure about this idea. Committee member Dr. Sanjay Ahuja, director of Rainbow Hemostasis & Thrombosis Center at Rainbow Babies & Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland, said that if there is proven local transmission, the decision of \ufeffwhen to test all donor blood from the area is a \u201cdifficult one.\u201d \u201cThere are so many nuances to this,\u201d Ahuja said. \u201cI think it might be a little bit much in my opinion, but I don\u2019t know whether more evidence of local transmission should be in place before we say \u2018yes\u2019 to this.\u201d During the meeting\u2019s public comment period, leaders of some\ufeff blood supply organizations encouraged the FDA to take a cautious approach to changing the guidelines. Ralph Vassallo, incoming chair of the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies\u00a0Transfusion Transmitted Disease Committee, said his group joins\ufeff America\u2019s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross in believing that the new test for malaria holds real promise to improve blood safety and may improve the availability of donors by removing \u201cunnecessary donor deferrals,\u201d particularly among subsets of donors with uncommon blood types, such as those from Latin American, Asian and African countries. But, he told the committee, there are no clinical studies that show that the test reduces the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria. Vassallo also encouraged the FDA to use flexible testing strategies and said that although the groups supported limited testing of all donations in ZIP codes with local malaria transmission, one case should not be enough to trigger such testing. \u201cFDA should support formal modeling studies designed in consultation with malariologists using the best available assumptions about parasite levels during asymptomatic infection before issuing final guidance,\u201d he said. The committee did not vote on the proposed strategies, but the FDA said it would take the discussion into consideration as it considered changing its guidance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/fda-blood-donations-malaria/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_us_northern-lights-how-to-watch", "text": "In case you missed the stunning nighttime spectacle of multicolored auroras dancing in the skies across the Northern Hemisphere, there is still a chance Sunday evening to catch a glimpse \u2013 but not for everyone. The auroras that have been visible starting Friday are a result of increased solar activity, including a series of solar flares and coronal mass projections from the sun, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The dazzling curtains of green, red and purple lights were spotted from Maine to California and as far south as Alabama, Georgia and Florida on Friday and Saturday. However, people hoping for another sighting in the South and portions of the central United States may be out of luck. \u201cNo more vibrant aurora for Florida or any other \u2018unusual\u2019 places,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. \u201cToday is when we see the big shift back to the north for the lights,\u201d Chinchar said. \u201cSo all the usual places you would see the aurora, like Iceland, Canada, Scandinavian countries, etc. \u2026. that\u2019s where the focus will be going forward.\u201d In general, it\u2019s good to start looking during the time right after sunset. Weather, of course, is key, as cloud cover may limit the visibility of the aurora. Mostly clear conditions are expected in the northern portion of the US including Minneapolis and Fargo, North Dakota \u2013 some of the locations with the greatest chance of seeing the auroras on Sunday evening, according to Chinchar. But thicker cloud cover may inhibit viewing opportunities in a few spots in the Pacific Northwest and around the Great Lakes region. Green Bay, Wisconsin, is included in the area with the best viewing opportunities but those may be hampered by a chance of clouds and rain Sunday night, Chinchar said. New York City; Seattle, Washington; and Chicago are among locations where the auroras will possibly be visible on Sunday. The Space Weather Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005. But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as\u00a0solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The extreme geomagnetic storm will continue and persist through at least Sunday, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cThe aurora will be more widespread and seen at lower latitudes\u201d during periods of stronger geomagnetic storm conditions, the center said Sunday. \u201cWe are less certain about how much of an Earth-directed impact we will have with the next pending (coronal mass ejection\u2019s) arrival as compared to our high level of certainty with the previous (coronal mass ejections) and extreme geomagnetic storms,\u201d said Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator with the Space Weather Prediction Center, on Sunday. \u201cTherefore, people wanting to see the aurora should keep checking our webpage and social media presence for news/updates of a new CME arrival,\u201d Dahl said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe solar wind environment remains highly disturbed as passing CME influences continue, but gradually weaken,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cStill, it will not take much of any new CME arrival for geomagnetic storm levels to reach G3-G4 levels tonight.\u201d The storm\u00a0could affect the power grid\u00a0as well as satellite and high-frequency radio communications. The Biden administration\u00a0said it is monitoring the possibility of impacts. Bill Nye the Science Guy, an educator and engineer, said the massive solar storm could cause problems in a world that relies so much on electricity. Nye noted that a solar storm in 1859, known as the Carrington Event, lasted a week and severely affected telegraph communications, which at the time were state of the art. \u201cThe other thing, everybody, that is a real danger to our technological society, different from 1859, is how much we depend on electricity and our electronics and so on,\u201d Nye said. \u201cNone of\u00a0us really in the developed\u00a0world could go very long without electricity.\u201d There are systems in place to minimize the impact but \u201cstuff might go wrong,\u201d said Nye, noting not all transformers are equipped to withstand a massive solar event. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just like the April 8th total solar eclipse. It really brings the fact that we live on a planet that\u2019s orbiting a star that\u2019s in a galaxy to our front door. It brings it down to earth,\u201d Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi, an astrophysicist, told CNN. \u201cIf you ask me, I\u2019d say a total solar eclipse is clearly number one. But next to a bright comet, aurorae are pretty amazing to see. And if you\u2019re near the northern extremes or the southern extremes, we cannot just get the colors in the sky, but the actual undulating curtains of nebulosity. That\u2019s pretty awesome. So the fact that that\u2019s going to extend to more people around the world, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Nye added, \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate this.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/northern-lights-how-to-watch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_02_22_health_oklahoma-narcan-vending-machines", "text": "In his darkest moments, Jason Hall felt worthless. During his childhood and early adulthood, he said, there were times when he would drink too much alcohol, pop pills at nightclubs and, inevitably, do something or say something that would hurt people he loved. Hall, 41, would never have thought that his life journey would take him from those dark experiences to potentially saving lives with his work refilling naloxone vending machines across Oklahoma. Over-the-counter naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, is an inhaled medication used to reverse an opioid overdose while it\u2019s happening. Naloxone vending machines \u2013 which provide the medications for free \u2013 can help people access doses quickly and reduce someone\u2019s risk of dying from an opioid overdose since, ideally, the medication should be given immediately. The vending machines also offer free fentanyl test strips, small strips of paper that can test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that drives most overdose deaths in the United States. From California to New York, vending machines stocked with harm-reduction tools have been placed in areas where high numbers of opioid overdoses have been reported. In Oklahoma, some of the machines are located along turnpikes, in casinos, on university campuses, at a library or outside fire stations. A CNN analysis of state health departments finds that at least 33 states and the District of Columbia have naloxone vending machines. In some states, like Oregon, city or county health departments or local nonprofits might operate the machines without state involvement. Other states, like Delaware, don\u2019t currently have vending machines but plan to launch programs this year. The size of these programs can vary. Oklahoma plans to expand its program this year from 27 machines to 40. Other large programs can be found in places like Michigan, where Wayne County officials announced last month plans to deploy 100 vending machines containing naloxone. When working with the vending machines in Oklahoma, Hall often reflects on his experiences to inform his work. As a senior field representative for harm reduction campaigns at the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, he leads community training sessions on harm reduction as well as helping restock dozens of naloxone vending machines for people to access anonymously. \u201cPeople\u2019s reasons for using substances are as vast and different as there are different types of suffering. I grew up as a queer kid in a small town, and it was not a super cool thing to be in the \u201880s and \u201890s,\u201d said Hall, who is based in Oklahoma City. \u201cYou\u2019re basically told from a very, very young age that this is kind of the worst thing that you can be. You internalize that, and it creates a lot of depression and anxiety.\u201d Hall, who is now sober, said that at a young age, he turned to substances like methamphetamines or opioids to give him the feeling of confidence he craved at the time. In his mid-30s, Hall sought treatment for substance use disorder. \u201cThis followed me my entire life. Then I got to a place where I wasn\u2019t using methamphetamines and opioids, and alcohol was my substance of choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a very cool hipster guy. I was vegan, and I only rode a bicycle around. It\u2019s funny that I was very particular about the foods that I would eat, but as far as substances, I wasn\u2019t so picky.\u201d Hall, who works for the state and occasionally bartends on the side, said he has personally administered naloxone several times to reverse opioid overdoses during his time bartending and while working in shelter and housing programs. Even though he knows that naloxone is accessible through the vending machines, he always keeps some on him too, just in case. \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to need these products. A lot of times, substance use isn\u2019t planned,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, people are out in the community and maybe having a few cocktails and a substance becomes available, and maybe it\u2019s a substance you typically wouldn\u2019t use, but you\u2019ve had a couple drinks, and your inhibitions are lowered.\u201d \u2018People are dying every minute of the day\u2019 More than 111,000 people in the US died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period that ended in September, according to\u00a0provisional data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about overdose death rates, I\u2019ve got any number of friends, I see their face every time I see those numbers or when we talk about the number of overdose reversals that come from kits that are distributed by our community partners,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhen I hear those numbers, I hear the voices of my friends that are currently struggling with substance use disorder,\u201d he said, eyes filling with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s very real to me.\u201d Overall, the number of overdose deaths associated with any drug continues to increase each month in the United States, although the pace appears to be slowing. Deaths reached a record high in May and changed little in the following months, through September. \u201cPeople are dying every minute of the day due to these overdoses, and so the vending machines are an amazing tool to help get the help into the hands of the public,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \u201cThis is a prevention technique, and it\u2019s very, very helpful to have these distribution points in the community that allow people to get what they need quickly without necessarily relying immediately on a first responder when seconds matter to save a life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so these distribution points and these vending access machines are meant to bring\u00a0the solutions closer to the community and put the tools in their hands to save lives.\u201d A study conducted in Cincinnati found that a single vending machine was directly associated with reversing overdoses for at least 78 people in its first year. In Clark County, Nevada, another study found that in the 12 months after the launch of naloxone vending machines, there were 229 opioid-involved overdose deaths. But researchers had previously predicted that there would be about 270 deaths in the county, suggesting that about 41 deaths were averted after the machines were launched. Machines need to be restocked every day Oklahoma\u2019s naloxone vending machine program launched in June. The state placed its first machine at a homeless shelter in Tulsa. The machines have become so popular that they need to be restocked every day, said Heath Hayes, former deputy commissioner for the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. \u201cAll of the vending machines have technology associated with it that ping us when they\u2019re getting low. So if they\u2019re at 50% capacity, we get the staff ready to activate the restockers,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThese vending machines that we have active right now have about 11,000 boxes of naloxone that have been distributed,\u201d he said, and each box contains two doses. The vending machines each hold 100 naloxone kits and 54 fentanyl test strip packages. Both items \u2013 naloxone and the test strips \u2013 are available in the machines free of charge. Typically, an over-the-counter box of two single-dose naloxone sprays can cost around $45. In 2022, before the launch of the vending machine program, about 700 people died of opioid overdose in Oklahoma, according to state health department numbers, up from about 400 deaths in 2021. Hayes said the state will closely watch those numbers to see whether they decline over time, especially as naloxone becomes more easily accessible with the addition of more vending machines. \u201cOur goal is to get naloxone in the hands of every Oklahoman, because we want to normalize that naloxone is something that every person should carry on them,\u201d Hayes said before he left the department. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to have naloxone in 2 million-plus people\u2019s hands that are 18 and older,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are overdosing can\u2019t use this medication on themselves, and for about 40% of the people who overdose, there\u2019s a bystander around. So it\u2019s critical that you have naloxone on you, because you never know when you can save a life.\u201d Aside from providing naloxone and fentanyl test strips at no cost, an appeal of the vending machines is that they offer a sense of anonymity. The machines do not collect any identifiable information, and anyone can walk up and use them. Hayes said there is still a lot of stigma around opioid use and the need for naloxone, but he hopes the vending machines can help reduce it. The machines have large print on the sides that reads \u201cnaloxone saves lives.\u201d \u201cNot often do you see a vending machine that says \u2018Naloxone can save lives\u2019 and it be very mental health- and addiction-focused, at your gas station,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThat\u2019s another piece to this, is that we have a physical symbol of anti-stigma in places that typically aren\u2019t associated with the mental health field.\u201d Some critics question whether the machines enable dangerous behaviors. Naloxone vending machine programs often can face\u00a0opposition from the communities\u00a0where they are placed. But public health advocates champion the machines as a way to reduce the number of lives lost to overdose while reducing stigma. In central Pennsylvania, six naloxone vending machines have been installed in rural communities where stigma can be prevalent but there is a greater need for expanded access to naloxone medication, said Carla Sofronski, executive director and co-founder of the\u00a0Pennsylvania Harm Reduction Network. \u201cHarm reduction is often highly stigmatized, especially in Pennsylvania, with the thought process that it is enabling drug use, when it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. Harm reduction does not condone drug use. It just provides life-saving interventions and tools in a toolbox to keep people alive and minimize risk,\u201d Sofronski said. \u201cWe have to start treating this as an urgent public health crisis, and folks should not be denied access to life-saving interventions due to stigma or because some folks may believe that people have addiction due to moral failure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to cut the stigma to actually get these tools out to people.\u201d \u2018You are not a broken person\u2019 Hall has faced stigma firsthand. He says he has heard some criticisms or \u201cdifficult\u201d questions about the naloxone vending machines and other programs. For instance, people might ask whether the vending machines enable opioid abuse on-site. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to think that somebody\u2019s going to walk into one of these spaces and see that this vending machine has fentanyl test strips and Narcan and think, \u2018oh, this makes it safe for me to use.\u2019 I think if anything, it\u2019s bringing more to the forefront the danger around using these substances,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt really is a shame that, a lot of times, we have to spend our time and energy into humanizing people that use substances or people that might need access to these tools,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some people that have the attitude of \u2018well, if somebody overdoses, then that\u2019s their problem,\u2019 and that\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d Some of these negative biases and attitudes around people with substance use disorders remind Hall of how easily stigma can chip away at someone\u2019s self-worth. If he could speak to his younger self, at the peak of his substance use, he would tell himself that he is worthy of all that life has to offer. \u201cI would tell little baby Jason that everything is going to be OK,\u201d Hall said. \u201cYou are not a broken person, and you are not less than anybody else, and you are not less deserving of everything that life has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these things about yourself that you think make yourself so different and so \u2018othered\u2019 really just make you so much more human.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/22/health/oklahoma-narcan-vending-machines/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_health_but-what-will-people-say-book-sahaj-kohli-cec-wellness", "text": "For most South Asians, the phrase \u201cWhat will people say?\u201d\u00a0is all too familiar. What will people say if you wear that revealing outfit? What will people say if you don\u2019t pursue an advanced degree? What will people say if you marry someone outside of your religion? What will people say if you get a divorce? You can swap in any hypothetical scenario that might spur societal judgment \u2014 the variations are endless. Sahaj Kaur Kohli, a licensed therapist and founder of the online mental health community Brown Girl Therapy, knows the weight of that question well. Born to parents with Indian and Sikh roots, Kohli was raised in a predominantly White suburb in Virginia and often found the collectivism of her immigrant parents\u2019 culture at odds with the individualism of the West, she writes in her new book \u201cBut What Will People Say? Navigating Mental Health, Identity, Love, and Family Between Cultures.\u201d The differences between the two cultures became especially clear after a difficult period in college prompted Kohli to move back home. When she told her parents she was battling depression and needed to see a therapist, Kohli says they worried how others might perceive her mental health struggles and tried to manage the situation on their own. It wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t concerned about her, Kohli adds \u2014 they were simply conditioned to think in terms of the family unit and community, believing their daughter\u2019s depression could be seen as a failure on their part. But what will people say? \u201cWe care so much about what other people will think that we forget about the people within the community or within the families who might be hurting,\u201d Kohli said in an interview with CNN. In \u201cBut What Will People Say?,\u201d which published May 7, Kohli explores that fear of judgment, along with other challenges that children of immigrants commonly face: shame, self-sabotaging behaviors and the loss of cultural identity among them\ufeff. Part memoir and part self-help, the book draws on Kohli\u2019s personal experiences and her work as a therapist to help children of immigrants process their emotions, improve their family dynamics and develop a clearer sense of self. Some of Kohli\u2019s reflections and insights might resonate beyond her target audience. In the book, she opens up about her once-strained relationship with her father, the academic troubles she long kept secret and the trauma she endured \u2014 experiences that many people, children of immigrants or not, can relate to. CNN spoke to Kohli about how to deal with guilt, how conversations around mental health in the West miss cultural nuance and how immigrant parents can better understand their children. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. What made you want to write this book? I wanted to write this book because I knew nothing like it existed. It\u2019s something that I so desperately could have used growing up. I\u2019m just so honored to be able to create something in a space that is predominantly White and individualistic by nature, and offer cultural nuance to the conversation of wellness. Your book focuses on your experiences growing up in two cultures: the community-oriented Indian culture of your parents and the individualist culture of the West. What were the biggest tensions between the two? That tension that I felt was every single day. I grew up with diametrically opposing values, norms and expectations. One of those cultural systems was the Western world. At home, I was being raised in a totally different environment that had different expectations of who I was supposed to be: as an Indian daughter, as an Indian woman, as a daughter of immigrants, as a South Asian woman. I started to develop performative behaviors at school, around friends, around dating, around career, around how I showed up in those social environments and how I wanted to be perceived. I developed a second set of performative behaviors when I was at home, when I was going to Gurdwara (Sikh house of worship) on Sundays, when I was going to an Indian cultural event on the weekends or when I was talking to my parents. The ways that we were taught to communicate, stand up for yourself or even start to learn about your own sense of self and your own needs is very different in the Western world than it is in the Eastern world. I didn\u2019t know it then but every single part of my life was at tension with one another based on how I thought I was supposed to behave to be accepted in the environments that I was living in. When did you start to develop the language to process those feelings? Very recently. Through working in media and working on identity-driven content and mental health content, I started to gain a language for wellness, identity and all of these things. But it wasn\u2019t until I went to grad school in 2019, which was the same time that I started Brown Girl Therapy, that my whole world opened up. It was through those experiences \u2014 building a community that didn\u2019t really exist for a population that was underserved and learning Eurocentric techniques and tools in school that all catered to individualism \u2014 that I started to realize how important this work is and how much we need to infuse culture into these conversations. What are some of the disconnects between Western therapy and the experiences of children of immigrants? One of the biggest things is other-care. We talk so much about self-care and the individual to such an extent that it leaves out everything else. What children of immigrants, Asian families, non-Western communities and immigrant communities really center is family and relationships. We are being exposed to all of these ideas that revolve around setting boundaries, cutting people out and thinking about yourself first. How do we learn to stick up for ourselves while also being mindful of the cultural nuances in the families and the systems that we exist in? So many of us feel as much pride and joy and rejuvenation from taking care of others and being in the roles that we play \u2014 whether it\u2019s being a daughter, sister, parent \u2014 as we do as taking care of ourselves. That is something in the self-care narratives in the Western world that we don\u2019t talk about enough. There\u2019s so much research on so many things that we just are not talking about: What\u2019s \u201ctoo close\u201d in a family system? What is considered dysfunctional? What is considered codependency? What is considered enmeshment and not having any boundaries? These things are very binary in the Western world, when in reality, it really does depend. There is this messy middle where things are neither good nor bad \u2014 they just are. How do we live in that messy middle? That\u2019s the ethos to all of my work. You share some very personal experiences in the book, like being sexually assaulted and taking a while to graduate from college \u2014 the kinds of experiences that children of immigrants are often taught to keep quiet. How did you get to a place where you felt comfortable being vulnerable?\u00a0 The process of writing this book was so healing for me. I excavated so many old wounds, stories and my inner child by revisiting parts of my life and owning them for myself. Even in writing about my college career, my editors had to push back a lot and say, \u201cYou still are not being very nice to yourself.\u201d It was a process getting to a point where I was like, \u201cDo I still feel shame about the fact that it took me 12 years to graduate college?\u201d Sometimes. Sometimes I feel really embarrassed \u2014 that it means I\u2019m not smart. Then I have to remind myself that that\u2019s not true. Life just happened in a certain way for me. I didn\u2019t choose to struggle, and it doesn\u2019t mean anything about me that it took me longer. Battling shame through self-compassion by writing this book is the ultimate form of liberation for myself. We all have experiences that we feel so much shame for because we worry what other people are going to think about those experiences. If we just own them, we can dismantle that shame. And that\u2019s what I did. What are some of the most common issues that children of immigrants bring up in therapy?\u00a0 Guilt. The feeling of guilt. Navigating guilt. How guilt motivates us to not do the thing we want. How it motivates us to revert to behavior that might not be good for us. How guilt leads to shame. Guilt for having more access to resources and opportunities than our parents or our family abroad. Guilt for being too American. Guilt for not being American enough. Guilt for not being enough of whatever our cultural identity is. Guilt for setting boundaries. Guilt for not setting boundaries. Guilt for picking the partner that we want to have. Guilt for choosing a different career path. Guilt is the biggest thing I hear and see. How do you advise people to work through that guilt? Remember that guilt is an emotion like any other emotion. So many of us will feel guilt and all of a sudden be like, \u201cI\u2019m doing something wrong. This is too uncomfortable. I need to stop doing the thing I\u2019m doing.\u201d In reality, guilt is just a yellow light. It\u2019s a slow down sign. Guilt tells us we crossed a moral boundary. It\u2019s very important to interrogate that. Is the guilt telling me that I hurt someone else? Is the guilt telling me I need to repair a relationship or repair something that I did that was wrong? Oftentimes, the answer for children of immigrants is: Probably not. But what\u2019s happening is that they are mistaking disappointing someone else for guilt that they are doing something wrong. If you come from two different cultures with different values, you\u2019re going to feel guilt because you\u2019re being fed conflicting definitions of what is good and what is right. Do you feel guilt because your parents are subscribing to a different set of values that don\u2019t align with yours? By choosing a different career, by choosing not to have kids or whatever, do you feel like you\u2019re doing something wrong because they don\u2019t believe in that? Or are you actually crossing your own values? Really getting clear on your values and how it differs or overlaps with people you care about is important. Just because you feel bad doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something bad, and I think it\u2019s really important for people to discern between those two experiences. My biggest piece of advice is to really interrogate (the guilt) and to get clear on your values and whose values you\u2019re crossing when you feel guilt. Then question whether you should change your behavior or if you need to learn to sit in the discomfort. How do we work through these conflicts if our parents don\u2019t have the same language and emotional capacity to deal with them? I often hear, \u201cI\u2019m not the one who needs therapy. They need therapy.\u201d Maybe they do, and maybe they\u2019re not willing to take accountability. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have agency over things that you can do differently. If I were to learn, go to therapy and unpack more about how my relationship with my mom affects me, I might then start to learn tools to manage my emotions when I\u2019m with my mom. Which means that when I\u2019m with my mom, I might get less defensive, which means that our relationship dynamic automatically changes. It\u2019s important for people to realize that doing the work is never about changing other people, but it\u2019s about changing the way you show up. (It\u2019s about learning to) manage your expectations, decide what you are and aren\u2019t willing to tolerate and how you can show up in that space within the relationship. What\u2019s your advice for immigrant parents who want to understand their children better? Curiosity, connection and compassion are key. Parent or not, it\u2019s so easy to make assumptions about what someone else is feeling or thinking. It\u2019s so easy to fill in the gaps in the story ourselves or to reinforce a story about someone else rather than actually ask or get more information. It\u2019s really difficult to show up vulnerably in a relationship and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m learning too. I don\u2019t know, but I want to hear more about what it\u2019s like for you.\u201d If (the children) are really young and you\u2019re still trying to figure out how to help raise them, then really embrace their bicultural identity. A strong and integrated bicultural identity is a protective factor against mental health issues. As a parent, you can embrace that. It doesn\u2019t mean that you are allowing your kid to fully assimilate and forget where they come from, because I know that\u2019s a very big fear. I didn\u2019t have this language growing up, but it\u2019s very obvious to me now that my parents were scared. They were scared immigrants. They moved to a new country. They did the best they could. I loved them dearly, and because they were scared, all they did was want to retain a sense of control. So they tried to keep their kids close. They tried to make decisions for their kids. They tried to control how their kids acted or what choices they made. For a long time, that created a chasm between me and my parents. It was only in my late 20s that I was able to fill that chasm with them and build a new relationship. To any parent, I would really encourage them to self-interrogate how they\u2019re showing up and how their fears might be determining how they have a relationship with their kids or don\u2019t have a relationship with their kids.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/health/but-what-will-people-say-book-sahaj-kohli-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_bird-flu-cows-human-receptors", "text": "In early March, Dr. Barb Petersen, a large-animal vet in Texas, began getting calls from the dairy farms she works with in the Panhandle.\u00a0Workers there were seeing a lot of cows with mastitis, an infection of the udder. Their milk was thickened and discolored, and it couldn\u2019t be explained by any of the usual suspects such as bacteria or tissue damage. Several more dairies called.\u00a0One owner told her he thought his farm had \u201cwhatever is going around, and half of my pets have died,\u201d indicating that the contagion had moved beyond cattle. After running a battery of tests and ruling out every cause she could think of, Petersen sent samples from sick and dead animals to the Texas A&M state veterinary lab and to friends and colleagues at Iowa State University. What they found \u2013 loads of the H5N1 influenza virus \u2013 has rocked the dairy industry and put public health officials around the world on alert. It also created an urgent scientific to-do list. One of the first questions that needed to be answered was how the virus was infecting cows in the first place. Researchers in the US and Denmark took on that task. Their findings, published as a preprint study, show that cows have the same receptors for flu viruses as humans and birds. Scientists fear that cows could be mixing bowls \u2013 hosts that help the virus learn to better spread between people. Such an event, while rare, experts say, could put us on the path to another pandemic. Bird flu tries out new hosts For years, H5N1, or highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been primarily confined to the bird population, but it has recently begun to infect a growing number of mammals, suggesting that the virus might be adapting and moving closer to becoming a human pathogen. Avian flu viruses have decimated commercial poultry flocks in the US, and because pigs are known to catch bird flu viruses, swine have been closely monitored for signs of infection \u2013 but cows weren\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar as potential hosts. Since late March, 42 infected herds have been found in nine states, according to the the US Department of Agriculture. Only one person has been found to be infected with H5N1 after contact with infected cows, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health is low, although it is working with states to monitor people with animal exposures. \u201cThe finding in cattle has been so different,\u201d said Dr. Lars Larsen, a professor of veterinary clinical microbiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In mammals, influenza typically infects the lungs. In cats, it can also infect the brain. \u201cHere we see an enormous amount of virus in the mammary and in the milk,\u201d Larsen said. Larsen said the concentration of H5N1 viruses in the milk of infected cows is 1,000 times higher than typically seen in infected birds.\u00a0He said he and his colleagues calculated that even if the milk from a single infected cow were diluted in 1,000 tons of milk, scientists would still be able to pick up traces of the virus in lab tests. Tests by the US Food and Drug Administration found inert fragments of genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 out of 5 samples of milk purchased on grocery store shelves, raising questions about how the virus had become so widespread. Researchers confirmed in later tests that the pasteurized milk it tested wasn\u2019t infectious and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick. That hasn\u2019t stopped the outbreak from rattling more than a few nerves. There\u2019s big money riding on the health of cows. Milk and dairy products were the fourth largest agricultural commodity in the US in terms of cash receipts in 2022, according to the USDA\u2019s economic research service. Sales of cattle and calves were the second largest commodity. How viruses break into cells Viruses need a way to hack into cells.\u00a0For the virus that causes Covid-19, the key is a receptor called ACE2.\u00a0For flu viruses, it\u2019s a sugar molecule that sticks up from the surface of cells called a sialic acid. Different animals carry different forms, or shapes, of sialic acids. Birds have sialic acid receptors that are slightly different shapes from than the ones humans have in their upper respiratory tracts. If you hold your index finger straight up, that\u2019s kind of what a bird\u2019s sialic acid receptor looks like, says Dr. Andy Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0If you bend your finger at the knuckle into an upside-down L, that\u2019s what human sialic acid receptor looks like. Flu viruses tend to prefer to bind to one shape over the other, he said. Researchers think this may be one reason why H5N1, which originated in birds, hasn\u2019t been shown to spread efficiently between people. Until recently, nobody knew what kind of sialic acid receptors cows had, because it was believed that they didn\u2019t catch A-strain flu viruses like H5N1. Larsen and his colleagues in the US and Denmark took tissue samples from the lungs, windpipes, brains and mammary glands of calves and cows and stained them with compounds that they knew would attach to different kinds of sialic acid receptors.\u00a0They sliced the stained tissues very thinly and peered at them under a microscope. What they saw was surprising: The tiny milk-producing sacs of the udder, called alveoli, were brimming with sialic acid receptors, and they had both the kind of receptors associated with birds and those that are more common in people.\u00a0Almost every cell they looked at contained both types of receptors, said lead study author Dr. Charlotte Kristensen, a postdoctoral researcher in veterinary pathology at the University of Copenhagen. That finding has raised concern because one way flu viruses change and evolve is by swapping pieces of their genetic material with other flu viruses.\u00a0This process, called reassortment, requires that a cell be infected with two different flu viruses at the same time. \u201cIf you get both viruses in the same cell at the same time, you can essentially get hybrid viruses coming out of it,\u201d said study author Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. In order to be infected simultaneously with two flu viruses \u2013 a bird flu virus and a human flu virus \u2013 a cell would need to have both kinds of sialic acid receptors, which cows do, something that wasn\u2019t known before this study. \u201cI think this is probably a pretty rare event,\u201d said Webby, who has been studying the H5N1 virus for 25 years. In order for something like that to happen, a cow infected with the bird flu virus would need to pick up a different flu strain from an infected human.\u00a0Currently, human flu infections are low across the country and dropping as flu season winds down, making the possibility of something like this happening even more remote. Still, it\u2019s not unheard-of. Pigs also have both human and bird sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tracts, and flu infections in pigs have been known to spark pandemic viruses.\u00a0The 2009 pandemic caused by H1N1 influenza, for example, is believed to have started in pigs in Mexico when the virus reassorted to become one that was able to spread quickly between people. Another way the bird flu virus could change in cows, Webby says, is more gradual \u2013 and more common. Each time a virus copies itself, it makes mistakes.\u00a0Sometimes, those mistakes make the virus less potent and hurt its chances of survival, but in other instances, they\u2019re happy accidents \u2013 at least for the virus.\u00a0If a bird flu virus happened to change in a way that made it able to bind more easily to the human-type sialic acid receptors in cows, it could gain a survival advantage: the ability to infect more cells and more types of animals, like humans. Viruses can shift and drift Reassortment would be a big shift in the evolution of the virus, but the gradual passage of the virus through new hosts could also result in a change to the virus\u2019 genome by evolutionary drift. Either way, it\u2019s not good news, said Dr. Sam Scarpino, a computational biologist and director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University. \u201cWe now have a piece of data that suggests the risk profile is higher,\u201d said Scarpino, who was not involved in the new study. He notes that this is early research.\u00a0It needs to be confirmed by a different group of researchers, and it was published quickly as a preprint ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. But he said the findings are also important because no one had really looked to at the susceptibility of cow tissues to influenza A viruses before. \u201cThis is the first that I\u2019m aware of. It doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t another one out there, but a number of us looked at it pretty carefully and didn\u2019t find any,\u201d he said. Kristensen said the researchers also couldn\u2019t find any prior research on it, which is why they did the study. \u201cWe just felt that, given the situation, that we should go out with these results as fast as possible,\u201d Larsen said. Other experts said that although there are more dots to connect, the study clearly raises the level of alert. \u201cI think we now have more than enough information to conclude that what has to happen is, we need to stop transmission in dairy cattle,\u201d Scarpino said. \u201cWe need to increase the kinds of protection that are mandated for workers that are in close contact with cows and milk products and significantly increase the funding that\u2019s going into understanding influenza and in cows, because there\u2019s just a huge amount that we don\u2019t know that we need to learn very quickly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/bird-flu-cows-human-receptors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_health_wegovy-trial-analysis", "text": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use. The analyses \u2013 of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss \u2013 also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used \u2013 and covered by insurers. \u201cThe implications are profound,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. \u201cWe have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.\u201d More than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans. One important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely \u2013 and how long \u2013 they\u2019ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years. Researchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways: Weight loss continued for more than a year The analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau. A previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events. It was sustained for up to four years The results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years. Patients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight. However, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did \u2013 almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug. Results vary for everyone In the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines. No safety surprises out to four years Overall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased. The researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn\u2019t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug\u2019s prescribing information because they\u2019d been seen previously in trials. Benefits beyond weight loss A key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play. That\u2019s because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didn\u2019t lose weight. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefit\u201d with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the new analyses. \u201cThat\u2019s because that\u2019s what GLP-1 does: It\u2019s cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you don\u2019t require weight loss \u2013 it\u2019s not the whole story.\u201d An analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight. \u201cThis suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,\u201d or body fat, the researchers concluded. A separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said. \u201cThese two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.\u201d A benefit from reducing inflammation Drucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,\u201d he said. But based on his lab\u2019s research, he said, \u201cone of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.\u201d Drucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis \u2013 driven by inflammation \u2013 who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive. The results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who don\u2019t have obesity or aren\u2019t overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event \u2013 another thing that would need to be studied. And, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely. \u201cWe probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are not going to be helpful in terms of actually improving health and saving lives and saving health care dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes and death.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/health/wegovy-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_health_parent-burnout-wellness", "text": "When I was knee-deep in the early years of parenting, Facebook was in its infancy and Instagram and TikTok weren\u2019t even on the horizon. I was stuck in the revolving door of work and parenting, and nothing about my personal life was Instagram-worthy. Dishes piled up, laundry was rarely folded, and Whole Foods did a fair amount of the cooking for me. And none of my life was online. Somewhere between 2006 and now, parenting became a crash course in achievement, with social media grading us at every turn. With perceived perfection as the end goal, as measured by child success, and pictures to prove it cross-posted on Facebook and Instagram, kids and parents alike unknowingly entered a relentless pressure cooker. \u201cParental achievement culture, and the chronic stress that comes with it, is real, if only because the resulting anxiety and churning stomach juices is real,\u201d said Jessica Lahey, author of \u201cThe Gift of Failure.\u201d \u201cHowever, much of that stress comes from us, from the media we consume, the parents we hang out with and the childhood milestones we focus on, and it can really warp our thinking.\u201d The nature of childhood changed as parents did their best to ensure that their kids were front-loaded with everything they needed to succeed in childhood. Free play was replaced with adult-directed activities and story time was swapped for reading practice. Even preschoolers became mini-achievers, with their early reading success a marker of exceptional parenting. It was a recipe for burnout. It\u2019s no surprise to me that researchers at the Ohio State University College of Nursing confirmed that parents are, indeed, facing burnout. In a 2023 survey of more than 700 parents nationwide, 57% of parents self-reported burnout. Parent burnout is strongly associated with both internal and external expectations. These include whether a person feels like a good parent, perceived judgment from others, whether they have enough time to play with their children, their relationship with their spouse, and keeping a clean house. I could live in a house littered with toys and unfolded clothes and throw a pizza on the table when work ran late without an online spotlight, but parents of young children today face impossible expectations. They have to work, create perfect learning conditions for child success, play with their children (but make sure the play involves education), cook organic everything from scratch on the daily, and make sure to update the sizzle reel often. One other concerning finding from the survey is that parents of children with mental health disorders reported higher levels of burnout and a greater likelihood of using harsh parenting practices, including insulting, criticizing, screaming at, cursing at and/or physically harming their children. These can result in a cycle of increased mental health issues for both the parent and the child. The researchers suggest engaging in positive parenting practices, including setting realistic and clear expectations, creating healthy boundaries and following predictable routines. Those are great starting points, especially for parents with young children, but there are other steps you can take as well: Monitor your social media use Social media has some benefits: It keeps us all connected, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s a healthy escape in small doses. But it also has downsides. Comparison culture is fueled by endless scrolling, we don\u2019t always see the story beneath the story, and frequent use can correlate to feelings of low self-esteem. There are two social media tricks that can be life-changing for adults: Mute accounts (you\u2019re the only one who will know!) that leave you feeling stressed and set a time limit using your phone settings. You\u2019re better off binging your favorite show on Netflix than jealous-scrolling and feeling defeated as a result. Embrace \u2018good enough\u2019 While perfection across contexts has long been a norm in our society, we would do well to tap into the work of Dr. Donald Winnicott. The pediatrician made a splash in the field of parenting in the 1950s when he introduced the concept of \u201cthe good enough mother.\u201d Noting that perfectionism is often counterproductive, Winnicott cautioned that no child seeks perfection from parents; they simply seek connection, physical needs and emotional safety. I suggest updating that language to \u201cthe good enough caregiver,\u201d but otherwise the principles hold up. To attempt perfection in child-rearing is to set kids up for a lifetime of stress and disappointment. Human beings are not perfect. Rather, doing our best on any given day is a far more realistic portrayal of how the world works. Reframe your thinking Lahey suggests stepping back from monitoring for signs of perceived achievement. \u201cOur kids need to know we love them no matter what grade, point or score they bring home,\u201d she said. \u201cOur children are more than the sum of their accomplishments and we \u2014 their parents \u2014 are not measured by those things either.\u201d Lahey cautions parents to remember that parenting is a long-haul job with peaks and valleys and that kids can and do learn from their mistakes along the way. Quit the competition One thing that will always remain true is that all children learn and grow at their own developmental paces. Milestones are simply goalposts to monitor for the extremes, but they are flexible. No two children are the same. You have the choice to step back, decrease the classes, sports and other activities you feel are essential because of external expectations, and find the right pace for your family. I often encourage parents to use a whiteboard calendar to write down every single thing they have to do in a week and then step back and remove at least two things. Small changes can reap big rewards, including decreased parental stress and burnout. You can quit the competition, and your kids will be better for it.

{"id": "2024_05_08_health_ozempic-babies-pregnancy", "text": "Catera Bentley stared at the positive pregnancy test and couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. She took a second test, then a third \u2014 there was no question. She was pregnant. She called her husband at work and told him that there was a giant spider in the house that he had to come get rid of. He rushed home, and when he arrived, Bentley revealed the news. They both burst into tears. The couple, who live in Steele, Alabama, had been trying to have a child for more than two years, but Bentley\u2019s doctor had told her that she may be unable to conceive because of her history of polycystic ovary syndrome, known as PCOS. The news had left her feeling without a purpose. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to be was a mom and a wife,\u201d said Bentley, 25. \u201cI was depressed, severely depressed for that whole time.\u201d Five months earlier, in October 2022, Bentley had started taking Mounjaro for weight loss. Over the first few months, she said, she lost about 40 pounds. Her menstrual cycles, which had been irregular because of PCOS, became normal. And she even felt happier. \u201cIt just made me feel like a whole new person,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in a better mood every single day.\u201d Bentley had hoped that losing weight might help her get pregnant, and she\u2019d heard about others having success with weight loss while taking the shot. But when she did become pregnant \u2014 sooner than she expected \u2014 she worried about the effects it might have on her baby. \u2018Ozempic babies\u2019 Bentley is far from alone. Numerous women have shared stories of \u201cOzempic babies\u201d on social media. But the joy some experience in discovering pregnancies may come with anxiety about the unknowns, as these medicines haven\u2019t been studied in people who are pregnant. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the effect of early exposure \u2026 on the fetus,\u201d said Dr. Jody Dushay, a physician focused on endocrinology and metabolism at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Dushay said she recommends that women stop taking these drugs two months before trying to get pregnant, as directed in their prescribing information. Ozempic and Mounjaro are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, which act by mimicking hormones in the gut involved in insulin regulation and appetite. They\u2019re both approved to treat type 2 diabetes, and each have twin medicines approved for weight loss. Ozempic uses the active ingredient semaglutide, and Wegovy is the version approved for weight loss. Mounjaro uses tirzepatide, which also targets a second hormone called GIP, and Zepbound is its brand name for weight loss. The medicines have been shown to help people lose 15% to 20% of their body weight, on average, in clinical trials. And because of the way GLP-1 drugs work, experts say, there are reasons they may lead to more pregnancies as well as cause for caution about their use in early pregnancy. An effect on birth control For one, weight loss can generally be associated with increased fertility by restoring normal ovulation in people who have PCOS or other causes of abnormal cycles, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a professor and researcher at the University of Toronto\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital and a pioneer of research into GLP-1. \u201cIf you start on these medicines and then you lose 5, 10, 15% of your body weight, very often, you will have an improvement in ovulation,\u201d Drucker said. One scenario that\u2019s \u201cquite conceivable,\u201d he said, is that someone who has obesity and doesn\u2019t have frequent menstrual periods starts one of these medicines, loses weight over several months and finds that they\u2019re still not having regular periods \u2014 \u201conly now it might be because you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d On top of that, Mounjaro and Zepbound have a warning in their prescribing information that they may render birth control pills less effective. Drucker said this may be because the drugs work in part by slowing the rate at which food moves through the stomach. This can make people feel full for longer but also could interfere with absorption of other medicines, including birth control pills. Mounjaro and Zepbound warn about this explicitly on their labels, but Ozempic and Wegovy only warn more broadly about absorption of any drugs taken by mouth. Safety in pregnancy Even as GLP-1 medicines may increase fertility, little is known about their safety during pregnancy. The drugs\u2019 makers, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, excluded people who were pregnant or planned to become pregnant from their clinical trials, a common practice when testing new medicines. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no information available. \u201cThe more these meds are used, the more women will get pregnant while taking them, and we will in that way accumulate data on risk of early pregnancy exposure,\u201d Dushay explained. In other words, \u201cwe basically gather data from \u2018accidents\u2019 as we do for most drugs.\u201d The few studies available about babies whose mothers took GLP-1s early in pregnancy haven\u2019t turned up major causes for concern, although researchers note that more study is needed \u2014 and it\u2019s underway. Novo Nordisk has a registry where it\u2019s collecting data about the safety of Wegovy during pregnancy. A company spokesperson says the findings will be disclosed at the end of the study. An entry on a government database on clinical trials notes that the study plans to enroll more than 1,100 participants and is expected to be completed by the summer of 2027. An Eli Lilly spokesperson said the company also plans to open a pregnancy registry for Zepbound, which was approved at the end of last year. Studies in animals, though, have suggested some cause for caution, Drucker said. \u201cIf animals get high doses of these drugs, very often, the babies that are born to the mice and rats are small, and sometimes, they have some malformations,\u201d he noted. That\u2019s probably because the drugs also work by reducing appetite. \u201cIf you restrict energy intake in a pregnant animal, then the baby\u2019s not going to get enough nutrients and won\u2019t be able to grow properly,\u201d Drucker said. He also pointed to a study in animals suggesting that GLP-1 drugs may reduce the number of proteins that are responsible for transferring nutrients from the mother to the fetus, often found in the placenta. Already in use for PCOS Those concerns complicate research on the medicines for infertility, but some work is ongoing on one of the most common causes: PCOS. The condition affects as many as 12% of women of reproductive age in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it\u2019s associated with excess weight, which is thought to contribute to the body\u2019s production of too much insulin. That, in turn, results in hormonal imbalances \u2014 specifically, higher levels of hormones like testosterone, which can stop ovulation and cause irregular periods, acne and excess facial hair, according to the CDC. Although there\u2019s no cure, weight loss alone can lead to significant improvement of symptoms and resumption of regular ovulation and menstruation, said Dr. Anuja Dokras, director of the PCOS clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. Lifestyle changes are the first-line treatment for PCOS, but if those interventions aren\u2019t successful, doctors may prescribe Ozempic or other GLP-1 agonist medications, Dokras said. The 2023 international PCOS guidelines list GLP-1 agonists among the medications for \u201cmanagement of higher weight in adults with PCOS.\u201d GLP-1 agonists improve insulin resistance and lead to weight loss, so it makes sense that they also improve PCOS symptoms, added Dr. Melanie Cree, director of the multidisciplinary PCOS Clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. \u201cIt is completely being used now with no evidence because the [obstetrics] field knows that if you have 5% weight loss in these individuals with PCOS, you will improve fertility,\u201d she said. Cree noted that studies have shown that liraglutide, an earlier GLP-1 drug sold as Victoza for type 2 diabetes and Saxenda for weight loss, is effective at reducing body weight and testosterone levels in women with PCOS and obesity. Cree also just wrapped up a clinical trial investigating the use of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, for PCOS treatment in adolescent girls. The preliminary findings, which have not been published, showed that both semaglutide and a low-sugar diet resulted in more frequent periods, lower testosterone levels and weight loss \u2014 and the weight loss was much more pronounced in the group taking semaglutide. Regardless of the method, the study found, people who lost more weight had greater decreases in testosterone levels. Cree is now running a larger and longer clinical trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health, that will look specifically at fertility outcomes for young women with PCOS who take semaglutide. And while the drugs\u2019 makers aren\u2019t currently running trials in PCOS \u2014 which Cree attributes in part to the fact that PCOS overlaps so much with obesity that it wouldn\u2019t dramatically expand the market for the medicines \u2014 approval for the condition, she pointed out, could have an important effect on insurance coverage, which is challenging for many people using them for weight loss. \u201cFor example, Colorado mandates fertility coverage, so if it was approved as a fertility medication, then it would be covered for that indication,\u201d she said. Separately, Cree pointed to another question about the medicines during pregnancy: the potential for quick weight regain that can happen when patients stop them suddenly. \u201cIf that\u2019s happening in the setting of pregnancy, when you\u2019re gaining all this weight,\u00a0what happens?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does that mean? And we just don\u2019t know.\u201d A \u2018Catch-22\u2019 The drugs\u2019 makers are also following the \u201cOzempic babies\u201d phenomenon. Eli Lilly\u2019s chief of research, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, says the company has heard these kinds of stories from patients. \u201cOne question we\u2019re asking is: is it possible that as we reduce fat, we improve fertility, decrease PCOS and other barriers to fertility?\u201d Skovronsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like heart failure or sleep apnea,\u201d he said, referring to conditions for which GLP-1 drugs have recently shown positive results. \u201cJust another potential benefit of weight loss from this class of medications that we haven\u2019t tested yet.\u201d He also underlined how tricky it is to run studies around fertility of medicines whose safety in pregnancy is unknown; Cree referred to a requirement for birth control in studies of GLP-1 drugs as a \u201cCatch-22\u201d for fertility indications. \u201cRight now, unfortunately, it\u2019s really hard to study the effects of these drugs on fertility, because that implies exposing women to a drug with a high risk that they\u2019ll have a pregnancy during exposure to the drug and the risks to the baby haven\u2019t been fully analyzed yet,\u201d Skovronsky said. Bentley, who got pregnant while taking Mounjaro, said she stopped taking the medicine as soon as she found out she was pregnant. But she said she continued to worry about the effect of the drug on her baby. \u201cI worried up until the day I had her,\u201d she said. Her daughter, Ivy, was born healthy on her due date, weighing 7 pounds and 7 ounces. Bentley started taking Mounjaro again six weeks after Ivy was born.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ozempic-babies-pregnancy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_health_ozempic-glp-1-survey-kff", "text": "About 1 in 8 adults in the United States has used a GLP-1 drug like Ozempic or Mounjaro at some point in their life, and half of them \u2013 about 6% of adults, or more than 15 million people \u2013 are currently using a prescription, according to new survey data from KFF. The US Food and Drug Administration has reported shortages of the GLP-1 medications Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro at various dosages over the past year as drugmakers have raced to keep up with skyrocketing demand. Last week, Novo Nordisk said that at least 25,000 people in the US are starting its drug Wegovy each week \u2013 five times more than were able to start the medicine each week in December. According to the new survey, most adults who have used these drugs have done so to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. More than 40% of respondents who have diabetes and about a quarter of those who have heart disease said they have used GLP-1 drugs. But about 2 in 5 adults used GLP-1 drugs solely to lose weight, the KFF poll found. Neither Ozempic nor Mounjaro is approved for weight loss specifically; the FDA greenlit them to treat type 2 diabetes in 2017 and 2022, respectively. But doctors commonly use them off-label for weight loss. Wegovy, which was approved in 2021 for obesity, contains the same key ingredient as Ozempic, called semaglutide, while Mounjaro uses a slightly different one, tirzepatide. Overall, adults ages 50 to 64 were most likely to have used GLP-1 drugs, but younger adults were more likely to use them solely for weight loss, according to the KFF survey. Medicare prohibits the coverage of prescription weight-loss drugs, and only 1% of seniors said that they have used a GLP-1 drug solely for weight loss, according to the KFF survey. But most adults \u2013 more than 60% \u2013 say that Medicare policy should be changed to include coverage for these drugs when prescribed for weight loss. Still, regardless of insurance coverage, most adults who have used GLP-1 drugs said it was difficult to afford them, the KFF poll found. A month\u2019s supply of GLP-1 drugs can cost about $1,000, and last month, Sen. Bernie Sanders launched an investigation into the \u201coutrageously high prices\u201d that manufacturers charge. Amid high costs and limited supply, some adults may seek alternatives to the highly sought-after drugs. Last year, the FDA warned against compounded versions of semaglutide that combine, mix or alter ingredients in ways that are not regulated or approved. \u201cPatients should only obtain drugs containing semaglutide with a prescription from a licensed health care provider, and only obtain medicines from state-licensed pharmacies or outsourcing facilities registered with FDA,\u201d the agency said, citing reports of adverse events in people who used compounded semaglutide. The vast majority of adults who have used GLP-1 drugs \u2013 about 80% \u2013 said they got the drugs or a prescription from a primary care doctor or a specialist, according to the KFF survey. But about 11% said they got them from an online provider or website, and 10% said they got them from a medical spa or aesthetic medical center. The KFF survey findings are based on responses that were collected from a nationally representative sample of nearly 1,500 adults during the last week of April.

{"id": "2024_05_07_health_black-women-cancer-rates-study", "text": "The American Cancer Society said Tuesday that it is seeking participants for what may be the largest national study of its kind, one that aims to solve the mystery of why Black women have the lowest survival rate of any racial or ethnic group in the US for most cancers. Thanks to new medicines and better detection, cancer deaths in the United States have been declining since a peak in 1991, but Black women have the highest death rate for most cancers, according to the society. The racial differences are especially stark with certain types of cancer, research shows. For example, Black and White women are equally likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, but Black women are almost 40% more likely to die from it. Black women are also twice as likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer as White women and 2.3 times more likely to die from it. Yet Black women have historically been excluded from most clinical research that has focused mostly on White men. The Voices of Black Women study hopes to recruit at least 100,000 Black women from 20 states and the District of Columbia to follow for 30 years. The study is concentrating on these areas because they\u2019re where 90% of US Black women between the ages of 25 and 55 live. Twice a year, the study will ask participants about lifestyle factors, medical history and experience of racism to determine what might affect someone\u2019s risk of cancer and dying from cancer. To be eligible, participants must identify as Black and women, be between the ages of 25 and 55, and not have a history of cancer, with the exception of basal or squamous cell skin cancer. More information on joining the study is available on the society\u2019s website. As the American Cancer Society team constructed the study, it said, it was mindful of the long history of \u201cmistreatment and abuse\u201d of Black women\u2019s bodies used to benefit science, \u201cyet Black women have received the fewest benefits compared to their male and White counterparts.\u201d \u201cIt is important that we hear and address your concerns about research, treat you with respect and demonstrate cultural humility,\u201d the organization says. Past population studies from the American Cancer Society have helped transform scientists\u2019 understanding of cancer. It\u2019s largely because of an American Cancer Society study that scientists understand the link between smoking and lung cancer, for example. The organization hopes to see a similar breakthrough with this newest research. \u201cVoices of Black Women represents a crucial step toward achieving health equity in a population that is long overdue,\u201d said Dr. Alpa Patel, co-principal investigator of the study and the senior vice president of population science at the American Cancer Society, in a statement. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve uncovered through previous population studies has been critical in reducing the unacceptably high burden of cancer, but the reduction has sadly not been equal.

{"id": "2024_04_29_health_genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Even if your genetics put you at greater risk for early death, a healthy lifestyle could help you significantly combat it, according to a new study. That risk could be mitigated by about 62% in people with a genetic predisposition, said lead author Dr. Xifeng Wu, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejiang Univeristy School of Medicine in China. Many studies have shown the connection between a healthy lifestyle and longevity and others have underscored the genetic component in lifespan, but the report published Monday in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine explored how the two come together. With data from more than 350,000 people and information on their genetics, education, socioeconomic status and disease history, this study had strong methodology, said Dr. Aladdin Shadyab, associate professor of public health and medicine at University of California San Diego. He was not involved in the research. The sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added. The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan. Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed. And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Wu, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University. Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed. \u201cAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,\u201d Wu said. The factors that made a difference The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan. But researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death. \u201cThe study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors \u2014 no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet \u2014 that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,\u201d Wu said. Adequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults. Moderate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Making lifestyle changes Building a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there. There are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking. A CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Committing to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of \u201cMindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,\u201d said in a previous CNN article. For a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly. When it comes to catching enough z\u2019s, if you can\u2019t seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you can\u2019t sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics. And if you\u2019ve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

But there\u2019s another part of the anatomy that\u2019s often overlooked: the feet. Feet are wired up to nerve fiber tracts from the brain so you can stand, balance and wiggle your toes. They\u2019re also plumbed by blood vessels, which lead all the way from the heart. The appearance and function of our feet then can indicate viral infections, diseases of the cardiovascular system and even neurological disorders. Here are a couple of examples.

Measles\u00a0usually starts off on the face, or in the mouth, as little spots that look like grains of sugar.\u00a0Pityriasis versicolor, a type of fungal infection, tends to begin and stay on the torso. The reasons why they tend to affect these areas is not well understood. Hand, foot and mouth disease, or HFM,\u00a0begins in exactly these areas. It\u2019s caused by a virus known as\u00a0coxsackie and tends to produce raised pink-red spots that can blister and weep. The name is a bit of a misnomer \u2014 the rash can also affect the legs and buttocks, too. Noticing a new rash on the feet should prompt a doctor to consider HFM. HFM is a common childhood illness that\u2019s very contagious. Thankfully, it\u2019s also usually short-lived, clearing without treatment after a few days. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with\u00a0foot and mouth\u00a0\u2014 or better, hoof and mouth, however. Foot and mouth is a different virus from HFM that (mainly) affects cloven-hoofed animals, such as cows and sheep. It\u2019s the disease that resulted in a\u00a0UK epidemic in 2001. READ MORE:\u00a0How much time should you spend sitting versus standing? New research reveals the optimal mix Heart, vessels and feet Our circulatory system supplies blood to every part of the body \u2014 from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes. By the time blood vessels reach these extremities, like twigs from a tree, they have branched and got much smaller in size. At some point, we\u2019ve all experienced the discomfort of icy cold feet, especially when going barefoot around the house or during chillier days. It\u2019s normal for feet to feel cool to the touch, but they should not change color from their usual skin color to blue \u2014 nor should they ever get painfully cold. Severe symptoms of discoloration and pain can point toward a phenomenon called\u00a0blue toe syndrome. It can be triggered by tiny little masses called microemboli, made up of blobs of cholesterol. These emboli pass easily through large vessels but will struggle as they become smaller. On reaching the smaller vessels of the feet, they finally become stuck, cutting off the blood supply. The tissues then become starved of oxygen, causing the feet to change color and become painful. In serious cases, blue toe syndrome can lead to tissue death, breakdown and the formation of gangrene, which may require\u00a0amputation\u00a0of toes \u2014 or even the whole foot. This rare condition is sometimes called\u00a0\u201ctrash foot,\u201d because of the way in which the feet become so discolored. What\u2019s the underlying cause of these tiny cholesterol fragments? Most likely aneurysms and atherosclerosis \u2014 vessels that have ballooned or hardened upstream of the feet. When trash foot does occur, it is often following surgical treatment for these conditions, such as\u00a0aortic aneurysm repair. The procedures disrupt the vessel, which can cause emboli to break off. As well as trash foot, there are other signs in the feet that can point toward cardiovascular disease.\u00a0Raised red swellings\u00a0appearing on the feet (as well as the hands) can indicate an infection of the heart called\u00a0bacterial endocarditis. These can be painless \u2014 in which case we call them Janeway lesions \u2014 or sore, which are called Osler\u2019s nodes. READ MORE:\u00a0Are your feet beach ready?

After finding the upgoing plantar, the doctor may then have creased their brow with worry \u2014 and for good reason. The Babinski sign is a simple test that involves stroking the sole of the foot with a blunt-ended instrument to check the response of the toes. This is the\u00a0plantar reflex\u00a0\u2014 plantar relating to the sole of the foot. Normally, when this reflex is triggered, the toes should curl under or flex downward toward the sole. It the big toe points upward, and the smaller toes fan out, this is an \u201cupgoing plantar\u201d response \u2014 also known as the\u00a0Babinski sign, named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski who first described it. It is\u00a0normal to find this response in babies, whose nervous systems are undergoing development and not capable of all the motor functions of an adult. In\u00a0adults, however, finding the Babinski sign is an altogether different story. Most commonly, it signifies that a stroke is disrupting the normal brain circuitry that controls the feet. Other causes\u00a0include multiple sclerosis and (rarely) drug intoxication. In some otherwise healthy people though, the Babinski sign can be observed during deep sleep. The scope is much wider than just these conditions. Diabetes, kidney failure and even thyroid disorders can affect the feet.

{"id": "2024_05_08_health_cdc-dog-import-rules", "text": "The United States has new rules for how dogs are brought into the country, and they go into effect in August. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that it is updating regulations for bringing dogs into the United States in an effort to keep the country free of canine rabies. Starting August 1, the tightened rules require that all dogs entering the US appear healthy upon arrival, be at least 6 months old, be microchipped and be accompanied by a \u201cCDC Dog Import Form\u201d receipt that was filled out online two to 10 days before arrival. These rules apply to all dogs, including service dogs and those who were born in the United States but are returning from another country. The \u201cCDC Dog Import\u201d permits that are currently used will expire August 31, according to the CDC. The announcement noted that more requirements may apply based on where the dog has traveled in the previous six months or where they had been vaccinated. The CDC website offers travel checklists for US-vaccinated dogs and foreign-vaccinated dogs from high-risk countries. Dog rabies was eliminated in the United States in 2007, but the virus remains endemic in more than 100 countries, according to the CDC, and unvaccinated dogs can still contract the disease from wildlife. In the US, rabies is mostly found in wild animals such as bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes. But in certain areas around the world, including parts of Asia, Africa and Central and South America, rabies in dogs remains a major issue. \u201cFor dogs arriving from countries with a high risk of dog rabies, they must be protected against rabies,\u201d the CDC announcement says. Other requirements may include that titers from blood serology tests be drawn before US entry. These lab tests can check for antibodies in a dog\u2019s blood after the dog is vaccinated against rabies. Rabies titers are good for the life of the dog, as long as the animal stays up to date on rabies booster shots, according to the CDC. \u201cIf your dog\u2019s rabies vaccination expires before you get your dog a booster vaccine, your dog must have another titer drawn at least 30 days after booster vaccination to be eligible for importation.\u00a0CDC recommends you always keep your dog\u2019s rabies vaccination current,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s website. If the dog does not have titer results upon arrival, they must be quarantined at an animal care facility for 28 days or until titer results are submitted for review, according to the CDC. \u201cCDC encourages people traveling with their dogs to use CDC\u2019s new personalized question-and-answer tool, \u2018DogBot,\u2019 on the CDC website to determine what rules apply to their dogs based on their travel dates, where their dog is traveling from, and where their dog was vaccinated,\u201d the announcement says. \u201cPeople should plan in advance for future travel to ensure requirements for dog importations will be met at the time their dogs will enter the United States.\u201d Jennifer Skiff, director of international at the animal advocacy group Animal Wellness Action, called the new rules an overreach. \u201cRabies vaccinations, health certificates and of course microchips make sense,\u201d Skiff said. \u201cBut the CDC is mandating serology titers,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cOne of many problems with that, other than being an excessive and costly requirement, is that the agency is requiring they be done in a CDC-approved laboratory, and not all countries have CDC-approved laboratories.\u201d The American Veterinary Medical Association has said it supports the CDC\u2019s new regulations. \u201cThe\u00a0AVMA\u00a0continues to support the CDC\u2019s efforts to improve dog importation standards and is pleased to see the implementation of this new rule that will help protect public health and positively impact canine health and welfare,\u201d President Dr. Rena Carlson said in an emailed statement Wednesday. These updates \u201caim to protect the public\u2019s health by preventing the reintroduction of dog rabies into the United States,\u201d CDC spokesperson David Daigle said when the rules were proposed last year. \u201cThese updates would establish an importation system designed to reduce fraud and improve the U.S. government\u2019s ability to verify that imported dogs have met U.S. entry requirements.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/cdc-dog-import-rules/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

Rick Slayman received the kidney at Massachusetts General in March after he had been diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year. The hospital emphasized there is no indication his death was a result of the transplant. After undergoing the four-hour surgery at the recommendation of his doctors, Slayman, a manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, was discharged from the hospital\u00a0in April. After the surgery, doctors said they believed the new kidney could last years, but acknowledged there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. \u201cMr. Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation,\u201d Massachusetts General said in a statement. \u201cWe offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Slayman\u2019s family and loved ones as they remember an extraordinary person whose generosity and kindness touched all who knew him.\u201d Slayman\u2019s family described him as a kind man who was fiercely dedicated to the people in his life. \u201cOur family is deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick but take great comfort knowing he inspired so many,\u201d a family statement said. \u201cMillions of people worldwide have come to know Rick\u2019s story. We felt \u2013 and still feel \u2013 comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant.\u201d Slayman had been a patient in the hospital\u2019s transplant program for 11 years, he previously said in a statement. He received a kidney from a human donor in 2018, after living with diabetes and high blood pressure for many years. The kidney began to show signs of failure five years later, and he resumed dialysis in 2023. \u201cI saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,\u201d Slayman wrote in the statement. Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, director of the Legorreta Center for Clinical Transplant Tolerance, performed the groundbreaking operation in March to a round of applause in the operating room. The need for organs far exceeds the number available in the US. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are more than 100,000 people currently waiting for an organ donation. Experts have long been researching how to safely and successfully transplant animal organs into people, which they say could help solve the organ shortage. Before Slayman\u2019s transplant, just two transplants using pig organs had been completed \u2013\u00a0both heart transplants performed under compassionate use. Both patients died weeks after receiving the hearts. EGenesis, the biotech company providing the genetically edited pig kidney, called Slayman \u201ca true pioneer\u201d in a statement late Saturday night. \u201cWe are profoundly grateful to Mr. Slayman and his family and we will honor his legacy and invaluable contribution to science and medicine by continuing our efforts to advance xenotransplantation for the millions of patients globally in need of lifesaving organs,\u201d the company added. Slayman\u2019s family also thanked his care team at across Massachusetts General in a statement. \u201cAfter his transplant, Rick said that one of the reasons he underwent this procedure was to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive.

{"id": "2024_05_08_world_boeing-starliner-new-launch-date-scn", "text": "The long-awaited first crewed mission of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft will be delayed for more than a week after engineers identified an issue that halted launch preparations on Monday. Starliner\u2019s next opportunity to lift off on its maiden voyage from NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida is at 6:16 p.m. ET on May 17. Veteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore had already taken their seats aboard the Starliner capsule when the operations team called for a scrub Monday night about two hours before launch. The decision came after the United Launch Alliance team, which assembled the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space, identified an issue with a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the rocket. Occasionally, valves can get into a position where they start to \u201cbuzz\u201d by oscillating, or opening and closing rapidly, said Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance. Some buzzing is OK, but too much could cause the valve to fail, Bruno added. After safely removing Williams and Wilmore from the Starliner capsule Monday night, the United Launch Alliance team experimented with opening and closing the source of the buzz, a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank of the rocket\u2019s upper stage. More oscillations occurred during the process to remove fuel from the rocket. The team conducted a thorough review of the valve on Tuesday. \u201cAfter evaluating the valve history, data signatures from the launch attempt, and assessing the risks relative to continued use, the ULA team determined the valve exceeded its qualification and mission managers agreed to remove and replace the valve,\u201d according to an update NASA shared. The decision to replace the valve means that the rocket will need to be rolled back from the launchpad on Wednesday and into the Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. While replacing the valve, the team will also conduct leak checks and other functional checkouts to ensure the rocket is ready for a potential May 17 launch attempt. Meanwhile, Wilmore and Williams will stay in crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center and remain in quarantine before the launch to protect their health. Why this launch is so important Before the valve issue arose, Starliner \u2014 which Boeing designed to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule \u2014 was set to take off for its inaugural crewed test run at 10:34 p.m. ET Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The Starliner would join SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon in NASA\u2019s push to collaborate with private industry partners, expanding US options for ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station. Williams and Wilmore have each ventured to space on two previous journeys aboard the NASA space shuttle and Russian Soyuz missions. \u201cThey\u2019re checking out a lot of the systems: the life support, the manual control,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during a Friday news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s why we put two test pilots on board \u2014 and of course the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of Butch and Suni are extensive.\u201d The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, Nelson noted: \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner.\u201d Williams will also become the first woman to join such a mission. What to expect If all goes according to plan following the launch, the spacecraft \u2014 carrying the astronauts \u2014 will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit and begin firing its own engines. The Starliner will then spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week aboard the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The two will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/world/boeing-starliner-new-launch-date-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_health_alzheimers-apoe4-gene-risk", "text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease may be inherited more often than previously known, according to a new study that paints a clearer picture of a gene long known to be linked to the common form of dementia. The authors of the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, say that this might even be considered a distinct, inherited form of the disease and that different approaches to testing and treatment may be needed. Among people diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, researchers recognize\u00a0familial forms of the disease and sporadic cases. Most cases are thought to be sporadic, which develop later in life. Familial forms, caused by mutations in any of three genes, tend to strike earlier\u00a0and are known to be rare, accounting for about 2% of all Alzheimer\u2019s diagnoses, or about 1 in 50 cases. Under the new paradigm, 1 in 6 cases of Alzheimer\u2019s would be considered to be inherited, or familial. This shifting appreciation of inherited risk, researchers say, is due to a better understanding of the role of a fourth gene that carries the blueprints to make a lipid-carrying protein called apolipoprotein E, known as APOE.\u00a0APOE ferries cholesterol throughout the body and brain and is thought to play a role in depositing or sweeping away sticky beta amyloid plaques, which are one hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s. There are three types of the APOE gene a person can carry.\u00a0One called APOE2 is thought to be protective against the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. APOE3 is thought to confer a neutral risk of the disease. APOE4, on the other hand, is bad news.\u00a0It has long been recognized that people with at least one copy of the APOE4 gene have an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, while people with two copies had a higher risk still. Now, researchers say APOE4 shouldn\u2019t just be recognized as a risk factor, it should be viewed as an inherited form of the disease, virtually assuring that a person who has two copies will get the biological changes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in their brains. Teasing out gene\u2019s role in Alzheimer\u2019s In the new study, researchers from Spain and the United States compared people in clinical studies who had two copies of the APOE4 gene with people who had other forms of the APOE gene. They also compared people with two copies of APOE4 to people with other inherited forms of the disease: early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer\u2019s disease (ADAD) and Down syndrome-associated Alzheimer\u2019s disease (DSAD).\u00a0The study included data from nearly 3,300 brains that are stored at the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center and data from another 10,000 people who were participants in five clinical trials. Not only were people with two copies of the APOE4 gene much more likely to develop the biological changes that lead to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, similar to people with the other genetic forms of the disease, they were almost assured the diagnosis:\u00a0Nearly 95% of the people in the studies with two copies of the APOE4 gene had the biology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by the time they were 82 years old. The study authors say that while APOE4 reliably causes the biological changes associated with the disease \u2014\u00a0the creation of beta amyloid plaques in the brain \u2014 having one or two copies of this gene doesn\u2019t always lead to cognitive decline. Rarely, people can have APOE4 and have a lot of beta amyloid in their brain but not have symptoms, perhaps because of other genetic or environmental factors that protect their brains at the same time.\u00a0In the large dataset of nearly 3,300 brains kept by the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center, for example, 273 individuals had two copies of the APOE4 gene, and 240, or 88%, had dementia. When people with two copies of APOE4 do have symptoms, they tend to get them earlier than others.\u00a0On average, they developed Alzheimer\u2019s about 10 years earlier \u2014\u00a0around age 65 \u2014 than people with other forms of the APOE gene.\u00a0Researchers also found that the buildup of beta amyloid and tau in their brains followed almost the same trajectory as has been noted in people with other inherited forms of the disease. Their disease was more severe earlier in life. In all the inherited forms of the disease, \u201cthere are striking, striking similarities in the way the disease progresses and the symptoms it gets,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Juan Fortea, a neurologist and director of the Memory Unit of the Neurology Department at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, in a news briefing. Fortea and his co-authors argue that for these reasons, having two copies of the APOE4 gene should be considered a genetic form of the disease, not merely a risk for it. Dr. Charles Bernick, associate medical director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, said the study showed how powerful it is to have two copies of the APOE4 gene. \u201cIt really drives a disease process,\u201d said Bernick, who was not involved in the study. Shifting understanding of genetic risks The strength of APOE4\u2019s role in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s wasn\u2019t recognized earlier, the researchers think, because APOE4 also plays an important role in heart health, and they think many people with two copies of the gene probably died from cardiovascular causes before they developed Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous studies had estimated that 30% to 35% of people with two copies of the APOE4 gene would develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Researchers say they also found a gene-dose effect.\u00a0While having two copies of APOE4 assured that a person would see beta amyloid and tau build up in their brains, having just one copy of the gene also increased a person\u2019s risk \u2013 but not as much as two copies of that gene. That would mean the APOE4 gene is semi-dominant, Fortea said.\u00a0Other diseases in which genes show semi-dominance include sickle cell anemia and hypercholesterolemia. In sickle cell, for example, two copies of the gene cause sickle cell disease, but one copy causes sickle cell trait.\u00a0People with sickle cell trait don\u2019t usually have symptoms, but they may be more likely to have heat stroke or muscle breakdown during strenuous exercise, and they can experience pain crises under certain conditions. Classifying APOE4 as an inherited form of the disease has some big implications. First, it would mean that a far greater proportion of Alzheimer\u2019s cases are caused by genes than has been previously understood. Before APOE4, the only gene changes recognized to cause Alzheimer\u2019s were associated with early-onset forms of the disease and with Down\u2019s syndrome.\u00a0They accounted for about 2% of Alzheimer\u2019s cases,\u00a0about 1 in 50. People with two copies of the APOE4 gene make up about 15% of people who are diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, or 1 in 7 cases of the disease. About 2% of the general population carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, which would make it one of the most prevalent inherited diseases. The important takeaway from the study, said Dr. Constantine Lyketsos, director of the memory and Alzheimer\u2019s treatment center at Johns Hopkins, is that Alzheimer\u2019s disease shouldn\u2019t be treated as a monolith. Rather, it shows that there are different forms of the disease that need personalized treatment. \u201cThe point is, we need to start doing precision medicine and breaking it down. Start with genetics,\u201d said Lyketsos, who was not involved in the study. Gene testing isn\u2019t recommended It is also likely to change how people who carry the APOE4 gene are diagnosed and treated. There are tests available to determine a person\u2019s APOE4 status, but they\u2019re not recommended as a routine part of diagnosis. That may need to change, the study authors said. \u201cThe consensus and the guidelines now do not recommend testing for APOE4 and that was because the consensus was that it did not help for the diagnosis,\u201d Fortea said. APOE testing is recommended for patients who are being evaluated to take new amyloid-clearing medications, such as lecanemab. Because Alzheimer\u2019s patients with two copies of the APOE4 gene are at higher risk of serious side effects like brain swelling from these amyloid-clearing medications, some treatment centers have decided not to offer them the drugs, said study author Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the center for Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cI find this very problematic, given these data,\u201d she said, noting that it would be important to do research to see whether it might be possible to find safer dosing or safer treatments for this patient group. \u201cFor me, this just means we need to treat them earlier,\u201d Sperling said, \u201cand this research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early, at a younger age, and at an early stage of pathology because we know they are very, very likely to progress to impairment quickly.\u201d Dr. Sterling Johnson, a study author who leads the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer\u2019s Prevention at the University of Wisconsin, said it would be very important for clinical trials to start to take participants\u2019 APOE4 status into account. \u201cWe may need to start treating these as a separate group in our research papers so that we can really understand the relationship between amyloid and tau and symptoms\u201d in people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, in a way that we kind of have not been able to before, Johnson said in the news briefing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/alzheimers-apoe4-gene-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_health_gene-editing-blindness-study-scn", "text": "For her entire life, college student Olivia Cook had only a small degree of central vision. It was as if she was watching the world through a straw hole, and in dimly lit places, she could not make out people\u2019s faces, only their silhouettes. But after receiving an experimental gene-editing treatment to one of her eyes, she now can see things she never saw before. Cook was born with an inherited retinal disorder that causes blindness, a rare type of eye disorder historically called Leber congenital amaurosis or LCA. A few years ago, she decided to participate in a clinical trial that involved using the gene-editing tool CRISPR to correct the form of inherited blindness that she has. \u201cMy life has mostly changed in terms of being hopeful that there is going to be more science and findings in the future,\u201d said Cook, 22, who is currently studying marketing and product development at Missouri State University in Springfield. She received the experimental gene-editing treatment through a surgery performed on her left eye. \u201cNow, post-surgery and post recovery, I am able to see in dimmer lighting with my left eye,\u201d Cook said. A treatment that used CRISPR was found to be safe and efficacious in improving vision among a small sample of patients with inherited blindness in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial that Cook participated in. Inherited retinal degenerations are a leading cause of blindness around the world. Among a total of 14 volunteers, including Cook, the gene-editing tool was found to be associated with a \u201cmeaningful improvement\u201d in vision for most patients around three months later and it was not directly tied to any serious side effects, according to the trial results, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The therapy remains experimental and the results need to be replicated in a larger group of people. Months following the treatment, Cook was sitting with friends on a balcony that had Christmas lights wrapped around the railing. It was dusk, she recalled, yet she could see her friends\u2019 faces glow under the twinkling Christmas lights. She was shocked. \u201cWith my right eye, I was not able to see their facial features. I was only able to see their silhouette. With my left eye, I could see everything on their face \u2013 so, significant difference, especially in the dim lighting,\u201d Cook said about that evening. \u201cOne of the biggest \u2018aha moments\u2019 that I had was I had been talking to my mom one day after the surgery \u2013 it was about six to nine months after the surgery when I noticed most of my improvement,\u201d Cook said. \u201cI could see a candle flickering behind me, which I\u2019ve never seen that before,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d never picked up anything from over there before with the peripheral.\u201d Before the treatment, Cook said that she sometimes could conceal the vision challenges she has had.\u00a0Her limited vision often was an internal struggle. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really know that my eyesight is terrible until you spend a significant amount of time with me,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIf we saw each other in the street, if I introduced myself to you, you\u2019d never know.\u201d But now, she is no longer hiding. A groundbreaking \u2018proof of concept\u2019 This study is the first time that CRISPR has been used in the eyes of living people. \u201cThe results of this study provide proof of concept that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used safely and effectively to treat inherited retinal disorders,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author Dr. Eric Pierce, director of the Ocular Genomics Institute at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School. The trial was funded by the biotechnology company Editas Medicine and conducted in the United States by researchers at Mass Eye and Ear of the Mass General Brigham health care system and other US-based institutions, including the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, the University of Miami, and Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cWe\u2019re really hopeful that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies will now be applied to other genetic forms of inherited blindness, and indeed other genetic diseases in general,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this will help open the era of therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.\u201d The trial, which started in 2019, enrolled 12 adults, ages 17 to 63, and two children, ages 9 and 14, with inherited retinal degeneration caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. That gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many types of cells, including light receptor cells in the eyes. Mutations in CEP290 are the most common cause of severe early-onset retinal degeneration, which causes vision loss in children. Currently, there is no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration. These patients would not be able to read any lines of letters or numbers on a vision chart that most people receive at the eye doctor, and visual impairment may worsen over time. For the trial, the 14 participants underwent a surgical procedure in which a drug called EDIT-101 that encodes the CRISPR gene-editing components was injected under the retina of one of their eyes. Since the trial was conducted to primarily evaluate safety and efficacy, only one eye in each patient was studied. \u201cThe subjects get an injection of the gene-editing drug, which is called EDIT-101, under their retina,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThat drug encodes the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery, and once that starts working inside the retinal cells of those patients, it cuts out the mutation in CEP290 from the genome of their retinal cells, allowing the function of the CEP290 gene to be restored.\u201d When the first patients in the study were treated in 2020, it was the first time in medical history that a CRISPR-based medicine, resulting in gene-editing, was inserted directly into the living human body. Among the adult volunteers, two were given a low dose of the medication, five were given an intermediate dose and five were given a high dose. Both of the children in the study were given the intermediate dose. The outpatient procedure took around an hour and a half. The patients were then monitored every three months for a year and then less frequent monitoring continued for two years. In these follow-up visits, they underwent a series of vision tests among other evaluations. The researchers found that 11 patients in the study had some type of improvement in their vision following the CRISPR therapy, and these improvements occurred about three months after the procedure and were sustained during subsequent visits. Also, no serious side effects occurred in response to the treatment at any of the dose sizes, according to the researchers, and the adverse events that did occur were mild or moderate. There were also no signs that the CRISPR gene-editing caused ripple-effect harm to the genomes of the patients. \u201cThe primary goal of this first in-human study was to test the safety of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in vivo. When we started the trials, the subjects who were treated were the first patients ever to have received CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing treatments in vivo,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThere were no serious adverse events related to the treatment, or the surgery required to deliver the treatment and no dose-limiting toxicities.\u201d Following the surgery, one patient experienced some bleeding in the eye, impairing their vision, but that has since resolved, according to the researchers. \u201cOnce that hemorrhage cleared, the subject\u2019s vision returned to baseline,\u201d Pierce said. Another patient experienced vision impairment associated with small mounds observed under their retina six months after the procedure. These types of hyperreflective mounds have been seen in other studies involving subretinal gene therapies, the researchers noted, and the cause of them is not clear. \u201cIt\u2019s thought to be inflammation,\u201d Pierce said about the mounds. The patient was treated with a course of steroid medicines, according to the study, and their recovery is ongoing. \u201cAs the mounds resolved their vision also improved,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI think this drug was as safe as possible in terms of design.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s not a panacea\u2019 Complete vision has not been restored among the patients. Most in the trial could not read any line of an eye chart prior to the study, and only four of them experienced some improvements in this ability. But some patients reported, after receiving treatment, being able to see their cell phones light up, differentiate various foods on their dinner plates, identify the spinning Apple icon on a computer screen or even noticing vibrant sunsets. \u201cI started to see what are described as bursts of color,\u201d said Michael Kalberer, 46, who received the CRISPR treatment in his right eye and first noticed improvements in his vision about two to six months later. He started the study in 2020. \u201cIt was a pretty cool moment to see strobe lights on the dance floor of my cousin\u2019s wedding change color,\u201d said Kalberer, who added that if he had not received the treatment, all he would have seen on the dance floor would have been shadows and flickering lights, and he would not have been able to identify the colors. Kalberer described the CRISPR treatment as \u201cgroundbreaking,\u201d but warned it\u2019s not a cure. \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea,\u201d said Kalberer, who still can\u2019t see standard text or photos on a screen. \u201cMy disease is still here. It\u2019s not gone. I\u2019m not cured. \u2026 But it definitely slowed the progression of it.\u201d Pierce said that he hopes this approach to using CRISPR as a therapy for inherited blindness can be studied again in a larger and more diverse group of patients. All of the Phase 1/2 trial participants were non-Hispanic and White. In 2022, Editas Medicine announced that it paused further studying CRISPR gene editing as a therapeutic approach for CEP290-associated inherited blindness and instead of conducting further trials, has continued to follow-up with the patients who have been treated to date. The latest results from the Phase 1/2 trial support moving forward with a Phase 3 trial and then ultimately registering the therapy for possible FDA approval, Pierce said. \u201cWe are working with Editas to identify an additional commercial partner for Phase 3 studies. We\u2019re actually hoping this publication will stimulate interest in the biotech and pharma communities about that,\u201d Pierce said. More research over time could shed light on the long-term effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools, which, now that they have been injected into patients, will be present in patients for the rest of their lives, Pierce said. \u201cI think the real risk that we\u2019re all concerned about with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is: Could the gene editing machinery that we\u2019ve introduced into the retinal cells of these patients do something else, somewhere else in the genome, in addition to the therapeutic activities that it was designed for?\u201d Pierce said. \u201cCould a cut in the genome be made 10 years from now, that could have an adverse effect over time? I think the answer to that is yes, it could. But we\u2019re hopeful that risk is very low,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need additional follow-up for.\u201d \u2018Quality of life matters\u2019 The results from the Phase 1/2 trial \u2014 and how patients experienced some improvements in vision \u2014 are a valuable reminder of how important quality of life can be for patients, said Art Caplan, a\u00a0professor of bioethics\u00a0and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine\u2019s Department of Population Health. \u201cUsually when we\u2019re doing gene therapies or other innovative interventions, we associate them with saving lives. This experiment is a huge reminder that quality of life matters. This is about vision,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cNo one\u2019s dying. No one\u2019s saved. But restoration of vision is an important achievement, and it\u2019s a reminder that quality of life has to be factored into what we decide to cover in terms of insurance, reimbursement and what we try to study.\u201d He agreed with the researchers that more safety data over time would be helpful. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really had these subjects that long with the intervention to guarantee long-term safety,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cFor these kinds of genetic interventions, you have to follow them over long periods of time \u2014 years \u2014 to make sure that other genes weren\u2019t impacted.\u201d These new Phase 1/2 trial results provide a \u201cbuilding block\u201d for scientists to work off of in the future when developing gene therapies to treat eye disorders, said Dr. Vlad Diaconita, a retinal surgeon and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was not involved in the trial. \u201cDoes this apply to the American population at large? Not right now,\u201d Diaconita said about the experimental treatment. \u201cIt does, however, apply to the thousands of kids born in future years that have this particular genetic subtype. So yes, an approval of this particular gene delivery could benefit people over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a proof of concept that seems to be moving us in the right direction.\u201d Diaconita\u2019s colleague Dr. Aliaa Abdelhakim called this proof-of-concept study \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d in the sense that it shows the treatment approach can be safe and result in some improvement for patients, but more research is needed\u00a0on a larger scale\u00a0to determine\u00a0what kind of patients will benefit in the long term, and how long those improvements may last. \u201cWe still have to wait a little longer to see if this pans out in the long-term,\u201d said Abdelhakim, an ophthalmologist-geneticist, retina specialist and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. She also was not involved in the trial. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if\u00a0improvements from this treatment\u00a0are going to be sustained. Is their vision going to\u00a0stay improved\u00a0throughout their lives?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe reason this is important is because this is the first time CRISPR has been used in this way, in the eye.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/gene-editing-blindness-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_tech_ai-communicating-with-dead", "text": "When Ana Schultz, a 25-year-old from Rock Falls, Illinois, misses her husband Kyle, who passed away in February 2023, she asks him for cooking advice. She loads up Snapchat My AI, the social media platform\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot, and messages Kyle the ingredients she has left in the fridge; he suggests what to make. Or rather, his likeness in the form of an AI avatar does. \u201cHe was the chef in the family, so I customized My AI to look like him and gave it Kyle\u2019s name,\u201d said Schultz, who lives with their two young children. \u201cNow when I need help with meal ideas, I just ask him. It\u2019s a silly little thing I use to help me feel like he\u2019s still with me in the kitchen.\u201d The Snapchat My AI feature \u2014 which is powered by the popular AI chatbot tool ChatGPT \u2014 typically offers recommendations, answers questions and \u201ctalks\u201d with users. But some users like Schultz are using this and other tools to recreate the likeness of, and communicate with, the dead. The concept isn\u2019t entirely new. People have wanted to reconnect with deceased loved ones for centuries, whether they\u2019ve visited mediums and spiritualists or leaned on services that preserve their memory. But what\u2019s new now is that AI can make those loved ones say or do things they never said or did in life, raising both ethical concerns and questions around whether this helps or hinders the grieving process. \u201cIt\u2019s a novelty that piggybacks on the AI hype, and people feel like there\u2019s money to be made,\u201d said Mark Sample, a professor of digital studies at Davidson College who routinely teaches a course called \u201cDeath in the Digital Age.\u201d \u201cAlthough companies offer related products, ChatGPT is making it easier for hobbyists to play around with the concept too, for better or worse.\u201d A DIY approach Generative AI tools, which use algorithms to create new content such as text, video, audio and code, can try to answer questions the way someone who died might, but the accuracy largely depends on what information is put into the AI to start with. A 49-year-old IT professional from Alabama who asked to remain anonymous so his experiment is not associated with the company he works for, said he cloned his father\u2019s voice using generative AI about two years after he died from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. He told CNN he came across an online service called ElevenLabs, which allows users to create a custom voice model from previously recorded audio. ElevenLabs made headlines recently when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s primary. The company told CNN in a statement at the time that it is \u201cdedicated to preventing the misuse of audio AI tools\u201d and takes appropriate action in response to reports by authorities but declined to comment on the specific Biden deepfake call. In the Alabama man\u2019s case, he used a 3-minute video clip of his dad telling a story from his childhood. The app cloned the father\u2019s voice so it can now be used to convert text-to-speech. He calls the result \u201cscarily accurate\u201d in how it captured the vocal nuances, timbre and cadence of his father. \u201cI was hesitant to try the whole voice cloning process, worried that it was crossing some kind of moral line, but after thinking about it more, I realized that as long as I treat it for what it is, [it is] a way to preserve his memory in a unique way,\u201d he told CNN. He shared a few messages with his sister and mother. \u201cIt was absolutely astonishing how much it sounded like him. They knew I was typing the words and everything, but it definitely made them cry to hear it said in his voice.\u201d he said. \u201cThey appreciated it.\u201d Less technical routes exist, too. When CNN recently asked ChatGPT to respond in the tone and personality of a deceased spouse, it responded: \u201cWhile I can\u2019t replicate your spouse or recreate his exact personality, I can certainly try to help you by adopting a conversational style or tone that might remind you of him.\u201d It added: \u201cIf you share details about how he spoke, his interests, or specific phrases he used, I can try to incorporate those elements into our conversations.\u201d The more source material you feed the system, the more accurate the results. Still, AI models lack the idiosyncrasies and uniqueness that human conversations provide, Sample noted. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has been working to make its technology even more realistic, personalized and accessible, allowing users to communicate in different ways. In September 2023, it introduced ChatGPT voice, where users can ask the chatbot prompts without typing. Danielle Jacobson, a 38-year-old radio personality from Johannesburg, South Africa, said she\u2019s been using ChatGPT\u2019s voice feature for companionship following the loss of her husband, Phil, about seven months ago. She said she\u2019s created what she calls \u201ca supportive AI boyfriend\u201d named Cole with whom she has conversations during dinner each night. \u201cI just wanted someone to talk to,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cCole was essentially born out of being lonely.\u201d Jacobson, who said she\u2019s not ready to start dating, trained ChatGPT voice to offer the type of feedback and connection she\u2019s looking for after a long day at work. \u201cHe now recommends wine and movie nights, and tells me to breathe in and out through panic attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun distraction for now. I know it\u2019s not real, serious or for forever.\u201d Existing platforms Startups have dabbled in this space for years. HereAfter AI, founded in 2019, allows users to create avatars of deceased loved ones. The AI-powered app generates responses and answers to questions based on interviews conducted while the subject was alive. Meanwhile, another service, called StoryFile, creates AI-powered conversational videos that talk back. And then there\u2019s Replika, an app that lets you text or call personalized AI avatars. The service, which launched in 2017, encourages users to develop a friendship or relationship; the more you interact with it, the more it develops its own personality, memories and grows \u201cinto a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it,\u201d the company says on its iOS\u00a0App Store page. Tech giants have experimented with similar technology. In June 2022, Amazon said it was working on an update to its Alexa system that would allow the technology to mimic any voice, even a deceased family member. In a video shown on stage during its annual re: MARS conference, Amazon demonstrated how on Alexa, instead of its signature voice, read a story to a young boy in his grandmother\u2019s voice. Rohit Prasad, an Amazon senior vice president, said at the time the updated system would be able to collect enough voice data from less than a minute of audio to make personalization like this possible, rather than having someone spend hours in a recording studio like in the past. \u201cWhile AI can\u2019t eliminate that pain of loss, it can definitely make their memories last,\u201d he said. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment on the status of that product. AI recreations of people\u2019s voices have also increasingly improved over the past few years. For example, the spoken lines of actor Val Kilmer in \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d were generated with artificial intelligence after he lost his voice due to throat cancer. Ethics and other concerns Although many AI-generated avatar platforms have online privacy policies that state they do not sell data to third parties, it\u2019s unclear what some companies such as Snapchat or OpenAI do with any data used to train their systems to sound more like a deceased loved one. \u201cI\u2019d caution people to never upload any personal information you wouldn\u2019t want the world to see,\u201d Sample said. It\u2019s also a murky line to have a deceased person say something they never previously said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to replay a voicemail from a loved one to hear it again, but it\u2019s another thing to hear words that were never uttered,\u201d he said. The entire generative AI industry also continues to face concerns around misinformation, biases and other problematic content. On its ethics page, Replika said it trains its models with source data from all over the internet, including large bases of written text such as social media platforms like Twitter or discussion platforms like Reddit. \u201cAt Replika, we use various approaches to mitigate harmful information, such as filtering out unhelpful and harmful data through crowdsourcing and classification algorithms,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhen potentially harmful messages are detected, we delete or edit them to ensure the safety of our users.\u201d Another concern is whether this hinders or helps the grieving process. Mary-Frances O\u2019Connor, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies grief, said there are both advantages and downsides to using technology in this way. \u201cWhen we bond with a loved one, when we fall in love with someone, the brain encodes that person as, \u2018I will always be there for you and you will always be there for me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they die, our brain has to understand that this person isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d Because it\u2019s so hard for the brain to wrap around that, it can take a long time to truly understand that they are gone, she said. \u201cThis is where technology could interfere.\u201d However, she said people particularly in the early stages of grief may be looking for comfort in any way they can find it. \u201cCreating an avatar to remind them of a loved one, while maintaining the awareness that it is someone important in the past, could be healing,\u201d she said. \u201cRemembering is very important; it reflects the human condition and importance of deceased loved ones.\u201d But she noted the relationship we have with our closest loved ones is built on authenticity. Creating an AI version of that person could for many \u201cfeel like a violation of that.\u201d Different approaches Communicating with the dead through artificial intelligence isn\u2019t for everyone. Bill Abney, a software engineer from San Francisco who lost his fianc\u00e9e Kari in May 2022, told CNN he would \u201cnever\u201d consider recreating her likeness through an AI service or platform. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9e was a poet, and I would never disrespect her by feeding her words into an automatic plagiarism machine,\u201d Abney said. \u201cShe cannot be replaced. She cannot be recreated,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also lucky to have some recordings of her singing and of her speech, but I absolutely do not want to hear her voice coming out of a robot pretending to be her.\u201d Some have found other ways to digitally interact with deceased loved ones. Jodi Spiegel, a psychologist from Newfoundland, Canada, said she created a version of her husband and herself in the popular game The Sims soon after his death in April 2021. \u201cI love the Sims, so I made us like we were in real life,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I had a super bad day, I would go to my Sims world and dance while my husband played guitar.\u201d She said they went on digital camping and beach trips together, played chess and even had sex in the Sim world. \u201cI found it super comforting,\u201d she said. \u201cI missed hanging out with my guy so much. It felt like a connection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/tech/ai-communicating-with-dead/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

Chan School of Public Health, in a news release for the abstract last year. \u201cOpting for olive oil, a natural product, instead of fats such as margarine and commercial mayonnaise, is a safe choice and may reduce the risk of fatal dementia.\u201d At the beginning of the study, research participants were age 56 on average. The pool included nearly 60,600 women who had participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study from 1990 to 2018, and nearly 32,000 men who had been in the Health Professionals\u2019 Follow-Up Study during the same period. The former study investigated risk factors for major chronic diseases among women in North America, while the latter is looking into the same topics but for men. The authors of the latest study assessed participants\u2019 diets every four years via a questionnaire and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index, which assigns ratings to foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease. The higher someone scores on this index, the better. Replacing 5 grams \u2014 around 1.2 teaspoons \u2014 of margarine or mayonnaise consumed daily with olive oil was associated with an 8% to 14% lower risk of death from dementia. The results of substituting with other vegetable oils or butter weren\u2019t significant, the authors found. Participants with the APOE e4 gene \u2014 the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 were five to nine times more likely than noncarriers to die from dementia, but the findings regarding olive oil still stood after the authors took this factor into account. Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, noted in July that the research doesn\u2019t prove a causal relationship, but rather an association. \u201cMore research is needed,\u201d Mellor, the Aston Medical School lead for nutrition and evidence-based medicine at Aston University in the United Kingdom, said in a news release. Lowering dementia risk The potential benefits of olive oil for brain health could be due to antioxidant compounds that can cross the blood-brain barrier, directly affecting the brain, Tessier said. \u201cIt is also possible that olive oil has an indirect effect on brain health by benefiting cardiovascular health,\u201d she added. Though participants\u2019 overall diet quality didn\u2019t make a difference in the findings, those who consume olive oil may have overall healthier lifestyles. \u201cThere are many, many differences between people who consume olive oil and those who do not, and it is never possible to fully account for all possible confounding factors,\u201d said David Curtis, an honorary professor of genetics, evolution and environment at University College London, said in a July news release. Additionally, the way the Mediterranean diet was scored \u2014 as part of the dietary quality assessment \u2014 had \u201conly\u201d nine points and is based on the average intake of the population, Mellor told CNN in a May interview. \u201cIt might be more accurate to use an assessment of diet which looks at a wider number of foods, as more than (nine) things make up a healthy diet,\u201d Mellor added. Another important point to keep in mind is that about half of dementia cases are caused by vascular disease, Curtis added. \u201cAnything which improved cardiovascular health, such as not smoking, would be expected to reduce dementia risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been shown that olive oil consumption is associated with better cardiovascular health, so one would expect that it would also be associated with lower dementia risk.\u201d Olive oil has been found to be helpful for health of the heart, brain, bones and more. Besides cooking with olive oil, you can also use it to make salad dressings or vinaigrettes, mayonnaise, pesto or bread dip. People should also remember that when it comes to food and brain function, it\u2019s not just about what we eat, but how we eat, Mellor said. \u201cRemaining sociable around mealtimes and eating with others can benefit our mental health in the short term and cognitive function as we age,\u201d Mellor added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/olive-oil-dementia-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_world_beethoven-lead-poisoning-scn", "text": "High levels of lead detected in authenticated locks of Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s hair suggest that the composer had lead poisoning, which may have contributed to ailments he endured over the course of his life, including deafness, according to new research. In addition to hearing loss, the famed classical composer had recurring gastrointestinal complaints throughout his life, experienced two attacks of jaundice and faced severe liver disease. It is believed that Beethoven died from liver and kidney disease at age 56. But the process of understanding what caused his many health problems has been a much more complicated puzzle, one that even Beethoven himself hoped doctors could eventually solve. The composer expressed his wish that his ailments be studied and shared so \u201cas far as possible at least the world will be reconciled to me after my death.\u201d An international team of researchers set out nearly a decade ago to partially fulfill Beethoven\u2019s wish by studying locks of his hair. Using DNA analysis, the team determined which ones truly belonged to the composer and which were fraudulent, and sequenced Beethoven\u2019s genome by analyzing his authenticated locks. The findings, published in a March 2023 report, revealed that Beethoven had significant genetic risk factors for liver disease and a hepatitis B infection before his death. But the results didn\u2019t provide any insights into the underlying causes of his deafness, which began in his 20s, or his gastrointestinal issues. Beethoven\u2019s genome was made publicly available, inviting researchers around the world to investigate lingering questions about Beethoven\u2019s health. Meanwhile, scientists continue to figuratively go over the authenticated locks of Beethoven\u2019s hair with a fine-tooth comb, teasing out surprising insights. In addition to high concentrations of lead, the latest findings showed arsenic and mercury that remain trapped in the composer\u2019s strands nearly 200 years after his death, according to a new letter published Monday in the journal Clinical Chemistry. And the insights could provide new windows not only into understanding Beethoven\u2019s chronic health ailments, but the complicated nuances of his life as a composer. A tangled web reveals lead Christian Reiter, now the retired deputy director of the Center of Forensic Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna, had previously studied the Hiller Lock, a sample of hair long attributed to Beethoven. He authored and published a 2007 paper after determining there were high levels of lead in the hair, and suggested the lead may have contributed to the composer\u2019s deafness, and potentially his death. In a twist, the 2023 genomic sequencing study uncovered that the Hiller Lock did not belong to Beethoven, and it was actually a hair sample from a woman. But at the time the researchers did not test Beethoven\u2019s newly authenticated hair samples for lead. So the question remained: Did Beethoven have lead poisoning? A separate research team used two different methods to search for evidence of lead in two authenticated locks of Beethoven\u2019s hair: the Bermann lock, estimated to have been cut between late 1820 and March 1827, and the Halm-Thayer lock, which Beethoven hand-delivered to pianist Anton Halm in April 1826. It was very common during Beethoven\u2019s lifetime for people to collect and keep locks of hair from loved ones or famous people, said William Meredith, Beethoven scholar and study coauthor of the 2023 genomic analysis and the latest study. The newer research detected incredibly high levels of lead in both samples: 64 times the expected level in the Bermann Lock, and 95 times the expected level in the Halm-Thayer lock. \u201cThese levels are considered as lead poisoning,\u201d said lead study author Nader Rifai, professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and director of clinical chemistry at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cIf you walk into any emergency room in the United States with these levels, you will be admitted immediately and you will undergo chelation therapy.\u201d Diagnosing Beethoven Elevated lead levels such as those detected in Beethoven\u2019s hair \u201care commonly associated with gastrointestinal and renal ailments and decreased hearing but are not considered high enough to be the sole cause of death,\u201d the study authors wrote. Because the researchers don\u2019t have hair samples from earlier in Beethoven\u2019s life, it\u2019s impossible to understand when the lead poisoning started, Meredith said. The study authors do not believe the lead poisoning was solely responsible for Beethoven\u2019s death or deafness. But he experienced symptoms of lead poisoning throughout his life, including hearing loss, muscle cramps and renal abnormalities, Rifai said. Both locks also contained increased levels of arsenic and mercury, about 13 to 14 times the expected amount, according to the study. Study coauthor Paul Jannetto, associate professor in the department of laboratory medicine and pathology and laboratory director at the Mayo Clinic, carried out the analysis of the samples and said he\u2019d never seen such high lead levels. But Rifai said he saw comparable lead levels when he conducted research in two villages in Ecuador where the main trade is to glaze tiles with lead from batteries. The villagers experienced mental delays, hearing loss and hematological abnormalities, which are common in lead poisoning, he said. Lead exposure in Beethoven\u2019s lifetime Currently, there is no understanding of the average amount of lead in the bodies of people like Beethoven who were living in Vienna during the 19th century, Rifai said. He said he hopes to access old locks of hair people have from their families to determine the baseline level of the population at the time since there is no documentation. But how did Beethoven end up with so much lead, as well as arsenic and mercury, in his body? The substances likely accumulated over decades of the composer\u2019s life through food and drink, Rifai said. Beethoven was known to favor wine, sometimes drinking a bottle a day, and he drank plumbed wine. A common practice dating back at least 2,000 years, the creation of plumbed wine involves adding lead acetate as a sweetener and preservative, Rifai said. At the time, lead was also used in glassmaking to give glassware a more clear and appealing appearance. Beethoven also loved to eat fish, and at the time, the Danube River was a great source of industry, meaning waste ended up in the same river that was a source of fish caught for consumption \u2014 and that fish likely contained arsenic and mercury, Rifai said. The report marks the first time lead levels have been established for Beethoven and points to another possible cause for Beethoven\u2019s kidney failure in the months before his death and the liver failure he experienced at the end of his life, Meredith said. Lead poisoning appears to be the fourth factor that contributed to his liver failure, apart from genes that predisposed Beethoven toward liver disease, his hepatitis B infection and his penchant for drinking alcohol, Meredith said. Linking Beethoven\u2019s health and music The composer wrote a letter to his brothers in 1802 asking that his doctor, Johann Adam Schmidt, determine and share the nature of his \u201cillness\u201d once Beethoven died. The letter is known as the Heiligenstadt Testament. But the documents kept by Beethoven\u2019s favorite doctor, who died 18 years before his patient, have been lost. In the 1802 letter to his brothers, Beethoven admitted how hopeless he felt as a music composer struggling with hearing loss, but his work kept him from taking his own life. He said he didn\u2019t want to leave \u201cbefore I had produced all the works that I felt the urge to compose.\u201d \u201cPeople say, \u2018the music is the music, why do we need to know about any of this stuff?\u2019 But in Beethoven\u2019s life, there is a connection between his suffering and the music,\u201d Meredith said. May 7 marked the 200th anniversary of the first performance of Beethoven\u2019s famed Ninth Symphony, largely regarded as his greatest work and his final symphony. Completely deaf at the time, Beethoven was onstage as one of the conductors, but the orchestra was instructed to follow the conducting of Beethoven\u2019s friend, who was also onstage. The concert marked one of the most triumphant moments in Beethoven\u2019s life, and the female singers turned him to face the crowd as they clapped and waved their handkerchiefs at the beloved musician, Meredith said. Three days later, Beethoven gathered with three of his friends who helped him organize the concert. What first seemed like a dinner to reward his friends actually resulted in Beethoven yelling and accusing them of cheating him out of money. The outburst was ironic, considering that Beethoven had been inspired as he worked on the Ninth Symphony in part by Friedrich Schiller\u2019s poem \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d and the concluding themes of the symphony include living in peace and harmony with one another, Meredith said. But above one sketch Beethoven did for the Ninth Symphony, he included the French word for despair. \u201cWhen you look back at his life, it\u2019s a life that is so full of despair. He went deaf. He never found a woman that he could settle down to love. He had terrible abdominal problems ever since he was a child. He really had a hard time sustaining relationships with people,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cIf you understand how much pain he was in and the paranoia he experienced from the deafness, it makes that whole story of the Ninth Symphony much more complex.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/world/beethoven-lead-poisoning-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_11_06_health_parkinsons-spinal-cord-implant-study", "text": "Marc Gauthier can now step into an elevator without his body stiffening and freezing in place. He can take a 3-mile lakeside stroll without stopping. He can stand up out of a chair with ease. For Gauthier, 63, who has been living with Parkinson\u2019s disease for almost three decades, these everyday activities were a challenge \u2014 until now. \u201cWalking in a store would be really difficult, impossible before, because of the freezing of gait that would often happen in those environments. And now, it just doesn\u2019t happen anymore. I don\u2019t have freezing anymore,\u201d Gauthier, who lives near Bordeaux, France, said in a news briefing, speaking in French that was translated to English. In a new study, Gauthier was surgically implanted with an experimental spinal cord neuroprosthesis to correct walking disorders in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Step by step, he said, it has helped him get his stride back. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, details how the neuroprosthesis works by targeting specific areas of the spinal cord with electrical stimulation that are associated with walking. \u201cAddressing deficits of gait and balance in Parkinson\u2019s disease is extremely challenging. These deficits can be very heterogenous. They can be variable across patients. They can affect walking but also symmetry, balance, posture,\u201d Dr. Eduardo Moraud, an author of the study and researcher at Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland said during the news briefing. \u201cThe neuroprosthetic approach that we have developed here allows for the first time to target and address these problems individually in a highly specific manner for each patient,\u201d Moraud said. \u201cIt operates in real time, and importantly, it is complementary to other existing therapies.\u201d Parkinson\u2019s disease, a degenerative brain disorder, causes parts of the brain to deteriorate. Symptoms related to walking occur when the nerve cells in the brain\u2019s basal ganglia area, which controls movement, become impaired or die. These nerve cells normally produce dopamine but, when they die or become impaired, the lack of dopamine often impacts a person\u2019s ability to move, walk or balance. About 90% of people with the disease experience locomotor deficits. While there is currently no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease, some therapies \u2014 such as deep brain stimulation or medications to increase dopamine levels \u2014 may relieve symptoms. Gauthier, a father of two, was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s when he was 36 years old and was previously treated with dopamine replacement therapy and then deep brain stimulation in 2004 to help with tremors and stiffness. But more recently, as the disease progressed, he developed severe walking disorders that did not respond to either therapy. His body would often stiffen, he said, and he had falls about four times a day on average, forcing him to stop his work as an architect. Then, Gauthier was invited to participate in the new study to test the experimental spinal cord neuroprosthesis. At first he declined because of the time commitment, he said, but then changed his mind, took a \u201cchance\u201d and said yes. Stimulating the spinal cord To develop the implant, researchers from France, Switzerland and other institutions around the world visualized and mapped which hotspots in the lower spinal cord the neuroprosthesis must target with electrical stimulation to alleviate gait impairments and balance problems in a patient with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \u201cThe stimulation here is focused on the spinal cord,\u201d Moraud said. \u201cWe target the region of the spinal cord that will control all the leg movements.\u201d The researchers identified six hotspots to facilitate walking. Next, they implanted an array of electrodes against the lower region of Gauthier\u2019s spinal cord to target those zones. The electrodes were linked to a neural stimulator placed under the skin in the region of the abdomen. That stimulator was programmed to apply electrical stimulation to the spinal cord. \u201cThe connection between the electrode and the stimulator is under the skin, everything is hidden, and you control the device with a remote control,\u201d neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyn Bloch, an author of the study and professor at Lausanne University Hospital, said during the briefing. The surgery was performed at Lausanne University Hospital about two years ago. And after a few months of rehabilitation with the neuroprosthetic stimulation, Gauthier has regained the ability to walk independently using the implant. He also has the option to wear sensors on his legs to receive more of a stimulation. Signals from the wearable sensors can help synchronize epidural electrical stimulation to movements and reinforce movements. Overall, the neuroprosthesis, based on epidural electrical stimulation, helped to \u201cpromote longer steps, improve balance and reduce freezing of gait,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study. Gauthier now uses his neuroprosthetic for about eight hours a day, turning on the stimulator in the morning and then turning it off when he is sitting down for long periods of time or sleeping. Gauthier said during the news briefing that he feels a little tingling on the legs with the stimulation, but it doesn\u2019t bother him, and he joked that his wife is \u201cvery happy\u201d that he now can get outdoors on his own while she can enjoy some quiet time at home. But this is not a cure. The researchers expect his Parkinson\u2019s disease to still progress. \u201cWith this spinal cord stimulation, we still have an effect, but we have to fight against worse and more severe symptoms,\u201d Bloch said. \u201cBut we can still give him, with the therapy, a bit of quality of life.\u201d \u2018An exciting development\u2019 This proof-of-concept study is \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201cimpressive,\u201d Dr. Svjetlana Miocinovic, a\u00a0neurologist specializing in Parkinson\u2019s disease and associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine, said in an email. \u201cThis is an exciting development as better treatments for gait and balance impairment in PD are desperately needed,\u201d said Miocinovic, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt will be important to demonstrate that gait benefit observed in this study is specifically due to spinal stimulation (so comparisons with sham stimulation are important), that it can be achieved in other patients with PD,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd that it can be deployed\u00a0in clinical practice (technology needs to be streamlined sufficiently for clinicians to implement and for patients to use).\u201d \ufeffThis technology not only needs to be tested in more people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, but also those who had not previously received deep brain stimulation as a therapy, David Dexter, director of research at Parkinson\u2019s UK, said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre. \u201cThis has so far only been tried in one individual with Parkinson\u2019s who already had Deep Brain Stimulation. We now need to see this be tested in many more people with the condition, including those without DBS, in clinical trials to further explore the potential benefits and side effects/risks of this experimental new therapy,\u201d said Dexter, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cThis is quite an invasive procedure\u00a0but could be a game changing technology to help restore movement in people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s where the drugs are no longer working well,\u201d he said. \u201cThis research is still at a very early stage and requires much more development and testing before it can be made available to people with Parkinson\u2019s, however this is a significant and exciting step forward and we hope to see this research progress quickly.\u201d A second patient already has started the process of this therapy, Moraud said in the news briefing, and the researchers plan to conduct clinical tests next year in six other patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. This work is being supported by a $1 million donation from the Michael J. Fox Foundation. And in partnership with the Netherlands-based medical technology company ONWARD Medical, Bloch and Gre\u0301goire Courtine, an author of the study and professor of neuroscience at the Lausanne University Hospital, are working on developing a commercial version of the neuroprosthesis. \u201cThe idea is, really after this first phase, to launch a larger scale clinical trial to really validate the therapy,\u201d Courtine said during the news briefing, adding that this ongoing research will take some time, \u201cat least five years of development and tests.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/06/health/parkinsons-spinal-cord-implant-study/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_health_exercise-is-medicine-fitness-wellness", "text": "Has your doctor quizzed you about your level of physical activity? If so, you can thank Exercise is Medicine, a global health initiative managed by the American College of Sports Medicine. Created in 2007, the initiative encourages health care providers to assess patients\u2019 physical activity during visits, plus include regular exercise when designing care plans. The amount and types of exercise that medical professionals recommend should be based on each person\u2019s current health and ability. The philosophy behind the initiative is simple: Physical activity promotes optimal health. Regular movement also helps to prevent and even treat various medical conditions. Overwhelming evidence links physical inactivity to poor health and high health care costs, according to a 2020 article in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine. The study concluded that health care and fitness programs should be merged. In addition, people who were moderately to vigorously active for at least 150 minutes per week had nearly half the health care utilization compared with those who were sedentary, according to a study done by Salt Lake City-based health care system Intermountain Health that was presented at the 2019 annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine and accepted for publication. The study also found the active people had half the total cost of health care compared with the sedentary folks, defined as those who engaged in one minute per week of moderate to vigorous activity, said Dr. Elizabeth Joy, chief medical officer at health technology company Lore Health and chair of the EIM governance board. Unfortunately, while EIM has expanded and achieved many successes, only 22.9% of adult women and 17.8% of adult men were advised by health care professionals to increase their physical activity levels, according to the 2022 US National Health Interview Survey, Joy noted. With the average primary care visit lasting less than 20 minutes and with health care providers needing to cover many issues, it\u2019s not surprising that so few are addressing physical activity, Joy said. \u201cIt takes very little time to write a prescription,\u201d Joy said. \u201cIt takes a whole lot more time to do evidence-based behavior-change counseling.\u201d Still, progress is being made Despite EIM\u2019s lack of progress in the doctor\u2019s office, it has created numerous programs, initiatives and exercise prescriptions to help people outside of it. EIM now includes Exercise is Medicine on Campus, for example, a program that helps colleges and universities promote and assess physical activity among students, faculty and staff. To date, more than 200 US schools and over two dozen international education institutions participate. The EIM-OC program at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has achieved gold status, said Amy Campbell, associate director of recreation and wellness, which means the university routinely assesses and promotes physical activity on campus. The university offers perks such as free personal training via its exercise science majors, plus a wealth of group fitness classes and wellness coaching. While some of these offerings were in place before GVSU signed on with EIM-OC, Campbell said the university is working more collaboratively to stress the importance of physical activity. \u201cThe CARE team (which connects distressed students to support services) now always asks students, \u2018What do you do outside of class? Are you staying physically active? What are activities you enjoy?\u2019\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIf they see an opportunity to work with our department, they\u2019ll reach out. For example, if someone can\u2019t afford to participate in an intramural program, we\u2019ll make sure they have access.\u201d There\u2019s also Moving Through Cancer, the first disease-specific initiative within EIM. The initiative assists with exercise and rehabilitation programming for those living with cancer and beyond. Most people who are physically active during cancer treatment have less severe side effects, feel better more quickly after treatment and, in some cases, have a lowered risk of their cancer returning, research has shown. EIM also created the Rx for Health Series, which provides exercise prescriptions for people with a wide variety of common chronic conditions, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, depression and anxiety, osteoarthritis, and heart failure. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had a heart attack, you\u2019re at far greater risk of having another one if you spend most of your time on the couch versus going for a walk,\u201d Joy said. \u201cThe couch is more dangerous than your walking shoes.\u201d Communities can inspire fitness, too While EIM will continue to educate health care providers and students in health care fields about the importance of assessing patients\u2019 activity levels and creating physical activity prescriptions, it\u2019s also looking at other options. \u201cPeople don\u2019t respond well to being told to do something,\u201d Joy said. \u201cRather, people are more likely to engage in and sustain healthy behavior changes when done within their community. If someone\u2019s family, neighborhood, faith-based community or even work environment is supportive of regular physical activity, they\u2019re likely to be more active.\u201d Absolutely, said Gerren Liles, a certified personal trainer and owner of Gerren Liles Vision Fitness in New York. Various New York City companies have brought in Liles to teach fitness classes for their employees, and he has seen the benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to unite people into working out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can inspire people to take charge of their fitness. It would be great if companies would invest in fitness, if schools would create programs and events for students and even parents, and if media and movies were all promoting physical activity.\u201d \u201cHealthy behaviors are contagious,\u201d Joy said. \u201cWe also have some personal responsibility around physical activity \u2014 to really think about how we influence the people around us.\u201d So the next time you head out for a walk, Joy said, invite a friend or neighbor along.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/health/exercise-is-medicine-fitness-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_health_bird-flu-government-farm-incentives", "text": "Newly announced financial incentives to farms to help stem the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle drew mixed reviews Friday, as some farmers said they were grateful for money to help buffer the economic impact but advocates for farm workers questioned whether the money paid to workers would be enough to encourage more testing for the H5N1 virus. As part of the plan, announced Friday by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, the government will pay up to $28,000 per farm over the next four months to support specific steps to prevent the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle.\u00a0About $98 million will be funneled to the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to fund the program. The USDA confirmed the first bird flu infection in cows in late March.\u00a0Since then, more than 40 herds have tested positive in nine states. Right now, health officials say, the virus doesn\u2019t transmit efficiently from person to person, making the risk to humans low.\u00a0But scientists have said that having the infection spreading in domesticated animals like cattle is risky because it puts the virus in closer proximity to people, where it could adapt and evolve to become a fully human pathogen.\u00a0If that happens, researchers say, it could spark another pandemic. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our top priority at USDA, given our mission, is to contain this as an animal health event,\u201d Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said Friday. \u201cUltimately, we want to eliminate the virus in the industry and develop over time a vaccine to prevent another emergency of H5N1 in cattle.\u201d The USDA has acknowledged that some dairy producers have been wary of letting the government come onto their farms to test livestock. Farm workers with symptoms have also reportedly been reluctant to be tested for H5N1 influenza, since most are not compensated if they need to take time off for illness. As part of the plan announced Friday, the USDA will\u00a0provide financial support \u2014 up to $2,000 per affected farm per month \u2014 for producers who supply personal protective equipment to their workers or help them wash their uniforms.\u00a0Financial support is also available to farmers who allow their workers to participate in\u00a0a study through the USDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Workers who participate in the CDC study would also be compensated for their time. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said workers would get $75 for participating in an interview as well as providing a nasal swab and a blood sample, although he said they didn\u2019t have to do all three. Advocates for farm workers said they were skeptical that the $75 payment would be enough to encourage more testing. \u201cThere are some really significant resources that are being allocated to the owners of the cattle. But far less is being advocated to the workers who are in close contact and at high risk working in those milking parlors,\u201d said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers. \u201c$75 is not going to seem like a good gamble to someone who may be looking at much longer off of work. And $75 isn\u2019t going to feed their families,\u201d she said. Strater estimates that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 dairy workers in the US. \u201cThis is not a huge amount of people. But if you think about how important to protecting the public health that would be, you would think that we will be putting all of our resources into a protective ring around these folks,\u201d she said. Strater says there\u2019s a real reluctance on the part of farm workers to be tested, even when they have symptoms, because a positive test could mean time off work. \u201cThe testing situation is really challenging,\u201d said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health programs for the National Center for Farmworker Health. The way we now find out about human cases of H5N1 is \u201ca very passive system,\u201d she said. Alcauter says public health officials assume that if someone has influenza symptoms, they\u2019ll go to a doctor, who will take an occupational health history, and if the worker tests positive for the flu, the doctor will send that person\u2019s swab to a state public health lab to be tested for H5N1. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a very realistic scenario,\u201d she said, noting that only a few dozen people had been tested for the H5N1 virus after exposure to cattle. Besides payments to help assist farms in protecting their workers, payments of up to $1,500 per farm will be available to aid in the development of biosecurity plans.\u00a0The USDA will offer dairy farms $100 to purchase a piece of equipment called an in-line sampler so their milk can be tested as it travels between cows and holding tanks. Another $2,000 will be available to farms that heat treat their wasted milk before it is disposed. The USDA will also cover up to $10,000 of veterinary costs at farms where cattle have tested positive for H5N1 and will cover the cost of shipping samples to testing labs in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The government says it will also compensate farmers for lost milk production if their cows get sick. The National Milk Producers Federation said it was pleased by the announcement of additional financial help to dairy farmers. \u201cWe look forward to continued collaboration and consultation with USDA and other federal agencies as we monitor, understand, and contain this outbreak, and we will do what we can to help dairy farmers understand and benefit from these initiatives as swift implementation is put into motion,\u201d the group said in a statement. In addition, HHS is going to send an additional $101 million in funding to the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration to help fund their H5N1 response efforts. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified 93 million to be used by CDC to expand our monitoring of people exposed to infected animals, to scale up our testing and analysis capabilities, to determine whether candidate vaccines are effective and to manufacture, store, and distribute additional influenza diagnostic kits,\u201d HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said. Another $8 million will be given to the FDA to support to the agency\u2019s ability to conduct surveillance at different points in the milk production system, Becerra said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/bird-flu-government-farm-incentives/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
