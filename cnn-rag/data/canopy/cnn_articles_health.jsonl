{"id": "2024_07_01_health_worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness", "text": "Eating higher levels of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespans by more than 10%, according to a new, unpublished study of over 500,000 people whom researchers followed for nearly three decades. The risk went up to 15% for men and 14% for women once the data was adjusted, said study lead author Erikka Loftfield, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Asked about their consumption of 124 foods, people in the top 90th percentile of ultraprocessed food consumption said overly processed drinks topped their list. \u201cDiet soft drinks were the key contributor to ultraprocessed food consumption. The second one was sugary soft drinks,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cBeverages are a very important component of the diet and the contribution to ultraprocessed food.\u201d Refined grains such as ultraprocessed breads and baked goods ranked next in popularity, the study found. \u201cThis is one more large, long-duration cohort study confirming the association between UPF (ultraprocessed food) intake and all-cause mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Carlos Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health at Brazil\u2019s University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in an email. Monteiro coined the term ultraprocessed food and created the NOVA food classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made. Monteiro was not involved in the study, but several members of the NOVA classification system were coauthors. The NOVA classification system sorts foods from unprocessed or minimally processed \u2014 whole foods such as fruits and vegetables \u2014 to ultraprocessed foods such as deli meat and sausage. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food appetizing. Health risks linked to processed meats and soft drinks The preliminary study, presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago, analyzed dietary data gathered in 1995 from nearly 541,000 Americans ages 50 to 71 who were participating in the US National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. Researchers linked the dietary data to death rates over the next 20 to 30 years. Compared with those in the bottom 10% of ultraprocessed food consumption, people who ate the most overly processed food were more likely to die from heart disease or diabetes, according to the study. Unlike other studies, however, researchers found no rise in cancer-related death. Some ultraprocessed foods carried more of a risk than others, Loftfield said: \u201cHighly processed meat and soft drinks were a couple of the subgroups of ultraprocessed food most strongly associated with mortality risk.\u201d Diet drinks are considered ultraprocessed food because they contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium and stevia, and additional additives not found in whole foods. Diet beverages have been linked to a higher risk of dying early from cardiovascular disease as well as the onset of dementia,\u00a0type 2 diabetes,\u00a0obesity, stroke and\u00a0metabolic syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes. The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans already recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to premature death and the development of chronic disease. A March 2019 study found women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages\u00a0\u2014 defined as a standard glass, bottle or can \u2014 had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared with women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk. Processed meats such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, ham, corned beef, jerky and deli meats are also not recommended; studies have linked red and processed meats to bowel and stomach cancers, heart disease, diabetes and early death from any cause. \u201cThe evidence from this new study indicates that processed meat may be one of the most unhealthy foods, but people do not tend to view ham or chicken nuggets as UPF (ultraprocessed food),\u201d said Rosie Green,\u00a0a professor of environment, food and health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in a statement. She was not involved in the study. The study found that people who consumed the most ultraprocessed food were younger and heavier, and had an overall poorer quality of diet than those who ate fewer ultraprocessed foods. However, the increased health risk could not be explained by these differences, because even people with normal weight and better diets were also at some risk for early death from ultraprocessed foods, the study found. \u201cStudies which utilize food classification systems such as NOVA, which focus on the degree of processing, as opposed to the nutritional composition should be considered with caution,\u201d said Carla Saunders, president of the \u200eCalorie Control Council, an industry association, in an email. \u201cSuggesting the elimination of dietary tools like no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages, with proven benefits in the management of comorbidities like obesity and diabetes, is harmful and irresponsible,\u201d Saunders said. Results may underestimate risk One key limitation of the study was that the dietary data was gathered only once some 30 years ago, Green said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how dietary habits might have changed between then and now.\u201d Ultraprocessed food manufacturing has exploded since the mid-1990s, however, with estimates that as nearly 60% of the average American\u2019s daily calories come from ultraprocessed foods. That\u2019s not surprising, considering as much as 70% of the food in any grocery store may be ultraprocessed. \u201cIf anything, we are probably underestimating ultraprocessed food consumption in our study because we\u2019re being very conservative,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cThe intake is likely to have only grown over the years.\u201d In fact, a study published in May that found similar results \u2014 a higher risk of premature death and death from cardiovascular disease in over 100,000 health professionals who ate ultraprocessed foods \u2014 accessed ultraprocessed food intake every four years and found consumption doubled between the mid-1980s and 2018. \u201cFor example, the daily intake of packaged savory snacks and dairy-based desserts, such as ice cream, has essentially doubled since the \u201890s,\u201d said the lead author of the May study, Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIn our study, just as in this new one, the positive association was mainly driven by a few subgroups, including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d Song said. \u201cHowever, all categories of ultraprocessed food were associated with increased risk.\u201d Choosing more minimally processed foods is a one way to limit ultraprocessed foods in one\u2019s diet, Loftfield said. \u201cWe should really be focusing on eating diets that are rich in whole foods,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if the food is ultraprocessed, then look to see the levels of sodium and added sugars and try to make the best decision possible using the nutrition facts label.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_health_summer-food-safety-wellness", "text": "This Independence Day holiday takes place as\u00a0record-breaking heat waves\u00a0have spread across many parts of the US and the world, and the temperatures could be deadly. There\u2019s potential for record-breaking heat and extreme heat risk for portions of the South and Southwest. California is likely to be especially hard hit, with highs passing 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) in many areas. At the same time, the avian influenza outbreak has spread to cows, raising questions about whether certain foods like milk, eggs and hamburgers remain safe. As I drank lots of water and perspired through high temperatures and humidity at an outdoor concert this week, I thought about safely celebrating the Fourth of July holiday. What about all the grilled meat, burgers and potato salad sitting outside in the heat?\u00a0How can we stay cool while attending picnics and barbecues during this holiday weekend? Are there additional food safety precautions we should take, given the predicted high temperatures? And are there other health factors to consider this holiday, such as keeping cool and well-hydrated? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: Can you remind us why food safety is important? Dr. Leana Wen: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are around 9 million episodes of foodborne illness annually. These illnesses primarily occur when people ingest food or drink that has been contaminated with bacteria, viruses or parasites. Most episodes are mild, though even mild illnesses are unpleasant\u2014they are generally characterized by nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Some people can become very sick and require hospitalization, and unfortunately, some can die. Those at highest risk for severe illness include older individuals, children under 5, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems. CNN: What food precautions should people take for barbecues and other outdoor gatherings? Wen: Undercooked meat contains a lot of infectious organisms. The best way to make sure meat is cooked thoroughly is to use an internal thermometer. I recommend this US government food safety website to check the internal temperature that different types of meat should be cooked to. For instance, chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit, and ground beef should be cooked to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the meat is cooked, keep it at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or above until serving to prevent germs from developing. Prior to cooking, refrigerate raw meat rather than keeping it at room temperature. It should be removed just before being placed on a barbeque. CNN: Given how hot the weather might be this week, are there other specific factors to consider? Wen: Yes. Under normal weather circumstances, the advice from the US Department of Agriculture is that perishable food can be unrefrigerated for up to two hours. However, if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, that\u2019s reduced to one hour. That applies to cooked meat like hamburgers as well as perishable salads like potato salad and cole slaw. In hot weather, these items should be eaten right away; if not, they should be refrigerated within an hour. CNN: What about people who are having barbecues at parks or other places without refrigerators? Wen: They should have a well-insulated cooler with lots of ice. Raw, uncooked meat should be kept at 40-degrees Fahrenheit or lower until it is ready to go on the grill. I also recommend keeping uncooked meat in tightly sealed bags so that it does not contaminate other items that are served raw, like veggies and fruit. Another precaution for barbeques is to keep an eye on what utensils and plates you use for raw meat versus other food. Label the utensils, plates and containers that come into contact with raw meat. Keep them separate from plates that contain salad items, fruit, chips, buns and other items. CNN: And make sure to wash your hands after touching raw meat? Wen: Yes, absolutely. You don\u2019t want to go right from handling raw hamburger meat to making a salad. Make sure to wash your hands well with soap and water each time after handling raw meat. CNN: Let\u2019s talk about bird flu for a moment. Has the avian flu outbreak affected how we should think about eating products like hamburgers and chicken wings? Is it still safe to eat eggs and drink milk? Wen: According to federal health officials, it is safe to continue eating these products as long as meat and eggs are cooked to the recommended temperatures. It is also safe to keep drinking milk, though it\u2019s crucial to emphasize that the milk needs to be pasteurized. Raw milk is not safe to drink. Not only can raw milk harbor bacteria, but it is also possible that raw milk can transmit the bird flu. It wasn\u2019t advisable for people to drink raw milk or consume products made from raw milk prior to the bird flu outbreak, and it certainly is not advisable now. CNN: We\u2019ve talked a lot about food safety. What are other health issues to consider this Fourth of July? Wen: If you will be in hot weather, be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Watch out for those who are most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, specifically children, older adults and people with chronic medical conditions. Watch out for your pets as well. They can get overheated, too. Never leave pets or children unattended and in a car by themselves; the inside of the car overheats rapidly and these high temperatures can be fatal. Everyone should try to stay in the shade when possible. Keep well-hydrated. Water is the best form of hydration, and be aware that excessive caffeine and alcohol can be dangerous during heat waves. Wear clothing that protects you from the sun, and make sure to apply and re-apply sunscreen often.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/health/summer-food-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_travel_camp-stove-cooking-wellness", "text": "You know what I love doing in the summer? I\u2019ll give you three things: \u2022 Taking road trip vacations\u2022 Eating well on my road trips\u2022 Not going over my food budget while on a road trip That last one is a little tricky to pull off because \u2014 and I admit this might be an obvious statement \u2014 the cost of eating adds up over the course of a vacation. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who loves to fill up on a big, leisurely brunch, finding affordable but memorable options for every meal during a long trip can be challenging. I used to make do with deli sandwiches and brought-from-home snacks, but now I have a secret weapon for quick but satisfying road trip lunches: my Coleman camp stove. Despite my outdoorsy hippie reputation among friends, this was the first time I dove into cooking on an outdoor propane stove before renting a camper van for a cross-country trip with my husband on Route 66. But once we were on the road and figured out the logistics of our travel routine, I realized the stove\u2019s versatility and utility, not to mention the genuine fun of being able to cook lunch on the go. With a two-burner stove and pump sink in the back of our camper van, we could pull over and cook lunch pretty much anywhere during each day\u2019s adventures. I made pesto rotini in the parking lot of Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s historic home in Missouri, flipped grilled cheese sandwiches in a local park in Baxter Springs, Kansas, and slurped up cheesy zoodles outside the Painted Desert Inn in Petrified Forest National Park. Now I\u2019m a seasoned outdoor cook and have invested in a full mini kitchen setup for my camping excursions. I\u2019ve fallen in love with camp stove cooking so much that I now bring it with us on most of our summer road trips \u2014 whether we\u2019re camping or not. Coupled with my trusty 10-inch cast-iron skillet, the camp stove gives me a way to save a few bucks and eat well during the day so we can have a big dinner out. I might get a few stares in hotel parking lots and patio areas, but it\u2019s worth it for the convenience and reassurance of a good meal while sticking to my frugal budget. Hey, I own all these items already \u2014 why not use them? My road-trip stove setup Along with my stove and skillet, I also bring a few basic tools for cooking and cleaning. I keep a crate packed with the following: \u2022 Metal tongs\u2022 Fish spatula (slotted spatula)\u2022 Silicone spoonula\u2022 Silicone trivet\u2022 Olive oil (in a small squeeze bottle)\u2022 Kosher salt\u2022 Bar towels\u2022 Washcloth\u2022 Laundry tub\u2022 Castile soap Because I\u2019m using a propane stove, I only cook in well-ventilated outdoor areas and bring a foldable metal table to make sure there is a safe cooking surface no matter where I\u2019ll be. Keep meals simple with pre-prepped ingredients Simplicity is the key to easy camp stove lunches. When I\u2019m planning these meals, I don\u2019t want to complicate my prep with anything that requires chopping on-site. Remember, all equipment needs to be washed in your hotel bathroom, so this is no time to get fancy. To accomplish this, I turn to pre-prepped ingredients, a departure from my usual higher-maintenance home cooking. However, these items are easy to find in many US grocery stores, so they don\u2019t need to be packed in advance. With these versatile building blocks, I can make a variety of meals. I start with a base of shelf-stable carbs, such as bagged, ready-to-eat pasta, rice or grain blends. Protein comes in the form of beans, whether canned or bagged, frozen mini meatballs or seasoned tofu or seitan from the refrigerated section. The frozen and refrigerated produce sections offer a cornucopia of quick-cooking vegetable choices, including zoodles, cauliflower rice and stir-fry blends, pre-chopped onions and peppers, green beans, snap peas, baby spinach, and broccoli florets. Sauces can be as varied as pesto, marinara, salsa, salad dressings, or simply a bit of butter and salt. I\u2019ve also been known to bring some cheese powder from my pantry to make a macaroni and cheese meal as well. Don\u2019t forget that a one-skillet meal can also be as easy as a quesadilla, nachos, flatbreads or a homemade grilled cheese that beats the pants off a basic cold deli sandwich. Mix and match these ingredients and find the fun in cooking outdoors on your camp stove for your next road trip.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/travel/camp-stove-cooking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_summer-body-image-wellness", "text": "Did you sculpt your \u201cbikini body\u201d? Is your skin soft and tan and free of body hair? Are you ready for your summer vacation? The pressures around how people\u2019s bodies look can feel particularly high in summer, and it can come from everywhere: advertisements, celebrities, influencers, your friends on social media and even that voice in your head when looking in the mirror. \u201cI see it impact people \u2026 whether it\u2019s a mom who doesn\u2019t let herself go in the pool with her kids because she\u2019s afraid of how she looks in a swimsuit, or people with eating disorders who will choose to not go out with friends because they\u2019re struggling particularly hard that day,\u201d said Rebecca Moravec, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Denver. \u201cThe way we\u2019re in relationship with our bodies directly impacts how we participate in our day-to-day life.\u201d Body image is the way you think and feel about your body, but it isn\u2019t influenced just by what you see in the mirror, said Bri Campos, a body image coach in Paramus, New Jersey. Messages from the culture around you and even your broader mental health can affect your relationship with your body, she said. In the thick of summer, here are the things that might be affecting your relationship with your body and what you can do about them \u2014 so you can enjoy the season with less stress. Comfort and connection In addition to all the messages about what people should look like, the physical sensations of summer often bring increased attention to people\u2019s bodies, Campos said. \u201cYou\u2019re being forced to feel your body when you\u2019re forced to feel that sweat, to feel that heat \u2014 it can be really uncomfortable,\u201d she said. But instead of acknowledging that heat, sweating, sticking and chafing are just part of the experience of summer, people often attribute it to a problem with themselves, Campos said. \u201cWhen we experience discomfort, our brain is automatically going to try to find whose fault is it. And for most of us, we\u2019re going to blame our body,\u201d she added. For a better relationship with your body this summer, Campos recommends finding ways to connect with yourself in more enjoyable ways. Wearing ill-fitting clothing \u2014 whether too large or too small \u2014 will make you feel uncomfortable and angry at your body all day, she said. Instead, put something on that feels good. And look for ways to connect with your body that aren\u2019t uncomfortable \u2014 such as focusing your attention on how it feels to dunk in a cool pool, take that first sip of coffee in the morning, cuddle with a pet or hug someone you love, she said. \u201cThat is a connected moment where I can say, \u2018This feels good in my body,\u2019\u201d Campos said. Instagram vs. reality Summer can look glamorous on social media \u2014 perfectly posed bathing suit pictures, luxurious vacations and radiant sunshine. It can feel as though everyone is having a better and more beautiful time than you, Moravec said. And many people think if they don\u2019t fit that image, everyone will notice, said Dr. Whitney Trotter, a doctor of nursing practice, psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner and registered dietitian in Austin, Texas. Campos\u2019 clients often share that they feel worried about going to cookouts and get-togethers over the summer because they think others will be eyeing the choices they make around food. \u201cMost people are worried about their own bodies, and they\u2019re worried about their own food choices, but yet the pressure is still there,\u201d she said. One helpful practice can be to go out into the world \u2014 parties, the beach, the pool or restaurants \u2014 and simply observe who is out there participating, Moravec said. It isn\u2019t just the curated images of social media. Instead you\u2019ll find people of all shapes, sizes and backgrounds who are getting together and having fun. \u201cThe reality is that life is happening with or without (the image management),\u201d she said. \u201cIf you were to focus on simply connecting with other people connecting with yourself, what would life look like?\u201d Looking for belonging Often, behind the efforts to achieve the socially ideal body are notions that you will have access to the more important things once you get it. \u201cWe all carry an underlying story about what we need or who we need to be to get love or belonging or safety,\u201d Moravec said. And bodies are an easy target. If only you looked different, then maybe you would also be staring at a sunset with someone you love, splashing in the waves happily with your kids or enjoying a vacation with a group of close friends, right? \u201cOur work is to really challenge that,\u201d Moravec said. \u201cWhen I think about the friends that I have the deepest friendships with, I\u2019m not thinking about how tan their skin is. I\u2019m not thinking about how they look in a bathing suit.\u201d The idea that a different image may help foster a sense of belonging in a season of vacationing may feel present for people of color, Trotter said. \u201cFor African Americans, (vacationing in popular locations) was not always available,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is kind of this pressure now \u2026 \u2018How do I vacation the right way?\u2019 \u201cAnd oftentimes, that leads to dieting and weight loss, because they want to have a thin body, or a body that appears more accessible,\u201d Trotter said. Moravec recommends shifting the focus away from how your body looks and striving toward those things you desire in your life. \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s having a hard body image day \u2026 I want them to check in about what else is going on,\u201d she said. \u201cAre they feeling lonely? Are they feeling disconnected? Are they not feeling good enough?\u201d Rarely, if ever, do we love people just because of how they look, so there are better ways than changing your body to get the connection you are looking for, Moravec said. Can you spend more quality time with your loved ones? Can you be more present by playing in the pool without worrying about what you look like? Be aware that changing your body doesn\u2019t always mean problems of connection and belonging will be fixed, Campos said. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a haircut after a breakup,\u201d she added. \u201cYou might feel better, but it doesn\u2019t actually change anything in your body. It is just in the temporary relief from a bigger, more systemic issue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/summer-body-image-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_gupta-biden-cognitive-testing-analysis", "text": "When the 46th President of the United States took the debate stage a week ago, it became apparent, even from his first answer, that this would not be the performance he hoped for. For me as a brain specialist, it was concerning to watch President Joe Biden, and it quickly became clear that I was not alone in my reaction. Over the past week, I received more than a dozen calls, texts and emails from medical colleagues who, like me, specialize in the brain. It wasn\u2019t that what we noticed was necessarily new but that it was particularly pronounced, and right from the start of the debate. From a neurological standpoint, we were concerned with his confused rambling; sudden loss of concentration in the middle of a sentence; halting speech and absence of facial animation, resulting at times in a flat, open-mouthed expression. To be clear, these are only observations, not in any way diagnostic of something deeper, and none of these doctors wished to suggest that was the case. The consensus from the doctors reaching out to me, however, was that the president should be encouraged to undergo detailed cognitive and movement disorder testing, and those results should be made available to the public. Over the past five years, I have reported extensively on the advances in the world of treating and reducing risk of dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia. For the documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I even went through extensive cognitive testing to demonstrate what it entailed and determine whether I had problems with executive functioning, judgment or memory lapses, as well as blood tests to determine things like the level of abnormal proteins that may be present in my brain and my B12 levels. My sense of smell and my genetic risk factors were checked. This type of testing is not necessary for most people as a matter of routine, but every one of the brain doctors I spoke to recommended that level of examination for Biden. Biden\u2019s health history The last official report in February was a health summary which concluded that the president was \u201cfit for duty.\u201d The White House said a team of 20 doctors, including a neurologist, participated in completing his physical. An \u201cextremely detailed\u201d neurologic exam found nothing consistent with neurological disorders, the summary said. It also found no evidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease that might explain his stiff gait and decreased expression in his face. Although Parkinson\u2019s disease is the most common cause of parkinsonism - a set of movement symptoms such as stiffness and tremor \u2013 there are other causes as well, and it was not clear in the medical report that those had been investigated. They did find evidence of neuropathy and arthritis\u00a0in his feet, which can cause numbness, weakness and pain. There was no mention of any sort of cognitive testing. Biden was examined by his physician after the debate to check on a cold, the White House said, but it was a \u201cbrief check\u201d and not a physical.\u00a0When White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked this week whether Biden should receive and release the results of any kind of cognitive test, she replied that his medical team has said it\u2019s \u201cnot necessary.\u201d It\u2019s true that the trajectory of aging varies from person to person. Biden is 81, and former President Donald Trump is 78. Both have already lived longer than the average American male lifespan of 74.8 years. This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, as both men have access to high-quality health care, and they don\u2019t drink or smoke. Biden\u2019s medical team has previously disclosed that he had two separate brain operations for aneurysms, including one that ruptured on the left side of his brain, in 1988, and there is some evidence that this type of hemorrhage may increase the risk of delayed cognitive problems later in life. Trump\u2019s father died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 93. Neither man has any other known risk factors for cognitive decline. Trump does at times display some of these same signs as Biden, including nonsensical rants as well as confusing names and current events. He said he\u2019d undergone the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, known as MoCA, in the past. According to his medical team, he received a perfect score when he took the test in 2018. Trump said he took a second cognitive test for his last physical exam at the end of 2023 and \u201caced it.\u201d In a note at the end of last year, Dr. Bruce Aronwald wrote that Trump\u2019s cognitive exams \u201cwere exceptional.\u201d Trump has not released his actual medical records, and memos about his health that were previously released have at times used hyperbolic language, unusual for medical documentation. The MoCA isn\u2019t the same level of cognitive testing the medical experts I spoke to would like to see Biden do, but it could serve as an initial screening tool for cognitive decline. For Trump, this might be considered either a screening test or a baseline to understand how his cognition might be changing. It\u2019s not clear that Biden has ever had such a baseline examination for comparison. An \u2018episode\u2019 or a \u2018condition\u2019? To be clear, there are aspects of aging that can be beneficial to the job of the presidency. Older people may \u201chave something called crystalized intelligence, which is the accumulated wisdom associated with the passage of time,\u201d according to Jay Olshansky, professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois-Chicago. This is our knowledge that comes from learning and experiences. On the other hand, there are definitely aspects of cognition that decline as we age \u2014 especially fluid abilities like processing speed, attention span and memory. This is normal and expected and doesn\u2019t necessarily stand in the way of someone\u2019s ability to do their job. But for a minority of us, that decline is steeper and can lead to dementia. Think of this as the difference between forgetting where you put your keys and not understanding what your keys are for. Still, determining a diagnosis of dementia is not as straightforward as many believe, and there are many other things that could account for the clinical observations I described above. A poor night\u2019s sleep or low blood sugar can have an impact. A viral illness or the medications used to treat those symptoms can result in temporary brain fog. Biden and his aides have said it was a \u201cbad night.\u201d The White House press team said Biden had a cold but did not take any medications to treat symptoms. After the debate, Jean-Pierre added that he had jet lag following overseas travel earlier in the month and worked late doing his presidential duties as well as preparing for the debate.\u00a0According to three sources briefed on these comments, Biden told Democratic governors during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he will stop scheduling events after 8 p.m. so he can get more sleep. The debate started at 9 p.m. Eastern. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question\u201d whether Biden\u2019s debate performance was an \u201cepisode\u201d or a \u201ccondition,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during an MSNBC interview Tuesday. That is precisely why detailed testing is important. It can help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning. As a doctor, I would want to understand the possibility of underlying dementia because, over the past several years, we have learned that there are medical treatments and lifestyle changes that can delay and, in some cases, even reverse the symptoms of the disease. These are hopeful days when it comes to dementia, and early diagnosis and treatment is better than it has ever been. Seeking answers With an election looming in November, we don\u2019t have answers about Biden. The White House has rejected requests from the press to release more medical records and question Biden\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor. Biden\u2019s press secretary said O\u2019Connor watched the debate and had no concerns afterward. Elected officials, like anyone else, are entitled to some level of privacy, and under federal health-care laws, there is no ability for someone to obtain personal medical information on an individual unless authorized, even the president. There is also no requirement for the president or candidates to disclose that information. Most do not. In fact, in the 23 years I have been reporting on these topics, only Sen. John McCain \u2014 one of the oldest presidential candidates in US history \u2014 shared all of his records with me and the American public. We often hear that observing a candidate on the campaign trail is the best assessment of the individual\u2019s physical and cognitive health. Back in 2020, Biden said he was \u201cconstantly tested\u201d by the work of running for president. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is watch me,\u201d he said then. The country is watching now, and that assessment gives cause for concern \u2014 and a need for transparent testing.

{"id": "2024_07_11_health_tampons-lead-arsenic-plastics-wellness", "text": "The average menstruating person will spend about five years of their total reproductive lifespan using an estimated 11,000 tampons, sanitary pads, panty liners and other menstrual products, experts say. What if some of those menstrual aids contain heavy metals or potentially toxic chemicals linked to chronic diseases and reproductive and developmental problems? Past research has found tampons and other menstrual products may contain chemicals such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS; plasticizers, also known as phthalates; and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, emitted as gas or fragrances from many consumer products. All these chemical groups have been shown to disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine system, which regulates sexual development, metabolism, blood sugar, mood, sleep and more. Recently, a small pilot study found arsenic and lead in organic and nonorganic tampons \u2014 and while the levels were small, there is no safe level of exposure to lead, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, that study was unable to determine whether heavy metals might leach from tampons into the body, thus making any potential health impact unknown, said senior study author Kathrin Schilling, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. \u201cI do not want people to panic, but to be aware that heavy metals have been found in these menstrual products,\u201d Schilling said. \u201cObviously, the next step is to do research that would show if the metals leach from the tampon into the body.\u201d The study was also unable to determine whether any metal, even if released into the body, can be absorbed into the vaginal lining and subsequently into the bloodstream, said Amanda Hils, a spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration, which regulates tampons and other menstrual products as medical devices. \u201cWe plan to evaluate the study closely, and take any action warranted to safeguard the health of consumers who use these products,\u201d Hils said in an email. Vaginal tissue is more permeable than other parts of the body, so if studies were to find that heavy metals \u2014 or worrisome chemicals \u2014 do leach from menstrual products into the body, it could be a significant problem, said Anna Pollack, associate professor of global and community health at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. She was not involved in the pilot study. \u201cI am most concerned with menstrual products that are used inside the body,\u201d said Pollack, who coauthored a review of 10 years of studies on contaminants in tampons, sanitary pads, menstrual cups and other products. \u201cHowever, there is no reason for people to be afraid to use menstrual products at this time,\u201d she added. \u201cI would just be aware of the issue and monitor any research that develops.\u201d Heavy metals in tampons Schilling and her team tested 30 tampons from 14 brands purchased from major online retailers and stores in the United States, United Kingdom and Greece. The researchers conducted a blinded study, so they did not know the brands. The team ran tests for 16 heavy metals: arsenic, barium, calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, strontium, vanadium and zinc. \u201cWe found an average of 100 nanograms per gram of lead, and 2 nanograms per gram of arsenic in the tampons,\u201d Schilling said, \u201cbut there was no detectable level of chromium and no detectable level of mercury, which is very good.\u201d Organic tampons contained higher levels of arsenic, while nonorganic tampons had higher levels of lead, the study found. \u201cThe average lead concentration in\u00a0tampons\u00a0was about 10 times higher than the maximum levels currently allowed in drinking water,\u201d Schilling said, adding that arsenic levels were five times lower than current limits for drinking water. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that arsenic shouldn\u2019t be present in\u00a0tampons\u00a0at all, and we don\u2019t yet understand the effects of vaginal exposure since it hasn\u2019t been studied,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no safe level of lead exposure, and it has been shown to cause reproductive health issues in women.\u201d How did detectable levels of these heavy metals get into tampons in the first place? First, most tampons are made of cotton or a mixture of cotton and rayon, a semi-synthetic fiber made from\u00a0wood pulp. Arsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, while lead and other heavy metals are a natural part of Earth\u2019s crust \u2014 so plants can easily absorb metals as they develop. Additional chemicals found in menstrual products The soil and water of the United States and other parts of the world are also heavily contaminated with both metals and chemicals used to produce plastic products, experts say. Heavy metals can be byproducts of manufacturing plants, mining facilities and smelting processes, while PFAS and other chemicals enter the air, soil and groundwater from human waste, consumer products discarded in landfills and byproducts from fluorochemical manufacturing plants. Nearly half of the drinking water in the US is contaminated with some of the 12,000 types of PFAS, according to an August 2023 study by the US Geological Survey. Chemicals called phthalates have been discovered in sanitary pads, panty liners and tampons, according to Pollack\u2019s review. Phthalates are in consumer products such as shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys and have been linked to\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and undescended testes\u00a0in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and\u00a0testosterone levels\u00a0in adult males. Both phthalates and PFAS have also been linked to the rise in early menarche in teens and preteens. In 2022, advocacy groups Mamavation and Environmental Health News, in collaboration with the Institute for Green Science\u00a0at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, looked at levels of PFAS in menstrual products. The investigation found 48%\u00a0of sanitary pads, incontinence pads and tested panty liners contained PFAS, as did\u00a022%\u00a0of tampons and\u00a065%\u00a0of period underwear. Manufacturers use PFAS, often called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they\u00a0do not easily break down\u00a0in the environment, in\u00a0food packaging\u00a0to prevent grease and water from soaking through food wrappers and beverage cups. The chemicals are also used to make carpeting, clothing and furniture resistant to stains, water and grease damage. A February 2023 study found PFAS may alter hormonal and metabolic pathways needed for growth and development in young children, teens and young adults. PFAS chemicals have also been linked to an increased risk of adult kidney cancer and abnormally high cholesterol levels and decreased antibody response to vaccines in both adults and children. However, the mere presence of a chemical is not an indication of risk or adverse effect, according to the American Chemistry Council, an industry association. \u201cAs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0emphasizes, \u2018The measurement of an environmental chemical in a person\u2019s blood or urine is a measure of exposure; it does not by itself mean that the chemical causes disease or an adverse effect,\u2019\u201d a spokesperson for the council told CNN. How to protect yourself Tampon makers and the FDA recommend that tampons not be used at night or for longer than eight hours due to a greater risk of toxic shock syndrome, a deadly bacterial infection that can cause organ failure and death if not treated. That advice also applies to anyone concerned about heavy metals or chemicals in their menstrual products, said Nancy King Reame, professor emerita of health promotion and risk reduction at the School of Nursing at Columbia University Medical Center. \u201cBut because the vaginal microbiome, including menstrual fluid, is the least understood organ system in the body, real world advice on the use of period products based on these findings is premature to say the least,\u201d said Reame, who assisted on the tampon study. Other recommendations include washing your hands before and after inserting or removing a tampon to reduce bacterial spread, changing tampons every four to eight hours and using the lowest absorbency possible. \u201cIf you can wear one tampon up to eight hours without changing it, the absorbency may be too high,\u201d the FDA noted on its website. Signs of toxic shock, which include a sudden high fever, diarrhea, dizziness, vomiting or a rash that looks like a sunburn, need immediate medical attention. In addition, \u201cif you have discomfort, pain or other unexpected symptoms like unusual discharge when trying to insert or wear a tampon, or if you have an allergic reaction, stop using tampons and contact your provider,\u201d the FDA said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/tampons-lead-arsenic-plastics-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_immunization-rates-report", "text": "Although the Covid-19 pandemic saw\u00a0unprecedented\u00a0speed in the development and distribution of coronavirus vaccines, experts say it was also marked by a significant and concerning drop in the rate of routine vaccinations. New data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund shows the world has yet to recover. The pandemic signified a \u201chistoric backslide,\u201d according to Dr. Katherine O\u2019Brien, director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biological at WHO. Now, she says, the race is on to reach children who missed shots during the pandemic and to restore and strengthen immunization services beyond pre-pandemic levels. WHO and UNICEF\u2019s 2023 immunization coverage report, released Sunday, is the world\u2019s largest dataset on immunization trends for vaccinations against 14 diseases. It analyzed estimates from 185 countries and used a third dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine \u2014 which is recommended for 1-year-olds \u2014 as the global marker for immunization coverage. The data revealed that\u00a0previous progress\u00a0in reaching pre-pandemic immunization levels has stalled. Worldwide DTP3 coverage was 84% in 2023, the same as in 2022 but below 86% recorded in 2019. The report\u2019s authors say this is a derailment on the trajectory toward the Immunization Agenda 2030\u00a0goal\u00a0of 90% coverage for essential childhood and adolescent vaccines. This stagnation reflects ongoing challenges with disruptions in health-care services, logistical challenges, vaccine hesitancy and inequities in access to services, the organizations said in a news release. The new report also showed that the number of children who had not received a single dose of DTP3 increased by 600,000 from 2022 to 2023, leaving 2.7 million more children un- and under-immunized than before the pandemic. \u201cToday\u2019s release highlights that we are off track and need to accelerate efforts to meet this challenge,\u201d said Dr. Ephrem T. Lemango, associate director for health and global chief of immunization at UNICEF. Bright spots around the globe Amid the overall challenge, however, \u201cthere are places where there are positive signs,\u201d Lemango told CNN. The data showed that the African region made the most progress last year in overall coverage, and countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria made notable strides in recovering post-pandemic, according to O\u2019Brien and Lemango. \u201cLow-income countries \u2026 where the health systems were hit the hardest by the pandemic \u2026 are starting to see some improvement compared with 2022,\u201d O\u2019Brien said at a news briefing. In Africa, vaccine coverage in the first year of life increased despite a rising number of births, which required more vaccinations to maintain the same coverage level, according to O\u2019Brien. The 2023 report also found HPV vaccine coverage in girls increased 7%, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Studies\u00a0have shown that the vaccine can reduce cervical cancer rates in women by 87%. However, current coverage remains well below the 90% target to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, reaching only 56% of adolescent girls in high-income countries and 23% in low- and middle-income countries, according to the news release. All eyes on measles WHO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that global immunization efforts have saved 154 million lives \u2014 6 lives every minute \u2014 over the past 50 years. About 60% of that can be attributed to the measles vaccine, the organization says, projecting it to be the \u201ctop contributor to preventing deaths in the future.\u201d But the 2023 data revealed that measles coverage in countries with large or disruptive outbreaks after the pandemic is too low to control further outbreaks. Nearly 35 million children were left with no or only partial protection, a decline the report called \u201cconcerning,\u201d even for countries that have not had outbreaks in the past five years. Low vaccination coverage was a major factor in outbreaks in 103 countries \u2013 accounting for roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s infant population \u2013 in the past five years, said the report. Cases of the highly contagious virus have also reemerged in the United States. In 2023, the 92% of US children that have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2 fell below the federal target of 95%, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that year. \u201cMeasles outbreaks continue to rise as measles vaccination coverage stalls,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cThe world saw over 300,000 confirmed measles cases in 2023, which is an almost threefold increase compared to what we had in 2022.\u201d According to the organizations, there is hope that the introduction of new and underutilized vaccines, through partnerships such as\u00a0Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will expand protection against infectious diseases like measles. \u201cThis progress is crucial in reducing the burden of diseases that have long plagued communities,\u201d Lemango added. Immunizations in conflict zones Over half of unvaccinated children in 2023 lived in countries experiencing fragility, conflict and vulnerability, the data shows, even though these places account for only 28% of new births worldwide. Many of these countries have had \u201cworrying declines in performance since 2019,\u201d the report says. Of children who did not receive any vaccines in 2023, 59% were in only 10 countries. Places such as Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan are new to this list, the report says. \u201cThe protection of children in any conflict setting is of critical importance,\u201d WHO\u2019s O\u2019Brien said. \u201c[Conflict] creates an environment where infectious diseases have a big risk of causing large and impactful outbreaks.\u201d Some countries that experienced conflict, such as Ukraine, had initial dips in immunization coverage but did not see an overall drop in vaccinations. But in other areas, such as Sudan and parts of the Middle East, that wasn\u2019t the case. There was a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in vaccine coverage in Gaza in 2023, one not seen to the same extent in Israel, according to O\u2019Brien. Data in the report from Gaza was submitted for only January through September, and it \u201cdoesn\u2019t cover what is happening in 2024,\u201d Lemango noted. Analyzing immunization coverage in other areas of conflict is \u201ca mixed picture,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019ll give the example, however, of Ukraine, which has had an improvement in coverage. Not all conflict areas result in a reduction in coverage,\u201d she said, referencing resilient programs, the nature of conflict and the safety of health workers. According to Lemango, there is a \u201cclear pattern\u201d in Ukraine where service availability typically decreases at the beginning of a conflict and resumes once assistance and resources flow in. The issue, he said, is how to maintain this improved state. Global reach of local vaccines Vaccine coverage in the United States ranges between 95% and 98%, an indication of good availability of health services, according to Lemango. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Americans are entirely protected. \u201cUntil everyone or every country has the ability and the reach for every child to be vaccinated, the vulnerability to have outbreaks, epidemics and potentially pandemics is always imminent,\u201d he said. In April 2023, WHO and UNICEF partnered with organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to launch The Big Catch Up initiative in response to declining levels of vaccine coverage after the pandemic. The effort aims to boost childhood immunizations and fill gaps between pre- and post-pandemic work, according to the partnership. Achieving these goals and aiming for those outlined in Immunization Agenda 2030 will require collaboration and investment in innovation, according to the IA2030 Partnership Council. \u201cThe future is likely to be a future where we\u2019ll have many vaccines that are able to prevent preventable diseases,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cImmunization stands as one of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/immunization-rates-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_mounjaro-ozempic-weight-loss-study-says", "text": "People taking tirzepatide injections lost more weight and were more likely to reach specific weight loss targets than those taking semaglutide, according to a new study. Researchers from Truveta, a health data analytics company, analyzed electronic health records for more than 18,000 adults, all of whom had overweight or obesity, who were using these medications in the real world between May 2022 and September 2023. The findings were published Monday in the JAMA Internal Medicine medical journal. Both medications were effective: The vast majority of people using either tirzepatide or semaglutide lost at least 5% of their starting body weight after one year of use. But 82% of people taking tirzepatide reached this important clinical benchmark, compared with about 67% of those taking semaglutide. And people taking tirzepatide were more than twice as likely to lose at least 15% of their starting weight than those taking semaglutide: about 42% compared with 18% after one year of use. Average weight loss was also consistently higher among those taking tirzepatide over time. After three months, people taking tirzepatide had lost about 6% of their body weight, on average, compared with an average of less than 4% loss among those taking semaglutide. At six months, average weight loss was 10% on tirzepatide and about 6% on semaglutide. And by one year, average weight loss was nearly double for those taking tirzepatide: more than 15%, compared with about 8% for those taking semaglutide. Tirzepatide and semaglutide both mimic the effects of the gut hormone GLP-1, which stimulates the body\u2019s production of insulin and slows the passage of food through the stomach. GLP-1 also signals the brain to help control appetite. Tirzepatide also stimulates a second gut hormone, called GIP, which may help boost its effects. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved versions of tirzepatide and semaglutide to treat both type 2 diabetes and obesity. Eli Lilly manufactures tirzepatide under the brand name Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for chronic weight management, while Novo Nordisk manufacturers semaglutide as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight management. The FDA approved higher doses of both tirzepatide and semaglutide to treat weight loss, but the new study looked only at the doses to treat type 2 diabetes. About half of the people who were included in this study had type 2 diabetes, while the other half had no indication of a diabetes diagnosis in their health records and were probably using these medications off-label for weight management at their doctor\u2019s discretion. When the findings from this study were first released in a preprint last year, Novo Nordisk told CNN that it wasn\u2019t a fair comparison. \u201cThe doses of semaglutide evaluated in this analysis have not been investigated for chronic weight management, and there are no head-to-head trials that have reported which evaluate Wegovy\u00a0and tirzepatide,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. According to the new study, individuals with type 2 diabetes had less significant weight loss than those without a diagnosis \u2014 but average weight loss was still greater among those taking tirzepatide. The researchers did not track mild gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting, noting that these types of complaints might not be captured in patient records consistently. But the risk of more serious adverse outcomes \u2014 such as bowel obstruction, gasteoparesis or pancreatitis \u2014 were found to be similar among those taking tirzepatide and semaglutide. Along with side effects, people who did not lose weight while taking these medications may be more likely to stop or switch drugs, the researchers say. Discontinuation was common \u2014 more than half of patients stopped their treatment before the end of the study \u2014 but rates were similar among those taking tirzepatide and those taking semaglutide. The findings from this study align with clinical trial results, but the study authors note that more research is needed to compare the effects that tirzepatide and semaglutide have on other key health outcomes, such as heart-related events.

{"id": "2024_05_29_europe_horses-remains-graves-france-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Archaeologists in France have uncovered nine \u201castonishing\u201d graves containing the skeletons of 28 horses that were buried about 2,000 years ago, though their precise cause of death remains a mystery. Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added. Other finds at the site, which sits on the slope of a valley, include buildings, pits, ditches and a road that archaeologists dated to the late 5th and early 6th centuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/europe/horses-remains-graves-france-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}

When I tried camper van life for the first time, I went all in. For three weeks, my husband and I drove a kitted-out, circa 2012 Ford Econoline van across North America, traveling from northern New Jersey to Los Angeles as we wound our way along the length of Route 66 in November 2019. It was a bold move, but I knew it was the most cost-efficient and efficient-efficient way to see as much of \u201cthe Mother Road\u201d as we could. My hope was that by renting a camper van, we\u2019d save money on purchased meals and hotel rooms and also feel more immersed in the journey and deeply connected to each town we visited. Our first night in the Bloomington, Illinois, Walmart parking lot was a little nerve-racking. I lay in my sleeping bag, listening to the activity beyond the van and wondering if we could handle this adventure. But after the first successful sleepover, we quickly settled into a routine. We\u2019d wake up each morning for a quick bathroom run and even shower at some of the surprisingly luxurious recreational vehicle parks we patronized. Then we\u2019d cook breakfast on our camp stove at the rear of the van and hit the road by 8:30 or 9 a.m. After a day covering roughly 130 miles and experiencing the historic sites, local museums, former filling stations and proudly kitschy roadside attractions along Route 66, we\u2019d make sure to arrive at our nightly destination by 4:30 p.m. \u2014 sundown in November comes early. By the time we dropped off the van near Los Angeles International Airport in late November, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a new but dear friend on the last day of summer camp. We\u2019d unwind, explore the sights of the town, treat ourselves to dinner away from the van, then bunk down in our sleeping bags and do it all again the next day. (We spent two-thirds of the trip sleeping in the van and the other third in historic lodgings along the route, such as Boots Court in Carthage, Missouri, and the El Rancho in Gallup, New Mexico.) The benefits of camper van travel Now, I\u2019m not saying you must spend weeks on an epic road trip to fully experience the joy of a camper van. And I\u2019m certainly not saying you need to sell all your possessions and become a full-time van lifer \u2014 I\u2019m grateful to return to my house and my cats after every trip. But even a few days of traveling and living in a camper van can give you a whole new perspective on yourself and the world around you. When you\u2019re in a camper van, everything you need is within reach \u2014 to an extent. I loved the challenge of condensing our lives into approximately 75 square feet and finding creative ways to live comfortably but efficiently. The morning coffee? It\u2019s right there. Your outfit for the day? Just reach behind you. If you need to change your shoes into hiking boots, grab a raincoat for an unexpected downpour, refuel with a quick snack or recharge with a 20-minute power nap, you don\u2019t need to go far. And you don\u2019t have to repack your bags to leave a hotel every morning. After the first night, I embraced the security and sanctuary of the van, knowing that whatever we had was around us. If we couldn\u2019t find it right away, it wasn\u2019t lost. We had exactly everything we needed \u2014 everything except, well, a bathroom, which brings me to the next life-changing aspect of a camper van. Camper van life makes you brave and gets you out there, interacting with others and connecting with the world. You\u2019re always in the environment, not separated by hotel corridors and lobbies. You\u2019re discovering creative places to stay for the night, looking forward to chatting with bartenders during the nightly dinner at a local restaurant or just fielding questions from strangers about the van and your trip. During our Route 66 adventure, our van prompted exchanges and allowed us to have moments we would likely have missed in a rental car. In Arcadia, Oklahoma, we stopped by Pops 66 Soda Ranch and struck up a conversation with a woman admiring our brightly painted camper van. She told us about one of the chairs at the nearby Oklahoma City National Memorial representing a boy named Zackary who loved collecting pennies. The next morning, we found Zackary\u2019s chair and placed a penny on it for him. Because the van functioned as a full campsite rig, we didn\u2019t have to figure out the logistics of bringing or renting equipment to camp in Joshua Tree National Park in California. We spent two nights in wonder among the granite boulders, with Cassiopeia shining brightly above, and two mornings waking up with the sun and the scent of high desert air. Tips for trying the van life Ready to try camper van travel? Companies rent vans that come fully equipped with mini kitchens and bedding, so it\u2019s almost as easy as booking an Airbnb. Some even come with toilets and showers, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a deal-breaker. Rent one for a quick round-trip weekend visit or explore further by taking a one-way jaunt to another rental hub and then flying home. If you\u2019re itching to have a new type of travel experience, you\u2019ll find it behind the rolling door of a camper van. As another well-loved saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey\u201d \u2014 but with a camper van, you\u2019ll get to appreciate both at once.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/travel/van-life-travel-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_ecigarettes-nicotine-exposure-children-wellness", "text": "Children who live in homes where adults use e-cigarettes are exposed to significantly less nicotine through secondhand aerosols than children in homes where adults use traditional cigarettes, a new study shows. But vaping still exposes kids to nicotine and may present other risks, too. To keep children completely nicotine-free, according to the researchers, people shouldn\u2019t smoke or vape around kids at all. The researchers said they did the study in part because of the perception that e-cigarettes were safer than traditional cigarettes and because people are using them more than regular cigarettes inside the home. The study published Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Vaping has been promoted to adults as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes and as a potential smoking cessation device, although experts say more research is needed. One reason some doctors prefer that their patients use e-cigarettes is because they expose users to fewer toxic chemicals such as tobacco and the dozens of other carcinogens found in cigarettes, like N-nitrosamines and aldehydes, that can cause cancer and other serious health problems. But what the new study shows, experts say, is that harm reduction for the user is not necessarily the same as harm removal for everyone around them \u2014 and this could be a significant issue for children, whose lungs are still developing. The study looked at the lives of 1,777 children who were were part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a racially diverse government study designed to continuously assess US child and adult health and nutrition. Tobacco use in the home was reported by parents or guardians. More than 270 of the kids were exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke at home, 45 were exposed to secondhand e-cigarette vapor only, and 1,476 had neither kind of user in their home. Scientists included children between the ages of 3 and 11 because they were less likely than older kids to use nicotine products. The researchers determined children\u2019s nicotine levels using blood samples taken between 2017 and 2020. Although new vaping devices have been introduced to the US since that time and exposure levels may be different depending on device, the authors say their study can provide a good general understanding of nicotine exposure in the home. Exposure levels in the study are generally considered an undercount, they said. The children in the study who had the most nicotine exposure by far were those who lived with people who smoked traditional tobacco products like cigarettes. With these products, kids have two chances to be exposed to nicotine: when the user exhales and in between puffs, when a lit cigarette or cigar sits in an ashtray. E-cigarette users are believed to absorb 99% of the nicotine they inhale, but some of it gets released when they exhale after taking a drag on their device. The children in the study with the lowest nicotine levels were those who had no exposure to secondhand aerosols of any kind at home. Kids who were exposed to e-cigarettes had some nicotine in their bodies, but they had absorbed 84% less than those who lived in homes with people who smoked only tobacco. The takeaway from the research, the authors said, is that people need to stop any kind of vaping or smoking\u00a0at home. \u201cVaping inside the home around children should be avoided given that, even though nicotine itself has a limited risk profile, the increased absorption of nicotine from secondhand vapor suggests that the children were also exposed to other potentially harmful excipients from e-cigarettes,\u201d the study says. Earlier studies have found similar nicotine exposure among children in homes with cigarette and e-cigarette users. Dr. Terry Gordon, a professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU\u2019s Langone Health who has done nicotine exposure research, said he was surprised that nicotine levels weren\u2019t higher in households with e-cigarette users. Some of his research has shown much higher nicotine levels in e-cigarette households than in the new study. Either way, he said, all of these studies should be a good reminder to vape users that they need to be careful around others, especially kids. \u201cMost of us toxicologists, we believe e-cigs are safer, but no one is ready to say they are safe because of the primary users of the devices as well as those who are exposed to secondary aerosols,\u201d said Gordon, who was not involved in the latest study. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how harmful secondhand vape aerosols can be. It took years to understand this with cigarettes, said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonologist and volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association. Secondhand smoke from cigarettes has done real damage, said Galiatsatos, who was not involved in the new study. He said he has treated an entire generation of people who have developed cancer and other lung problems not because they smoked but because they grew up around adults who did. In 2020, Galiatsatos published what is believed to be the first study to document significant injury in an adult with secondhand e-cigarette exposure. He says adults shouldn\u2019t take a chance with a child\u2019s health by vaping around them. \u201cA child who is growing, their lungs are so vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t completely know the effect it\u2019s going to have on the next generation, just like we didn\u2019t know what secondhand smoke did, but why even put your child in a position of becoming a future patient?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/ecigarettes-nicotine-exposure-children-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_health_plague-human-risk-explainer", "text": "Plague, one of the deadliest bacterial infections in human history, caused an estimated 50 million deaths in Europe during the Middle Ages when it was known as the Black Death. While extremely rare, the disease is still around today, with a man in New Mexico dying of plague in March after being hospitalized for the disease and a person in Oregon being diagnosed with bubonic\u00a0plague in February after likely being infected by their pet cat. It\u2019s transmitted by fleas that live on rodents. Symptoms usually appear within one to seven days after infection and include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, in the groin, armpit or neck areas as well as fever, chills and coughing. How do you get the plague? Plague affects humans and other mammals. Usually, people get the plague after being bitten by a rodent flea carrying Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the disease, or by handling an infected animal, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cats, which become sick themselves, can directly infect humans, while hardier dogs may simply carry the fleas back to their owners. People also can become sick by inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. The bacteria persists because low levels circulate among populations of certain rodents, according to the CDC. These infected animals and their fleas serve as long-term reservoirs for the bacteria. \u201cThe reason why it hasn\u2019t been eliminated is because there\u2019s an animal reservoir,\u201d Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,\u00a0said in February. \u201cThe bacteria can infect animals, and because we can\u2019t treat all animals\u00a0in the wild, it persists in nature and thus occasionally\u00a0causes a limited number of human cases.\u201d Where can you get the plague? Plague occurs naturally in rural areas in the western United States, particularly Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. That\u2019s where an average of seven human plague cases are reported each year to the CDC. But significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia. From 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths, according to\u00a0the World Health Organization.\u00a0It said the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru. There are three types of plague \u2013 bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic plague. With the pneumonic form of plague \u2013 which means it affects the lungs \u2013 there is a risk of direct transmission from human to human. That was the case\u00a0in the large outbreak in Madagascar in 2017, where there were 2,348 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and 202 deaths. The last urban plague epidemic in the United States occurred in Los Angeles from 1924 through 1925, the CDC said. How worried should I be? Modern antibiotics \u2013 streptomycin is the usual first-line treatment \u2013 can prevent complications and death if given promptly after symptoms appear. The treatment is used for the two most common types of plague: bubonic and pneumonic. \u201cThe reason why it caused such widespread death and destruction in the Middle Ages is because we didn\u2019t have antibiotics at that time,\u201d Barouch said in February about plague. \u201cAlthough it can be a serious illness, it\u2019s usually easily treatable with antibiotics as long as it\u2019s caught early. So now it\u2019s a very treatable disease. It shouldn\u2019t create the fear that people had in the Middle Ages of the Black Death,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone develops symptoms consistent with the plague \u2014 usually the initial symptoms are fever, chills and swollen lymph node \u2014 then seek medical attention, because at the early stages, the plague is easily treatable with antibiotics.\u201d Bubonic plague has a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60%\u00a0when left untreated,\u00a0while pneumonic plague, when left untreated, is always fatal,\u00a0according to WHO. However, a strain of bubonic plague with\u00a0high-level resistance to streptomycin\u00a0has been seen in Madagascar. More than 80% of US cases have been the bubonic form, which is the most common form of infection. Untreated bubonic plague can turn into the more serious pneumonic plague, which causes rapidly developing pneumonia after bacteria spread to the lungs. Is there a vaccine for the plague? There is a\u00a0Yersinia pestis vaccine, but it is recommended only for high-risk people like scientists who work directly with the bacterium, Dr. Harish Moorjani, an infectious disease specialist at Phelps Hospital in New York, part of Northwell Health, said in February. \u201cMost people don\u2019t need the vaccine,\u201d Moorjani said. A 2019 review\u00a0of experimental plague vaccines suggests that researchers are exploring a variety of approaches to develop an effective plague inoculation. Since different vaccine designs lead to different mechanisms of immunity, the authors conclude that combinations of different types might overcome the limitations of individual vaccines and effectively prevent a potential plague outbreak. How do you protect yourself and your family? Key steps for prevention of plague include eliminating nesting places for rodents around your home, sheds, garages and recreation areas by removing brush, rock piles, trash and excess firewood. Report sick or dead animals to law enforcement or your local health officials; do not pick up or touch them yourself. If you absolutely must handle a sick or dead animal, wear gloves. If you live in an endemic area,\u00a0take added precautions. Use insect repellent that contains DEET to prevent flea bites and treat dogs and cats for fleas regularly. Do not sleep with your pets as this increases your risk of getting plague. Finally, your pets should not hunt or roam rodent habitats, such as prairie dog colonies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/plague-human-risk-explainer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_health_cardiac-arrest-anxiety-depression-women-wellness", "text": "The care that comes after a cardiac arrest should include supporting mental health \u2014 especially for women, new research has found. In the five years that followed an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or OHCA, in which the heart suddenly stops beating, women were more likely than men to receive medication to treat anxiety or depression, according to a report published Monday in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. \u201cWe recommend monitoring of social and mental well being in individuals who survived an OHCA, not just directly after the event but also in the long-term,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author, Dr. Robin Smits, in an email. \u201cThis seems particularly relevant in women but will likely also benefit men.\u201d Researchers analyzed data from 259 women and 996 men in the Netherlands who survived at least 30 days after a cardiac arrest that took place outside a hospital between 2009 and 2015. The team compared the data on patients\u2019 socioeconomic status and mental health with those in the general population, according to the study. The amount of women taking anxiety or depression medications after cardiac arrest was also greater than in women in the general population, said Smits, a postdoctoral researcher at Amsterdam University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \u201cFurther investigation may shed light into which interventions are necessary for physicians to be able to help individuals thrive after OHCA,\u201d Smits said. Researchers have been learning more and more about how closely connected mental and cardiac health are, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. One in five people hospitalized for heart attack (a blockage of blood flow to the heart) or chest pain develop major depression \u2014 about four times the rate in the general population, according to the\u00a0American Heart Association. One in three\u00a0stroke survivors become depressed, along with\u00a0up to half\u00a0of those who undergo heart bypass surgery, past studies found. \u201cMental health and stress make cardiac events worse and more frequent, and we know that cardiac events make mental health worse,\u201d he said. Just the start delving into mental and cardiac health This new study investigates an important topic but it\u2019s just the beginning, Freeman said. While the authors did account for factors that might skew the results, there are a lot of them, he said. For example, the research was only able to look at the number of people prescribed medication \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they were the only people experiencing anxiety or depression, Smits said. \u201cThe results may also in part reflect that men may less often seek care for mental health and are perhaps less frequently assessed and prescribed medication,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cMoreover, the data do not fully reflect lived experience, such as forced changes in job responsibilities or effect in other areas of life.\u201d But this study highlights an important concept: that men and women often experience the world differently, and providers need to be conscious of that to give everyone their best care,\u00a0 Freeman said. Checking in on emotional well-being The biggest lesson of this latest research is for loved ones and health care providers to check in on people who have experienced cardiac arrest, Freeman said. \u201cIs there a strategy that we should be taking that\u2019s more proactive after people have a cardiac arrest, to sort of make sure that they\u2019re back on their feet, that they understand that they are amazing survivors in many cases?\u201d he said. Even if the doctor you are following up with isn\u2019t a psychiatrist, it is important to keep an open line of communication about your well-being \u2014 and then you may be referred to a mental health professional, he said. Fortunately, there are a lot of strategies to improve mental health. Past studies have shown cognitive behavioral therapy, regular exercise and proper sleep to be effective tools for managing emotional welfare. \u201cAs a physician, how do we help people avoid or treat these problems as they arise? Or even before they arise?\u201d Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/health/cardiac-arrest-anxiety-depression-women-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}

The case was flagged Friday from preliminary test results, and the potential source of the infection is still under investigation, the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment said in a\u00a0news release. The plague is an infectious disease caused by bacterium, Yersinia pestis, transmitted by fleas. Although it is best known for \u201cThe Black Death,\u201d an outbreak that killed millions of Europeans during the Middle Ages, the bacteria circulates naturally among wild rodents and\u00a0rarely\u00a0infects humans today, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Plague is transmitted to humans through bites from infected fleas, contact with infected animals or inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. Anyone who develops symptoms of plague should get medical attention immediately, the CDC says. Typical symptoms include sudden fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and, commonly, swollen lymph nodes with pain. \u201cPlague can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but an infected person must be treated promptly to avoid serious complications or death,\u201d said Alicia Solis, program manager of the Office of Communicable Disease and Emergency Preparedness at the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment, in the news release. \u201cWe advise all individuals to protect themselves and their pets from plague,\u201d the department says. One way to avoid infection is to eliminate places where wild rodents can exist around humans such as brush, rock piles, trash and piles of lumber around homes, garages, sheds and recreation areas, according to the department. Taking precautions around pets can also reduce risk of transmission. The department suggests treating dogs and cats for fleas, keeping pet food in rodent-proof containers and not letting pets roam in rodent areas or sleep in bed with you. From 1970 to 2022, there were 67 reported cases of plague in Colorado, according to the CDC. Worldwide, 3,248 human plague cases were reported from 2010 to 2015, most commonly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Peru, the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0found. \u201cA plague vaccine is no longer available in the United States,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cNew plague vaccines are in development but are not expected to be commercially available in the immediate future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/human-plague-case-colorado/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}

When the 4-year-old English bulldog tried, his misshapen eyelids would roll inward, causing his eyelashes to scrape against his cornea. \u201cHave you ever had something scratch your cornea? It is profoundly painful,\u201d said Dr. Dana Varble, chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community, a nonprofit organization that provides learning opportunities for veterinarians. \u201cFor these poor animals, every blink is excruciating,\u201d Varble added. \u201cThey often squint in order to see, and that can make the eyelids turn in even more.\u201d After Hamilton had plastic surgery on his eyes \u2014 what humans would call a nip and tuck \u2014 he was able to see and interact with his owners with no pain. \u201cThese nip and tucks are not cosmetic; they are critical to the health of the animal,\u201d Varble said. \u201cWhen the eyelids roll in and the lashes rub the cornea, eventually the cornea gets scarred and (this) causes visual problems, or even blindness.\u201d Some canine breeds are genetically more likely to develop eyelid problems, such as dogs with shortened muzzles and flattened faces \u2014 think boxers, Boston terriers, French bulldogs, Pekingese, pugs and shih tzus, to name a few. In Hamilton\u2019s case, his vision worsened after he gained weight, with his beefy cheeks forcing the eyelids to fold inward. However, symptoms of the painful condition can show up in puppyhood, often disguised as behavioral problems, Varble said. \u201cWe see these 6-month-old puppies who are cranky, they\u2019re not training well, they\u2019re still not housebroken or getting over that puppy nipping stage,\u201d she said. \u201cYou take a closer look, and they are constantly in pain every time they blink their eyes \u2014 no wonder they\u2019re not paying attention to training.\u201d Cats can suffer, too Large cat breeds with flat faces, such as Persians and Himalayans, or round, puffy cheeks such as Siberians, Ragdolls and Maine coons, can also have issues with malformed eyelids, although it\u2019s not as common as in dogs. A 6-month-old Maine coon named Jinxy frequently kept his painful eyes shut until his owner took him to a specialist in Athens, Georgia, trained to perform complex eyelid surgery. \u201cThese eyelid diseases happen in people as well, and I like to tell my clients we practice them on humans first to make sure they are safe before we do the surgery on their dog or cat,\u201d said Dr. Kate Myrna, an associate professor of veterinary ophthalmology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia in Athens. After his surgery, Jinxy was able to open his eyes and purr at his owner without pain, Myrna said. \u201cThese are necessary surgeries. If a pet is born with too much eyelid, it\u2019s not going to get better on its own,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile surgery sounds serious, it creates almost instant pain relief, and the eye is one of the fastest healing organs in the body.\u201d However, cats can be a bit more difficult to treat \u201cbecause when you try to get in close with that bright light, they usually have big feelings about it,\u201d Myrna said. \u201cSo don\u2019t be surprised if your vet needs to wrap your cat into a \u2018kitty burrito\u2019 to conduct the exam,\u201d she said, referring to putting a towel around a cat for safe handling. A lack of trained specialists When Denali, a mastiff mix, was rescued at 4 months old by Varble, she had bulging red glands in the corner of each eye. \u201cWe call it cherry eye, because it looks like a small cherry in the corner of their eye, but it\u2019s actually the tear glands behind the third eyelid rolling outward, instead of being tucked in as they should,\u201d Varble said. While not always painful, the condition can be irritating for dogs and puts them at risk of injury or infection from pawing at the eye. Left untreated, the condition can lead to dry eye and the potential for blindness, experts say. While all breeds are susceptible to cherry eye, it\u2019s most common among basset hounds, beagles, cocker spaniels, Great Danes, rottweilers, and dogs with flat faces such as boxers, bulldogs and Pekingese. Surgery to correct cherry eye can be relatively simple for an experienced veterinary surgeon, but some circumstances can be more challenging and require the skill of a vet trained in ophthalmology. \u201cDenali had a very severe case,\u201d Varble said. \u201cThankfully, the specialist was able to save the gland in her eye. That\u2019s important because if we have to remove the gland it increases the incidence of dry eye in those dogs after surgery.\u201d Unfortunately, there are only 500 veterinary ophthalmologists in the United States, making it difficult at times for pet owners and general vets to get the quick treatment needed, according to Varble. To overcome that obstacle, the North American Veterinary Community holds periodic trainings so a general vet can become more comfortable treating simple injuries and eye abnormalities. \u201cIf our general practice veterinarians can handle more than just first aid for eyes, they can free up the specialists for serious cases and significant emergencies,\u201d Varble said. \u201cIt just makes everybody more efficient and is better for the pets and their owners as well.\u201d Droopy eyes and signs of injury There are other eye problems that require plastic surgery as well. Mastiffs and bloodhounds are often born with \u201cbig droopy eyelids\u201d that refuse to close completely, Varble said. \u201cTheir lower lids can be so far down that the eyelids literally don\u2019t shut all the way when the upper lid comes down,\u201d Varble said. \u201cThat can create dry spots, and the dogs are more prone to get dust and other things stuck in their eyes.\u201d Unfortunately, a healthy eye can turn into a vision-threatening emergency rapidly, making it important that pet owners act as soon as they notice any significant irritation, Myrna said. \u201cIf your pet has morning sleep or goo in the corner of their eyes, or a bit of a discharge that is common with some cat and dog breeds, that\u2019s probably not a reason to go rushing into your vet,\u201d Myrna said. Signs of significant injury include redness in one or both eyes, excessive squinting or twitching of an eyelid, or an eye that remains closed or is unable to open, Myrna said. Another sign is a blue haze over the entire eye that lasts more than two hours. \u201cIt\u2019s different than cataracts, which are a white or blue color in the pupil,\u201d Myrna said. \u201cWhen the whole surface of the eye looks hazy blue, that\u2019s usually because it\u2019s waterlogged, and that\u2019s a sign of a problem that we need to look at right away. \u201cRemember, a scratched eye can easily become infected and can go from a superficial, easy to treat injury to needing surgery or the pet will lose the eye and lose vision \u2014 and that can happen overnight.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/nip-and-tuck-eye-surgery-pets-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}

However, those looking to incorporate more veggies into their diet may be overlooking one in particular. Eating three servings of baby carrots a week can give a significant boost of important nutrients found in the\u00a0orange root vegetables, according to a new unpublished study presented June 30 in Chicago at\u00a0Nutrition 2024,\u00a0the annual meeting of the\u00a0American Society for Nutrition. Surveys found separately in 2015 and 2019 that only\u00a0about 1 in 10 American adults ate the recommended 2 to 3 cups of vegetables daily, according to a 2022 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0report\u00a0on fruit and vegetable intake. That statistic inspired lead study author Mary Harper Simmons and her colleagues to investigate a simple solution that could increase a person\u2019s weekly vegetable intake. \u201c(Baby carrots) are grab and go, great with things like ranch, hummus \u2014 I\u2019ve even seen people dip them in peanut butter \u2014 some people like them plain,\u201d said Simmons, a graduate student in nutrition at Samford University in Alabama. \u201cI would really like to show people that improving your health can be (done) with small simple changes. \u2026 It does not have to be one drastic change overnight.\u201d For the study, one serving of baby carrots \u2014 chopped into smaller pieces and commonly sold at grocery stores \u2014 was around eight to 12 carrots, the equivalent of 100 grams or half a cup, Simmons added. The unpublished study looked at 60 young adults who were either assigned to eat the servings of carrots three times a week, eat no carrots and instead take a multivitamin supplement, consume a combination of the carrots and the multivitamin, or consume neither the carrots or supplement as a control group. After four weeks, the researchers found those who ate the carrots had a 10.8% increase in carotenoids in their skin, natural antioxidants found to have\u00a0health benefits, such as preventing inflammation and promoting heart health, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Additionally, the researchers found those who only took the multivitamin (containing the same carotenoid found in carrots) did not see any changes in carotenoid levels. But those who consumed the carrots and the supplement saw the most benefits and increased their skin carotenoids by 21.6%. \u201cPeople might think, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m getting a multivitamin supplement, (that should be enough),\u2019 but that alone did not increase the carotenoid accumulation. It was a combination that seemed to increase it,\u201d said Dr. Suresh Mathews, the principal investigator for the new study and a professor and chair of Samford\u2019s department of nutrition and dietetics. \u201cThe \u2018food first\u2019\u00a0philosophy always works. But for populations that may be unable to just do only foods or are limited, the combination of the food and the supplements seems to have an even bigger effect in this case,\u201d he added. The benefits of eating carrots and other vegetables \u201cHigh vegetable intake is associated with all kinds of positive health effects \u2014 the risk of all kinds of chronic diseases are lowered with increased fruit and vegetable consumption,\u201d said Dr. Sander Kersten, the director of the division of nutritional sciences and Schleifer Family Professor\u00a0at Cornell University, who was not involved in the new study. Eating vegetables can protect against heart disease, some cancers, diabetes and obesity,\u00a0according to the CDC. But carrots and other orange and red-toned vegetables such as squash and sweet potatoes are unique in that they\u2019re high in beta-carotene, the carotenoid that the body converts into vitamin A, Kersten said. Dark leafy greens, such as spinach and kale, are also high in beta-carotene, he added. Vitamin A is important for keeping your heart, lungs and other organs healthy and also for supporting various bodily functions, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health. Vitamin A deficiency is not common in the United States,\u00a0but people should still look to eat fruits and vegetables to reap the benefits of the natural low-calorie, high-in-fiber foods, Kersten said. Young adults eating vegetables While a reminder to include vegetables in a healthy diet is good for everyone, Simmons said the message is particularly important when it comes to young adults. According to the\u00a02022 CDC report, around 7% of adults\u00a0ages 18 to 30 eat the recommended amount of vegetables, while a 2023\u00a0National College Health Assessment\u00a0from the American College Health Association found that about 1 in 4 college students surveyed said they ate three or more servings of vegetables per day. \u201cYou hear the thing we tell kids, \u2018Eat the rainbow,\u2019 and I feel like for any age that really does stand,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt is good to have a variety of colors on your plate, and if not every single time you eat, just having a variety throughout your day and throughout your week is definitely very beneficial to getting all those key nutrients that our body needs to function.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli", "text": "Children in Ivory Coast received the first doses of a new, relatively cheap malaria vaccine on Monday, a step that has been hailed as a major milestone in the battle against one of the world\u2019s most deadly diseases. The R21 vaccine, developed by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India (SII), has been sent to several African countries and will also be administered in South Sudan Tuesday, the University of Oxford said in a statement sent to CNN. The vaccine costs less than $4 a dose, making it \u201crealistic to roll out in many tens of millions of doses from now on,\u201d and it has high efficacy levels of around 75%-80% in young children, Professor Adrian Hill, director\u00a0of the\u00a0Jenner Institute\u00a0at\u00a0Oxford University, who led the development of the vaccine, said in an interview with BBC Radio on Monday. Up to 500,000 child deaths could be saved every year with the widespread implementation of R21, alongside its counterpart RTS,S vaccine, according to modeling by the World Health Organization (WHO). Spread by some types of mosquitoes, malaria is preventable and curable but still killed around 608,000 people around the world in 2022, according to WHO. About 95% of those deaths occurred in Africa, where children under the age of 5 account for around 80% of all malaria deaths across the continent. The SIII has already manufactured more than 25 million doses and has committed to producing up to 100 million doses a year, a scale that allows the vaccine to remain affordable, according to the statement from the University of Oxford. There are enough doses that 250,000 children under the age of 2 will initially be vaccinated in Ivory Coast, while Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic have all authorized the vaccine, too, the university said.   R21 will be used alongside the RTS,S vaccine, which has already been delivered to more than 2 million children over a four-year pilot program in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, where it reduced all-cause mortality by 13%, according to UNICEF. Both these vaccines have been approved by the WHO and are expected to have a hugely positive impact on public health, alongside other prevention strategies like mosquito nets. Hill added that there is still \u201ca lot of work for people in-country to get set up, particularly when you\u2019re aiming to distribute millions of doses from this year.\u201d \u201cThis is a three-dose vaccine, typically (given at) five, six, seven months of age and then a booster a year later. That\u2019s not a time point that other vaccines are usually given at, so there\u2019s training required in these largely relatively low income countries.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness", "text": "About 40% of new cancer cases among adults ages 30 and older in the United States \u2014 and nearly half of deaths \u2014\u00a0could be attributed to preventable risk factors, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society. \u201cThese are things that people can practically change how they live every single day to reduce their risk of cancer,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Arif\u00a0Kamal, chief patient officer with the American Cancer Society. Smoking was the leading risk factor by far, the study found, contributing to nearly 1 in 5 cancer cases and nearly a third of cancer deaths. Other key risk factors included excess body weight, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, diet and infections such as HPV. Overall, researchers analyzed 18 modifiable risk factors across 30 types of cancer. In 2019, these lifestyle factors were linked to more than 700,000 new cancer cases and more than 262,000 deaths, the study found. Cancer grows because of DNA damage or because it has a fuel source, Kamal said. Other things \u2014 such as genetics or environmental factors \u2014 can also create these biological conditions, but modifiable risks explain a significantly larger share of cancer cases and deaths than any other known factors. Exposure to sunlight can damage DNA and lead to skin cancer, for example, while fat cells produce hormones that can feed certain cancers. \u201cWith cancer, it oftentimes feels like you have no control,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cPeople think about bad luck or bad genetics, but people need to feel a sense of control and agency.\u201d Certain cancers are more preventable than others, the new study suggests. But modifiable risk factors contributed to more than half of new cases for 19 of the 30 types of cancer evaluated. There were 10 types of cancer where modifiable risk factors could be attributed to at least 80% of new cases, including more than 90% of melanoma cases linked to ultraviolet radiation and nearly all cases of cervical cancer linked to HPV infection, which can be prevented with a vaccine. Lung cancer had the largest number of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors \u2014 more than 104,000 cases among men and 97,000 among women \u2014 and the vast majority were linked to smoking. After smoking, excess body weight was the second largest contributor to cancer cases, linked to about 5% of new cases in men and nearly 11% of cases in women. It was associated with more than\u00a0a third of deaths from cancer\u00a0of the endometrium, gallbladder, esophagus, liver and kidney, the new study found. Another recent study found that the risk for certain cancers was significantly reduced for people taking popular weight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy. \u201cObesity is emerging, in some ways, as just as potent of a risk for people as smoking is,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. He was not involved in the new study, but has prior experience working on cancer prevention initiatives. Intervening on a set of \u201ccore behavioral risk factors\u201d \u2014 quitting smoking, eating well and exercising, for example \u2014 can make a \u201cdramatic difference in the rates and outcomes of chronic diseases,\u201d Plescia said. And cancer is one of those chronic diseases, just like heart disease or diabetes. Policymakers and health officials should work to \u201ccreate environments where it\u2019s easier for people, where the healthy choice is the easy choice,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s particularly important for people who are living in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods, where it might not be safe to exercise or easy to get to a store with healthy food. As rates of early-onset cancer rise in the US, it\u2019s especially important to create healthy habits early, experts say. It\u2019s harder to quit smoking once you\u2019ve started or lose weight that you\u2019ve gained. But \u201cit\u2019s never too late to make these changes,\u201d Plescia said. \u201cTurning (health behaviors) around later in life can make a profound difference.\u201d And making lifestyle changes to minimize exposure to certain factors can reduce cancer risk relatively quickly, experts say. \u201cCancer is something your body fights every single day as your cells divide,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that you face every day, and that also means that the reduction of the risks can benefit you every day as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_health_biden-debate-cognitive-tests", "text": "President Joe Biden said Friday that his poor performance in last week\u2019s debate was a bad night but not evidence of a serious condition. \u201cI have medical doctors traveling everywhere. Every president does, as you know. Medical doctors from the best of the world travel with me everywhere I go,\u201d Biden told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos. \u201cI have an ongoing assessment of what I\u2019m doing. They don\u2019t hesitate to tell me if they think there\u2019s something else wrong.\u201d Biden said he spoke with his doctor after the debate and was told, \u201cyou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d Being president, he said, means \u201cI get a full neurological test every day.\u201d But doctors who work with aging patients say there\u2019s no single moment or test that determines a person\u2019s mental fitness or ability to function. In-depth evaluations can provide more answers, including ruling out potential problems. Such tests might start with short questionnaires, then expand to physical exams, blood tests, brain imaging, lengthy interviews with the individual and conversations with family members and friends. In an analysis published Friday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta urged the president to undergo detailed cognitive and neurological tests and to make those results public. Such testing \u201ccan help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning,\u201d Gupta wrote. When asked on Friday whether he\u2019s had cognitive tests and an exam by a neurologist, Biden said no. \u201cNo one said I had to. \u2026 They said I\u2019m good,\u201d the president said. Biden gave no indication he would be willing to have such tests conducted in the aftermath of his debate performance. Effects of typical aging Most people who are aging normally will experience some cognitive changes, but when and how much varies from person to person. Slow, age-related cognitive decline starts around age 27, studies show, even for healthy and well-educated people. A person\u2019s reasoning and problem-solving skills, along with their ability to maintain the thread of a conversation, can get tougher with age, but not so much that it impairs what doctors consider normal functioning. \u201cEvery aging researcher will tell you, though, that not everything declines as you get older, and not everything declines at an equal rate,\u201d said Dr. Charan Ranganath, a professor of psychology and neuroscience and the director of the Dynamic Memory Lab at the University of California, Davis. For example, the ability to remember facts \u2014 an essential skill for a president \u2014 doesn\u2019t disappear with age, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re slower to pull it up, and you\u2019re more likely to struggle to pull up the facts when you need it,\u201d Ranganath said. And it\u2019s not just memory that changes with age, said Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University. \u201cIt\u2019s reasoning and sociability and attention and orientation, and emotional stability and judgment and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cSome get impaired with age, and some actually get better with age, such as vocabulary.\u201d A person\u2019s moral\u00a0reasoning and judgment or their capacity for compassion and empathy will not necessarily decline, Ranganath added. Unless there is some kind of cognitive impairment, those aspects of personality can improve in some people with normal aging. \u201cSo, again, pretty important for a job like president,\u201d Ranganath added. Cognitive impairment \u2014 a loss of memory and other mental abilities that affect daily life \u2014 is different and is not considered normal or inevitable with aging. It occurs in 12% to 18% of people older than 65 and is more prevalent with advancing age, Rowe said. By age 80, more than 25% of people may have some mild cognitive impairment. They may start to lose things and miss appointments, \u201coccurrences that could be characterized as impairing your function,\u201d Rowe said. A minority in this group will go on to develop dementia each year, he said. And some may adapt, maybe seeming to have improved function. \u201cThey always put the key in the same place. They write down all their appointments,\u201d Rowe said. Screening for cognitive impairment To screen for cognitive impairment, a person\u2019s primary care physician will often start with the Mini Mental State Exam, known as the MMSE, or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, also called the MoCA. The MMSE is a 5- to 10-minute 11-question assessment that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. Former President Donald Trump, who has faced questions about his cognitive function, has repeatedly said he \u201caced\u201d the MoCA \u2014 a 30-point test that takes about 10 minutes. It evaluates the ability to concentrate and tests executive function, memory, language, conceptual thinking and orientation, the ability to do calculations and the ability to organize and manipulate spatial information to create a design. Both ask for simple information, like what the date is and where the participant is, and ask to count backward from 100 using a particular number. Both tests ask a person to draw. The MMSE asks the participant to identify particular objects in the room and to take a piece of paper in their right hand, fold it in half and put it on the floor. For the MoCA, the person will be told five words and then asked to repeat them in five minutes. The tests are not in-depth. Ranganath describes the MMSE as a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d: Unless someone has established language problems, he said, \u201cbasically, you have to be seriously cognitively impaired\u201d to do poorly, \u201cespecially for somebody who is functioning at a high level, like a high-level politician.\u201d The MoCA, he said, is good at detecting when someone has mild cognitive impairment. It\u2019s a test for \u201cwhen people can really tell there\u2019s a memory problem, and that\u2019s often when they\u2019ll be talking to a doctor about it,\u201d Ranganath said \u2014 and perhaps seeking more detailed results. More detailed cognitive tests If a doctor or family member suspects more serious cognitive problems, a person may be referred to specialists who can do further tests that may take one or two days to complete. Usually, the person will be referred to a behavioral neurologist who specializes in aging and dementia and non-dementia diagnosis, as well as a neuropsychologist and possibly a social worker who will meet with them and their family, according to Dr. Emily Rogalski, a professor of neurology who runs the University of Chicago\u2019s Health Aging & Alzheimer\u2019s Research Care Center. \u201cPart of those evaluations will look at the overall health of the individual, from neurologic health to also cognitive health,\u201d she said. Cognitive health includes how a person can learn, think and remember. Neurological health involves the nervous system. Neurological disorders like Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s, or even a headache, can affect cognitive functions. But other conditions can have an impact too, such as an infection or tumor. \u201cThe neuropsychologist is able to do an in-depth evaluation of the strengths and challenges that an individual may be experiencing and start to understand the interactions between those strengths and challenges,\u201d Rogalski said. Testing could also include blood tests or imaging that may tell doctors what\u2019s going on in the brain itself. There will also be a physical examination. If a person has a history of congestive heart failure, a doctor may do a cardiac exam to check for deterioration that could contribute to cognitive issues, said Dr. Brad Dickerson, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and an associate neurologist who sees patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cYou have to take all that into consideration when you\u2019re trying to figure out why their cognitive functioning may be different than it was,\u201d he said. At this level of testing, part of the evaluation will also include a report from people close to the patient. \u201cThat sometimes is a spouse or a close family member who can comment on whether the individual is experiencing significant change from their previous level of function and whether that change is interfering with what we call activities of daily living,\u201d Rogalski said. Who should get tested \u2014\u00a0and when Dickerson said patients will often ask him when they should get tested. His answer: It depends. If, for example, an 80-year-old tells him that they keep forgetting the name of an actor in a movie they\u2019ve just seen or that they go into another part of the house to get three things and remember only two, and if the problem has gotten more annoying but over time isn\u2019t too disruptive, they could get a baseline cognitive and neurological assessment in the office. He said he would not be worried that this was a sign of a progressive disorder that needs to be diagnosed and treated. \u201cThere are elements of the history that would raise a doctor\u2019s concerns about a significant problem or would reduce the doctor\u2019s concerns about a significant problem,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cSometimes, you can\u2019t be sure of that until you sit down in the office and interview people.\u201d Rowe said he tells concerned family members and patients that the time to get tested is when they start asking whether they should. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in getting tested,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have a baseline so that you can get tested again in a year or two if you think things are getting worse.\u201d Testing, he said, should be able to tell them if they have issues that impair their function. But people shouldn\u2019t worry if they can\u2019t remember someone\u2019s name. Rowe, who served as chairman and CEO of the insurance company Aetna and was president and CEO of Mount Sinai NYU Health, believes that testing should be the default for people in several roles: presidential candidates, regardless of age; US Supreme Court justices; airline pilots. He says the public shouldn\u2019t get \u201ccarried away\u201d with scores: If one candidate\u2019s score is higher than the others, that doesn\u2019t mean that one is more qualified to be president, he said. \u201cBut if somebody fails a test,\u201d Rowe said, \u201cI think that it\u2019s something that people should know.\u201d Testing doesn\u2019t always lead to a dementia diagnosis. Addressing other health problems, such as a sleep disorder or medications interacting with each other, may lead to improvement. Patients may see symptoms reduced through lifestyle changes. If someone is found to have early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s, new treatments can slow the progression of disease. Distinguishing between cognitive impairment and typical age-related cognitive decline \u201care not trivial questions,\u201d and it\u2019s not something a family doctor can typically do, Ranganath said. Even in-depth testing may not give a clear indication of what a person is capable of now or in the near future. \u201cThere is also a bit of an art in figuring out how to translate someone\u2019s test results into a statement about real world functioning (i.e., whether a person is fit to drive, live independently, do a demanding job, etc.),\u201d Ranganath wrote in an email. \u201cMany times, the recommendation is obvious, but on occasion, it can be hard to tell and there are no clear cut answers. And if someone seems relatively competent at the moment, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they will be doing so well 2-4 years later.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang and John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/health/biden-debate-cognitive-tests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_colorado-bird-flu-humans-confirmed", "text": "Five cases of bird flu have been identified among workers culling poultry at a farm in northeast Colorado, the state department of health said on Sunday. The commercial egg operation was impacted by H5N1 outbreaks that have also affected wild birds and dairy cows in several states. Three of the five human cases were announced Friday, and all of those have now been confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A fourth case was also confirmed, and a fifth is presumed positive based on state testing. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in a statement on Sunday that no additional test results are pending. The workers are believed to have caught the virus through direct work with infected birds. They had mild symptoms including conjunctivitis or pink eye and respiratory problems, but none of them were hospitalized, the state said Sunday. The investigation into the cases is ongoing with support of a team sent by CDC at the state\u2019s request. The CDC said Friday its risk assessment for the general public remains low. \u201cThere are no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity otherwise in Colorado or in other states affected by H5 bird flu outbreaks in cows and poultry,\u201d it said. Four people in the US had previously tested positive for bird flu in connection with the ongoing outbreak: one in Colorado, one in Texas and two in Michigan. All were workers at dairy operations. Colorado\u2019s agriculture industry has been hit hard by bird flu, with Gov. Jared Polis\u00a0declaring\u00a0a disaster emergency July 5 to ensure that the state can offer support and resources for farms in Weld County. Poultry products are still safe to eat if they have been properly handled and cooked, the Colorado health department said. The CDC advises that everyone avoid close or long exposure to sick or dead animals, animal poop or bedding. Experts also recommend against consuming unpasteurized or raw milk due to the potential for contamination. Another state finds bird flu in cattle Until the Colorado cases were announced, recent human H5N1 cases in the US had been linked to dairy cattle. On Friday, the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced that a dairy cattle herd in the state had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, raising the number of states that reported impacted herds to 13. The positive sample was collected in April, the state said, and the herd has fully recovered. It\u2019s not clear why it took the so long for the state or federal government to report the results. Since the first cattle infections were reported in late March, 157 herds have tested positive for H5N1 across 13 states.\u00a0Four states have had more than 20 herds impacted \u2014\u00a0Texas, Colorado, Michigan and Idaho\u00a0\u2014 according to the US Department of Agriculture.

{"id": "2024_07_12_health_sex-gender-child-brain", "text": "Sex and gender are often conflated or equated in everyday conversations, and most American adults believe a person\u2019s gender is determined by sex assigned at birth. But a new study of nearly 5,000 9- and 10-year-olds found that sex and gender map onto largely distinct parts of the brain. The research gives a first insight into how sex and gender may have \u201cmeasurable and unique influences\u201d on the brain, study authors said, just as other experiences have been shown to shape the brain. \u201cMoving forward, we really need to consider both sexes and genders separately if we better want to understand the brain,\u201d said Dr. Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and the Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, California, and a co-author of the study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances. The researchers on the new study defined sex as what was assigned to the child at birth. In the US, clinicians make this assignment based on genitalia. Most people are assigned either female or male, according to the research; the rest are intersex, a person whose sexual or reproductive anatomy doesn\u2019t fit this male/female binary. The researchers defined gender as an individual\u2019s attitude, feelings and behaviors, as well as socially constructed roles. They noted specifically that gender is not binary, meaning not all people identify as either female or male. Both sex and gender are a core part of human experience. They\u2019re key to how people perceive others and how they understand themselves. Both can influence behavior as well as health, the study authors say. The researchers looked at brain imaging data from 4,757 children in the United States, 2,315 assigned female at birth and 2,442 assigned male at birth, who were ages 9 and 10 and were a subset of the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. Over a period of 10 years, the children in the ABCD study underwent comprehensive neuroimaging, behavioral, developmental and psychiatric assessments. Beyond tests such as MRIs, the scientists did surveys of the children and their parents that were focused on gender, both at the beginning of the research and then a year later. The children were asked about how they expressed their gender and how they felt about it. The parents were asked about a child\u2019s sex-typed behavior during play and whether the child had any gender dysphoria, a term that mental health professionals use to describe clinically significant distress felt because a person\u2019s sense of their gender does not match their sex the assigned at birth. Parents were a key part of the study, said study co-author Dr. Dani S. Bassett, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania with appointments in the Departments of Bioengineering, Electrical & Systems Engineering, Physics & Astronomy, Neurology, and Psychiatry. \u201cWhen kids have a particular kind of gender behavior or gender expression, that will influence how their parents and also other caregivers and friends and family \u2026 et cetera interact with them,\u201d Bassett said. Information about a parent\u2019s perception of a child\u2019s gender gives researchers a better sense of the child\u2019s social environment and how it may affect their brain development. The authors used a kind of artificial intelligence called machine learning that built a model that could predict a child\u2019s sex and reported gender from their brain scan.  When the researchers looked the children\u2019s brain scans, the results seemed to show that sex influenced different regions of the brain that are involved in visual processing, sensory processing and motor control and some regions involved in executive function, which lets an individual organize and integrate information across time. Gender seems to influence some of the more sensory-specific networks that are associated with sex, but it also seems to have a broader influence and can be detected on different brain networks involved in executive function, including things like attention, social cognition and emotional processing. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re able to capture how gender maps onto the brain basically just tells us that gender is influencing our brain,\u201d Dhamala said. The structure of the human brain can be shaped by expertise and experiences. Research on London taxi drivers \u2014 who must take extensive tests to show that they can navigate the city\u2019s streets without maps or GPS \u2014 seems to show that they have significantly larger posterior hippocampi, the part of the brain related to spatial memory and navigation, than in people who aren\u2019t taxi drivers. \u201cSimilarly, as individuals and as humans, we are experts about ourselves and our genders. So it makes sense that gender will also be mapped within our brains,\u201d Dhamala said. What the new study cannot do is predict what gender a person may identify with beyond one limited snapshot in time captured by the scans and surveys. Gender, the authors note, is not something that is necessarily static, and a person\u2019s understanding of their gender can change throughout their lifetime. The study also can\u2019t determine what things in someone\u2019s environment will influence their brain function in terms of sex or gender, nor can it identify what a person\u2019s sexual orientation might be. \u201cSexual orientation is independent from gender and from sex,\u201d Bassett said, and it may be differently mapped in the brain. The researchers say they hope to someday learn more about how sex and gender interact in a person\u2019s life and how they influence one another and the brain throughout a lifetime. They also hope to see how different cultures affect a person\u2019s gender and their brain development. A 2022 poll showed that most American adults \u2014 and the vast majority of conservatives \u2014 believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. The distinction is key to gender-affirming care, medical treatment for people who identify as a gender that is different from the one they were assigned at birth. Conservative politicians have pushed for a record number of bans on such care, and nearly half of US states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care for minors. The study did not look at whether sex or gender were congruent or incongruent in any study participant. Rather, it looked at the child\u2019s binary sex and gender across self- and parent-reported measures. The study couldn\u2019t provide any specific findings if sex and gender were incongruent. \u201cGoing forward, the hope is that we can motivate other scientists to consider science and gender in their analyses in the data collections in their programs and research,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Avram Holmes, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers University. The field of neuroscience has only just begun to acknowledge and address the presence of biases and barriers to inclusivity within research, Holmes said. A fuller understanding of the way the brain works in terms of sex and gender could also have practical implications and potentially help scientists find better ways to treat people with brain-related illnesses. For instance, the study pointed to how people assigned male at birth are more likely to be diagnosed with substance use and attention deficit disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that sex and gender necessarily drive illness rates, but the cultures people are embedded in can also influence the likelihood they may or may not develop a particular illness,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cSo the types of environmental pressures a child undergoes across development could increase or decrease their risk for experiencing illness, independent of their initial brain biology.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/sex-gender-child-brain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_science_ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white", "text": "During the Cretaceous Period, a genus of sharks roamed the sea with rows of unusual teeth. Mostly large and rounded, these chompers were not meant to slice through their prey, but to grind and crush shelled creatures. However, since the sharks\u2019 presence in the fossil record has mostly consisted of isolated teeth, scientists have been left to speculate on what the rest of this ancient predator looked like since its\u00a0discovery in the 18th century. Now, remains uncovered from limestone quarries in northeastern Mexico are finally giving researchers a clearer idea of the shark\u2019s appearance, including one fossil that shows almost all skeletal elements and an outline of the specimen\u2019s soft-tissue body. The find also reveals where the genus, known as Ptychodus, sat on the shark evolutionary tree, and other previously unknown traits of this \u201clong-standing enigma,\u201d according to a study published in April in the journal\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. \u201cThe finding of the skeletal remains in Mexico not only allow us to unite these teeth that have been searching for a long time for a skeleton, but also allow us as scientists to revise our previous hypotheses regarding its biology and relationships and see what we got right and what we got wrong,\u201d said study coauthor\u00a0Dr. Eduardo Villalobos Segura, an assistant professor in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna, Austria, in an email. The discovery also provides insight into the evolutionary history of sharks found in our oceans today, experts say. Ancient relative of the great white shark Most species of Ptychodus lived between 100 and 80 million years ago during the\u00a0late Cretaceous period. The deposits in which the fossils were discovered \u2014 in Nuevo Le\u00f3n near the municipality of Vallecillo \u2014 date back to\u00a0approximately 93.9 to 91.85 million\u00a0years ago, Villalobos Segura said. Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage, they do not fossilize well, typically leaving archaeologists only teeth and few skeletal remains to find. But evidence suggests the\u00a0Nuevo Le\u00f3n fossils ended up in mostly stagnant conditions that would have allowed for an oxygen-deficient zone, resulting in the preservation of the soft skeletons, Villalobos Segura said. In the study, the researchers analyzed six fossils found at the site, including the complete specimen. Three other fossils were almost complete, and two were incomplete. With these remains, the study authors determined that Ptychodus belonged to the order of sharks known as Lamniformes, or mackerel sharks, the same group that the extinct\u00a0Otodus megalodon\u00a0and the modern great white shark belong to. Lamniformes also includes the modern species of megamouth, sand, goblin and basking sharks,\u00a0among others. \u201cPresent-day\u00a0sharks represent just a vanishingly minimal portion of the astonishing biodiversity that occurred throughout their entire evolutionary history (spanning almost 400 million years) \u2026 studying fossil\u00a0sharks is crucial to understand fully the evolutionary phenomena related to current groups,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Manuel Amadori, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna in Austria, in an email. The existence of mackerel sharks with crushing teeth was unknown until now, Amadori said. \u201cThere is still much more to discover, but we can say that we have taken another important step forward in understanding the complex evolutionary history of mackerel sharks,\u201d he added. The outline of the body, which revealed the shark\u2019s shape and fin location, also provides evidence that the prehistoric fish was not just a bottom-dweller as previously believed, but instead, a fast-swimming predator that might have hunted and eaten sea turtles and large ammonites instead of only eating mollusks found on the ocean floor, according to the study authors. Although the shark\u2019s exact diet is still unknown, the researchers suggest that this revised hypothesis about what it ate could be a hint at the cause of Ptychodus\u2019 extinction, since it puts the shark in competition with other Late Cretaceous marine predators with similar diets. \u201cWithout a complete specimen (hard evidence), what was known about Ptychodus beyond the teeth was largely scientific guesswork,\u201d said Michael Everhart, an adjunct curator of paleontology at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas, and an expert on\u00a0Late Cretaceous marine fossils, in an email. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThe new specimens answer questions that go back 180+ years to the 1830s when\u00a0Louis Agassiz\u00a0(an early renowned scientist and paleontologist)\u00a0first coined the name Ptychodus,\u201d which means rugous or\u00a0wrinkled tooth, Everhart added. Massive shell-crushing sharks The findings also suggested that the largest species of Ptychodus may have been slightly smaller than previously thought, reaching a maximum length of 9.7 meters (nearly 32 feet). Previous estimates of a species known as Ptychodus mortoni put it at 11.2 meters (nearly 37 feet), but the revised size is still larger than modern apex shark predators, the authors note in the study. Great whites today reach up to\u00a06 meters (20 feet)\u00a0in length. There are modern shell-crushing species, the largest being the Zebra shark, which reaches a maximum length of a little over 3.5 meters (12 feet) \u2014 not near as gigantic as Ptychodus. \u201cThe crushing teeth together with the gigantic size make Ptychodus a very unique shark,\u201d Amadori said. \u201c(In the fossil record) some teeth are massive, polygonal and almost flat, while others have strange, rounded protuberances or pointed cusps on the top surface. All these were joined together to form massive tooth plates, which this predator of the past could have used to crush almost anything it encountered.\u201d A new fossil revealing the complete side view of Ptychodus measured nearly 1.5 meters (about 5 feet) in length, suggesting it was from was of a much smaller shark. This could be due to the remains belonging to a younger shark, or because the Ptychodus genus included various species of different sizes, Villalobos Segura said. According to the nonprofit Mindat.org database, there are 22 species of Ptychodus currently known. Most species and individuals of Ptychodus were likely smaller than the largest Ptychodus mortoni specimen discovered, but there could also be the possibility of larger species yet to be found, Everhart said. Often, researchers can tell apart the different species of Ptychodus by varying features in the teeth, but the study authors were unable to identify which\u00a0species of Ptychodus\u00a0the six fossils studied belonged to due to the teeth being too worn down, Villalobos Segura said. The researchers said they hope future research reveals more about the ancient shark, including its diet and its role in past marine food chains and ecosystems. \u201c(The April study) is a comprehensive review of some remarkably complete fossils of the strange Cretaceous shark, Ptychodus,\u201d said Dr. Bretton Kent, an emeritus principal lecturer in the department of entomology at the University of Maryland, who has\u00a0studied and lectured\u00a0on the diversification of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). He was not involved in the study. \u201cOur present world can act like a set of blinders, limiting the scope of possible lifestyles we can envision for extinct animals. \u2026 Modern durophagous sharks (that consume hard-shelled organisms) are demersal, feeding on or near the bottom. And their bodies are frequently small and not particularly streamlined. So a gigantic, streamlined, high speed durophage that was much larger than a modern great white shark is quite remarkable,\u201d Kent added, in an email.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/science/ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk", "text": "GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy may help lower the risk of certain cancers, a new study suggests. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting 13 types of cancer, and the risk increases the longer a person is overweight and the more excess weight they gain. About 40% of new cancer diagnoses are associated with excess weight, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, there were about 170 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people, CDC data shows. But a study published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with a class of GLP-1 drugs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with 10 of the 13 obesity-associated cancers than those who were taking insulin. The risk was cut by more than half for gallbladder cancer, meningioma, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, a kind of liver cancer. It was also significantly reduced for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and kidney cancer. Excess weight can cause changes in the body such as long-lasting inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones that can cause cancer, according to the CDC. And GLP-1 medications interact with systems related to insulin production. The new findings that link GLP-1 treatment to reduced risk of some cancers \u201ccompare favorably\u201d with similar effects linked to intensive lifestyle intervention and metabolic-bariatric surgery that have been found in other trials, the study authors wrote. However, the research found that GLP-1 treatment was not associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, which CDC data shows is the most common type of cancer associated with obesity. Risk was also not reduced for stomach cancer or thyroid cancer. In fact, other research has found that GLP-1s may interact with the body\u2019s insulin production in ways that negatively affect the thyroid, and the study authors note that patients should be aware of potential thyroid-related risks that are included on the medication\u2019s packaging. The new study also found that the risk of cancer diagnosis for people with type 2 diabetes was not different among those who were treated with GLP-1s compared with those where were being treated with metformin. In fact, the risk of diagnosis with kidney cancer was higher among those using GLP-1s than those on metformin. For this study, researchers from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and the MetroHealth System analyzed more than a decade of medical records for nearly 1.7 million people with type 2 diabetes. More information is needed about how reduced cancer risk may relate to the scale of weight loss, but the findings provide \u201cpreliminary evidence of the potential benefit of GLP-1RAs for cancer prevention in high-risk populations and support further preclinical and clinical studies,\u201d the study authors wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2017_09_18_health_opioid-crisis-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at the opioid crisis.  Experts say the United States is in the throes of an opioid epidemic. An estimated 8.9 million Americans aged 12 and older misused opioids in 2022, including 8.5 million prescription pain reliever abusers and 1 million heroin users. Opioids are drugs formulated to replicate the pain-reducing properties of opium. Prescription painkillers like morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone are opioids. Illegal drugs like heroin and illicitly made fentanyl are also opioids. The word \u201copioid\u201d is derived from the word \u201copium.\u201d  Overdose deaths have been on the rise for years in the United States, but surged amid the Covid-19 pandemic: Annual deaths were nearly 50% higher in 2021 than in 2019, CDC data shows. Data on overdose deaths. Prescription opioid volumes peaked in 2011, with the equivalent of 240 billion milligrams of morphine prescribed, according to the market research firm, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee had the highest opioid dispensing rates in 2020. Common Opioids Opioids such as morphine and codeine are naturally derived from opium poppy plants more commonly grown in Asia, Central America and South America. Heroin is an illegal drug synthesized from morphine.  Hydrocodone and oxycodone are semi-synthetic opioids, manufactured in labs with natural and synthetic ingredients.  Fentanyl is a fully synthetic opioid, originally developed as a powerful anesthetic for surgery.  It is also administered to alleviate severe pain associated with terminal illnesses like cancer. The drug is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. Just a small dose can be deadly. Illicitly produced fentanyl has been a driving factor in the number of overdose deaths in recent years.  Methadone is another fully synthetic opioid. It is commonly dispensed to recovering heroin addicts to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.     Opioids bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting pain signals. They also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a \u201chigh.\u201d Addiction Opioid use disorder is the clinical term for opioid addiction or abuse. People who become dependent on opioids may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the medication. Dependence is often coupled with tolerance, meaning that users need to take increasingly larger doses for the same effect.  A drug called naloxone, available as an injection or a nasal spray, is used as a treatment for overdoses. It blocks or reverses the effects of opioids and is often carried by first responders.  Regulation and Funding The 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, allocated $1 billion over two years in opioid crisis grants to states, providing funding for expanded treatment and prevention programs. In April 2017, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price announced the distribution of the first round of $485 million in grants to all 50 states and US territories. In August 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the launch of an Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit within the Department of Justice. The unit\u2019s mission is to prosecute individuals who commit opioid-related health care fraud. The DOJ is also appointing US attorneys who will specialize in opioid health care fraud cases as part of a three-year pilot program in 12 jurisdictions nationwide.  On October 24, 2018, President Donald Trump signed opioid legislation into law. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes provisions aimed at promoting research to find new drugs for pain management that will not be addictive. It also expands access to treatment for substance use disorders for Medicaid patients. State legislatures have also introduced measures to regulate pain clinics and limit the quantity of opioids that doctors can dispense.  Timeline 1861-1865 - During the Civil War, medics use morphine as a battlefield anesthetic. Many soldiers become dependent on the drug.  1898 - Heroin is first produced commercially by the Bayer Company. At the time, heroin is believed to be less habit-forming than morphine, so it is dispensed to individuals who are addicted to morphine. 1914 - Congress passes the Harrison Narcotics Act, which requires that doctors write prescriptions for narcotic drugs like opioids and cocaine. Importers, manufacturers and distributors of narcotics must register with the Treasury Department and pay taxes on products   1924 - The Anti-Heroin Act bans the production and sale of heroin in the United States.  1970 - The Controlled Substances Act becomes law. It creates groupings (or schedules) of drugs based on the potential for abuse. Heroin is a Schedule I drug while morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone (Percocet) and methadone are Schedule II. Hydrocodone (Vicodin) is originally a Schedule III medication. It is later recategorized as a Schedule II drug.  January 10, 1980 - A letter titled \u201cAddiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics\u201d is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It looks at incidences of painkiller addiction in a very specific population of hospitalized patients who were closely monitored. It becomes widely cited as proof that narcotics are a safe treatment for chronic pain.  1995 - OxyContin, a long-acting version of oxycodone that slowly releases the drug over 12 hours, is introduced and aggressively marketed as a safer pain pill by manufacturer, Purdue Pharma.  May 10, 2007 - Purdue Pharma pleads guilty for misleadingly advertising OxyContin as safer and less addictive than other opioids. The company and three executives are charged with \u201cmisleading and defrauding physicians and consumers.\u201d Purdue and the executives agree to pay $634.5 million in criminal and civil fines.  2010 - FDA approves an \u201cabuse-deterrent\u201d formulation of OxyContin, to help curb abuse. However, people still find ways to abuse it.  May 20, 2015 - The DEA announces that it has arrested 280 people, including 22 doctors and pharmacists, after a 15-month sting operation centered on health care providers who dispense large amounts of opioids. The sting, dubbed Operation Pilluted, is the largest prescription drug bust in the history of the DEA.     March 18, 2016 - The CDC publishes guidelines for prescribing opioids for patients with chronic pain. Recommendations include prescribing over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen in lieu of opioids. Doctors are encouraged to promote exercise and behavioral treatments to help patients cope with pain.    March 29, 2017 - Trump signs an executive order calling for the establishment of the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is selected as the chairman of the group, with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an adviser. July 31, 2017 - After a delay, the White House panel examining the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic releases its interim report, asking Trump to declare a national public health emergency to combat the ongoing crisis    September 22, 2017 - The pharmacy chain CVS announces that it will implement new restrictions on filling prescriptions for opioids, dispensing a limited seven-day supply to patients who are new to pain therapy.  November 1, 2017 - The opioid commission releases its final report. Its 56 recommendations include a proposal to establish nationwide drug courts that would place opioid addicts in treatment facilities rather than prison.  February 9, 2018 - A budget agreement signed by Trump authorizes $6 billion for opioid programs, with $3 billion allocated for 2018 and $3 billion allocated for 2019.  February 27, 2018 - Sessions announces a new opioid initiative: The Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force. The mission of the task force is to support local jurisdictions that have filed lawsuits against prescription drugmakers and distributors. March 19, 2018 - The Trump administration outlines an initiative to stop opioid abuse. The three areas of concentration are law enforcement and interdiction; prevention and education via an ad campaign; and job-seeking assistance for individuals fighting addiction. April 9, 2018 - The US surgeon general issues an advisory recommending that Americans carry the opioid overdose-reversing drug, naloxone. A surgeon general advisory is a rarely used tool to convey an urgent message. The last advisory issued by the surgeon general, more than a decade ago, focused on drinking during pregnancy. May 1, 2018 - The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a study that finds synthetic opioids like fentanyl caused about 46% of opioid deaths in 2016. That\u2019s a three-fold increase compared with 2010, when synthetic opioids were involved in about 14% of opioid overdose deaths. It\u2019s the first time that synthetic opioids surpassed prescription opioids and heroin as the primary cause of overdose fatalities.   May 30, 2018 - The journal Medical Care publishes a study that estimates the cost of medical care and substance abuse treatment for opioid addiction was $78.5 billion in 2013.   June 7, 2018 - The White House announces a new multimillion dollar public awareness advertising campaign to combat opioid addiction. The first four ads of the campaign are all based on true stories illustrating the extreme lengths young adults have gone to obtain the powerful drugs. December 12, 2018 - According to the National Center for Health Statistics, fentanyl is now the most commonly used drug involved in drug overdoses. The rate of drug overdoses involving the synthetic opioid skyrocketed by about 113% each year from 2013 through 2016. January 14, 2019 - The National Safety Council finds that, for the first time on record, the odds of dying from an opioid overdose in the United States are now greater than those of dying in a vehicle crash. March 26, 2019 - Purdue Pharma agrees to pay a $270 million settlement to settle a historic lawsuit brought by the Oklahoma attorney general. The settlement will be used to fund addiction research and help cities and counties with the opioid crisis. July 17, 2019 - The CDC releases preliminary data showing a 5.1% decline in drug overdoses during 2018. If the preliminary number is accurate, it would mark the first annual drop in overdose deaths in more than two decades. August 26, 2019 - Oklahoma wins its case against Johnson & Johnson in the first major opioid lawsuit trial to be held in the United States. Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman orders Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million for its role in the state\u2019s opioid crisis. The penalty is later reduced to $465 million, due to a mathematical error made when calculating the judgment. In November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reverses the decision. September 15, 2019 - Purdue files for bankruptcy as part of a $10 billion agreement to settle opioid lawsuits. According to a statement from the chair of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, the money will be allocated to communities nationwide struggling to address the crisis. September 30, 2019 - The FDA and DEA announce that they sent warnings to four online networks, operating a total of 10 websites, which the agencies said are illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded versions of opioid medicines, including tramadol. February 25, 2020 - Mallinckrodt, a large opioid manufacturer, reaches a settlement agreement in principle worth $1.6 billion. Mallinckrodt says the proposed deal will resolve all opioid-related claims against the company and its subsidiaries if it moves forward. Plaintiffs would receive payments over an eight-year period to cover the costs of opioid-addition treatments and other needs. October 21, 2020 - The Justice Department announces that Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has agreed to plead guilty to three federal criminal charges for its role in creating the nation\u2019s opioid crisis. They agree to pay more than $8 billion and close down the company. The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. The Justice Department also reached a separate $225 million civil settlement with the former owners of Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family. In November 2020, Purdue Pharma board chairman Steve Miller formally pleads guilty on behalf of the company. March 15, 2021 - According to court documents, Purdue files a restructuring plan to dissolve itself and establish a new company dedicated to programs designed to combat the opioid crisis. As part of the proposed plan, the Sackler family agrees to pay an additional $4.2 billion over the next nine years to resolve various civil claims. September 1, 2021 - In federal bankruptcy court, Judge Robert Drain rules that Purdue Pharma will be dissolved. The settlement agreement resolves all civil litigation against the Sackler family members, Purdue Pharma and other related parties and entities, and awards them broad legal protection against future civil litigation. The Sacklers will relinquish control of family foundations with over $175 million in assets to the trustees of a National Opioid Abatement Trust. On December 16, 2021, a federal judge overturns the settlement.  February 25, 2022 - Johnson & Johnson and the three largest US drug distributors \u2013 McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and AmerisourceBergen Corp \u2013 finalize a $26 billion nationwide opioid settlement.

{"id": "2024_07_08_health_sleep-eating-disorder-wellness", "text": "Jill was in middle school when she began eating in her sleep. Despite carrying the food back to her bed to devour night after night, she didn\u2019t have a clue about what she had done until the next morning. \u201cI would wake up with these containers or wrappers from an entire box of crackers or cookies on my bed or by the side of my bed,\u201d said Jill, now 62, who lives an hour away from Minneapolis. Due to stigma and misunderstanding about sleep eating, CNN\u00a0agreed not to use her last name. \u201cA lot of people think this condition is, \u2018Oh, you get up and you have a snack and then you go back to bed.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not what this is. This is a whole other animal,\u201d Jill said of her unconscious nocturnal behaviors. \u201cI don\u2019t just get up once and take a bite of this or that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can eat a whole package of cookies, then get up again and have four bowls of cereal, then get up again and have an entire box of graham crackers. And it is always junky junk food, never, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have an apple.\u2019\u201d Over time, nights of poor nutrition and dysfunctional sleep can take a toll, Jill said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how sick you feel,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten up countless times during the night, so you\u2019re not rested, and you\u2019ve consumed enormous amounts of garbage food. Then you wake up and boom, you have to function the rest of the day. And that\u2019s what I did for years and years and years.\u201d Jill is living with sleep-related eating disorder, also known as sleep eating \u2014 an arousal condition in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Sleep eating is a parasomnia, an abnormal or unusual behavior during sleep, similar to sleepwalking, sleep talking, sleep terrors, and sleep sex, or sexsomnia. \u201cOf all the parasomnias, sleep-related eating disorder has the worst impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThese people have disinhibited eating almost every night. They gain weight. They feel miserable in the morning. It affects their whole life and is just horrendous,\u201d said Schenck, who specializes in treating parasomnias. While it may seem as if people are acting out their dreams, parasomnias most often occur during the slowest, deepest stage of sleep called delta sleep, he said. \u201cSomething triggers an alarm in the central nervous system, and your body is activated while your cognition is deeply asleep,\u201d he said. No control or restraint In the mixed state of sleep and wakefulness that is sleep eating, the ancient brain takes over, searching out foods that might satisfy the body\u2019s need for gratification. Ultraprocessed foods such as candy, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, chips and crackers are preferred choices during sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any control, you don\u2019t have any restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can consume foods they\u2019re allergic to and then have an allergic reaction. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. \u201cAnd because they choose foods like peanut butter, chocolate, leftover banana cream pie or pasta \u2014 fattening, overly processed comfort foods \u2014 they can develop or aggravate their diabetes or hypertension.\u201d Of all the parasomnias, sleep eating is the most challenging to treat, with a success rate of only two-thirds, Schenck said. In comparison, treatment success is more than 75% for patients with sexsomnia, sleepwalking or night terrors. \u201cYou can have someone who\u2019s been a sleepwalker for many years, but once they start eating during the night, before long, eating becomes the only sleepwalking behavior,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s something irresistible about consuming food during the night and sleepwalking \u2014 who wants to rearrange the furniture or just wander around the house when you can go eat?\u201d \u2018The doctors didn\u2019t understand it\u2019 Married in her early 20s, Jill continued to eat in bed at night alongside her new husband. Thankfully, she said, he was a heavy sleeper. \u201cHe would wake up in the morning to a bed full of crumbs and wrappers and say, \u2018What is wrong with you?\u2019 He thought I was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand. And I didn\u2019t understand because I wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose.\u201d Jill\u2019s health suffered. Not only did she gain weight from all the extra calories, but the quality of her diet dropped dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m a healthy eater, but I often felt so sick throughout the day, the last thing I wanted was food, even healthy food,\u201d Jill said. \u201cWho would when you ate the equivalent of six Thanksgiving dinners back-to-back every night?\u201d Embarrassed by her behavior, Jill kept her sleep habits to herself for decades. It wasn\u2019t until her son developed a disorder called idiopathic hypersomnolence, in which he would sleep for 18 or more hours at a time, that she began asking doctors about her own condition. Unfortunately, she said, broaching the topic didn\u2019t go well. \u201cMany doctors I spoke to had no idea what was wrong with me, or they just didn\u2019t get it. One doctor said, \u2018Well, maybe have a piece of bread before you go to bed.\u2019 Oh, right, that\u2019s sure to solve it,\u201d Jill said disdainfully. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this disorder or aren\u2019t living with it, you\u2019re not going to have a full understanding, but I really thought that doctors would know more,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the problem was then I felt alone, believing something was wrong with me \u2014 because the doctors didn\u2019t understand it, it must be my fault.\u201d Causes of sleep eating After years of disappointing doctor visits, Jill discovered Schenck\u2019s treatment center in Minneapolis. For the first time, she underwent a lab sleep study, which showed that she had restless legs syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes unpleasant sensations in the legs along with an irresistible urge to move them.\u00a0The sensations often begin in the evenings and can last throughout the night. \u201cIt\u2019s now become restless body syndrome,\u201d Jill said. \u201cIt\u2019s a twitching, almost like a bug is crawling inside that travels through my whole body.\u201d To ease the constant twitching during the evenings before sleep, Jill may walk around the house, flailing her arms and legs in a desperate bid to stop the sensation. \u201cYou just become so miserable, so uncomfortable, that you\u2019re swinging your body parts, kind of trying to tire them out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some nights that the twitching is just, oh, I can\u2019t even tell you, I\u2019m in tears it\u2019s so bad.\u201d Restless legs syndrome is one of four potential causes of sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou can develop sleep eating from sleepwalking, from sleep apnea, from certain insomnia medications, or like Jill, from restless legs syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those can be the ultimate causes of sleep-related eating disorder, and that\u2019s why in medicine, we call that a final common pathway disorder. All roads lead to Rome basically.\u201d Jill, however, was sleep eating long before restless legs syndrome became a key complaint. Research has shown sleep eating may occur first, Schenck said. \u201cWe studied a group of sleep-related eating patients in the lab, and they had periodic limb movements along with the sleep eating,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, lo and behold, five or 10 years later they developed classic restless legs syndrome. So sleep-related eating can be the first indicator of future restless legs syndrome.\u201d Other risk factors for sleep eating include a family history of eating disorders of any kind as well as the person\u2019s sex, Schenck said. \u201cSleep-related eating is like 70% female predominant, while sexsomnia, for example, is 80% male predominant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that society\u2019s emphasis on dieting may contribute; if someone restricts their eating during the daytime and doesn\u2019t get enough calories, that may drive more sleep-related eating.\u201d Jill\u2019s mother was always on a diet, she recalls, and wonders if that factor might have contributed to her behavior. \u201cYou know, the big thing was you had to be thin, and I wonder if as a kid I was picking up on it. But I really don\u2019t know,\u201d Jill said. Families may try to help their loved ones by waking them while they are sleep eating, Schenck said. At times, however, doing so can backfire. \u201cThe person may get irritable and angry and say, \u2018Don\u2019t stop me from doing what I have to do.\u2019 I once treated a single mother with three teenage kids who paid her three children to sleep in sleeping bags in the kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she would come into the kitchen during the night, her children would say, \u2018Stop, you paid us to have you stop!\u2019 Guess what happened? She got so frustrated she paid her children more money to go back to their own beds and let her eat in peace.\u201d \u2018Just don\u2019t give up\u2019 It has been more than 20 years since Jill first visited Schenck\u2019s clinic. Today, her restless legs syndrome and sleep-related eating disorder are mostly under control, she said, thanks to a cocktail of three medications Schenck prescribed. \u201cI take them early at night because it takes awhile for the meds to work \u2014 even Dr. Schenck was surprised I take them as early as I do to get my system to calm down by bedtime. \u201cThe medications work 95% of the time, but then I will have the occasional bad day and night,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t work, it\u2019s just exhausting.\u201d She does her best to keep overly processed trigger foods out of her home, a desire that is at times sabotaged by the treats she has on hand when her grandchildren visit. But life is enormously better than before she began treatment. \u201cI\u2019m very, very, very grateful that I finally found someone who understands what I am going through,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI know there are thousands of people out there suffering just like me, and my heart goes out to them. It is a tough journey to go through.\u201d Her advice to others? Be your own best advocate, she said. Do research and read what you can about the disorder so you know the right questions to ask the doctor. And above all, she said, request a prescription for a sleep study to find out what is triggering the behavior. \u201cDon\u2019t let doctors put you down, blow you off or make you feel bad,\u201d she said. \u201cOne doctor might not want to do a sleep study, so find another doctor that will. \u201cJust keep fighting until you get the right doctor. Get a second opinion, even a third opinion if you think you need to. Just don\u2019t give up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/sleep-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death", "text": "Lisa Pisano, the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney, died Sunday,\u00a0according to\u00a0NYU Langone Health, where she had the surgery. Pisano\u00a0received the transplant on April 12, but the organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed May 29. Her case was the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the animal\u2019s thymus gland. Pisano\u00a0was brave and altruistic, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute,\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday. She had said\u00a0during a news conference after the procedure that even if the organ transplant didn\u2019t work for her, it might for the next person. \u201cAt least somebody is going to benefit from it,\u201d she said. Montgomery said Tuesday that \u201cLisa\u2019s contributions to medicine, surgery, and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. \u2026 Lisa helped bring us closer to realizing a future where someone does not have to die for another person to live.\u201d Every eight minutes, another person is added to the transplant waiting list, and 17 people from this list die each day waiting for an organ, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Xenotransplantation, which involves using organs from other species, is a potential solution to the shortage of available donor organs, experts say. Doctors in the US perform xenotransplants in rare cases, with permission from the US Food and Drug Administration. For Pisano, the permission came through the agency\u2019s expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policy, which allows terminally ill patients who have no other treatment options to access experimental medical products. Due to Pisano\u2019s heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, she couldn\u2019t have a standard transplant, NYU Langone said in a news release. Before the xenotransplant, Pisano\u00a0said,\u00a0she had \u201ctried everything else\u201d and, with the surgery, was hoping to spend time with her grandkids and play with them. The pig kidney she received was genetically altered to evade human antibodies, which typically detect and attack foreign organs. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed beneath the pig kidney\u2019s cover to further help Pisano\u2019s body accept the organ. However, the kidney was removed in May after it was determined that it was \u201cno longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen,\u201d Montgomery said at the time. Pisano\u2019s \u201cbravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs,\u201d he said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cHer legacy as a pioneer will live on and she will forever be remembered for her courage and good nature.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_mediterranean-diet-children-cardiometabolic-health-wellness", "text": "The Mediterranean diet has been linked to many health benefits for adults. Now, a new study suggests it could be\u00a0beneficial to children\u2019s heart health\u00a0as well. An analysis of nine earlier studies including 577 participants from the ages of 3 to 18 has found incorporating the Mediterranean diet for at least eight weeks had a significant association with lowering blood pressure and total cholesterol, according to the study published Friday in the\u00a0journal JAMA Network Open. The research further supports that incorporating healthy dietary habits early in life can help prevent cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders, such as high blood pressure and\u00a0diabetes, which often originate in childhood, researchers say. \u201cEarly dietary habits significantly influence long-term health outcomes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Jos\u00e9 Francisco L\u00f3pez-Gil, a senior researcher with One Health Research Group at the University of the Americas in Quito, Ecuador, in an email. \u201cThe key takeaway for parents is the importance of promoting a diet rich in whole foods and healthy fats to optimize their children\u2019s health and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.\u201d Knowing the benefits the Mediterranean diet has for adults\u2019 cardiometabolic health, the findings are not surprising but provide further emphasis on the importance of having a diet of\u00a0unprocessed foods\u00a0such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats and fish for all stages of life, said Dr. Stuart Berger, division head of pediatric cardiology at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago. Berger was not involved with the study. Here\u2019s how parents and guardians could help their children benefit from the Mediterranean eating plan, according to experts. Should kids eat the Mediterranean diet? The\u00a0Mediterranean diet\u00a0is a way of eating that includes plant-based cooking with an emphasis on healthy fats. Fruits, vegetables, beans, seeds, nuts, whole grains, lean meats and fish are all contributors to the\u00a0dietary plan. Not every child needs to adopt a Mediterranean diet, but it is important to increase \u201creal foods\u201d in children\u2019s diets and decrease highly processed foods that have added sugars and sodium, said Dr. Natalie Muth, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, who was not involved with the research. \u201cWe know that calories from ultraprocessed foods\u00a0make up about 70%\u00a0of a typical teenager\u2019s intake. Any change that can lower intake of things like chips, cookies, and sodas and increase intake of fruits and vegetables is a big win,\u201d said Muth, a\u00a0pediatrician and registered dietitian at the WELL Clinic at Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group in San Diego, in an email. But it is always important to keep in mind a child\u2019s preferences and to incorporate cultural traditions into any guidance around food choices, Muth added. For those looking to shift to the Mediterranean eating plan, following age-appropriate dietary plans and exercise recommended by a child\u2019s pediatrician is also key, said Berger, who is a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Gathering\u00a0together as a family over a meal as a way to connect also plays a major role\u00a0in the Mediterranean diet,\u00a0said Dr. Tamara Hannon, director of the clinical pediatric diabetes program at Riley Hospital for Children\u00a0at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis. \u201cParents need to lead by example by eating using this pattern, offering structured meals and snacks (scheduled), and exercising daily,\u201d she added in an email. Hannon, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, was not involved with the research. Hannon also recommends parents and guardians limit their children\u2019s eating between structured meals and snacks as well as eliminating sugary beverages and juices to improve blood glucose and weight management. Future research on improving children\u2019s heart health The authors of the new report found a variation in results across the earlier studies analyzed, which can be attributed to the differing factors of diet and physical activity each study displayed. Despite the variations, the Mediterranean diet consistently improved\u00a0blood pressure levels and\u00a0lipid profiles, L\u00f3pez-Gil said, which can lower the risk of cardiometabolic problems later in life such as heart attacks, strokes and diabetes. The researchers were surprised they didn\u2019t find evidence of any effects on glucose and insulin levels, L\u00f3pez-Gil said. The impact the Mediterranean diet has on these health factors could be less pronounced, or could require a longer time frame to have an effect, he added. The study looked at the results of kids adopting the dietary plan from eight to 40 weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to do more studies on kids in particular,\u201d Berger said, \u201cbut reviewing these studies suggest the \u2026 beneficial effects of the so-called Mediterranean diet and everything associated with it.\u201d Further research should include larger sample sizes and more diverse populations as well as longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of the Mediterranean diet on kids\u2019 cardiometabolic health, L\u00f3pez-Gil said. \u201cThe growing research shows the value (in the Mediterranean diet) to be the same for children and adolescents (as in adults),\u201d Muth said. \u201cOne of the most impactful steps a parent can take to help improve kids\u2019 nutrition is to commit to regular family meals and try to prepare foods at home, as often as possible.\u00a0The more kids are exposed to fruits, vegetables, and fish, the more likely they will try them and like them eventually.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/mediterranean-diet-children-cardiometabolic-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "health"}}
