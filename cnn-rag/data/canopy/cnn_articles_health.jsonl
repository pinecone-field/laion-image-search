Researchers from Truveta, a health data analytics company, analyzed electronic health records for more than 18,000 adults, all of whom had overweight or obesity, who were using these medications in the real world between May 2022 and September 2023. The findings were published Monday in the JAMA Internal Medicine medical journal. Both medications were effective: The vast majority of people using either tirzepatide or semaglutide lost at least 5% of their starting body weight after one year of use. But 82% of people taking tirzepatide reached this important clinical benchmark, compared with about 67% of those taking semaglutide. And people taking tirzepatide were more than twice as likely to lose at least 15% of their starting weight than those taking semaglutide: about 42% compared with 18% after one year of use. Average weight loss was also consistently higher among those taking tirzepatide over time. After three months, people taking tirzepatide had lost about 6% of their body weight, on average, compared with an average of less than 4% loss among those taking semaglutide. At six months, average weight loss was 10% on tirzepatide and about 6% on semaglutide. And by one year, average weight loss was nearly double for those taking tirzepatide: more than 15%, compared with about 8% for those taking semaglutide. Tirzepatide and semaglutide both mimic the effects of the gut hormone GLP-1, which stimulates the body\u2019s production of insulin and slows the passage of food through the stomach. GLP-1 also signals the brain to help control appetite. Tirzepatide also stimulates a second gut hormone, called GIP, which may help boost its effects. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved versions of tirzepatide and semaglutide to treat both type 2 diabetes and obesity. Eli Lilly manufactures tirzepatide under the brand name Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for chronic weight management, while Novo Nordisk manufacturers semaglutide as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight management. The FDA approved higher doses of both tirzepatide and semaglutide to treat weight loss, but the new study looked only at the doses to treat type 2 diabetes. About half of the people who were included in this study had type 2 diabetes, while the other half had no indication of a diabetes diagnosis in their health records and were probably using these medications off-label for weight management at their doctor\u2019s discretion. When the findings from this study were first released in a preprint last year, Novo Nordisk told CNN that it wasn\u2019t a fair comparison. \u201cThe doses of semaglutide evaluated in this analysis have not been investigated for chronic weight management, and there are no head-to-head trials that have reported which evaluate Wegovy\u00a0and tirzepatide,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. According to the new study, individuals with type 2 diabetes had less significant weight loss than those without a diagnosis \u2014 but average weight loss was still greater among those taking tirzepatide. The researchers did not track mild gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting, noting that these types of complaints might not be captured in patient records consistently. But the risk of more serious adverse outcomes \u2014 such as bowel obstruction, gasteoparesis or pancreatitis \u2014 were found to be similar among those taking tirzepatide and semaglutide. Along with side effects, people who did not lose weight while taking these medications may be more likely to stop or switch drugs, the researchers say. Discontinuation was common \u2014 more than half of patients stopped their treatment before the end of the study \u2014 but rates were similar among those taking tirzepatide and those taking semaglutide. The findings from this study align with clinical trial results, but the study authors note that more research is needed to compare the effects that tirzepatide and semaglutide have on other key health outcomes, such as heart-related events.

{"id": "2024_07_16_health_teens-mental-health-support-parent-gap-wellness", "text": "As a youth mental health crisis persists in the US, a new report highlights a significant gap between the level of support that teenagers feel and the amount that parents think their children have. Only about a quarter of teens said they always get the social and emotional support they need, but parents were nearly three times more likely to think they did, according to a report published Tuesday by the National Center for Health Statistics. The findings are based on nationally representative surveys of nearly 1,200 children ages 12 to 17 and their parents, conducted in 2021 and 2022. Parents responded to survey questions from trained interviewers, while children responded to survey questions online after their parents gave approval. The study authors note that the presence of an interviewer may have biased parents to respond more favorably, but significant discrepancies between perceptions of parents and children were found across demographic groups. \u201cThis suggests a systematic bias where parents consistently report higher levels of social and emotional support compared with their teenager\u2019s perception, and in doing so may underestimate their teenager\u2019s perceived need for social and emotional support,\u201d the study authors wrote. Teens are often thinking about their feelings, along with their identity and place in the world, but they might not want to share that with their parents, said Dr. Jeffrey Arnett, a developmental psychologist and senior research scholar at Clark University. He was not involved in the new study. \u201cThis is sometimes something they discuss with their parents, but to a large extent, it\u2019s an individual project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to start developing an independent identity. They sometimes feel like they should be independent, so it can get more difficult to talk openly with their parents about how they\u2019re feeling.\u201d Defining support in different ways There also may be a disconnect between the support parents think they\u2019re offering and the type that their teenage children are seeking \u2013 even when there are the best of intentions on both sides, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a psychologist who was not involved in the new study but who has written books on related topics and who co-hosts a parenting podcast. A parent\u2019s first instinct is often to provide advice or guidance, while teens tend to want empathy and reassurance, she said. \u201cWhen teenagers come to adults with concerns, I think above everything else, what they\u2019re looking for is for the adult to serve as a steady presence to maintain perspective about what\u2019s happening and help the teenager gain a sense of perspective,\u201d Damour said. \u00a0\u201cSo when we go with our common instinct to offer advice or guidance or ask questions, I think sometimes that feels to teenagers like we are confirming that the problem is every bit as bad as it feels to them, and it doesn\u2019t have the intended effect.\u201d The surveys from the new report did not define social or emotional support, so it was up to teens and their parents to determine what that meant to them. And this disconnect between parents and their teens may be exacerbated by broader anxieties that parents have about the mental health crises the US is facing, Damour said. \u201cParents may now, more than in recent years, be quick to try to jump in with solutions or corrections because they are anxious about adolescent mental health overall,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the net effect is that it is probably harder than it\u2019s ever been for parents to feel like a steady presence in the face of teenage hiccups and bumps, and that may be trickling down to their kids.\u201d Overall, 93% of parents thought their children always or usually had the social and emotional support they need, but only about 59% of teens felt that to be true, according to the new report. Instead, 20% of teens said that they rarely or never had the support they need, compared with only about 3% of parents who thought the same. Links with mental health concerns Support systems are important for everyone but particularly for adolescents, who are experiencing a period of major biological and social transition, experts say. It\u2019s important for parents to encourage open lines of communication with their teens because, despite the push for independence, they are still reliant on them in many ways, Arnett said. \u201cThe relationship that adolescents have with their parents is central to life for almost all of them. They\u2019re growing up, but they\u2019re still children in many ways,\u201d he said. And the new report shows that teens who did not feel that they always or usually had the support they need were significantly more likely to report a number of poor health effects than those who did feel supported. Depression and anxiety were nearly three times more common among teenagers who did not feel emotionally supported than among those who did; nearly a third of those who did not feel supported reported symptoms, according to the new study. Two-thirds of teens who did not feel supported reported poor sleep, compared with about a third of those who did feel supported. And nearly 14% of teens who did not feel supported said that they had poor health or low life satisfaction, compared with less than 5% of those who did feel supported. Groups of teens who were among the least likely to feel they had the support they need were also among those with the largest gaps in parent perception, according to the new report. Less than half of Black teens (42%) and LGBTQ+ teens (44%) said they always or usually had the social and emotional support they need, while their parents perceived this to be the case more than twice as often. Teenage girls were less likely than boys to say they always or usually had the support they need, and there was a larger gap in perception between teen girls and their parents. Experts say it\u2019s important for adults to make intentional time to connect with teenagers in their life. This is especially true in the age of technology and social media, when physical togetherness may not always bring emotional connectedness, Arnett said. The US surgeon general has emphasized the importance of protecting youth mental health, most recently calling for a warning label to be put on social media platforms. \u201cOften, supporting teenagers is as simple as being curious about what they bring our way and then offering empathy,\u201d Damour said. \u201cTake comfort in the knowledge that helping a teenager feel heard and understood is overwhelmingly the most useful and therapeutic thing an adult can do.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/teens-mental-health-support-parent-gap-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_bird-flu-cases-extreme-heat", "text": "Searing heat may have played a role in the infections of five workers who fell ill last week while culling a large flock of chickens infected with the H5N1 virus in Colorado, health officials said Tuesday. \u201cAt the time transmission is thought to have occurred, Colorado was experiencing 104-plus-degree heat,\u201d and it was probably hotter inside the barns, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0The CDC is investigating the outbreak along with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. This made the use of personal protective equipment a challenge, Shah said. In addition, to bring down temperatures in the sweltering barns, large industrial fans were blowing, moving air as well as dust and feathers.\u00a0Feathers from infected birds are known to carry the H5N1 virus. \u201cWe understand those large fans \u2026 were moving so much air \u2026 the workers were finding it hard to maintain a good seal or a good fit either between the mask or with eye protection,\u201d Shah said. Four of the Colorado cases have been confirmed by the CDC. A fifth tested positive at a state lab and has been sent to the CDC for confirmation. The incident has quickly doubled the number of farm workers known to be infected with H5N1 virus in the United States, and it is the largest number of workers known to be infected in connection with a single farm. In 2022, a poultry worker tested positive for H5N1 in Colorado.\u00a0This year, four other farm workers have tested positive \u2014 one in Texas, two in Michigan and another in Colorado \u2014 after working with infected dairy cattle.\u00a0Cases are believed to be undercounted because farm workers are often reluctant to be tested for fear of losing work and income. Genetic analysis of the virus from one of the recent human cases involved in the poultry culling was reassuring, Shah said, because it didn\u2019t show any mutations that might indicate the virus is spreading more readily to people. Testing also showed that the virus was closely related to the strain spreading in cattle. At the state of Colorado\u2019s request, the CDC has sent a 10-person team to assist with the investigation and contact tracing in the outbreak.\u00a0Sixty people have shown symptoms consistent with bird flu, and all but five have tested negative at a state laboratory, Shah said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen strong uptake of testing across this particular farm in Colorado,\u201d he added. None of the workers was hospitalized, and many had traditional flu symptoms, including conjunctivitis or eye infections, fever, chills, coughing and sore throats.\u00a0The workers have been offered an antiviral medication and are recovering. Altogether, about 160 people are involved in the culling, or killing, of 1.8 million egg-laying chickens on the Colorado farm, which is a \u201csignificant\u201d egg-producing operation that officials didn\u2019t name.\u00a0The culling operation is expected to continue another 10 to 14 days. It is not clear how the birds became infected, but viruses isolated from the birds are closely related to the same strain that\u2019s infecting dairy cattle, said Dr. Eric Deeble, the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s acting senior adviser of the H5N1 response. The CDC maintains that the threat to the public of the H5N1 bird flu virus is low. However, farm workers are at higher risk of catching the infection, which has recently spread from domestic and wild birds to dairy cattle and other mammals. To stay safe, the CDC recommends that people working with sick or dead cattle or birds wear personal protective equipment, or PPE, which includes waterproof coveralls, a face mask, goggles or a face shield, boots, gloves and a head covering. Workers involved in the culling of the chickens in Colorado were required to wear the full uniform, but environmental conditions made it difficult to keep on. \u201cWe understand that PPE use was not optimal, particularly the masks and the eye protection,\u201d Shah said. The United Farm Workers labor union has questioned whether the CDC\u2019s recommendations are practical given the record-breaking heat enveloping much of the United States this summer.\u00a0It had called on the CDC to rethink its PPE guidance so more people could follow it. \u201cThese are people that are being asked to put their lives on the line for a virus we don\u2019t understand all that well when they have no reasonable way of protecting themselves from either the virus or from heat illness,\u201d Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers, said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re being put in an impossible position.\u201d Workers wear fluid-proof coveralls, Strater points out, which prevent sweat from cooling their bodies, making it easy to overheat.\u00a0In dirty, wet environments like a barn, masks and respirators can become clogged or soggy within minutes. The CDC said it is working to refine its PPE recommendations to account for the heat.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve sent, as part of our team, a specialist in these matters, an industrial hygienist who can help implement improved engineering controls that may make PPE use more uniform as well as more palatable,\u201d Shah said. Strater said it\u2019s time for the CDC to consider vaccinating farmworkers, as Finland is, to give them \u2013 and the general public \u2013 an added layer of protection from the virus and from the threat of another pandemic if it spreads. \u201cThey need to be prioritized, not just because it\u2019s moral to protect their lives by prioritizing vaccination, but it\u2019s a relatively small group of people, when you think about the sort of firewall they\u2019re creating around the rest of the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a huge number of people we need to be protecting. These are people who are on the front lines and who are so intimately exposed.\u201d Although US health officials have stressed that they have no plans to distribute an H5N1 vaccine, they are getting several candidates ready to be deployed in case the virus becomes more dangerous. In May, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was ordering 4.8 million doses of H5N1 vaccine to be manufactured from bulk ingredients in the country\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile. Those doses are expected to be ready by the end of the month. In early July, HHS announced that it had paid Moderna $176 million to support the development of an mRNA-based vaccine against H5N1. The agency said it expects to see phase 1 clinical trial results on the safety of that vaccine by the end of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/bird-flu-cases-extreme-heat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_mediterranean-diet-children-cardiometabolic-health-wellness", "text": "The Mediterranean diet has been linked to many health benefits for adults. Now, a new study suggests it could be\u00a0beneficial to children\u2019s heart health\u00a0as well. An analysis of nine earlier studies including 577 participants from the ages of 3 to 18 has found incorporating the Mediterranean diet for at least eight weeks had a significant association with lowering blood pressure and total cholesterol, according to the study published Friday in the\u00a0journal JAMA Network Open. The research further supports that incorporating healthy dietary habits early in life can help prevent cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders, such as high blood pressure and\u00a0diabetes, which often originate in childhood, researchers say. \u201cEarly dietary habits significantly influence long-term health outcomes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Jos\u00e9 Francisco L\u00f3pez-Gil, a senior researcher with One Health Research Group at the University of the Americas in Quito, Ecuador, in an email. \u201cThe key takeaway for parents is the importance of promoting a diet rich in whole foods and healthy fats to optimize their children\u2019s health and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.\u201d Knowing the benefits the Mediterranean diet has for adults\u2019 cardiometabolic health, the findings are not surprising but provide further emphasis on the importance of having a diet of\u00a0unprocessed foods\u00a0such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats and fish for all stages of life, said Dr. Stuart Berger, division head of pediatric cardiology at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago. Berger was not involved with the study. Here\u2019s how parents and guardians could help their children benefit from the Mediterranean eating plan, according to experts. Should kids eat the Mediterranean diet? The\u00a0Mediterranean diet\u00a0is a way of eating that includes plant-based cooking with an emphasis on healthy fats. Fruits, vegetables, beans, seeds, nuts, whole grains, lean meats and fish are all contributors to the\u00a0dietary plan. Not every child needs to adopt a Mediterranean diet, but it is important to increase \u201creal foods\u201d in children\u2019s diets and decrease highly processed foods that have added sugars and sodium, said Dr. Natalie Muth, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, who was not involved with the research. \u201cWe know that calories from ultraprocessed foods\u00a0make up about 70%\u00a0of a typical teenager\u2019s intake. Any change that can lower intake of things like chips, cookies, and sodas and increase intake of fruits and vegetables is a big win,\u201d said Muth, a\u00a0pediatrician and registered dietitian at the WELL Clinic at Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group in San Diego, in an email. But it is always important to keep in mind a child\u2019s preferences and to incorporate cultural traditions into any guidance around food choices, Muth added. For those looking to shift to the Mediterranean eating plan, following age-appropriate dietary plans and exercise recommended by a child\u2019s pediatrician is also key, said Berger, who is a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Gathering\u00a0together as a family over a meal as a way to connect also plays a major role\u00a0in the Mediterranean diet,\u00a0said Dr. Tamara Hannon, director of the clinical pediatric diabetes program at Riley Hospital for Children\u00a0at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis. \u201cParents need to lead by example by eating using this pattern, offering structured meals and snacks (scheduled), and exercising daily,\u201d she added in an email. Hannon, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, was not involved with the research. Hannon also recommends parents and guardians limit their children\u2019s eating between structured meals and snacks as well as eliminating sugary beverages and juices to improve blood glucose and weight management. Future research on improving children\u2019s heart health The authors of the new report found a variation in results across the earlier studies analyzed, which can be attributed to the differing factors of diet and physical activity each study displayed. Despite the variations, the Mediterranean diet consistently improved\u00a0blood pressure levels and\u00a0lipid profiles, L\u00f3pez-Gil said, which can lower the risk of cardiometabolic problems later in life such as heart attacks, strokes and diabetes. The researchers were surprised they didn\u2019t find evidence of any effects on glucose and insulin levels, L\u00f3pez-Gil said. The impact the Mediterranean diet has on these health factors could be less pronounced, or could require a longer time frame to have an effect, he added. The study looked at the results of kids adopting the dietary plan from eight to 40 weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to do more studies on kids in particular,\u201d Berger said, \u201cbut reviewing these studies suggest the \u2026 beneficial effects of the so-called Mediterranean diet and everything associated with it.\u201d Further research should include larger sample sizes and more diverse populations as well as longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of the Mediterranean diet on kids\u2019 cardiometabolic health, L\u00f3pez-Gil said. \u201cThe growing research shows the value (in the Mediterranean diet) to be the same for children and adolescents (as in adults),\u201d Muth said. \u201cOne of the most impactful steps a parent can take to help improve kids\u2019 nutrition is to commit to regular family meals and try to prepare foods at home, as often as possible.\u00a0The more kids are exposed to fruits, vegetables, and fish, the more likely they will try them and like them eventually.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/mediterranean-diet-children-cardiometabolic-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness", "text": "Vegetables are great not only\u00a0for their versatility\u00a0\u2014 they can be eaten raw or cooked, whole or chopped \u2014 but also for their health benefits. However, those looking to incorporate more veggies into their diet may be overlooking one in particular. Eating three servings of baby carrots a week can give a significant boost of important nutrients found in the\u00a0orange root vegetables, according to a new unpublished study presented June 30 in Chicago at\u00a0Nutrition 2024,\u00a0the annual meeting of the\u00a0American Society for Nutrition. Surveys found separately in 2015 and 2019 that only\u00a0about 1 in 10 American adults ate the recommended 2 to 3 cups of vegetables daily, according to a 2022 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0report\u00a0on fruit and vegetable intake. That statistic inspired lead study author Mary Harper Simmons and her colleagues to investigate a simple solution that could increase a person\u2019s weekly vegetable intake. \u201c(Baby carrots) are grab and go, great with things like ranch, hummus \u2014 I\u2019ve even seen people dip them in peanut butter \u2014 some people like them plain,\u201d said Simmons, a graduate student in nutrition at Samford University in Alabama. \u201cI would really like to show people that improving your health can be (done) with small simple changes. \u2026 It does not have to be one drastic change overnight.\u201d For the study, one serving of baby carrots \u2014 chopped into smaller pieces and commonly sold at grocery stores \u2014 was around eight to 12 carrots, the equivalent of 100 grams or half a cup, Simmons added. The unpublished study looked at 60 young adults who were either assigned to eat the servings of carrots three times a week, eat no carrots and instead take a multivitamin supplement, consume a combination of the carrots and the multivitamin, or consume neither the carrots or supplement as a control group. After four weeks, the researchers found those who ate the carrots had a 10.8% increase in carotenoids in their skin, natural antioxidants found to have\u00a0health benefits, such as preventing inflammation and promoting heart health, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Additionally, the researchers found those who only took the multivitamin (containing the same carotenoid found in carrots) did not see any changes in carotenoid levels. But those who consumed the carrots and the supplement saw the most benefits and increased their skin carotenoids by 21.6%. \u201cPeople might think, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m getting a multivitamin supplement, (that should be enough),\u2019 but that alone did not increase the carotenoid accumulation. It was a combination that seemed to increase it,\u201d said Dr. Suresh Mathews, the principal investigator for the new study and a professor and chair of Samford\u2019s department of nutrition and dietetics. \u201cThe \u2018food first\u2019\u00a0philosophy always works. But for populations that may be unable to just do only foods or are limited, the combination of the food and the supplements seems to have an even bigger effect in this case,\u201d he added. The benefits of eating carrots and other vegetables \u201cHigh vegetable intake is associated with all kinds of positive health effects \u2014 the risk of all kinds of chronic diseases are lowered with increased fruit and vegetable consumption,\u201d said Dr. Sander Kersten, the director of the division of nutritional sciences and Schleifer Family Professor\u00a0at Cornell University, who was not involved in the new study. Eating vegetables can protect against heart disease, some cancers, diabetes and obesity,\u00a0according to the CDC. But carrots and other orange and red-toned vegetables such as squash and sweet potatoes are unique in that they\u2019re high in beta-carotene, the carotenoid that the body converts into vitamin A, Kersten said. Dark leafy greens, such as spinach and kale, are also high in beta-carotene, he added. Vitamin A is important for keeping your heart, lungs and other organs healthy and also for supporting various bodily functions, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health. Vitamin A deficiency is not common in the United States,\u00a0but people should still look to eat fruits and vegetables to reap the benefits of the natural low-calorie, high-in-fiber foods, Kersten said. Young adults eating vegetables While a reminder to include vegetables in a healthy diet is good for everyone, Simmons said the message is particularly important when it comes to young adults. According to the\u00a02022 CDC report, around 7% of adults\u00a0ages 18 to 30 eat the recommended amount of vegetables, while a 2023\u00a0National College Health Assessment\u00a0from the American College Health Association found that about 1 in 4 college students surveyed said they ate three or more servings of vegetables per day. \u201cYou hear the thing we tell kids, \u2018Eat the rainbow,\u2019 and I feel like for any age that really does stand,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt is good to have a variety of colors on your plate, and if not every single time you eat, just having a variety throughout your day and throughout your week is definitely very beneficial to getting all those key nutrients that our body needs to function.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_travel_van-life-travel-cec-wellness", "text": "Home is where you are. Home is where you make it. Home on the range. Home is \u2026 in a camper van? Absolutely! When I tried camper van life for the first time, I went all in. For three weeks, my husband and I drove a kitted-out, circa 2012 Ford Econoline van across North America, traveling from northern New Jersey to Los Angeles as we wound our way along the length of Route 66 in November 2019. It was a bold move, but I knew it was the most cost-efficient and efficient-efficient way to see as much of \u201cthe Mother Road\u201d as we could. My hope was that by renting a camper van, we\u2019d save money on purchased meals and hotel rooms and also feel more immersed in the journey and deeply connected to each town we visited. Our first night in the Bloomington, Illinois, Walmart parking lot was a little nerve-racking. I lay in my sleeping bag, listening to the activity beyond the van and wondering if we could handle this adventure. But after the first successful sleepover, we quickly settled into a routine. We\u2019d wake up each morning for a quick bathroom run and even shower at some of the surprisingly luxurious recreational vehicle parks we patronized. Then we\u2019d cook breakfast on our camp stove at the rear of the van and hit the road by 8:30 or 9 a.m. After a day covering roughly 130 miles and experiencing the historic sites, local museums, former filling stations and proudly kitschy roadside attractions along Route 66, we\u2019d make sure to arrive at our nightly destination by 4:30 p.m. \u2014 sundown in November comes early. By the time we dropped off the van near Los Angeles International Airport in late November, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a new but dear friend on the last day of summer camp. We\u2019d unwind, explore the sights of the town, treat ourselves to dinner away from the van, then bunk down in our sleeping bags and do it all again the next day. (We spent two-thirds of the trip sleeping in the van and the other third in historic lodgings along the route, such as Boots Court in Carthage, Missouri, and the El Rancho in Gallup, New Mexico.) The benefits of camper van travel Now, I\u2019m not saying you must spend weeks on an epic road trip to fully experience the joy of a camper van. And I\u2019m certainly not saying you need to sell all your possessions and become a full-time van lifer \u2014 I\u2019m grateful to return to my house and my cats after every trip. But even a few days of traveling and living in a camper van can give you a whole new perspective on yourself and the world around you. When you\u2019re in a camper van, everything you need is within reach \u2014 to an extent. I loved the challenge of condensing our lives into approximately 75 square feet and finding creative ways to live comfortably but efficiently. The morning coffee? It\u2019s right there. Your outfit for the day? Just reach behind you. If you need to change your shoes into hiking boots, grab a raincoat for an unexpected downpour, refuel with a quick snack or recharge with a 20-minute power nap, you don\u2019t need to go far. And you don\u2019t have to repack your bags to leave a hotel every morning. After the first night, I embraced the security and sanctuary of the van, knowing that whatever we had was around us. If we couldn\u2019t find it right away, it wasn\u2019t lost. We had exactly everything we needed \u2014 everything except, well, a bathroom, which brings me to the next life-changing aspect of a camper van. Camper van life makes you brave and gets you out there, interacting with others and connecting with the world. You\u2019re always in the environment, not separated by hotel corridors and lobbies. You\u2019re discovering creative places to stay for the night, looking forward to chatting with bartenders during the nightly dinner at a local restaurant or just fielding questions from strangers about the van and your trip. During our Route 66 adventure, our van prompted exchanges and allowed us to have moments we would likely have missed in a rental car. In Arcadia, Oklahoma, we stopped by Pops 66 Soda Ranch and struck up a conversation with a woman admiring our brightly painted camper van. She told us about one of the chairs at the nearby Oklahoma City National Memorial representing a boy named Zackary who loved collecting pennies. The next morning, we found Zackary\u2019s chair and placed a penny on it for him. Because the van functioned as a full campsite rig, we didn\u2019t have to figure out the logistics of bringing or renting equipment to camp in Joshua Tree National Park in California. We spent two nights in wonder among the granite boulders, with Cassiopeia shining brightly above, and two mornings waking up with the sun and the scent of high desert air. Tips for trying the van life Ready to try camper van travel? Companies rent vans that come fully equipped with mini kitchens and bedding, so it\u2019s almost as easy as booking an Airbnb. Some even come with toilets and showers, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a deal-breaker. Rent one for a quick round-trip weekend visit or explore further by taking a one-way jaunt to another rental hub and then flying home. If you\u2019re itching to have a new type of travel experience, you\u2019ll find it behind the rolling door of a camper van. As another well-loved saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey\u201d \u2014 but with a camper van, you\u2019ll get to appreciate both at once.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/travel/van-life-travel-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_health_voice-box-transplant", "text": "A Massachusetts man has regained his voice after surgeons removed his cancerous larynx and, in a pioneering move, replaced it with a donated one. Transplants of the so-called voice box are extremely rare, and normally aren\u2019t an option for people with active cancer. Marty Kedian is only the third person in the U.S. ever to undergo a total larynx transplant \u2013 the others, years ago, because of injuries \u2013 and one of a handful reported worldwide. Surgeons at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona offered Kedian the transplant as part of a new clinical trial aimed at opening the potentially lifechanging operation to more patients, including some with cancer, the most common way to lose a larynx. \u201cPeople need to keep their voice,\u201d Kedian, 59, told The Associated Press four months after his transplant \u2013 still hoarse but able to keep up an hourlong conversation. \u201cI want people to know this can be done.\u201d He became emotional recalling the first time he phoned his 82-year-old mother after the surgery \u201cand she could hear me. \u2026 That was important to me, to talk to my mother.\u201d The study is small \u2014 just nine more people will be enrolled. But it may teach scientists best practices for these complex transplants so that one day they could be offered to more people who can\u2019t breathe, swallow or speak on their own because of a damaged or surgically removed larynx. \u201cPatients become very reclusive, and very kind of walled off from the rest of the world,\u201d said Dr. David Lott, Mayo\u2019s chair of head and neck surgery in Phoenix. He started the study because \u201cmy patients tell me, \u2018Yeah I may be alive but I\u2019m not really living.\u2019\u201d Lott\u2019s team reported early results of the surgery Tuesday in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. The larynx may be best known as the voice box but it\u2019s also vital for breathing and swallowing. Muscular tissue flaps called vocal cords open to let air into the lungs, close to prevent food or drink from going the wrong way \u2013 and vibrate when air pushes past them to produce speech. The first two U.S. larynx transplant recipients \u2013 at the Cleveland Clinic in 1998 and the University of California, Davis, in 2010 \u2013 had lost their voices to injuries, one from a motorcycle accident and the other damaged by a hospital ventilator. But cancer is the biggest reason. The American Cancer Society estimates more than 12,600 people will be diagnosed with some form of laryngeal cancer this year. While today many undergo voice-preserving treatment, thousands of people have had their larynx completely removed, breathing through what\u2019s called a tracheostomy tube in their neck and struggling to communicate. Although the earlier U.S. recipients achieved near normal speech, doctors haven\u2019t embraced these transplants. Partly that\u2019s because people can survive without a larynx \u2013 while antirejection drugs that suppress the immune system could spark new or recurring tumors. \u201cWe want to be able to push those boundaries but do it as safely and ethically as we can,\u201d Lott said. Head-and-neck specialists say the Mayo trial is key to helping larynx transplants become a viable option. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a \u2018one-off,\u2019\u201d but an opportunity to finally learn from one patient before operating on the next, said Dr. Marshall Strome, who led the 1998 transplant in Cleveland. This first attempt in a cancer patient \u201cis the next important step,\u201d he said. Other options are being studied, noted Dr. Peter Belafsky of UC Davis, who helped perform the 2010 transplant. His patients at high risk of larynx loss record their voice in anticipation of next-generation speech devices that sound like them. But Belafsky said there\u2019s \u201cstill a shot\u201d for larynx transplants to become more common while cautioning it likely will take years more research. One hurdle has been achieving enough nerve regrowth to breathe without a trach tube. Kedian was diagnosed with a rare laryngeal cartilage cancer about a decade ago. The Haverhill, Massachusetts, man underwent more than a dozen surgeries, eventually needing a trach tube to help him breathe and swallow \u2014 and struggled even to muster a raspy whisper through it. He had to retire on disability. Still the once gregarious Kedian, known for long conversations with strangers, wouldn\u2019t let doctors remove his entire larynx to cure the cancer. He desperately wanted to read bedtime stories to his granddaughter, with his own voice rather than what he called robotic-sounding speech devices. Then Kedian\u2019s wife Gina tracked down the Mayo study. Lott decided he was a good candidate because his cancer wasn\u2019t fast-growing and \u2013 especially important \u2013 Kedian already was taking antirejection drugs for an earlier kidney transplant. It took 10 months to find a deceased donor with a healthy enough larynx just the right size. Then on Feb. 29, six surgeons operated for 21 hours. After removing Kedian\u2019s cancerous larynx, they transplanted the donated one plus necessary adjoining tissues \u2013 thyroid and parathyroid glands, the pharynx and upper part of the trachea \u2013 and tiny blood vessels to supply them. Finally, using new microsurgical techniques, they connected nerves critical for Kedian to feel when he needs to swallow and to move the vocal cords. About three weeks later, Kedian said \u201chello.\u201d Soon he\u2019d relearned to swallow, working up from applesauce to macaroni and cheese and hamburgers. He got to say hi to granddaughter Charlotte via video, part of his homework to just keep talking. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Kedian, who moves back to Massachusetts soon. His tracheostomy remains in place at least a few more months but \u201cI\u2019m pushing myself to make it go faster because I want these tubes out of me, to go back to a normal life.\u201d And just as Lott had assured him, Kedian retained his beloved Boston accent.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/voice-box-transplant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_sex-gender-child-brain", "text": "Sex and gender are often conflated or equated in everyday conversations, and most American adults believe a person\u2019s gender is determined by sex assigned at birth. But a new study of nearly 5,000 9- and 10-year-olds found that sex and gender map onto largely distinct parts of the brain. The research gives a first insight into how sex and gender may have \u201cmeasurable and unique influences\u201d on the brain, study authors said, just as other experiences have been shown to shape the brain. \u201cMoving forward, we really need to consider both sexes and genders separately if we better want to understand the brain,\u201d said Dr. Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and the Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, California, and a co-author of the study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances. The researchers on the new study defined sex as what was assigned to the child at birth. In the US, clinicians make this assignment based on genitalia. Most people are assigned either female or male, according to the research; the rest are intersex, a person whose sexual or reproductive anatomy doesn\u2019t fit this male/female binary. The researchers defined gender as an individual\u2019s attitude, feelings and behaviors, as well as socially constructed roles. They noted specifically that gender is not binary, meaning not all people identify as either female or male. Both sex and gender are a core part of human experience. They\u2019re key to how people perceive others and how they understand themselves. Both can influence behavior as well as health, the study authors say. The researchers looked at brain imaging data from 4,757 children in the United States, 2,315 assigned female at birth and 2,442 assigned male at birth, who were ages 9 and 10 and were a subset of the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. Over a period of 10 years, the children in the ABCD study underwent comprehensive neuroimaging, behavioral, developmental and psychiatric assessments. Beyond tests such as MRIs, the scientists did surveys of the children and their parents that were focused on gender, both at the beginning of the research and then a year later. The children were asked about how they expressed their gender and how they felt about it. The parents were asked about a child\u2019s sex-typed behavior during play and whether the child had any gender dysphoria, a term that mental health professionals use to describe clinically significant distress felt because a person\u2019s sense of their gender does not match their sex the assigned at birth. Parents were a key part of the study, said study co-author Dr. Dani S. Bassett, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania with appointments in the Departments of Bioengineering, Electrical & Systems Engineering, Physics & Astronomy, Neurology, and Psychiatry. \u201cWhen kids have a particular kind of gender behavior or gender expression, that will influence how their parents and also other caregivers and friends and family \u2026 et cetera interact with them,\u201d Bassett said. Information about a parent\u2019s perception of a child\u2019s gender gives researchers a better sense of the child\u2019s social environment and how it may affect their brain development. The authors used a kind of artificial intelligence called machine learning that built a model that could predict a child\u2019s sex and reported gender from their brain scan.  When the researchers looked the children\u2019s brain scans, the results seemed to show that sex influenced different regions of the brain that are involved in visual processing, sensory processing and motor control and some regions involved in executive function, which lets an individual organize and integrate information across time. Gender seems to influence some of the more sensory-specific networks that are associated with sex, but it also seems to have a broader influence and can be detected on different brain networks involved in executive function, including things like attention, social cognition and emotional processing. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re able to capture how gender maps onto the brain basically just tells us that gender is influencing our brain,\u201d Dhamala said. The structure of the human brain can be shaped by expertise and experiences. Research on London taxi drivers \u2014 who must take extensive tests to show that they can navigate the city\u2019s streets without maps or GPS \u2014 seems to show that they have significantly larger posterior hippocampi, the part of the brain related to spatial memory and navigation, than in people who aren\u2019t taxi drivers. \u201cSimilarly, as individuals and as humans, we are experts about ourselves and our genders. So it makes sense that gender will also be mapped within our brains,\u201d Dhamala said. What the new study cannot do is predict what gender a person may identify with beyond one limited snapshot in time captured by the scans and surveys. Gender, the authors note, is not something that is necessarily static, and a person\u2019s understanding of their gender can change throughout their lifetime. The study also can\u2019t determine what things in someone\u2019s environment will influence their brain function in terms of sex or gender, nor can it identify what a person\u2019s sexual orientation might be. \u201cSexual orientation is independent from gender and from sex,\u201d Bassett said, and it may be differently mapped in the brain. The researchers say they hope to someday learn more about how sex and gender interact in a person\u2019s life and how they influence one another and the brain throughout a lifetime. They also hope to see how different cultures affect a person\u2019s gender and their brain development. A 2022 poll showed that most American adults \u2014 and the vast majority of conservatives \u2014 believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. The distinction is key to gender-affirming care, medical treatment for people who identify as a gender that is different from the one they were assigned at birth. Conservative politicians have pushed for a record number of bans on such care, and nearly half of US states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care for minors. The study did not look at whether sex or gender were congruent or incongruent in any study participant. Rather, it looked at the child\u2019s binary sex and gender across self- and parent-reported measures. The study couldn\u2019t provide any specific findings if sex and gender were incongruent. \u201cGoing forward, the hope is that we can motivate other scientists to consider science and gender in their analyses in the data collections in their programs and research,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Avram Holmes, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers University. The field of neuroscience has only just begun to acknowledge and address the presence of biases and barriers to inclusivity within research, Holmes said. A fuller understanding of the way the brain works in terms of sex and gender could also have practical implications and potentially help scientists find better ways to treat people with brain-related illnesses. For instance, the study pointed to how people assigned male at birth are more likely to be diagnosed with substance use and attention deficit disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that sex and gender necessarily drive illness rates, but the cultures people are embedded in can also influence the likelihood they may or may not develop a particular illness,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cSo the types of environmental pressures a child undergoes across development could increase or decrease their risk for experiencing illness, independent of their initial brain biology.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/sex-gender-child-brain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_fda-ftc-thc-snacks-letters", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission issued warnings to five companies Tuesday as part of a joint effort to crack down on illegal sales of copycat food products containing delta-8 THC. Delta-8 THC\u00a0is the psychoactive cannabinoid from the Cannabis sativa plant, of which marijuana and hemp plants are two varieties. The packaging for the THC edibles looks strikingly similar to that of popular foods such as Froot Loops cereal and Chips Ahoy! cookies. The FDA has said it is concerned that these products can be easily mistaken for traditional foods, leading to accidental ingestion or overconsumption. The agency specifically cited concerns about the easy availability of these products to young people and potential impurities or unpredictable effects from processes used to synthesize delta-8 THC. \u201cInadequate or confusing labeling can result in children or unsuspecting adults consuming products with strong resemblance to popular snacks and candies that contain delta-8 THC without realizing it,\u201d Dr. Namandj\u00e9 Bumpus, FDA principal deputy commissioner, said in a news release Tuesday. A spokesperson for Earthly Hemps, one of the companies that were issued letters, said it has not sold any Dr. Blaze THC Delta-8 Slushers, Doweedos Delta-8 Chips or Delta-8 Weedos this year. The other companies have not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The FDA says it has given the companies 15 working days to submit written responses detailing how they will address these violations and prevent future ones. If the violations are not promptly addressed, the agency may take legal action. The FDA and the FTC say they are continuing to collaborate to \u201cprotect consumers against companies illegally selling copycat delta-8 THC food products.\u201d The agencies have previously issued similar\u00a0warnings\u00a0to six other companies selling products containing THC, and those companies no longer have such products in stock, the agencies noted. From January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023, the FDA received over 300 adverse event reports involving children and adults who consumed delta-8 THC products, prompting the agency to issue a\u00a0warning\u00a0to customers in June 2022. These adverse effects have included hallucinations, vomiting, tremor, anxiety, dizziness, confusion and loss of consciousness, the agency said. Nearly half of the cases involved hospitalization or emergency department visits. Between January 1, 2021, and May 31, 2022, national poison control centers handled 10,448 single substance exposure cases involving edible products containing THC, 77% of them for people 19 or younger, the FDA said in the warning. Of those cases, 65% were due to unintentional exposure to edible THC-containing products, and 91% of those were children. One of these pediatric cases ended in death after the person consumed a suspected delta-8 THC edible, according to the FDA. \u201cCompanies that market and sell edible THC products that are easily mistaken for snacks and candy are not only acting illegally, but they are also putting the health of young children at risk,\u201d Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in Tuesday\u2019s release. \u201cThose that prioritize profits in front of children\u2019s safety are at serious risk of legal action.\u201d Consumers who notice a reaction or illness after using a product are advised to immediately stop using it and contact a health care provider. Adverse reactions associated with FDA-regulated products can be reported to the FDA using\u00a0MedWatch\u00a0or the\u00a0Safety Reporting Portal. \u201cAs accidental ingestion and/or overconsumption of delta-8 THC containing products could pose considerable health risks, the companies who sell these illegal products are demonstrating complete neglect for consumer safety,\u201d Bumpus said. \u201cThe FDA will continue to work to safeguard the health and safety of U.S. consumers by monitoring the marketplace and taking action when companies sell products that present a threat to public health.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/fda-ftc-thc-snacks-letters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_hiit-workout-without-jumping-wellness", "text": "For the past decade, high-intensity interval training has been among the top 10 fitness trends every year, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. During a HIIT workout, you pair short bursts of intense work \u2014 generally lasting between 15 seconds and four minutes \u2014 with quick recovery periods. These cycles are repeated over a set period of time. The workouts are popular because they are quite beneficial. You can burn a lot of calories in a short period of time during a HIIT workout, which is great for time-pressed individuals. They also build muscle mass, are better at enhancing sports performance than moderate-intensity, continuous exercise, and are more enjoyable than other exercise regimens, studies have shown. A HIIT workout also has a positive effect on your executive function, or cognition, according to a July 2021 review of 24 studies published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Increased cognitive function due to HIIT workouts was even seen in young adults, a February 2020 study showed, which researchers said indicated HIIT workouts may be both an efficient and effective way of combating cognitive decline as people age. Despite all these benefits and HIIT\u2019s popularity, some people are wary of trying these workouts since they often involve various forms of jumping. Popular HIIT moves include jumping jacks, box jumps, burpees, tucks and mountain climbers. If you\u2019ve got a bum knee, poor balance or are recovering from an injury, it makes sense to be leery of jumping. But there is good news \u2014 you can do a wide variety of HIIT workouts without a single jump and still get your heart racing. How to up the intensity without jumping \u201cHigh-impact activities like jumping are often confused with high-intensity ones,\u201d said Jonathan Tylicki, a certified personal trainer based in Irvine, California. \u201cBut high-intensity workouts can be low-impact, where you\u2019re not jumping but still get the same benefits as a high-impact, high-intensity workout.\u201d High-intensity workouts use multiple muscle groups at the same time and elevate your heart rate to more than 70% of its maximum. You can calculate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220, then calculating 70% of that number to know how fast your heart should be beating. For example, a 45-year-old\u2019s maximum heart rate would be 220 minus 45, or 175 beats per minute. Seventy percent of 175 is 122.5, so your heart rate should rise above 122.5 beats per minute during the high-intensity portions of your HIIT workout. More simply, during a high-intensity exercise cycle, you should only be able to say a few words at a time because you\u2019re huffing and puffing so much. So how do you get your heart racing without jumping around? One way is through speed. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing squats, do them as fast as you can,\u201d said Pete McCall, a certified personal trainer based in Encinitas, California, and host of the \u201cAll About Fitness\u201d podcast. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to jump at the end.\u201d Good form, of course, is important. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for the rapid lengthening and shortening of muscle tissues, which is one of the benefits of jumping,\u201d McCall said. \u201cBut you can get almost the same benefit by standing in place and doing as many squats as you can in 20 seconds.\u201d Another way to up the intensity of an exercise is to use resistance bands or weights. So toss a medicine ball, Tylicki said, or use resistance bands to create extra tension against your muscle tissues. One example: Tie a band to a doorknob of a shut door, then pull or row it as quickly as you can. The traditional shoulder press is a favorite of Tylicki\u2019s for upping the intensity of a workout. He instructs his clients to use heavier weights than they normally do or use lighter weights paired with faster speed. \u201cI love showing clients how their heart rate increases while doing shoulder presses,\u201d Tylicki said. \u201cIt always takes them by surprise.\u201d Rowing machines are also a great choice for a high-intensity, low-impact workout, McCall said. \u201cSo much of your body is in motion at one time, you use more muscle mass,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no impact from the ground. I have bad arthritis in my right knee, and the rowing machine is my go-to. They\u2019re one of the best-kept secrets.\u201d But consider some easier jumping, too If you don\u2019t have a limiting injury or issue, both trainers who spoke with CNN said you should consider trying some form of jumping during your workouts, at least occasionally. \u201cThere are benefits from including impact in training,\u201d Tylicki said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways to improve bone mineral density, for example, which is important for women who are prone to osteoporosis or osteopenia.\u201d The key is to start slowly and easily. Try jumping jacks or jumping rope, which have less impact than, say, box jumps. If you want to try box jumps, start with a short box and jump up, then step down, McCall said. \u201cAnybody can jump, but landing correctly is the issue,\u201d McCall said. \u201cIf you\u2019re jumping up and down off a box, you\u2019ll risk falling when you\u2019re jumping back down. I\u2019m a big fan of jumping, but not repeated jumps in place.\u201d No matter whether you occasionally jump during a HIIT workout or always go jump-free, it\u2019s important to limit HIIT sessions to two or three times per week, with at least one rest day in between, as they are intense sessions. Also, remember that the older you are, the longer it takes your body to recover. But don\u2019t let that stop you from incorporating HIIT workouts into your weekly routine since they offer so many benefits, especially for older adults. \u201cThey really reduce the risk of diabetes as you age and combat cognitive decline,\u201d McCall said. \u201cThe biggest benefit we\u2019re seeing now with HIIT workouts is the brain.\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus\u00a0is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/hiit-workout-without-jumping-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_science_ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white", "text": "During the Cretaceous Period, a genus of sharks roamed the sea with rows of unusual teeth. Mostly large and rounded, these chompers were not meant to slice through their prey, but to grind and crush shelled creatures. However, since the sharks\u2019 presence in the fossil record has mostly consisted of isolated teeth, scientists have been left to speculate on what the rest of this ancient predator looked like since its\u00a0discovery in the 18th century. Now, remains uncovered from limestone quarries in northeastern Mexico are finally giving researchers a clearer idea of the shark\u2019s appearance, including one fossil that shows almost all skeletal elements and an outline of the specimen\u2019s soft-tissue body. The find also reveals where the genus, known as Ptychodus, sat on the shark evolutionary tree, and other previously unknown traits of this \u201clong-standing enigma,\u201d according to a study published in April in the journal\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. \u201cThe finding of the skeletal remains in Mexico not only allow us to unite these teeth that have been searching for a long time for a skeleton, but also allow us as scientists to revise our previous hypotheses regarding its biology and relationships and see what we got right and what we got wrong,\u201d said study coauthor\u00a0Dr. Eduardo Villalobos Segura, an assistant professor in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna, Austria, in an email. The discovery also provides insight into the evolutionary history of sharks found in our oceans today, experts say. Ancient relative of the great white shark Most species of Ptychodus lived between 100 and 80 million years ago during the\u00a0late Cretaceous period. The deposits in which the fossils were discovered \u2014 in Nuevo Le\u00f3n near the municipality of Vallecillo \u2014 date back to\u00a0approximately 93.9 to 91.85 million\u00a0years ago, Villalobos Segura said. Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage, they do not fossilize well, typically leaving archaeologists only teeth and few skeletal remains to find. But evidence suggests the\u00a0Nuevo Le\u00f3n fossils ended up in mostly stagnant conditions that would have allowed for an oxygen-deficient zone, resulting in the preservation of the soft skeletons, Villalobos Segura said. In the study, the researchers analyzed six fossils found at the site, including the complete specimen. Three other fossils were almost complete, and two were incomplete. With these remains, the study authors determined that Ptychodus belonged to the order of sharks known as Lamniformes, or mackerel sharks, the same group that the extinct\u00a0Otodus megalodon\u00a0and the modern great white shark belong to. Lamniformes also includes the modern species of megamouth, sand, goblin and basking sharks,\u00a0among others. \u201cPresent-day\u00a0sharks represent just a vanishingly minimal portion of the astonishing biodiversity that occurred throughout their entire evolutionary history (spanning almost 400 million years) \u2026 studying fossil\u00a0sharks is crucial to understand fully the evolutionary phenomena related to current groups,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Manuel Amadori, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna in Austria, in an email. The existence of mackerel sharks with crushing teeth was unknown until now, Amadori said. \u201cThere is still much more to discover, but we can say that we have taken another important step forward in understanding the complex evolutionary history of mackerel sharks,\u201d he added. The outline of the body, which revealed the shark\u2019s shape and fin location, also provides evidence that the prehistoric fish was not just a bottom-dweller as previously believed, but instead, a fast-swimming predator that might have hunted and eaten sea turtles and large ammonites instead of only eating mollusks found on the ocean floor, according to the study authors. Although the shark\u2019s exact diet is still unknown, the researchers suggest that this revised hypothesis about what it ate could be a hint at the cause of Ptychodus\u2019 extinction, since it puts the shark in competition with other Late Cretaceous marine predators with similar diets. \u201cWithout a complete specimen (hard evidence), what was known about Ptychodus beyond the teeth was largely scientific guesswork,\u201d said Michael Everhart, an adjunct curator of paleontology at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas, and an expert on\u00a0Late Cretaceous marine fossils, in an email. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThe new specimens answer questions that go back 180+ years to the 1830s when\u00a0Louis Agassiz\u00a0(an early renowned scientist and paleontologist)\u00a0first coined the name Ptychodus,\u201d which means rugous or\u00a0wrinkled tooth, Everhart added. Massive shell-crushing sharks The findings also suggested that the largest species of Ptychodus may have been slightly smaller than previously thought, reaching a maximum length of 9.7 meters (nearly 32 feet). Previous estimates of a species known as Ptychodus mortoni put it at 11.2 meters (nearly 37 feet), but the revised size is still larger than modern apex shark predators, the authors note in the study. Great whites today reach up to\u00a06 meters (20 feet)\u00a0in length. There are modern shell-crushing species, the largest being the Zebra shark, which reaches a maximum length of a little over 3.5 meters (12 feet) \u2014 not near as gigantic as Ptychodus. \u201cThe crushing teeth together with the gigantic size make Ptychodus a very unique shark,\u201d Amadori said. \u201c(In the fossil record) some teeth are massive, polygonal and almost flat, while others have strange, rounded protuberances or pointed cusps on the top surface. All these were joined together to form massive tooth plates, which this predator of the past could have used to crush almost anything it encountered.\u201d A new fossil revealing the complete side view of Ptychodus measured nearly 1.5 meters (about 5 feet) in length, suggesting it was from was of a much smaller shark. This could be due to the remains belonging to a younger shark, or because the Ptychodus genus included various species of different sizes, Villalobos Segura said. According to the nonprofit Mindat.org database, there are 22 species of Ptychodus currently known. Most species and individuals of Ptychodus were likely smaller than the largest Ptychodus mortoni specimen discovered, but there could also be the possibility of larger species yet to be found, Everhart said. Often, researchers can tell apart the different species of Ptychodus by varying features in the teeth, but the study authors were unable to identify which\u00a0species of Ptychodus\u00a0the six fossils studied belonged to due to the teeth being too worn down, Villalobos Segura said. The researchers said they hope future research reveals more about the ancient shark, including its diet and its role in past marine food chains and ecosystems. \u201c(The April study) is a comprehensive review of some remarkably complete fossils of the strange Cretaceous shark, Ptychodus,\u201d said Dr. Bretton Kent, an emeritus principal lecturer in the department of entomology at the University of Maryland, who has\u00a0studied and lectured\u00a0on the diversification of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). He was not involved in the study. \u201cOur present world can act like a set of blinders, limiting the scope of possible lifestyles we can envision for extinct animals. \u2026 Modern durophagous sharks (that consume hard-shelled organisms) are demersal, feeding on or near the bottom. And their bodies are frequently small and not particularly streamlined. So a gigantic, streamlined, high speed durophage that was much larger than a modern great white shark is quite remarkable,\u201d Kent added, in an email.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/science/ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

Experiencing gratitude is beneficial for physical health and emotional well-being, past research has shown. Now, a new study has found those who experience more gratitude also have a lower risk of dying. The report is the first to examine the effects of gratefulness on longevity, experts say. The researchers used data from the\u00a0Nurses\u2019 Health Study,\u00a0which included nearly 50,000 women between ages 69 and 96 who completed a six-item\u00a0gratitude questionnaire\u00a0in 2016. By asking participants to rank how strongly they agreed with statements such as \u201cI have so much in life to be thankful for\u201d and \u201cI am grateful to a wide variety of people,\u201d the research team was able to determine the percentage of women who had the highest and lowest feelings of gratitude. When the researchers reviewed the data three years later, they found the women who had the highest levels of gratitude experienced a 9% lower risk of death of any cause, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disease, according to the study published July 3 in the\u00a0journal JAMA Psychiatry. \u201cGratitude is powerful: powerful for happiness, powerful for addressing at least more minor depressive symptoms, powerful for improving health, powerful for protecting against premature death \u2014 and it is something that anyone can do,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Tyler VanderWeele, who is the John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. During the three years of follow-up in the study, there were 4,608 deaths among participants \u2014 2,153 of those were women who reported experiencing the lowest amount of gratitude, while 1,273 deaths were of women who were in the middle tier. There were 1,182 deaths among women who reported the highest amount of gratitude. The study also found those who reported feeling more gratitude were more likely to be slightly younger, have a partner, participate in social or religious groups, or have overall better health. \u201cI think things that are going well in life, whether that\u2019s one\u2019s health or one\u2019s social relationships, (it\u2019s) going to make one more grateful,\u201d said VanderWeele, who is also director of the\u00a0Human Flourishing Program, which aims to study and promote human well-being, and codirector of the\u00a0Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion\u00a0at Harvard. For the analysis of longevity, researchers controlled the data group by comparing similar women who only differed in their gratitude scores, VanderWeele said.\u00a0The researchers controlled for factors such as psychological well-being, health issues and other demographics including social and religious participation. \u201cIt\u2019s still quite meaningful \u2014 even after controlling for social connectedness and other aspects of psychological well-being and a host of baseline health characteristics and money and income and so on \u2014 you\u2019re still finding those who are grateful versus those who are not with about a 10% reduced mortality risk,\u201d VanderWeele said. \u201cThose other things are important, but it doesn\u2019t explain away the whole of the effect of gratitude.\u201d The authors noted in the study that the participants were mostly White, older women in the United States, and future studies with a more representative sample would be needed to find out more on the effects of gratitude and longevity for other demographics. How to practice gratitude \u201cIt\u2019s not completely surprising to me, just given what we know on the health benefits\u00a0of positive emotions\u00a0more generally, that a person\u2019s disposition for gratitude might actually even lengthen their life,\u201d said Dr. Philip Watkins, a professor of psychology at Eastern Washington University and author of the book \u201cGratitude and the Good Life: Toward a Psychology of Appreciation.\u201d Research has found that gratitude benefits individuals\u2019 happiness and flourishing, added Watkins, who was not involved with the new study. Having more gratitude has been linked to improving\u00a0physical health, such as strengthening the\u00a0immune system, lowering blood pressure and benefiting the\u00a0heart. Those who are more grateful also tend to get a better night\u2019s sleep and have\u00a0increased self-esteem\u00a0and lower anxiety, stress and\u00a0depression\u00a0levels. While the new study looked at people who are naturally more grateful, there are ways to practice having more gratitude on a day-to-day basis, said Dr. Emiliana\u00a0Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center \u2014 a research institute that studies the psychology, sociology, and\u00a0neuroscience of well-being\u00a0\u2014 at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for each individual to start from a place of their own comfort zone,\u201d said Simon-Thomas, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cIt is unfair to demand gratitude from anyone if they\u2019re feeling particularly impoverished. But it\u2019s not unfair to point out some of the simple and easy immediate factors that are actually a source of goodness. \u201cIt could be (as simple as) the feeling of warm sun through a window on your shoulder \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of really noticing that there are things around you even in moments that are difficult,\u201d she added. There are three strategies Simon-Thomas recommends for those looking to implement more feelings of gratitude. First, keep a gratitude journal where you can write a few things you are grateful for, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a washing machine in your home, or electric light, or the opportunity to go on a camping trip with friends \u2014 the list could go on.\u201d Another way to practice gratitude is by writing letters to others who have had a positive impact on your life; the sense of gratitude is even more pronounced when those letters are delivered to the other person, Simon-Thomas said. A third way to feel more gratitude is to be more specific when giving out thanks \u2014 when someone gets you a coffee to start your day, instead of just saying, \u201cThank you,\u201d try to extend it to something like, \u201cI really appreciate that you brought me a coffee today, I know you have a lot of other things to do \u2026 and I got a lot of stuff done, because you brought me back coffee,\u201d Simon-Thomas said. There\u2019s no clear consensus on how often one should practice gratitude, Simon-Thomas said. She recommends trying out different methods for what feels right to you. Practicing gratitude is not only key for health and well-being, but it is also important to try to be more grateful because it is a good virtue and can positively affect your relationships, too, Watkins said. Having more gratitude has also been linked to being more optimistic in general, and people who express higher levels of gratitude tend to look more for the good in life, Watkins added. \u201cResearch shows we have a lot more good stuff happen to us than bad stuff, but we very easily focus on the bad stuff,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons gratitude \u2026 and being a grateful person is so important is because they help us have a more balanced view of life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/gratitude-benefits-longer-life-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_07_11_health_cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness", "text": "About 40% of new cancer cases among adults ages 30 and older in the United States \u2014 and nearly half of deaths \u2014\u00a0could be attributed to preventable risk factors, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society. \u201cThese are things that people can practically change how they live every single day to reduce their risk of cancer,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Arif\u00a0Kamal, chief patient officer with the American Cancer Society. Smoking was the leading risk factor by far, the study found, contributing to nearly 1 in 5 cancer cases and nearly a third of cancer deaths. Other key risk factors included excess body weight, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, diet and infections such as HPV. Overall, researchers analyzed 18 modifiable risk factors across 30 types of cancer. In 2019, these lifestyle factors were linked to more than 700,000 new cancer cases and more than 262,000 deaths, the study found. Cancer grows because of DNA damage or because it has a fuel source, Kamal said. Other things \u2014 such as genetics or environmental factors \u2014 can also create these biological conditions, but modifiable risks explain a significantly larger share of cancer cases and deaths than any other known factors. Exposure to sunlight can damage DNA and lead to skin cancer, for example, while fat cells produce hormones that can feed certain cancers. \u201cWith cancer, it oftentimes feels like you have no control,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cPeople think about bad luck or bad genetics, but people need to feel a sense of control and agency.\u201d Certain cancers are more preventable than others, the new study suggests. But modifiable risk factors contributed to more than half of new cases for 19 of the 30 types of cancer evaluated. There were 10 types of cancer where modifiable risk factors could be attributed to at least 80% of new cases, including more than 90% of melanoma cases linked to ultraviolet radiation and nearly all cases of cervical cancer linked to HPV infection, which can be prevented with a vaccine. Lung cancer had the largest number of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors \u2014 more than 104,000 cases among men and 97,000 among women \u2014 and the vast majority were linked to smoking. After smoking, excess body weight was the second largest contributor to cancer cases, linked to about 5% of new cases in men and nearly 11% of cases in women. It was associated with more than\u00a0a third of deaths from cancer\u00a0of the endometrium, gallbladder, esophagus, liver and kidney, the new study found. Another recent study found that the risk for certain cancers was significantly reduced for people taking popular weight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy. \u201cObesity is emerging, in some ways, as just as potent of a risk for people as smoking is,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. He was not involved in the new study, but has prior experience working on cancer prevention initiatives. Intervening on a set of \u201ccore behavioral risk factors\u201d \u2014 quitting smoking, eating well and exercising, for example \u2014 can make a \u201cdramatic difference in the rates and outcomes of chronic diseases,\u201d Plescia said. And cancer is one of those chronic diseases, just like heart disease or diabetes. Policymakers and health officials should work to \u201ccreate environments where it\u2019s easier for people, where the healthy choice is the easy choice,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s particularly important for people who are living in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods, where it might not be safe to exercise or easy to get to a store with healthy food. As rates of early-onset cancer rise in the US, it\u2019s especially important to create healthy habits early, experts say. It\u2019s harder to quit smoking once you\u2019ve started or lose weight that you\u2019ve gained. But \u201cit\u2019s never too late to make these changes,\u201d Plescia said. \u201cTurning (health behaviors) around later in life can make a profound difference.\u201d And making lifestyle changes to minimize exposure to certain factors can reduce cancer risk relatively quickly, experts say. \u201cCancer is something your body fights every single day as your cells divide,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that you face every day, and that also means that the reduction of the risks can benefit you every day as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_tampons-lead-arsenic-plastics-wellness", "text": "The average menstruating person will spend about five years of their total reproductive lifespan using an estimated 11,000 tampons, sanitary pads, panty liners and other menstrual products, experts say. What if some of those menstrual aids contain heavy metals or potentially toxic chemicals linked to chronic diseases and reproductive and developmental problems? Past research has found tampons and other menstrual products may contain chemicals such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS; plasticizers, also known as phthalates; and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, emitted as gas or fragrances from many consumer products. All these chemical groups have been shown to disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine system, which regulates sexual development, metabolism, blood sugar, mood, sleep and more. Recently, a small pilot study found arsenic and lead in organic and nonorganic tampons \u2014 and while the levels were small, there is no safe level of exposure to lead, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, that study was unable to determine whether heavy metals might leach from tampons into the body, thus making any potential health impact unknown, said senior study author Kathrin Schilling, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. \u201cI do not want people to panic, but to be aware that heavy metals have been found in these menstrual products,\u201d Schilling said. \u201cObviously, the next step is to do research that would show if the metals leach from the tampon into the body.\u201d The study was also unable to determine whether any metal, even if released into the body, can be absorbed into the vaginal lining and subsequently into the bloodstream, said Amanda Hils, a spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration, which regulates tampons and other menstrual products as medical devices. \u201cWe plan to evaluate the study closely, and take any action warranted to safeguard the health of consumers who use these products,\u201d Hils said in an email. Vaginal tissue is more permeable than other parts of the body, so if studies were to find that heavy metals \u2014 or worrisome chemicals \u2014 do leach from menstrual products into the body, it could be a significant problem, said Anna Pollack, associate professor of global and community health at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. She was not involved in the pilot study. \u201cI am most concerned with menstrual products that are used inside the body,\u201d said Pollack, who coauthored a review of 10 years of studies on contaminants in tampons, sanitary pads, menstrual cups and other products. \u201cHowever, there is no reason for people to be afraid to use menstrual products at this time,\u201d she added. \u201cI would just be aware of the issue and monitor any research that develops.\u201d Heavy metals in tampons Schilling and her team tested 30 tampons from 14 brands purchased from major online retailers and stores in the United States, United Kingdom and Greece. The researchers conducted a blinded study, so they did not know the brands. The team ran tests for 16 heavy metals: arsenic, barium, calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, strontium, vanadium and zinc. \u201cWe found an average of 100 nanograms per gram of lead, and 2 nanograms per gram of arsenic in the tampons,\u201d Schilling said, \u201cbut there was no detectable level of chromium and no detectable level of mercury, which is very good.\u201d Organic tampons contained higher levels of arsenic, while nonorganic tampons had higher levels of lead, the study found. \u201cThe average lead concentration in\u00a0tampons\u00a0was about 10 times higher than the maximum levels currently allowed in drinking water,\u201d Schilling said, adding that arsenic levels were five times lower than current limits for drinking water. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that arsenic shouldn\u2019t be present in\u00a0tampons\u00a0at all, and we don\u2019t yet understand the effects of vaginal exposure since it hasn\u2019t been studied,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no safe level of lead exposure, and it has been shown to cause reproductive health issues in women.\u201d How did detectable levels of these heavy metals get into tampons in the first place? First, most tampons are made of cotton or a mixture of cotton and rayon, a semi-synthetic fiber made from\u00a0wood pulp. Arsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, while lead and other heavy metals are a natural part of Earth\u2019s crust \u2014 so plants can easily absorb metals as they develop. Additional chemicals found in menstrual products The soil and water of the United States and other parts of the world are also heavily contaminated with both metals and chemicals used to produce plastic products, experts say. Heavy metals can be byproducts of manufacturing plants, mining facilities and smelting processes, while PFAS and other chemicals enter the air, soil and groundwater from human waste, consumer products discarded in landfills and byproducts from fluorochemical manufacturing plants. Nearly half of the drinking water in the US is contaminated with some of the 12,000 types of PFAS, according to an August 2023 study by the US Geological Survey. Chemicals called phthalates have been discovered in sanitary pads, panty liners and tampons, according to Pollack\u2019s review. Phthalates are in consumer products such as shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys and have been linked to\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and undescended testes\u00a0in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and\u00a0testosterone levels\u00a0in adult males. Both phthalates and PFAS have also been linked to the rise in early menarche in teens and preteens. In 2022, advocacy groups Mamavation and Environmental Health News, in collaboration with the Institute for Green Science\u00a0at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, looked at levels of PFAS in menstrual products. The investigation found 48%\u00a0of sanitary pads, incontinence pads and tested panty liners contained PFAS, as did\u00a022%\u00a0of tampons and\u00a065%\u00a0of period underwear. Manufacturers use PFAS, often called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they\u00a0do not easily break down\u00a0in the environment, in\u00a0food packaging\u00a0to prevent grease and water from soaking through food wrappers and beverage cups. The chemicals are also used to make carpeting, clothing and furniture resistant to stains, water and grease damage. A February 2023 study found PFAS may alter hormonal and metabolic pathways needed for growth and development in young children, teens and young adults. PFAS chemicals have also been linked to an increased risk of adult kidney cancer and abnormally high cholesterol levels and decreased antibody response to vaccines in both adults and children. However, the mere presence of a chemical is not an indication of risk or adverse effect, according to the American Chemistry Council, an industry association. \u201cAs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0emphasizes, \u2018The measurement of an environmental chemical in a person\u2019s blood or urine is a measure of exposure; it does not by itself mean that the chemical causes disease or an adverse effect,\u2019\u201d a spokesperson for the council told CNN. How to protect yourself Tampon makers and the FDA recommend that tampons not be used at night or for longer than eight hours due to a greater risk of toxic shock syndrome, a deadly bacterial infection that can cause organ failure and death if not treated. That advice also applies to anyone concerned about heavy metals or chemicals in their menstrual products, said Nancy King Reame, professor emerita of health promotion and risk reduction at the School of Nursing at Columbia University Medical Center. \u201cBut because the vaginal microbiome, including menstrual fluid, is the least understood organ system in the body, real world advice on the use of period products based on these findings is premature to say the least,\u201d said Reame, who assisted on the tampon study. Other recommendations include washing your hands before and after inserting or removing a tampon to reduce bacterial spread, changing tampons every four to eight hours and using the lowest absorbency possible. \u201cIf you can wear one tampon up to eight hours without changing it, the absorbency may be too high,\u201d the FDA noted on its website. Signs of toxic shock, which include a sudden high fever, diarrhea, dizziness, vomiting or a rash that looks like a sunburn, need immediate medical attention. In addition, \u201cif you have discomfort, pain or other unexpected symptoms like unusual discharge when trying to insert or wear a tampon, or if you have an allergic reaction, stop using tampons and contact your provider,\u201d the FDA said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/tampons-lead-arsenic-plastics-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_988-suicide-lifeline-numbers", "text": "Two years after the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched, the service has answered over 10 million texts, calls and chats, according to new data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The lifeline, formerly a 10-digit number, transitioned to three digits in July 2022 as part of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s\u00a0strategy\u00a0to \u201caddress our national mental health crisis.\u201d Since 2022, the administration has invested over $1.5 billion in the effort, including expanding access to services for Spanish speakers, LGBTQI+ youth and young adults, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing, according to HHS. Those in crisis can reach the lifeline through a phone call, text, web chat and video chat. This year, text messages to 988 have increased 51% and calls 34% from the year before, a sign of the effects of expanded services, according to senior administration officials. Last year,\u00a0text messages through the lifeline increased 1,135%, chats answered increased 141% and calls answered increased 46%, a report from the department showed. The lifeline has made 110,000 contacts in Spanish and 475,000 with LGBTQI+ youth and young adults this year, the new report says. About 20,000 videophone contacts in American Sign Language were made, and 1.2 million calls were answered by the Veterans Crisis Line through 988\u2019s Press 1 option. \u201c988 is available to everyone,\u201d emphasized Andrea Palm, deputy secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cHaving someone on the other end of the line to listen and provide support makes a difference. It really does save lives, and that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d This year, HHS expects to roll out georouting technology to route 988 callers and texters based on their physical location versus their area code, the agency says. The move, which would follow an April\u00a0proposal\u00a0from the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to improve cell phone users\u2019 connectivity to local services and maintain additional privacy. The agency also pointed to the bolstering of a national backup system. Funneling federal funding to this system will help ensure that all contacts to 988 are able to be answered, regardless of a state\u2019s local capacity. A 911 for mental health crises In 2022, the year 988 debuted, suicide deaths reached a\u00a0record high\u00a0in the US, according to provisional\u00a0data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, the US surgeon general called for the implementation of a national prevention strategy in response to suicide rates that have been rising for decades. 988, like 911, is easy to remember. The switch to the three-digit lifeline saw an over\u00a045% increase\u00a0in overall contact volume in just the first month, according to HHS. \u201cTo remember 10 digits to call for help is not easy. That\u2019s why 911 is only three digits.\u201d said Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer at the National Alliance on Mental Illness or NAMI. \u201cTransitioning to a shorter number and a number that is focused on our wider array of mental health crises, not just suicide, opens up the door for people to reach out and be connected to the support they need.\u201d The hundreds of thousands of people who have contacted 988 in the past two years and the growth in its usage reflect the need for increased mental health services nationwide, she said. Behind the numbers Despite 988\u2019s growth, 3 in 4 Americans say they are not content with mental health treatment in this country, a July poll from the National Alliance on Mental Illness found. The NAMI/Ipsos poll also found that only 23% percent of Americans say they are familiar with 988. This is an increase from 17% in June 2023 but has not changed since October. \u201cWe need that number much higher,\u201d Wesolowski said. \u201cThis data speaks to the urgency of having awareness so people who need help can get connected to that help.\u201d However, the poll showed 72% of Americans said they are comfortable contacting the lifeline. Of those who had contacted 988 this year or whose loved one had done so, nearly 7 in 10 said they had received some or all of the help they needed. This sentiment is up 55% from June 2023, according to NAMI. HHS is prioritizing raising awareness about the lifeline and emphasizing that 988 is available not only for crises but for anytime someone needs to talk, according to senior administration officials. What happens when you contact 988 When someone calls 988, they first hear a greeting message. They are given the option to connect with specialized services and subsequently routed to a national network or local 988 Lifeline network crisis center. According to the\u00a0Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a trained crisis counselor answers the phone, listens to the caller, works to understand how the problem is affecting them, provides support and shares resources, if needed. Similarly, users can receive care through texting 988, an increasingly popular option. On a call with reporters Tuesday, Palm shared anecdotes from the progress the lifeline has made, emphasizing the real-life impact of the calls that make up this year\u2019s 988 data. \u201cA really important point are countless stories of real people whose lives have been changed forever,\u201d she said, sharing the story of Florida 988 counselor Kelly, who joined the service after losing her 18-year-old son to suicide. \u201cShe believes that if 988 had been in existence for her son, that it would have saved his life,\u201d Palm said. After the call The lifeline has reached millions in crisis since its debut, but what happens after they hang up the phone? Although the vast majority of calls do not escalate to emergency services being dispatched, users who need more help than can be provided over the phone or by chat may be contacted by local services, including mobile crisis and law enforcement teams. \u201cWe know [a police response] is not the best response for people in crisis,\u201d Wesolowski said, pointing to the need for mental health professionals to respond to cases of mental health crisis. According to senior administration officials, one of the goals of the lifeline is to divert from unnecessary police response and to ensure that users are safe while providing support based on individual needs, something that may require coordination between 988 and law enforcement. Next steps for 988 According to Palm, the administration still has more work to do to reach people who need help. \u201cNot everyone can access the support they need. And in other cases, stigma prevents them from reaching out at all,\u201d she said. Studies have shown that after speaking with a trained crisis counselor, most callers feel more hopeful and less depressed, suicidal and overwhelmed. Collaboration on the federal and state level for continued support of 988 is necessary for the success of the program to continue this impact, according to Palm and senior administration officials. \u201cIn the two years since we launched 988, it\u2019s become one of the most effective first line responses that we have to help individuals who feel alone and without options,\u201d she said. \u201cMake no mistake, 988 saves lives,\u201d Neera Tanden, White House domestic policy adviser, said on Tuesday\u2019s call. \u201cAs a country, we have a moral obligation to be there for each other, to reach out to offer help for just a listening ear.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/988-suicide-lifeline-numbers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_summer-covid-rise-wellness", "text": "Covid-19 levels have been rising in the United States again. Emergency department visits associated with Covid-19 have been trending up for weeks, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0The most recent data shows that during the week ending July 6 there was a 23.5% increase in emergency visits for Covid-19\u00a0compared with the previous week. The CDC also reports the viral activity level for Covid-19 in wastewater is high nationally as of July 6. I have seen these trends reflected in my own social group. Two friends have gotten Covid-19 this month while traveling. And we\u2019ve seen more coronavirus infections being reported in public figures, with second gentleman\u00a0Doug Emhoff recently testing positive and major sporting events such as the\u00a0Tour de France\u00a0affected with riders being diagnosed. It\u2019s time to reset our understanding about Covid-19\u2019s summer spread. Why is this summer wave happening, and do I really have to worry about infection again? What should people do to reduce their chance of infection while living their normal life? What if I\u2019m traveling? Should I get the vaccine now versus waiting for an updated one? Do tests still work? And what should I do if I get Covid-19 \u2014 do I still have to sequester myself and stay away from family? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0How much should people worry about Covid-19 infection now that there is a resurgence of cases? Dr. Leana Wen:\u00a0Based on CDC numbers, it does appear that we are in the midst of a\u00a0summer wave\u00a0of Covid-19 infections. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Ever since the start of the pandemic, we have seen multiple waves of infections every year, including one that peaks in the summer. This could be due to increased travel as well as more people gathering indoors due to hot weather. Whether people should worry about Covid-19 infection depends on their specific medical circumstances. People who should be especially concerned are those who are older or\u00a0immunocompromised or those with multiple underlying heart, lung, kidney and other medical conditions. They should be sure they are up-to-date with vaccines, have a plan for\u00a0accessing\u00a0antiviral\u00a0treatment\u00a0and consider additional precautions such as masking in crowded indoor spaces and trying to gather outdoors instead of indoors. CNN:\u00a0What should people do to reduce their chance of infection while living their normal life around town?\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0Many people have returned to their full pre-pandemic lives and are thinking of Covid-19 the way they consider other respiratory viruses:\u00a0They don\u2019t want to get these viruses, but they also don\u2019t want to stop socializing and going to restaurants, the theater and religious services. I think the risk calculation will depend on the individual and their personal medical circumstances. One thing to consider is to reduce your chance of infection prior to visiting an especially vulnerable family or friend. For the week or so before that visit, you could avoid indoor gatherings and mask while on public transit and in other crowded spaces. Taking a rapid test just before the visit can also reduce your risk of infecting that vulnerable person. CNN: Speaking of tests, are home tests still a good way to diagnose Covid-19 if someone develops symptoms? Wen:\u00a0Rapid antigen home tests are not as accurate as laboratory PCR testing, but they are a convenient way to screen for Covid-19. People who have symptoms and could be eligible for antiviral treatment should take the rapid test. If it\u2019s initially negative, take it again the next day to be sure. Remember that this test only looks for the coronavirus. You could have\u00a0one of\u00a0a whole host of other viruses that cause respiratory symptoms. If you have symptoms, you should stay away from vulnerable people, even if you test negative for Covid-19. CNN: Do you have any recommendations for reducing risk while traveling? Wen:\u00a0While in crowded spaces that aren\u2019t well-ventilated, consider wearing an N95 or equivalent mask. For instance, mask while boarding the plane and on standing-room-only trains. Also, try to dine outdoors rather than indoors when possible. Bring rapid tests with you. And always have a plan for what happens if you get Covid-19. How will you access antiviral treatments if you are eligible for them? Where will you stay? Travel insurance is something I highly recommend; it can help with medical care and with allaying costs if plans must change. CNN: A lot of people are eager to get another Covid-19 vaccine to best protect them during the summer wave. But there is a\u00a0new vaccine coming out in the fall. Who should get the vaccine now, and who can wait to get the new one? Wen:\u00a0There is a new formulation of the Covid-19 vaccine coming out soon. It should be available in September and could be available as early as August. The\u00a0CDC has recommended\u00a0that everyone 6 months and older receive this vaccine when it\u2019s out. Since we are so close to the release of the new vaccine, I think it\u2019s reasonable to wait for the new formulation. This one should more closely target the variants currently circulating and, ideally, be a better match for the strains expected to be dominant in the fall and winter. People should keep in mind that the primary purpose of the vaccine is to reduce the chance of severe illness \u2014 of needing hospitalization and of dying. The vaccine is not as effective at reducing infection. It does have some effectiveness at reducing the infection rate, but that effectiveness wanes quickly. People who need additional protection against infection \u2014 which always carries the risk of severe illness as well as of long Covid \u2014 should take additional precautions as we discussed. CNN: Finally, at this point, what should I do if I get Covid-19 \u2014 do I still have to isolate and stay away from family? Wen:\u00a0Several months ago, the\u00a0CDC dropped\u00a0its five-day isolation requirement. Now, the recommendation is that people diagnosed with Covid-19 stay home until they are fever-free for at least 24 hours and their symptoms are improving. For the next five days, they should still try to take additional precautions such as masking and limiting close contact with others. The way I interpret this is that it depends on the medical situation of other members of your family. If others are generally healthy and not taking additional precautions to reduce their risk of Covid-19, I think you could follow the advice from the CDC as above. However, in my view, if you live at home with someone who is extremely vulnerable \u2014 for instance, an older parent who has had a kidney transplant \u2014 you should really avoid that person until you test negative for Covid-19. That means not dining indoors with them and not sharing common spaces during that period. The bottom line is that while many people can go about living their lives during this summer wave, people who are vulnerable to severe illness still should take additional precautions. Those around them should also take precautions to help protect those at highest risk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/summer-covid-rise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli", "text": "Children in Ivory Coast received the first doses of a new, relatively cheap malaria vaccine on Monday, a step that has been hailed as a major milestone in the battle against one of the world\u2019s most deadly diseases. The R21 vaccine, developed by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India (SII), has been sent to several African countries and will also be administered in South Sudan Tuesday, the University of Oxford said in a statement sent to CNN. The vaccine costs less than $4 a dose, making it \u201crealistic to roll out in many tens of millions of doses from now on,\u201d and it has high efficacy levels of around 75%-80% in young children, Professor Adrian Hill, director\u00a0of the\u00a0Jenner Institute\u00a0at\u00a0Oxford University, who led the development of the vaccine, said in an interview with BBC Radio on Monday. Up to 500,000 child deaths could be saved every year with the widespread implementation of R21, alongside its counterpart RTS,S vaccine, according to modeling by the World Health Organization (WHO). Spread by some types of mosquitoes, malaria is preventable and curable but still killed around 608,000 people around the world in 2022, according to WHO. About 95% of those deaths occurred in Africa, where children under the age of 5 account for around 80% of all malaria deaths across the continent. The SIII has already manufactured more than 25 million doses and has committed to producing up to 100 million doses a year, a scale that allows the vaccine to remain affordable, according to the statement from the University of Oxford. There are enough doses that 250,000 children under the age of 2 will initially be vaccinated in Ivory Coast, while Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic have all authorized the vaccine, too, the university said.   R21 will be used alongside the RTS,S vaccine, which has already been delivered to more than 2 million children over a four-year pilot program in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, where it reduced all-cause mortality by 13%, according to UNICEF. Both these vaccines have been approved by the WHO and are expected to have a hugely positive impact on public health, alongside other prevention strategies like mosquito nets. Hill added that there is still \u201ca lot of work for people in-country to get set up, particularly when you\u2019re aiming to distribute millions of doses from this year.\u201d \u201cThis is a three-dose vaccine, typically (given at) five, six, seven months of age and then a booster a year later. That\u2019s not a time point that other vaccines are usually given at, so there\u2019s training required in these largely relatively low income countries.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_health_summer-food-safety-wellness", "text": "This Independence Day holiday takes place as\u00a0record-breaking heat waves\u00a0have spread across many parts of the US and the world, and the temperatures could be deadly. There\u2019s potential for record-breaking heat and extreme heat risk for portions of the South and Southwest. California is likely to be especially hard hit, with highs passing 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) in many areas. At the same time, the avian influenza outbreak has spread to cows, raising questions about whether certain foods like milk, eggs and hamburgers remain safe. As I drank lots of water and perspired through high temperatures and humidity at an outdoor concert this week, I thought about safely celebrating the Fourth of July holiday. What about all the grilled meat, burgers and potato salad sitting outside in the heat?\u00a0How can we stay cool while attending picnics and barbecues during this holiday weekend? Are there additional food safety precautions we should take, given the predicted high temperatures? And are there other health factors to consider this holiday, such as keeping cool and well-hydrated? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: Can you remind us why food safety is important? Dr. Leana Wen: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are around 9 million episodes of foodborne illness annually. These illnesses primarily occur when people ingest food or drink that has been contaminated with bacteria, viruses or parasites. Most episodes are mild, though even mild illnesses are unpleasant\u2014they are generally characterized by nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Some people can become very sick and require hospitalization, and unfortunately, some can die. Those at highest risk for severe illness include older individuals, children under 5, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems. CNN: What food precautions should people take for barbecues and other outdoor gatherings? Wen: Undercooked meat contains a lot of infectious organisms. The best way to make sure meat is cooked thoroughly is to use an internal thermometer. I recommend this US government food safety website to check the internal temperature that different types of meat should be cooked to. For instance, chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit, and ground beef should be cooked to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the meat is cooked, keep it at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or above until serving to prevent germs from developing. Prior to cooking, refrigerate raw meat rather than keeping it at room temperature. It should be removed just before being placed on a barbeque. CNN: Given how hot the weather might be this week, are there other specific factors to consider? Wen: Yes. Under normal weather circumstances, the advice from the US Department of Agriculture is that perishable food can be unrefrigerated for up to two hours. However, if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, that\u2019s reduced to one hour. That applies to cooked meat like hamburgers as well as perishable salads like potato salad and cole slaw. In hot weather, these items should be eaten right away; if not, they should be refrigerated within an hour. CNN: What about people who are having barbecues at parks or other places without refrigerators? Wen: They should have a well-insulated cooler with lots of ice. Raw, uncooked meat should be kept at 40-degrees Fahrenheit or lower until it is ready to go on the grill. I also recommend keeping uncooked meat in tightly sealed bags so that it does not contaminate other items that are served raw, like veggies and fruit. Another precaution for barbeques is to keep an eye on what utensils and plates you use for raw meat versus other food. Label the utensils, plates and containers that come into contact with raw meat. Keep them separate from plates that contain salad items, fruit, chips, buns and other items. CNN: And make sure to wash your hands after touching raw meat? Wen: Yes, absolutely. You don\u2019t want to go right from handling raw hamburger meat to making a salad. Make sure to wash your hands well with soap and water each time after handling raw meat. CNN: Let\u2019s talk about bird flu for a moment. Has the avian flu outbreak affected how we should think about eating products like hamburgers and chicken wings? Is it still safe to eat eggs and drink milk? Wen: According to federal health officials, it is safe to continue eating these products as long as meat and eggs are cooked to the recommended temperatures. It is also safe to keep drinking milk, though it\u2019s crucial to emphasize that the milk needs to be pasteurized. Raw milk is not safe to drink. Not only can raw milk harbor bacteria, but it is also possible that raw milk can transmit the bird flu. It wasn\u2019t advisable for people to drink raw milk or consume products made from raw milk prior to the bird flu outbreak, and it certainly is not advisable now. CNN: We\u2019ve talked a lot about food safety. What are other health issues to consider this Fourth of July? Wen: If you will be in hot weather, be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Watch out for those who are most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, specifically children, older adults and people with chronic medical conditions. Watch out for your pets as well. They can get overheated, too. Never leave pets or children unattended and in a car by themselves; the inside of the car overheats rapidly and these high temperatures can be fatal. Everyone should try to stay in the shade when possible. Keep well-hydrated. Water is the best form of hydration, and be aware that excessive caffeine and alcohol can be dangerous during heat waves. Wear clothing that protects you from the sun, and make sure to apply and re-apply sunscreen often.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/health/summer-food-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

Women have trouble prioritizing their own health, the survey found, with over 60% of women responding that it was hard to make their own health a priority. The numbers are particularly striking among younger women;\u00a074% of women in Generation Z and 70% of millennials said it was hard to prioritize their health, compared with 52% of baby boomers and 39% of the Silent Generation.

Dr. Leana Wen: I was disheartened, though not surprised, to see that it was so common for women, especially young women, to forgo health screenings. According to the results, most women in the survey mentioned factors such as caring for other family members first, struggling with work and other pressing matters. This is consistent with my experience as a clinician and\u00a0a\u00a0public health official. Unfortunately, too many women focus on their health only after they have been diagnosed with a chronic illness. Our society places too little emphasis on prevention, and there are many barriers in the way of people obtaining preventive care. CNN: Why are regular health screenings so important for women, including young women? Wen:\u00a0This study focused on health screenings for cancer, so let\u2019s start there.\u00a0One in five\u00a0women\u00a0around the world\u00a0will develop cancer over our lifetimes. Early treatment is key to improving survival rates, and that hinges on early diagnosis. This is why screenings are so important. Cancer screenings are conducted before people develop symptoms. There is a disturbing global trend of a\u00a0rise in early-onset cancers,\u00a0which is defined as cancer cases diagnosed in people younger than 50. Between 1990 and 2019, early-onset cancers increased by\u00a079%. In the US, while people older than 50 have experienced a drop in overall cancer rates between 1995 and 2020, the cancer incidence\u00a0has increased in people younger than 50. All of this\u00a0makes the survey results of young women neglecting their health screenings even more distressing. According to the survey, 41% of US women delayed or skipped screenings for breast cancer, 35% for cervical cancer and 33% for colorectal cancers. CNN: What cancer screenings are recommended for younger women? Wen:\u00a0Here are the recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force. For\u00a0breast cancer, the USPSTF recommends that women get screened every other year, starting from age 40 and continuing through age 74. This is a recent change. Previously, the recommendation was to start between age 40 to 50. For\u00a0cervical cancer, the task force recommends that women who are ages 21 to 29 get screened every three years with a Pap test that looks at cervical cells. For women ages 30 to 65, the recommendation is to get screened every three years with the Pap test, or every five years with either testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (a virus that could cause cervical cancer) or the virus testing combined with the Pap test. For\u00a0colon cancer, the USPSTF recommends that both women and men begin screenings at age 45. This also represents a change in response to the rise in colon cancer among younger individuals; until a few years ago, the recommendation was for colon cancer screenings to start at age 50. All the above recommendations apply to women at average risk of developing these cancers. Individuals at higher risk by virtue of family history, personal cancer history or other risk factors should speak with their physicians about whether they should start screening at earlier ages and more frequently. They may also need additional testing; for instance, women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer may be recommended for an MRI in addition to a mammogram and may be referred to genetic testing. CNN: What else should women know about regular screenings? Wen: Ideally, every woman has a primary care provider whom they visit every year. These appointments should keep track of what screenings have been done and when to do the next set of screenings. First, women should know whether they have personal medical circumstances that put them at higher risk compared with other people. Everyone should try to find out their family history of common ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Bring up lifestyle factors that may influence risk factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and physical activity. Second, discuss screening tests. What\u2019s recommended now and why? We\u2019ve spoken today mainly about cancer screening, but there are screenings for other chronic diseases that should be done. For instance, you should be getting your blood pressure checked at annual visits to screen for hypertension. The USPSTF also recommends screening for\u00a0diabetes\u00a0in adults ages 35 to 70 who have a body mass index that places them in the category of overweight or obesity and for\u00a0high cholesterol\u00a0in women ages 45 and older who are at increased risk of heart disease. Third, women should discuss issues regarding their reproductive health. If they want to become pregnant, they should optimize their health in preparation for pregnancy. If they do not, they should discuss contraceptive options. We have not yet discussed screening for\u00a0sexually transmitted infections, but this is also a part of routine health screening that should be discussed at the annual checkup. Last but certainly not least, it\u2019s important to discuss mental health issues. Mental health is a crucial determinant of overall health. Women should be sure to discuss concerns such as\u00a0depression,\u00a0anxiety\u00a0and\u00a0stress\u00a0with their providers. Many treatment options exist \u2014 no one should have to suffer in silence. CNN: How can women keep track of their screenings and what they need coming up? The problem is that many women do not have a regular provider. They may also neglect to see that person due to the issues highlighted in the survey \u2014 maybe these women are busy with other life circumstances and then only see a provider once something is wrong. The other issue highlighted in the survey is that providers may not be bringing up the screenings. Women are more likely to be screened if they and their provider have a discussion about the importance of screenings, the poll says. Yet these conversations are sometimes not happening for a variety of reasons. We need to have a better health care system that ensures access and continuity of care for all people, and clinicians must have adequate time to address crucial issues like prevention during the annual visit. In the meantime, I recommend that women keep track of what screenings they have received and have an idea of when the next one is due. Bring that list with you when you are going for your annual checkup and ask your doctor if you are up to date.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/women-cancer-colon-breast-screening-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_immunization-rates-report", "text": "Although the Covid-19 pandemic saw\u00a0unprecedented\u00a0speed in the development and distribution of coronavirus vaccines, experts say it was also marked by a significant and concerning drop in the rate of routine vaccinations. New data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund shows the world has yet to recover. The pandemic signified a \u201chistoric backslide,\u201d according to Dr. Katherine O\u2019Brien, director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biological at WHO. Now, she says, the race is on to reach children who missed shots during the pandemic and to restore and strengthen immunization services beyond pre-pandemic levels. WHO and UNICEF\u2019s 2023 immunization coverage report, released Sunday, is the world\u2019s largest dataset on immunization trends for vaccinations against 14 diseases. It analyzed estimates from 185 countries and used a third dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine \u2014 which is recommended for 1-year-olds \u2014 as the global marker for immunization coverage. The data revealed that\u00a0previous progress\u00a0in reaching pre-pandemic immunization levels has stalled. Worldwide DTP3 coverage was 84% in 2023, the same as in 2022 but below 86% recorded in 2019. The report\u2019s authors say this is a derailment on the trajectory toward the Immunization Agenda 2030\u00a0goal\u00a0of 90% coverage for essential childhood and adolescent vaccines. This stagnation reflects ongoing challenges with disruptions in health-care services, logistical challenges, vaccine hesitancy and inequities in access to services, the organizations said in a news release. The new report also showed that the number of children who had not received a single dose of DTP3 increased by 600,000 from 2022 to 2023, leaving 2.7 million more children un- and under-immunized than before the pandemic. \u201cToday\u2019s release highlights that we are off track and need to accelerate efforts to meet this challenge,\u201d said Dr. Ephrem T. Lemango, associate director for health and global chief of immunization at UNICEF. Bright spots around the globe Amid the overall challenge, however, \u201cthere are places where there are positive signs,\u201d Lemango told CNN. The data showed that the African region made the most progress last year in overall coverage, and countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria made notable strides in recovering post-pandemic, according to O\u2019Brien and Lemango. \u201cLow-income countries \u2026 where the health systems were hit the hardest by the pandemic \u2026 are starting to see some improvement compared with 2022,\u201d O\u2019Brien said at a news briefing. In Africa, vaccine coverage in the first year of life increased despite a rising number of births, which required more vaccinations to maintain the same coverage level, according to O\u2019Brien. The 2023 report also found HPV vaccine coverage in girls increased 7%, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Studies\u00a0have shown that the vaccine can reduce cervical cancer rates in women by 87%. However, current coverage remains well below the 90% target to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, reaching only 56% of adolescent girls in high-income countries and 23% in low- and middle-income countries, according to the news release. All eyes on measles WHO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that global immunization efforts have saved 154 million lives \u2014 6 lives every minute \u2014 over the past 50 years. About 60% of that can be attributed to the measles vaccine, the organization says, projecting it to be the \u201ctop contributor to preventing deaths in the future.\u201d But the 2023 data revealed that measles coverage in countries with large or disruptive outbreaks after the pandemic is too low to control further outbreaks. Nearly 35 million children were left with no or only partial protection, a decline the report called \u201cconcerning,\u201d even for countries that have not had outbreaks in the past five years. Low vaccination coverage was a major factor in outbreaks in 103 countries \u2013 accounting for roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s infant population \u2013 in the past five years, said the report. Cases of the highly contagious virus have also reemerged in the United States. In 2023, the 92% of US children that have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2 fell below the federal target of 95%, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that year. \u201cMeasles outbreaks continue to rise as measles vaccination coverage stalls,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cThe world saw over 300,000 confirmed measles cases in 2023, which is an almost threefold increase compared to what we had in 2022.\u201d According to the organizations, there is hope that the introduction of new and underutilized vaccines, through partnerships such as\u00a0Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will expand protection against infectious diseases like measles. \u201cThis progress is crucial in reducing the burden of diseases that have long plagued communities,\u201d Lemango added. Immunizations in conflict zones Over half of unvaccinated children in 2023 lived in countries experiencing fragility, conflict and vulnerability, the data shows, even though these places account for only 28% of new births worldwide. Many of these countries have had \u201cworrying declines in performance since 2019,\u201d the report says. Of children who did not receive any vaccines in 2023, 59% were in only 10 countries. Places such as Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan are new to this list, the report says. \u201cThe protection of children in any conflict setting is of critical importance,\u201d WHO\u2019s O\u2019Brien said. \u201c[Conflict] creates an environment where infectious diseases have a big risk of causing large and impactful outbreaks.\u201d Some countries that experienced conflict, such as Ukraine, had initial dips in immunization coverage but did not see an overall drop in vaccinations. But in other areas, such as Sudan and parts of the Middle East, that wasn\u2019t the case. There was a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in vaccine coverage in Gaza in 2023, one not seen to the same extent in Israel, according to O\u2019Brien. Data in the report from Gaza was submitted for only January through September, and it \u201cdoesn\u2019t cover what is happening in 2024,\u201d Lemango noted. Analyzing immunization coverage in other areas of conflict is \u201ca mixed picture,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019ll give the example, however, of Ukraine, which has had an improvement in coverage. Not all conflict areas result in a reduction in coverage,\u201d she said, referencing resilient programs, the nature of conflict and the safety of health workers. According to Lemango, there is a \u201cclear pattern\u201d in Ukraine where service availability typically decreases at the beginning of a conflict and resumes once assistance and resources flow in. The issue, he said, is how to maintain this improved state. Global reach of local vaccines Vaccine coverage in the United States ranges between 95% and 98%, an indication of good availability of health services, according to Lemango. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Americans are entirely protected. \u201cUntil everyone or every country has the ability and the reach for every child to be vaccinated, the vulnerability to have outbreaks, epidemics and potentially pandemics is always imminent,\u201d he said. In April 2023, WHO and UNICEF partnered with organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to launch The Big Catch Up initiative in response to declining levels of vaccine coverage after the pandemic. The effort aims to boost childhood immunizations and fill gaps between pre- and post-pandemic work, according to the partnership. Achieving these goals and aiming for those outlined in Immunization Agenda 2030 will require collaboration and investment in innovation, according to the IA2030 Partnership Council. \u201cThe future is likely to be a future where we\u2019ll have many vaccines that are able to prevent preventable diseases,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cImmunization stands as one of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/immunization-rates-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_colorado-bird-flu-humans-confirmed", "text": "Five cases of bird flu have been identified among workers culling poultry at a farm in northeast Colorado, the state department of health said on Sunday. The commercial egg operation was impacted by H5N1 outbreaks that have also affected wild birds and dairy cows in several states. Three of the five human cases were announced Friday, and all of those have now been confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A fourth case was also confirmed, and a fifth is presumed positive based on state testing. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in a statement on Sunday that no additional test results are pending. The workers are believed to have caught the virus through direct work with infected birds. They had mild symptoms including conjunctivitis or pink eye and respiratory problems, but none of them were hospitalized, the state said Sunday. The investigation into the cases is ongoing with support of a team sent by CDC at the state\u2019s request. The CDC said Friday its risk assessment for the general public remains low. \u201cThere are no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity otherwise in Colorado or in other states affected by H5 bird flu outbreaks in cows and poultry,\u201d it said. Four people in the US had previously tested positive for bird flu in connection with the ongoing outbreak: one in Colorado, one in Texas and two in Michigan. All were workers at dairy operations. Colorado\u2019s agriculture industry has been hit hard by bird flu, with Gov. Jared Polis\u00a0declaring\u00a0a disaster emergency July 5 to ensure that the state can offer support and resources for farms in Weld County. Poultry products are still safe to eat if they have been properly handled and cooked, the Colorado health department said. The CDC advises that everyone avoid close or long exposure to sick or dead animals, animal poop or bedding. Experts also recommend against consuming unpasteurized or raw milk due to the potential for contamination. Another state finds bird flu in cattle Until the Colorado cases were announced, recent human H5N1 cases in the US had been linked to dairy cattle. On Friday, the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced that a dairy cattle herd in the state had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, raising the number of states that reported impacted herds to 13. The positive sample was collected in April, the state said, and the herd has fully recovered. It\u2019s not clear why it took the so long for the state or federal government to report the results. Since the first cattle infections were reported in late March, 157 herds have tested positive for H5N1 across 13 states.\u00a0Four states have had more than 20 herds impacted \u2014\u00a0Texas, Colorado, Michigan and Idaho\u00a0\u2014 according to the US Department of Agriculture.

{"id": "2024_07_09_health_heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death", "text": "Lisa Pisano, the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney, died Sunday,\u00a0according to\u00a0NYU Langone Health, where she had the surgery. Pisano\u00a0received the transplant on April 12, but the organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed May 29. Her case was the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the animal\u2019s thymus gland. Pisano\u00a0was brave and altruistic, Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute,\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday. She had said\u00a0during a news conference after the procedure that even if the organ transplant didn\u2019t work for her, it might for the next person. \u201cAt least somebody is going to benefit from it,\u201d she said. Montgomery said Tuesday that \u201cLisa\u2019s contributions to medicine, surgery, and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. \u2026 Lisa helped bring us closer to realizing a future where someone does not have to die for another person to live.\u201d Every eight minutes, another person is added to the transplant waiting list, and 17 people from this list die each day waiting for an organ, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Xenotransplantation, which involves using organs from other species, is a potential solution to the shortage of available donor organs, experts say. Doctors in the US perform xenotransplants in rare cases, with permission from the US Food and Drug Administration. For Pisano, the permission came through the agency\u2019s expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policy, which allows terminally ill patients who have no other treatment options to access experimental medical products. Due to Pisano\u2019s heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, she couldn\u2019t have a standard transplant, NYU Langone said in a news release. Before the xenotransplant, Pisano\u00a0said,\u00a0she had \u201ctried everything else\u201d and, with the surgery, was hoping to spend time with her grandkids and play with them. The pig kidney she received was genetically altered to evade human antibodies, which typically detect and attack foreign organs. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed beneath the pig kidney\u2019s cover to further help Pisano\u2019s body accept the organ. However, the kidney was removed in May after it was determined that it was \u201cno longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen,\u201d Montgomery said at the time. Pisano\u2019s \u201cbravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs,\u201d he said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cHer legacy as a pioneer will live on and she will forever be remembered for her courage and good nature.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_health_sleep-eating-disorder-wellness", "text": "Jill was in middle school when she began eating in her sleep. Despite carrying the food back to her bed to devour night after night, she didn\u2019t have a clue about what she had done until the next morning. \u201cI would wake up with these containers or wrappers from an entire box of crackers or cookies on my bed or by the side of my bed,\u201d said Jill, now 62, who lives an hour away from Minneapolis. Due to stigma and misunderstanding about sleep eating, CNN\u00a0agreed not to use her last name. \u201cA lot of people think this condition is, \u2018Oh, you get up and you have a snack and then you go back to bed.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not what this is. This is a whole other animal,\u201d Jill said of her unconscious nocturnal behaviors. \u201cI don\u2019t just get up once and take a bite of this or that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can eat a whole package of cookies, then get up again and have four bowls of cereal, then get up again and have an entire box of graham crackers. And it is always junky junk food, never, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have an apple.\u2019\u201d Over time, nights of poor nutrition and dysfunctional sleep can take a toll, Jill said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how sick you feel,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten up countless times during the night, so you\u2019re not rested, and you\u2019ve consumed enormous amounts of garbage food. Then you wake up and boom, you have to function the rest of the day. And that\u2019s what I did for years and years and years.\u201d Jill is living with sleep-related eating disorder, also known as sleep eating \u2014 an arousal condition in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Sleep eating is a parasomnia, an abnormal or unusual behavior during sleep, similar to sleepwalking, sleep talking, sleep terrors, and sleep sex, or sexsomnia. \u201cOf all the parasomnias, sleep-related eating disorder has the worst impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThese people have disinhibited eating almost every night. They gain weight. They feel miserable in the morning. It affects their whole life and is just horrendous,\u201d said Schenck, who specializes in treating parasomnias. While it may seem as if people are acting out their dreams, parasomnias most often occur during the slowest, deepest stage of sleep called delta sleep, he said. \u201cSomething triggers an alarm in the central nervous system, and your body is activated while your cognition is deeply asleep,\u201d he said. No control or restraint In the mixed state of sleep and wakefulness that is sleep eating, the ancient brain takes over, searching out foods that might satisfy the body\u2019s need for gratification. Ultraprocessed foods such as candy, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, chips and crackers are preferred choices during sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any control, you don\u2019t have any restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can consume foods they\u2019re allergic to and then have an allergic reaction. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. \u201cAnd because they choose foods like peanut butter, chocolate, leftover banana cream pie or pasta \u2014 fattening, overly processed comfort foods \u2014 they can develop or aggravate their diabetes or hypertension.\u201d Of all the parasomnias, sleep eating is the most challenging to treat, with a success rate of only two-thirds, Schenck said. In comparison, treatment success is more than 75% for patients with sexsomnia, sleepwalking or night terrors. \u201cYou can have someone who\u2019s been a sleepwalker for many years, but once they start eating during the night, before long, eating becomes the only sleepwalking behavior,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s something irresistible about consuming food during the night and sleepwalking \u2014 who wants to rearrange the furniture or just wander around the house when you can go eat?\u201d \u2018The doctors didn\u2019t understand it\u2019 Married in her early 20s, Jill continued to eat in bed at night alongside her new husband. Thankfully, she said, he was a heavy sleeper. \u201cHe would wake up in the morning to a bed full of crumbs and wrappers and say, \u2018What is wrong with you?\u2019 He thought I was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand. And I didn\u2019t understand because I wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose.\u201d Jill\u2019s health suffered. Not only did she gain weight from all the extra calories, but the quality of her diet dropped dramatically. \u201cI\u2019m a healthy eater, but I often felt so sick throughout the day, the last thing I wanted was food, even healthy food,\u201d Jill said. \u201cWho would when you ate the equivalent of six Thanksgiving dinners back-to-back every night?\u201d Embarrassed by her behavior, Jill kept her sleep habits to herself for decades. It wasn\u2019t until her son developed a disorder called idiopathic hypersomnolence, in which he would sleep for 18 or more hours at a time, that she began asking doctors about her own condition. Unfortunately, she said, broaching the topic didn\u2019t go well. \u201cMany doctors I spoke to had no idea what was wrong with me, or they just didn\u2019t get it. One doctor said, \u2018Well, maybe have a piece of bread before you go to bed.\u2019 Oh, right, that\u2019s sure to solve it,\u201d Jill said disdainfully. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this disorder or aren\u2019t living with it, you\u2019re not going to have a full understanding, but I really thought that doctors would know more,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the problem was then I felt alone, believing something was wrong with me \u2014 because the doctors didn\u2019t understand it, it must be my fault.\u201d Causes of sleep eating After years of disappointing doctor visits, Jill discovered Schenck\u2019s treatment center in Minneapolis. For the first time, she underwent a lab sleep study, which showed that she had restless legs syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes unpleasant sensations in the legs along with an irresistible urge to move them.\u00a0The sensations often begin in the evenings and can last throughout the night. \u201cIt\u2019s now become restless body syndrome,\u201d Jill said. \u201cIt\u2019s a twitching, almost like a bug is crawling inside that travels through my whole body.\u201d To ease the constant twitching during the evenings before sleep, Jill may walk around the house, flailing her arms and legs in a desperate bid to stop the sensation. \u201cYou just become so miserable, so uncomfortable, that you\u2019re swinging your body parts, kind of trying to tire them out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some nights that the twitching is just, oh, I can\u2019t even tell you, I\u2019m in tears it\u2019s so bad.\u201d Restless legs syndrome is one of four potential causes of sleep eating, Schenck said. \u201cYou can develop sleep eating from sleepwalking, from sleep apnea, from certain insomnia medications, or like Jill, from restless legs syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those can be the ultimate causes of sleep-related eating disorder, and that\u2019s why in medicine, we call that a final common pathway disorder. All roads lead to Rome basically.\u201d Jill, however, was sleep eating long before restless legs syndrome became a key complaint. Research has shown sleep eating may occur first, Schenck said. \u201cWe studied a group of sleep-related eating patients in the lab, and they had periodic limb movements along with the sleep eating,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, lo and behold, five or 10 years later they developed classic restless legs syndrome. So sleep-related eating can be the first indicator of future restless legs syndrome.\u201d Other risk factors for sleep eating include a family history of eating disorders of any kind as well as the person\u2019s sex, Schenck said. \u201cSleep-related eating is like 70% female predominant, while sexsomnia, for example, is 80% male predominant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that society\u2019s emphasis on dieting may contribute; if someone restricts their eating during the daytime and doesn\u2019t get enough calories, that may drive more sleep-related eating.\u201d Jill\u2019s mother was always on a diet, she recalls, and wonders if that factor might have contributed to her behavior. \u201cYou know, the big thing was you had to be thin, and I wonder if as a kid I was picking up on it. But I really don\u2019t know,\u201d Jill said. Families may try to help their loved ones by waking them while they are sleep eating, Schenck said. At times, however, doing so can backfire. \u201cThe person may get irritable and angry and say, \u2018Don\u2019t stop me from doing what I have to do.\u2019 I once treated a single mother with three teenage kids who paid her three children to sleep in sleeping bags in the kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she would come into the kitchen during the night, her children would say, \u2018Stop, you paid us to have you stop!\u2019 Guess what happened? She got so frustrated she paid her children more money to go back to their own beds and let her eat in peace.\u201d \u2018Just don\u2019t give up\u2019 It has been more than 20 years since Jill first visited Schenck\u2019s clinic. Today, her restless legs syndrome and sleep-related eating disorder are mostly under control, she said, thanks to a cocktail of three medications Schenck prescribed. \u201cI take them early at night because it takes awhile for the meds to work \u2014 even Dr. Schenck was surprised I take them as early as I do to get my system to calm down by bedtime. \u201cThe medications work 95% of the time, but then I will have the occasional bad day and night,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t work, it\u2019s just exhausting.\u201d She does her best to keep overly processed trigger foods out of her home, a desire that is at times sabotaged by the treats she has on hand when her grandchildren visit. But life is enormously better than before she began treatment. \u201cI\u2019m very, very, very grateful that I finally found someone who understands what I am going through,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI know there are thousands of people out there suffering just like me, and my heart goes out to them. It is a tough journey to go through.\u201d Her advice to others? Be your own best advocate, she said. Do research and read what you can about the disorder so you know the right questions to ask the doctor. And above all, she said, request a prescription for a sleep study to find out what is triggering the behavior. \u201cDon\u2019t let doctors put you down, blow you off or make you feel bad,\u201d she said. \u201cOne doctor might not want to do a sleep study, so find another doctor that will. \u201cJust keep fighting until you get the right doctor. Get a second opinion, even a third opinion if you think you need to. Just don\u2019t give up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/sleep-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_travel_camp-stove-cooking-wellness", "text": "You know what I love doing in the summer? I\u2019ll give you three things: \u2022 Taking road trip vacations\u2022 Eating well on my road trips\u2022 Not going over my food budget while on a road trip That last one is a little tricky to pull off because \u2014 and I admit this might be an obvious statement \u2014 the cost of eating adds up over the course of a vacation. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who loves to fill up on a big, leisurely brunch, finding affordable but memorable options for every meal during a long trip can be challenging. I used to make do with deli sandwiches and brought-from-home snacks, but now I have a secret weapon for quick but satisfying road trip lunches: my Coleman camp stove. Despite my outdoorsy hippie reputation among friends, this was the first time I dove into cooking on an outdoor propane stove before renting a camper van for a cross-country trip with my husband on Route 66. But once we were on the road and figured out the logistics of our travel routine, I realized the stove\u2019s versatility and utility, not to mention the genuine fun of being able to cook lunch on the go. With a two-burner stove and pump sink in the back of our camper van, we could pull over and cook lunch pretty much anywhere during each day\u2019s adventures. I made pesto rotini in the parking lot of Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s historic home in Missouri, flipped grilled cheese sandwiches in a local park in Baxter Springs, Kansas, and slurped up cheesy zoodles outside the Painted Desert Inn in Petrified Forest National Park. Now I\u2019m a seasoned outdoor cook and have invested in a full mini kitchen setup for my camping excursions. I\u2019ve fallen in love with camp stove cooking so much that I now bring it with us on most of our summer road trips \u2014 whether we\u2019re camping or not. Coupled with my trusty 10-inch cast-iron skillet, the camp stove gives me a way to save a few bucks and eat well during the day so we can have a big dinner out. I might get a few stares in hotel parking lots and patio areas, but it\u2019s worth it for the convenience and reassurance of a good meal while sticking to my frugal budget. Hey, I own all these items already \u2014 why not use them? My road-trip stove setup Along with my stove and skillet, I also bring a few basic tools for cooking and cleaning. I keep a crate packed with the following: \u2022 Metal tongs\u2022 Fish spatula (slotted spatula)\u2022 Silicone spoonula\u2022 Silicone trivet\u2022 Olive oil (in a small squeeze bottle)\u2022 Kosher salt\u2022 Bar towels\u2022 Washcloth\u2022 Laundry tub\u2022 Castile soap Because I\u2019m using a propane stove, I only cook in well-ventilated outdoor areas and bring a foldable metal table to make sure there is a safe cooking surface no matter where I\u2019ll be. Keep meals simple with pre-prepped ingredients Simplicity is the key to easy camp stove lunches. When I\u2019m planning these meals, I don\u2019t want to complicate my prep with anything that requires chopping on-site. Remember, all equipment needs to be washed in your hotel bathroom, so this is no time to get fancy. To accomplish this, I turn to pre-prepped ingredients, a departure from my usual higher-maintenance home cooking. However, these items are easy to find in many US grocery stores, so they don\u2019t need to be packed in advance. With these versatile building blocks, I can make a variety of meals. I start with a base of shelf-stable carbs, such as bagged, ready-to-eat pasta, rice or grain blends. Protein comes in the form of beans, whether canned or bagged, frozen mini meatballs or seasoned tofu or seitan from the refrigerated section. The frozen and refrigerated produce sections offer a cornucopia of quick-cooking vegetable choices, including zoodles, cauliflower rice and stir-fry blends, pre-chopped onions and peppers, green beans, snap peas, baby spinach, and broccoli florets. Sauces can be as varied as pesto, marinara, salsa, salad dressings, or simply a bit of butter and salt. I\u2019ve also been known to bring some cheese powder from my pantry to make a macaroni and cheese meal as well. Don\u2019t forget that a one-skillet meal can also be as easy as a quesadilla, nachos, flatbreads or a homemade grilled cheese that beats the pants off a basic cold deli sandwich. Mix and match these ingredients and find the fun in cooking outdoors on your camp stove for your next road trip.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/travel/camp-stove-cooking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "health"}}

The workers are believed to have caught the virus through direct work with infected birds at a commercial egg operation. They had mild symptoms including conjunctivitis or pink eye and respiratory problems, but none of them were hospitalized, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in\u00a0a statement\u00a0Friday.
