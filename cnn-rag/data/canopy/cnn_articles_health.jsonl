CNN is showcasing the work of\u00a0The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. In September 2023, several people came down with\u00a0dengue\u00a0fever in Paris, France. The presence of this mosquito-borne disease was notable for two reasons. It was the most northerly outbreak ever recorded, and none of the people had travelled recently. This demonstrated it is now possible for dengue to be transmitted locally in northern Europe. These facts are important in 2024 because of the Olympics. France waits in anticipation of more than\u00a010 million\u00a0athletes, spectators, officials and tourists descending on the city for the event. The French government knows there is a risk of dengue. In Paris,\u00a0hundreds of sites\u00a0are being regularly checked for the presence of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes. Will this be enough? The concept of the\u00a0super-spreader\u00a0in infection epidemiology is not new. In essence, it means that a small fraction of a population, maybe just one person, is responsible for most of the cases. A famous historical super-spreader was\u00a0\u201ctyphoid Mary\u201d. Mary Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid who may have infected over 100 people.

In terms of dengue,\u00a0one analysis from Peru\u00a0of super-spreading suggests 8% of human-occupied spaces are responsible for over half of cases. (It should be noted that dengue cannot be caught directly from another human, only from the bite of a dengue-carrying mosquito.) This is not the first time the Olympics has been identified as a risk factor for viral epidemics. The 2016 Olympics in Brazil\u00a0were almost postponed\u00a0because of fears about Zika - another virus transmitted by the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquito. READ MORE: More dengue fever and less malaria \u2013 mosquito control strategies may need to shift as Africa heats up In the end, any worries were put to bed, because there were\u00a0no reported cases. Fear about COVID spreading via the Tokyo Olympics brought about drastic measures to limit transmission. At that event, few infections occurred inside the Olympic bubble, but there was an\u00a0increase in cases\u00a0among the general population. So what is different about Paris? Aedes\u00a0has spread considerably further than in 2016, and the number of dengue cases worldwide has increased dramatically in the same period. In 2016 there were 5.2 million cases reported worldwide. Halfway through 2024, there have already been\u00a07.6 million cases. READ MORE: Viruses can change your scent to make you more attractive to mosquitoes, new research in mice finds Visitors from more than 200 countries are expected in France for the Olympics. Many of those countries are already experiencing dengue this year. For the Paris Olympics to become a\u00a0super-spreader event, several factors must overlap. There needs to be enough mosquitoes, enough susceptible\u00a0and\u00a0already-infected people, enough time and enough mosquito bites. Perfectly adapted The tiger mosquito is perfectly adapted to the urban Paris environment. It needs just the smallest amount of water in a small container to lay its eggs. It preferentially feeds on humans, at dawn and dusk. The eggs themselves can withstand dry conditions for months. Once wet again, the eggs will hatch. READ MORE: Dengue in France: tropical diseases in Europe may not be that rare for much longer What makes this situation potentially dangerous for Paris is that some of these mosquitoes may have dengue already inside them,\u00a0passed down from their mother. This could significantly reduce the number of bites needed to start an epidemic. Within the time frame of the Olympics, an infected athlete or spectator could be bitten once by a mosquito and seed an epidemic in a week or so. Each female mosquito can lay up to 200 eggs at a time. Most dengue cases are asymptomatic. People infected before or during the Olympics may have no idea they are carrying the virus. They might take the virus back home and seed an epidemic there without ever knowing it. Whether people get sick or not, they are carrying the virus and can transmit the infection onwards if they get bitten by an\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquito. At the Rio Carnival this year, a dengue outbreak just days before the event led to a\u00a0public health emergency being called, but the event wasn\u2019t cancelled. There will be no public health emergency in Paris because the event itself is the risk factor. Anyone living, working, visiting, competing, volunteering or even just passing through Paris during the Olympic period is going to be part of a huge\u00a0natural experiment\u00a0\u2013 whether they know it or not.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/health/dengue-paris-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_health_therapy-benefits-happiness-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Therapy often gets a bad rap. In old movies, it\u2019s often depicted with a patient lying on a couch, talking to a stony-faced, note-taking analyst who never speaks. Critics sometimes derisively describe it as navel-gazing. Therapists are offhandedly called \u201cshrinks,\u201d a throwback to the ancient practice \u00a0of shrinking the head of a conquered enemy. And let\u2019s face it, the practice still carries a stigma for many; acknowledging you see a therapist is akin to admitting you are weak or \u201ccrazy,\u201d especially in some professions. When it comes to physical health, most of us don\u2019t hesitate too long to get help for injuries such as a broken bone or a burn. But when it comes to emotional health, there often is a delay, possibly resulting in a bigger mental health crisis. \u201cPeople don\u2019t come to therapy until they\u2019re having the equivalent of an emotional heart attack,\u201d psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently. Gottlieb is the author of \u201cMaybe You Should Talk to Someone,\u201d a cohost of the \u201cDear Therapists\u201d podcast\u00a0and the writer of the weekly \u201cDear Therapist\u201d advice column for The Atlantic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this hierarchy of pain with our physical health. We don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I fell down and broke my wrist, but I don\u2019t have stage 4 cancer, so I\u2019m just going to let my wrist hang out there and I\u2019m not going to get a cast.\u2019 And we have a very different attitude about emotional health,\u201d she said. Hesitancy over therapy may be due to its stigma, a skepticism about its worth, the cost in time and money, or just the uncertainty about how it works \u2014 and this reluctance to discuss mental health is pretty widespread. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center released in May, 31% of respondents said they would only be somewhat comfortable talking to a therapist about their mental health, while 18% said they\u2019d be either not too or not at all comfortable doing so. \u201cThere are so many misconceptions about therapy, and I think that often prevents people from going,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c(One) is that you\u2019re going to go in, you\u2019re going to download the problem of the week, and you\u2019re going to leave, and you\u2019re basically just complaining and getting validated for your complaints. \u201cAnd that is not what therapy is. We like to say that insight is the booby prize of therapy, that you can have all the insight in the world, but if you don\u2019t make changes out in the world, the insight is useless,\u201d she said, noting that most therapy takes place in the week between sessions \u201cwhere you are actually taking what you\u2019ve learned and doing something different.\u201d Taking action not only rewires your brain, but it can ultimately result in a happier you. \u201cDo they experience joy more? Yes. Are they generally more content in their lives? Do they feel less stressed, less sad, more able to manage when things don\u2019t go well, less reactive when they\u2019re in a situation that maybe is relationally difficult for them, more able to find sort of inner peace? Yes,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. I think that when people say, \u2018Oh, I just want to be happy.\u2019 All of the things that I just described bring you happiness.\u201d You can listen to the full episode here. How can therapy improve your happiness? Here are Gottlieb\u2019s top five reasons. 1. Therapy offers perspective Ideally, therapy is impartial. \u201cTherapy is like getting a really good second opinion on your life, from someone who\u2019s not already in your life,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWhen we try to get advice or guidance from people who are close to us, it\u2019s hard for them to separate out the relationship they have with us and to be able to see the issue objectively.\u201d Our friends, she said, give us \u201cidiot compassion\u201d \u2014 they loyally validate our feelings often without pointing out our own role in any conflicts. Therapists are trained to give us \u201cwise compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hold up a mirror to you, and we help you to see something about what is getting you stuck, that maybe you haven\u2019t been willing or able to see. We help you to see something that you can actively change,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAnd I think that there\u2019s something so empowering about that, and it\u2019s so translatable to many different relationships.\u201d 2. Therapy is a safe space In therapy, you can explore seemingly frivolous subjects. \u201cTherapy can make you happier because it helps you to really be intentional about what you want in your life. And I don\u2019t think we have a lot of spaces to talk about that,\u201d Gottlieb said, referring to concepts such as life satisfaction. \u201cSometimes people think, \u2018Well, I have a roof over my head and food on the table. So this whole thing about meaning and fulfillment \u2014 I can\u2019t really talk about that,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIn therapy, you have a space where you can really ask those hard questions, and nobody\u2019s judging you and nobody\u2019s trying to tell you, \u2018Well, you have enough already.\u2019\u201d 3. Therapy helps to connect with others Modern times have created an epidemic of loneliness; the pandemic only made it worse. Therapy can be a bridge. \u201cWe do have this epidemic of loneliness. And I think a lot of people want deeper connections, and they want more meaningful connections, but they don\u2019t know how to go about it,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think that we all grew up with certain ideas about what relationships look like, what friendships look like. (But) we aren\u2019t always aware of the ways in which we may be preventing ourselves from having more meaningful relationships.\u201d For example, many people avoid conflict or seek it out, while others have social anxiety or never learned the necessary social skills. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know how to reach out even if we want to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think in therapy, you learn how to create connection in your life, which is one of the most influential factors when it comes to happiness.\u201d 4. Therapy helps us see the big picture Therapy helps people see that they are part of larger forces, and not simply individuals who formed with no external influences. \u201cWe sometimes feel that the problems are sort of \u2018out there\u2019 \u2014 we don\u2019t really know that we are part of that dynamic, part of that dance,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c(Therapy) helps you to process that unfinished business.\u201d She pointed out that our parents were human and often did what they learned from their parents. \u201cAnd (therapy is) a place where you can say, \u2018What is some of this old stuff that I\u2019m carrying around with me that I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m carrying around?\u2019\u201d she said, noting that once you understand how your history influences how you navigate through the world, you can change patterns. \u201cIt makes you happier because you\u2019re not carrying around the burden of something that happened a long time ago,\u201d she said. 5. Therapy helps us control our story Our life is a narrative, and therapy can help us make sense of it. \u201cWhen you think about our lives \u2026 they\u2019re really stories. (Therapy) helps you clarify your story and take authorship of your story,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt helps you to take authorship of your own life. \u2026 If I\u2019m creating this one limited time that I have here \u2014 this one life that I have here \u2014 why am I letting all these other people write my story for me, and how can I really take ownership of my story?\u201d We hope these five tips help you understand the benefits of therapy.

{"id": "health_abortion-pill-safety-dg", "text": "The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone \u2014 the first drug in the medication abortion process \u2014 is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That\u2019s a death rate of 0.0005%. Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin \u2014 a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia \u2014 is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra \u2014 used to treat erectile dysfunction \u2014 is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA. \u201c[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIts safety is very well established.\u201d Weighing medication abortion against the alternatives Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion. \u201cIt reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,\u201d she said. It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications \u2014 like hemorrhages or infections \u2014 for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a\u00a02015 study\u00a0conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications. The likelihood of\u00a0serious complications via procedural abortion\u00a0\u2014 performed second-trimester or later \u2014 is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And\u00a0childbirth\u00a0by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%. Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said. In a\u00a0study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol. Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen. \u201cIt\u2019s clear people can use these medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, at home even without the help of a medical professional very safely,\u201d said Aiken. Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it\u2019s readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN in April. However, a lesser-effective method means more people will likely have unsuccessful abortions. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that it might not work for some people, and it will prolong their abortions,\u201d said Upadhyay. \u201cThen by the time they get back to the clinic, they\u2019re seeking abortion later in pregnancy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/health/abortion-pill-safety-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_health_cdc-adhd-medication-alert", "text": "People taking medications for ADHD, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, may face disruptions in accessing treatment after the arrests of two executives of a telehealth company that distributed such drugs to adults across the United States. On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an official health advisory warning about a \u201cpotential disrupted access to care among individuals taking prescription stimulant medications and possible increased risks for injury and overdose.\u201d Around the same time, the US Department of Justice announced a federal health-care fraud indictment against two executives from the digital health company Done Global, whose website describes it as \u201cmaking high quality psychiatric chronic care management more accessible and affordable for patients.\u201d The indictment\u2019s effect on patients \u201cis unknown at the time,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s advisory. \u201cPatients who rely on prescription stimulant medications to treat their ADHD and have been using this or other similar subscription-based telehealth platforms could experience a disruption to their treatment and disrupted access to care,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cA disruption involving this large telehealth company could impact as many as 30,000 to 50,000 patients ages 18 years and older across all 50 U.S. states.\u201d Ruthia He, the founder and CEO of Done Global Inc., was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday and accused of participating in a scheme to distribute Adderall over the internet, conspire to commit health-care fraud and obstruct justice, according to the Justice Department\u2019s announcement. The company\u2019s clinical president, David Brody, also was arrested in San Rafael, California. The Justice Department claims that He and Brody generated more than $100 million in revenue by arranging for the prescriptions of more than 40 million pills, targeting \u201cdrug seekers\u201d and instructing prescribers to prescribe stimulants to patients even if they didn\u2019t qualify. \u201cAs alleged, these defendants exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and carry out a $100 million scheme to defraud taxpayers and provide easy access to Adderall and other stimulants for no legitimate medical purpose,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news release. \u201cThose seeking to profit from addiction by illegally distributing controlled substances over the internet should know that they cannot hide their crimes and that the Justice Department will hold them accountable.\u201d Naomi Chung, Brody\u2019s attorney, said he had pleaded not guilty to all counts. \u201cDr. Brody worked to promote access to medical treatment for those with ADHD in the face of both widespread stigma and the unprecedented challenges of a global pandemic.\u201d Efforts to reach He or the company were not successful, and CNN has not been able to determine whether He has retained a lawyer because the case docket remains under seal. The arrests mark the Justice Department\u2019s first criminal drug distribution prosecutions related to prescribing via telemedicine through a digital health company, the agency said. If convicted, He and Brody will face a maximum penalty of two decades in prison. Last year, a CDC study found that prescriptions for stimulants often used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder surged during the pandemic, especially among adults. Between 2016 and 2020, the share of the population that had filled a prescription for a stimulant drug held relatively steady. But there was a large increase in 2021, with prescription fills jumping more than 10% across most age groups. The new CDC advisory noted that there is an ongoing prescription drug shortage in the United States involving several stimulant medications commonly prescribed to treat ADHD, a brain disorder that can make it difficult to concentrate or control impulsive behavior. It\u2019s estimated that ADHD affects about 4% of adults and about 10% of children in the US. About one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. \u201cPatients whose care or access to prescription stimulant medications is disrupted, and who seek medication outside of the regulated healthcare system, might significantly increase their risk of overdose due to the prevalence of\u00a0counterfeit pills\u00a0in the illegal drug market that could contain unexpected substances, including\u00a0fentanyl,\u201d according to the CDC advisory. \u201cGiven the national\u00a0drug overdose crisis\u00a0and threats associated with the illegal drug market, individuals struggling to access prescription stimulant medications are urged to avoid using medication obtained from anyone other than a licensed clinician and licensed pharmacy,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cHealth officials and healthcare providers may need to assist affected patients seeking treatment for ADHD and should communicate overdose risks associated with the current illegal drug market as well as provide overdose prevention education and mental health support.\u201d The CDC advisory also warned that without treatment, ADHD is associated with social and emotional impairment and a higher risk of drug or alcohol use disorder, unintentional injuries such as motor vehicle crashes, and suicide. \u201cAs more health care needs are met through telemedicine, we will not tolerate fraud schemes that seek to recklessly exploit digital technologies,\u201d Christi Grimm, inspector general of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in the Justice Department\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect the enrollees of federal health care programs by ensuring that requirements for the appropriate, legal prescribing of stimulants and other drugs are always met, and those who choose to violate them are held accountable.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/cdc-adhd-medication-alert/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_planetary-diet-longevity-study-wellness", "text": "Closely following a planet-friendly diet of mostly fruits, vegetables and whole grains reduces the risk of premature death by nearly one-third in people, while also dramatically cutting the release of greenhouse gases devastating the planet, a new study found. \u201cEating more whole plant foods, less animal foods, and less highly processed foods is better for people and planet alike,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who was not involved in the study. \u201cIn this paper, we see that same message amplified: adhering to a dietary pattern conducive to the health of the planet and sustainability is associated with meaningful reductions in all-cause mortality,\u201d he said in an email. Katz is the founder of\u00a0the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine Food production plays a major role in the climate crisis. Raising livestock for human consumption, for example, uses an enormous amount of agricultural land and contributes to deforestation, biodiversity loss and water pollution, experts say. Animals that chew their cud can emit noxious gases with an astounding impact on the environment. Burps and poo\u00a0from cattle, sheep and goats generate methane, a greenhouse gas\u00a080 times more powerful than carbon dioxide\u00a0in warming the planet in the span of 20 years, according to the UN Environment Programme. One adult cow, for example, can belch or fart up to 500 liters of methane a day. Add them up, and they can generate nearly 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, experts say. Eating a planet-healthy diet, however, cut land use by 51%, greenhouse gas emissions by 29% and fertilizer use by 21%, while also extending the lives of people, according to the study. \u201cChanging how we eat can help slow climate change, and fortunately what\u2019s healthiest for the planet is also best for us,\u201d said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. \u201cFor every major cause of death we looked at, there was a lower risk in people with better adherence to the planetary health diet,\u201d Willett said. A diet for people and the planet In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission, composed of 37 leading scientists from 16 countries, created a diet with dual goals \u2014 maximizing human health while reducing the environmental impact of feeding billions of people. The resulting meal plan stressed a higher consumption of a rainbow of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes and other plant-based proteins while reducing meat and dairy to small portions. The study, published Monday in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, analyzed dietary data gathered from more than 200,000 women and men to see how it matched up against the Eat-Lancet dietary guidelines. All the people were enrolled in long-term government studies \u2014 the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study \u2014 and had no major diseases when the research began. Every four years for 34 years, study participants filled out dietary questionnaires, providing researchers with an enormous amount of data. Researchers then scored the diets based on the intake of 15 food groups. Foods that are good for the planet take fewer overall resources to grow and include whole grains, tubers, vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, soybean foods and unsaturated plant oils, such as olive oil. Foods that require a large use of land, such as cattle, and to a lesser extent sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, were also measured, as was intake of added sugar, which has many known health risks. While other studies have looked at the impact of the planetary health diet, none has matched the scope of this study, Willett said. \u201cThis is a substantially larger and much longer study which has repeated assessments of diet over more than three decades, which allows more statistical precision,\u201d he said. The top 10% of people who followed the Eat-Lancet planetary diet were 30% less likely to die prematurely from any cause than those in the bottom 10%, the study found. In addition, those who most closely followed the planetary diet had a 28% lower risk of neurodegenerative mortality, a 14% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, a 10% lower risk of dying from cancer and a 47% lower risk of dying from a respiratory disease, which applied to nonsmokers as well, Willett said. \u201cThe findings show just how linked human and planetary health are. Eating healthfully boosts environmental sustainability \u2014 which in turn is essential for the health and well-being of every person on Earth,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/planetary-diet-longevity-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

It was 1:30 a.m.\u201d How did a dream from a retired grocery manufacturer from Golden Valley, Minnesota, become worthy of a profile in a well-known national magazine? Five years earlier, Dorff had become the first patient diagnosed with an unusual disease called rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, or RBD. There\u2019s more. Dorff\u2019s case also launched researchers on a journey that uncovered one of the earliest signs of two devastating diseases: Parkinson\u2019s and a unique form of dementia called Lewy body. Symptoms include screaming, kicking and throwing punches The discovery of RBD was made in 1982 when Dorff, after years of experiencing \u201cviolent moving nightmares,\u201d became a patient of psychiatrist and sleep specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck,\u00a0then working at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis. \u201cDuring rapid eye movement or REM sleep, the brain basically paralyzes the body so that we cannot act out our dreams,\u201d Schenck, now a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota, told CNN recently. \u201cBut Dorff was able to get up and hurt himself while dreaming, a very odd behavior. We were scratching our heads about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we put him in a sleep lab, and lo and behold, all his physical behaviors came out of REM sleep, which had never been reported before.\u201d More patients with the unusual disorder were identified, many exhibiting a disturbing set of violent symptoms, Schenck said. \u201cThey start kicking in bed, throwing punches at their bed partners, talking or screaming loudly, things like \u2018Get the hell out of here!\u2019 Then the wife has to scream really loudly to stop the episode,\u201d he said. \u201cLimb jerking, twitching, throwing out your arm, throwing punches, kicking, sitting up, standing, jumping out of bed and running. Those behaviors are very typical with RBD,\u201d he added. One 70-year-old patient, described by his wife as having a gentle nature during the day, would punch and kick her as many as five times a night, Schenck said. On one occasion, he tried to strangle his wife while dreaming of fighting off a mauling bear. Another patient, also 70, dreamed he had just taken down a deer and was going to break its neck. In reality it was his wife\u2019s neck, which he discovered when he woke up. (She quit sleeping in the same bed.) By 1986, Schenck and his team had published their first paper on the newly discovered sleep disorder. As he followed patients over the years, however, Schenck discovered something more disturbing \u2014 the behavior could be a \u201ccanary in the mine\u201d for later neurodegeneration. \u201cLosing the paralysis of REM sleep that is the basis of RBD is the earliest and strongest predictor of a later diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy body,\u201d Schenck said. RBD can affect women, too Lewy body dementia can refer to two different types of dementia:\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which both affect cognition. Parkinson\u2019s disease, however, is a slowly progressive disorder that inhibits muscle control, balance and movement \u2014 although about 4 in 5 people with Parkinson\u2019s ultimately develop dementia, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. In both Parkinson\u2019s and the two dementias, cells in and around the stalk-like stem at the bottom of the brain begin to die. In addition to breathing, swallowing, heart rate and eye and facial movements, the brain stem also controls the sleep-wake cycle. Early damage to the brain stem caused by Parkinson\u2019s can interfere with the body\u2019s innate ability to freeze the muscles while dreaming, thus allowing the body to sit up, scream, flail or otherwise act out a dream. Hallucinations, which are common in Parkinson\u2019s, can also occur, according to case studies. A 67-year-old man would see faceless, hooded or cloaked figures or animals while awake during the night. The images vanished when the man turned on a light or got up to investigate. Such nighttime behaviors can often be controlled with medication, including high doses of melatonin or the drug clonazepam, which stops seizures and relaxes tense muscles, Schenck said. \u201cEither one alone or both in combination works 80% to 90% of the time, and there are a long list of alternative treatments,\u201d said Schenck, who first published the connection between RBD and Parkinson\u2019s in February 1996. \u201cWe know the mechanism for RBD very well, and we know how to treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next step is to slow down or halt the progression to Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.\u201d At first, researchers believed RBD only affected men but then realized that women are equally impacted. \u201cJust as many women have this problem, but because it\u2019s much milder and doesn\u2019t cause injury as often, they frequently don\u2019t come in to seek help,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cYet they have lost that muscle paralysis in REM sleep, and they\u2019re just as much at risk for future Parkinson\u2019s disease as the men.\u201d A clinical trial is underway at nine medical centers in the United States, Schenck said. Called the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy Consortium, the research hopes to identify potential treatments for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and slow its progression into Parkinson\u2019s and dementia. Seek medical treatment if violent dreams begin As a child, Donald Dorff shared a room with three brothers and never had any signs of a sleep disorder. On his wedding night, however, he scared his new bride with loud talking, groaning, teeth grinding and minor movements, according to Schenck\u2019s case study. About 41 years later, however, he began to have vivid, violent dreams that he would act out. In one dream, he was riding a motorcycle when another motorcyclist tried to ram him. \u201cI decided I\u2019m going to kick his motorcycle away and at that point my wife woke me up and said, \u2018What in heavens are you doing to me?\u2019 because I was kicking the hell out of her,\u201d Dorff told Schenck during treatment. In another dream Dorff was under attack by a man with a rifle and preparing to shoot back when he suddenly woke up. \u201cI was kneeling alongside the bed with my arms extended like 1 was holding the rifle up and ready to shoot.\u201d One night Dorff dived into a bedside dresser and cut himself, Schenck said. It was then that he found Schenck\u2019s clinic and went there for treatment. While some people with RBD develop full-blown Parkinson\u2019s rather quickly, Dorff was not one of them. He died of prostate cancer, Schenck said, and was able to control his violent nighttime behavior until his death as long as he remained on medication. Dorff\u2019s case helped physicians discover an early key to two devastating disorders, allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never been a sleepwalker or sleep talker throughout your life and suddenly, after the age of 50, you start and the talking becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should be evaluated by your primary care doctor,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cYour doctor should consider neurological evaluation because that could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/health/violent-dreams-parkinsons-dementia-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_health_fatherhood-good-for-dads-wellness", "text": "Many arguments about why dads should do more parenting focus on why that would be good for their wives or partners and kids. How about why and how it would be good for the dads themselves? It\u2019s also a conversation we should be having. Fatherhood can be good for men, psychologically speaking. As I discovered while doing interviews for my new book, \u201cWhen You Care: The Unexpected Magic of Caring for Others,\u201d the experience of being a dad allows men to feel feelings and behave in ways that mainstream masculinity standards often prohibit. At the office or on the ball court, men are expected to deny or conceal their vulnerability, empathy and sensitivity. Do so and risk being thought of as feminine or weak. But with their kids, dads have a chance to explore all these sides and more, often away from the scrutiny of the public eye. They get to be sweet, soft and compassionate, unafraid to show tenderness without fear of judgment or rejection. Many are better for it. \u201cWhen we put men in caregiving roles, whether they chose to be in it or are forced into it, it gives men a chance to reach inside and embody parts of themselves that are already there, but often not widely shown nor reinforced by greater society,\u201d Matt Englar-Carlson, director of the Center for Boys and Men at California State University, Fullerton, told me in an interview for my book. Take Eric Gardner, for example. He is a former company commander in the US Army who found that caring for his daughters has allowed him to uncover long-repressed feelings and work through trauma. Fatherhood pushed Gardner to break away from the stoicism and aggression encouraged during his military career and learn how to be deeply attentive to others and try to understand their weakness and fears. Eventually, he realized he needed to turn these skills on himself to move past the shame of his post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis and figure out what would help him. \u201cBeing with my daughters made me realize that I had to understand myself,\u201d Gardner said. Dads really are doing more care It may not always feel like fathers are doing more parenting, but they are. \u201cIf you are a woman who has to constantly fight with her husband to get him to help with the kids or do housework, I am sure it is very frustrating,\u201d Stephanie Coontz, a family studies historian, told me. \u201cBut, as a historian, if you step back and look at what men were not doing and refusing to do 20 or 30 years ago and compare that to what they are doing now \u2014 from a historical perspective it is quite a turnaround.\u201d Dads still do less parenting than moms, but we are getting closer than ever. One cross-national study found that dads spent an average of 16 minutes a day caring for their kids in 1965. By 2012 that number rose to 59 minutes a day. By comparison, moms went from 54 minutes a day in 1965 to 104 minutes in 2012. Sadly, this shift didn\u2019t happen because men suddenly realized parenthood is a meaningful and valuable \u2014 something they wanted to experience firsthand. Or, because they wanted to give moms a break. Instead, it is because women went to work outside the home. \u201cNothing has had more of an impact on men getting more involved in caregiving than women entering the workforce in greater numbers,\u201d said Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work & Family. If you find this reason frustrating \u2014 well, me, too! But it helps to remember that men didn\u2019t avoid hands-on parenting exclusively because they weren\u2019t interested. There are social costs to men doing more care, which has long been considered antithetical to masculinity. I grew up watching a movie about a full-time dad and the high jinks that ensued when a man took on women\u2019s work. What was it called? \u201cMr. Mom.\u201d For years I remember people teasing men who took on a heavy load of parenting with this nickname. The implication was that doing care makes men more feminine, and being feminine is a joke. Such stigma follows men to the workplace, where they are financially rewarded for being a dad, but only if they don\u2019t make any parenthood-related requests from their employers \u2014 such as having to work from home when a kid is sick or leave early for a child\u2019s orthodontist appointment. Should that happen, they tend to be penalized just like moms, Harrington said. Despite the professional and cultural obstacles, today\u2019s dads continue to do more and more parenting for both practical reasons \u2014 Mom has a job, too! \u2014 and personal ones. They like it. In his research, Harrington found that more than two-thirds of dads said they wish they could spend more time with their kids, even when they\u2019re already spending a lot of time with them. Other studies reach similar conclusions. Also, dads find parenting \u201cextremely important to their identity,\u201d and enjoyable and rewarding nearly identically as often moms do. Breaking free of gender scripts Some of this joy and satisfaction comes from the way fatherhood allows men to break free of gender scripts, experts say. One reason is that traditional masculinity isn\u2019t good for anyone, according to a 2018 American Psychological Association report featuring guidelines for treating boys and men. \u201cThe main thrust of the subsequent research is that traditional masculinity \u2014 marked by stoicism, competitiveness, dominance and aggression \u2014 is, on the whole, harmful,\u201d according to the APA. Indeed, the patriarchy has rewarded men. But the type of masculinity required to make it in a patriarchal world comes with a cost. Traditional masculinity is negatively correlated\u00a0with poor physical health and mental health, lower life satisfaction and lower self-esteem. Englar-Carlson said he believes that caring for others gives men a chance to find justification for behaving in ways that have long been associated with the feminine. \u201cCaregiving gives men an opportunity to combat the shame associated with not being tough enough, which is often a cause of the internal conflict men often experience when they are in nontraditionally male roles. It can also give men an opportunity to feel helpful, worthwhile, and like something matters,\u201d he said. At online and in-person gatherings for Fathering Together, a dad advocacy organization, fathers often work through their desire to try to be more sensitive, empathetic dads. Brian Anderson, cofounder of the organization, told me that these dads rely on each other to learn how to express vulnerability and move past the \u201cfather knows best\u201d approach to parenthood. Their goal is to be more empathetic and sensitive. For many, these conversations are a rare opportunity to shed their macho skins and discover what is underneath. Learning the power of vulnerability David Bullman, a member of the Fathering Together community, was raised in a US Army post in Colorado Springs, where traditional masculinity had a stronghold. Bullman responded to his father\u2019s expectations with rebellion; his self-described tough-guy lifestyle, including drugs and crime, eventually landed him in prison at age 22. When he got out a decade later, determined to take a different path, he became romantically committed to a woman he knew as a child and reconnected with while in prison. Two years later, they had a child. Caring for his daughter woke up the tender and receptive parts of himself that he had long buried. \u201cMy whole world had changed. I\u2019m not the hard-ass I used to be. I had to learn how to have feelings and have emotions and how to be human and not a robot,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause with the kids you can\u2019t just turn it all off. I had to learn to ask for help, because for a long time I would try to keep that in, and think I got to learn this on my own and do this on my own,\u201d he said. To raise his child, \u201cI went from being a stone-cold a**hole \u00a0to being the complete opposite. I had to change everything about me.\u201d Elissa Strauss writes about the politics and culture of parenthood. She is the author of the new book \u201cWhen You Care: The Unexpected Magic of Caring for Others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/health/fatherhood-good-for-dads-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_swimsuit-color-pool-safety-wellness", "text": "The color of your child\u2019s swimsuit could impact their safety at a swimming pool or the beach. That\u2019s according to water safety experts who have taken a close look at how the hue of swimwear may influence how visible a child is under water. \u201cA child\u2019s swimsuit color can significantly impact their visibility in the water, which is crucial in preventing drownings. Bright and contrasting colors stand out more clearly against the water, making it easier for lifeguards and parents to spot a child quickly, especially in an emergency situation,\u201d Bernard Fisher, director of health and safety for the American Lifeguard Association, said in an email. \u201cPeople should avoid swimsuits in light blue, gray, or green as they can blend with the water and pool surroundings, making it difficult to spot a child. We recommend bright and contrasting colors such as neon yellow, orange, pink, and bright red,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cThese colors are highly visible both underwater and on the surface. Swimsuit colors are not talked about enough in public safety, said Wyatt Werneth, a coastal lifeguard in Florida and spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association. \u201cThe bright clothes are something that we\u2019ve identified as being a game-changer. If you have the same colors of the water or the environment, you\u2019re going to blend in,\u201d Werneth said while patrolling Cocoa Beach. \u201cWe consider this also with missing children. Not only the fact that the bright colors are going to help us locate them in a pool environment or the beach, but one of the things that lifeguards do more than anything else \u2013 you think we go out and wrestle with sharks and save people from rip currents \u2013 but we also look for missing children at the beach,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re wearing a bright color, and if you take a picture of those children before, then we\u2019ll have a picture and know what to look for. So, you can help us \u2013 not only can drowning be prevented, missing persons\u2019 [cases] can be prevented as well.\u201d Swimsuit color test A company called Alive Solutions, which specializes in water safety, has found in two separate experiments that certain swimsuit colors are easier to spot in a swimming pool or open water, such as a lake. In tests, the company\u2019s water safety experts placed swimsuits of various colors in swimming pools and lakes to determine how visible they may be. The tests were conducted independently and not published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cIn our main testing we did 14 different colors,\u201d Natalie Livingston, co-founder and owner of Alive Solutions, said in an email. \u201cWater is not like looking through air.\u00a0Even the tiniest bit of surface agitation, glare, or movement in the water can cause objects and people to become distorted,\u201d she said. \u201cVisibility in water can be increased or decreased depending on the color of a swimsuit or clothing.\u201d Livingston, who has been a lifeguard for more than 25 years, remembers watching her children at the pool one afternoon with other parents and that\u2019s when she realized that some children wearing either dark- or pastel-colored swimsuits seemed to visibly disappear in the water. Her colleagues and she later decided to conduct the tests from 2019 through last year. In a swimming pool, with a light-colored bottom, the company\u2019s tests showed that neon pink and neon orange appeared to be the most visible. Darker colors showed up against the light pool bottom, but could often be dismissed for shadows, leaves or dirt. White and light blue swimsuits were not as visible and seemed to disappear completely in the pool. \u201cLight colors or blues tend to look like glare spots or cloud reflections, or completely blend in with the environment,\u201d Livingston said in the email. In 18 inches of lake water, the tests showed that bright neon colors \u2013 including neon orange, yellow and green \u2013 were most visible against the lake bottom, but neon pink did not perform well. White swimsuits appeared more due to reflecting light, but not as much as the bright neon colors. All other colors were not very visible. Overall, Livingston said, neons won for visibility in all environments. \u201cWe have heard from so many parents that said they had their kid in a bright-colored swimsuit and the color caught their attention out of the corner of their eye and they responded to prevent a drowning event,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cOf course, the color of the suit doesn\u2019t matter if no one is supervising effectively, but it can and does help in partnership with effective supervision and other layers of water safety prevention.\u201d Layers of water safety It certainly makes sense that bright swimsuit colors can play a role in making a child more visible in the water in case of an emergency, but there isn\u2019t \u201creal-world evidence\u201d that having a child in a neon bathing suit leads to better outcomes in a drowning event, said Dr. Maneesha Agarwal, an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Emory University School of Medicine. \u201cThe goal is that you never have to even rely on your child\u2019s bathing suit color to find them in a drowning event at all,\u201d Agarwal said, adding that appropriate water safety includes various layers of protection. \u201cOther important layers include making sure your child is water-competent \u2013 so that means swim lessons. Making sure your child has good supervision whenever they are in the water, which means that the parents or a designated adult is watching the child in the water,\u201d she said, adding that it is important to look out for signs of drowning. Unlike how drowning is portrayed in the movies \u2013 with loud splashing and screams for help \u2013 drowning events in the real world occur silently and quickly, Agarwal said. \u201cThe child that\u2019s drowning, they\u2019re not going to be yelling for help. They are typically going to be struggling to keep their face above water level, so you might see their face kind of going up and down above the water level. And it really can only take 30 to 60 seconds before they\u2019re completely submerged,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cYou also want to make sure that you are doing everything you can to prevent your child from getting into the water unsupervised. That means if you have a pool, wherever you live or wherever you are visiting, making sure there\u2019s appropriate four-sided pool fencing that keeps children from accessing the pool,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then if the unthinkable happens, making sure that you are prepared \u2013 you know how to perform CPR, and you are able to rapidly call 911, and if you happen to be near an open body of water in particular, life jackets are imperative.\u201d The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data last month showing that accidental drowning rates are on the rise in the United States. The new numbers show that more than 4,500 people drowned each year between 2020 and 2022, which is about 500 more\u00a0drowning\u00a0deaths each year compared with the previous year in 2019. Children especially are at high risk, as drowning\u00a0is the number-one cause of death for children 1-4 years old in the United States. But some studies have shown that participating in formal swimming lessons is associated with an 88% reduced risk of drowning in young children, said Chris DeJong, founder and president of Big Blue Swim School, which offers swimming lessons to children. He added that wearing bright-colored swimsuits is just one tool in a toolbox of many steps children can take to be safer while in or around a swimming pool. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends swim lessons as a layer of protection against drowning and says they can start for many children as early as 1. \u201cStarting at that very early age can help make them more comfortable as we start to get into more advanced lessons when they\u2019re older \u2013 so they\u2019re not starting from scratch and having to overcome a fear of something brand new, which can be challenging with swim lessons,\u201d DeJong said. \u201cSwim lessons are the most important tool to help kids save themselves and know what to do in an emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd know your risk factors. Younger children, typically under the age of 10, are most commonly drowning victims in residential pools, whereas drowning victims over the age of 14 are typically in natural bodies of water.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/swimsuit-color-pool-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and the (levels of xylitol) went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d as the xylitol levels did, said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products.

{"id": "2024_06_10_health_plant-based-junk-food-study-wellness", "text": "Want to reduce your risk of developing chronic disease and live longer while also helping the planet? Eat a plant-based diet, experts say. Does that mean you can fill your plate with boxed macaroni and cheese, deep-dish frozen veggie pizza or fast-food French fries and have a doughnut or three for dessert? While all of those ultraprocessed choices may be meat-free, they are not without risk, said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston Medical School in Birmingham, United Kingdom. \u201cWe can\u2019t always assume plant-based means healthy, as after all sugar is plant-based,\u201d Mellor said in a statement. \u201cMany foods that do not contain animal products, which includes biscuits, crisps, confectionary and soft drinks, are technically plant-based but would not be considered essential as part of a healthy diet by the majority of people.\u201d In fact, eating such plant-based junk foods dramatically raises bad cholesterol and hypertension and can lead to associated heart disease and early death, according to a new study authors call \u201cthe first\u201d to show ultraprocessed plant foods are associated with an increase in the risk of cardiovascular diseases. \u201cEating plant-based products can be beneficial, acting as protection against health problems, or it can represent a risk \u2014 it all depends on the level of processing of these foods,\u201d said senior study author Renata Levy, a researcher in the Epidemiological Research Center in Nutrition and Health at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, known as Nupens/USP, in Brazil. Ultraprocessed foods undergo multiple industrial processes, such as heating, fracking of nutrients and proteins, molding and compression, and have added chemicals to cosmetically alter color, smell, taste and texture. Foods in this category are formulated to be hyper-palatable to human taste buds and are often extremely convenient, requiring little to no preparation time. Unprocessed foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs and milk.\u00a0Minimally processed foods\u00a0include culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils, and foods such as canned goods and frozen vegetables that combine culinary ingredients with unprocessed foods. \u201cFood additives and industrial contaminants present in these foods might cause oxidative stress and inflammation, further aggravating the risks,\u201d said first author Fernanda Rauber, a researcher with Nupens/USP. \u201cTherefore, our results support the shift towards plant-based food choices that consider the degree of processing to improve cardiovascular health outcomes,\u201d Rauber said in a statement. Eat fresh and frozen minimally processed plants The study, published Monday in the journal The Lancet Regional Health \u2014 Europe, utilized data collected from the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study that includes participants from England, Scotland and Wales. More than 118,000 people between the ages of 40 and 69 years answered questions about their diet. That information was later linked to hospital and mortality records on the development of cardiovascular risk factors. Ultraprocessed foods made from plants increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by 5% while increasing the risk of early death by 13%, the study found. Researchers also found that each 10% replacement of plant-based ultraprocessed foods with fresh, frozen or minimally processed plants lowered the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 7% while offering a 13% reduction in the risk of dying from heart disease. The study also looked at plant-based meat products, such as sausages, nuggets and burgers, which by their very nature fall into the ultraprocessed bucket. However, it was hard to determine just how much risk those foods carried, said Peter Scarborough, a professor of population health at the University of Oxford in the UK. He was not involved in the study. \u201cPlant-based meat alternatives make up only 0.5% of all the plant-based ultraprocessed foods included in this paper,\u201d Scarborough said in a statement. Over half of the plant-based ultraprocessed foods studied in the paper were packaged breads, pastries, buns, cakes and cookies. \u201cIt is therefore very difficult to conclude from this paper that plant-based meat alternatives are bad for your health,\u201d Scarborough added. In addition, much of what is reported in the paper is already known, said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt is well accepted that well-balanced plant-based diets such as the Mediterranean or DASH diets are favorable for cardiovascular health and these already emphasize avoiding unhealthy foods such as crisps etc., sugar sweetened beverages, cakes, biscuits and confectionary,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThese latter foods are unhealthy regardless of whether they are made industrially or home-made.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/plant-based-junk-food-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

Despite living in the light-filled streets of central London, my smartphone camera picked up a green haze and a pulsing sheet of purple and pink light. Capturing the moment was an unforgettable experience and one that I had thought would involve expensive travel to the northernmost reaches of our planet. The storms that create spectacular auroras such as those I witnessed originate from the sun\u2019s dynamic magnetic field, an astrophysical enigma that scientists this week came closer to unraveling. Solar update Figuring out how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works will help scientists improve the forecasting of space weather, which dazzles night sky watchers but can disrupt GPS and communication satellites. The sun\u2019s looping magnetic field lines, which form a tangled web of structures more complex than those on Earth, are difficult to study directly. To grasp what\u2019s going on, scientists create mathematical models. A new model, which took more than a decade to develop and required a NASA supercomputer to conduct the detailed calculations, found that the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated much closer to the surface than previously thought. The team believes its model is more accurate because it accounts for a unique solar feature. A long time ago A single gold earring found in the ruins of a 2,000-year-old building in the Pyrenees is a clue to how a devastating fire may have started. The inferno consumed the wooden structure, situated in an Iron Age settlement called Tossal de Baltarga, and killed six animals penned in a stable. Archaeologists believe the fire was deliberate. Had it been accidental, the building\u2019s owners likely would have released the livestock and returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden gold, which was concealed in a jar. The arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic, according to the new study. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but the excavation uncovered telling details of the lives of an Iberian people called the Cerretani. Sky watch The builders of Stonehenge placed the huge stones that make up the prehistoric monument in line with sunrise and sunset on the longest and shortest days of the year, revealing an intimate understanding of the sun that\u2019s still palpable today. But does the 4,500-year-old site in southwest England \u2014 and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world \u2014 also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge has a lunar link first gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored \u2014 until now. This summer, archaeologists are using the lunar standstill, a little-known phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years, to investigate. Across the universe Space scientists have observed the edge of a black hole \u2014 an area known as the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 for the first time. Andrew Mummery, lead author of a new study on black holes and a research fellow at the University of Oxford, compared it to \u201cthe edge of a waterfall\u201d at the end of a river, where orbiting material from nearby stars plummets into the abyss. In the plunging region, matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead hurtles into the black hole. But unlike at the black hole\u2019s event horizon, or surface, light can still escape at this point. The study\u2019s findings, which Albert Einstein predicted, could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes.

Researchers working with Eurasian jays trained to find food hidden under cups said these birds may be capable of the feat of memory. In the experiment, which involved decorated cups, the jays were able to remember what a particular cup looked like, even after the cups were rearranged and a time delay.

{"id": "2024_06_02_health_anxiety-positive-energy-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014  Tossing and turning in the wee hours. A low but constant buzzing in the brain that thwarts concentration. A feeling of tense restlessness. Most have experienced this sort of anxiety \u2014 not clinical anxiety, which might result in a full-on panic attack, but the run-of-the-mill kind that leaves you feeling uncomfortable. \u201cAnxiety is this simple definition: that feeling of fear or worry that comes in situations of uncertainty,\u201d neuroscientist Dr. Wendy Suzuki\u00a0recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life. \u201cThat\u2019s my simplistic definition of everyday anxiety.\u201d That experience is not pleasant. \u201cThe general feeling is, \u2018I just want to get rid of it,\u2019\u201d said Suzuki, a professor of neural science and psychology at New York University as well as dean of the school\u2019s College of Arts and Science. She is also the author of \u201cGood Anxiety: Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion.\u201d \u201cThe misunderstanding is that it is valuable,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning system that we all need. It is a tool that helps us figure out what we hold dear. If we don\u2019t have that, I think something important will be taken away from our lives.\u201d You can listen more on how anxiety can be good here. Suzuki explained how anxiety evolved to protect us. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that in this day and age,\u201d she said. But 2.5 million years ago, \u201can ancestor with a little baby (was) walking around trying to find food, and there\u2019s a crack of a twig and that could either be \u2026 a big animal coming to eat her or it could be the crack of a twig.\u00a0She better be ready, or we\u2019re not going to have any ancestors after her.\u201d The crack of the twig left her anxious but alert to danger. \u201cAnd then her body is (in) the fight-or-flight response,\u201d she said. \u201cThat same response, including all of the fight-or-flight (reaction), gets activated when we look at the news, when we look at social media, at what\u2019s going on today,\u201d she said. \u201cOur heart rates are going up, our respiration rates are going off \u2014 that is not good physiologically for us. And so \u2026\u00a0that is your No. 1 reason to learn how to modulate that stress response.\u201d The first step toward getting to \u201cgood\u201d anxiety, Suzuki said, is learning how to lower your level of everyday anxiety. So, what can you do to ratchet it down? Here are Suzuki\u2019s top five tips: Take a deep breath Practice breath meditation. \u201cBreath meditation is the oldest form of meditation and can be so effective in really calming ourselves down \u2014 and immediately,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cThat\u2019s my No. 1 go-to for people who say, \u2018I just need something right now.\u2019\u201d One calming pattern is box breathing. To do it, inhale deeply for four counts, hold for four counts, exhale for four counts and hold again for four counts. \u201cRepeat to calm your mind and body,\u201d she said. Get moving Go for a short walk, Suzuki recommended. \u201cDid you know that just 10 minutes of walking can significantly reduce anxiety and depression levels in people? You don\u2019t even have to change your clothes to get that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat that\u2019s doing is stimulating the release of neurotransmitters that don\u2019t necessarily decrease your anxiety, but they increase your feelings of reward and happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cThose neurotransmitters that go up include dopamine and serotonin and noradrenaline and endorphins.\u00a0Every single time you move your body, it\u2019s like giving your brain a wonderful bubble bath of neurochemicals, and it works immediately.\u201d Reframe your anxiety Turn anxiety-inducing situations into personal challenges to foster growth and resilience \u2014 and enjoy the newness of uncertain circumstances. Paraphrasing Deepak Chopra, Suzuki recommended embracing uncertainty because it can make life interesting to live. \u201cIn my life, the uncertainty can be something that brings excitement, can bring joy. Not all the time, but maybe you can take part of that and embrace it as something useful,\u201d she said. For example, she said, \u201cIf the same thing happened every single time I went on vacation, that would not be a fun vacation. I like the newness; I like learning new things and being exposed to new things. And I can\u2019t control that by definition.\u201d Spin straw into gold Turn your worry into action. To enhance productivity and reduce worry, transform your anxious what-if list into a productive to-do list, Suzuki advised. \u201cI like to say that there are gifts that come with your anxiety,\u201d she said, citing what often happens to her right before she goes to sleep. \u201cI have this worry list that hits me right before I\u2019m going to go to sleep. And so what do I do? I turn that what-if list into a to-do list,\u201d she said. \u201cI just say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to remember these things, so Wendy, you can go to sleep now.\u2019 But the next morning I go and take all those things that made me not sleep the night before, and I go do something about them. \u2026 In that way, I make myself more productive. And I use my anxiety as the tool that it\u2019s supposed to (be).\u201d Practice compassion Support others, Suzuki said, letting them know they are not alone. \u201cReach out with a kind word to someone experiencing similar anxiety,\u201d she said, noting that some people feel shame about being anxious over a certain situation. \u201cThis simple act can release dopamine and improve your own mood.\u201d We hope these five tips help you turn your anxiety into something more productive.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_what-to-know-about-the-supreme-courts-ruling-allowing-mifepristone-to-stay-on-the-market", "text": "The Supreme Court\u00a0unanimously rejected a lawsuit on Thursday challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone, allowing the drug to stay on the market. The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Though technical, the court\u2019s reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. Medication abortion\u00a0accounts for nearly two-thirds of all US abortions, according to some estimates.\u00a0The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 as part of a two-drug regimen to end a pregnancy, and it has been shown to be safe and effective. The pill is also often prescribed for miscarriage treatment. Here\u2019s what to know about the ruling: Plaintiffs had no standing The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the opinion, said the parties do not have standing \u201csimply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities \u2014 at least without the plaintiffs demonstrating how they would be injured by the government\u2019s alleged under-regulation of others.\u201d Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone \u2014 the first drug in the medication abortion process \u2014 is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. Biden blames GOP for allowing challenge to abortion access President Joe Biden cast blame on Republicans for the very existence of the case, taking aim at GOP elected officials\u2019 \u201cextreme and dangerous agenda\u201d on reproductive rights. Biden has worked to make protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid. Meantime, former President Donald Trump cautioned Republicans not to go too far on abortion in a meeting with the House GOP conference. The big picture Access to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. The ruling is a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement. But the court\u2019s technical reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. Much of the opinion covered the various legal thresholds a plaintiff must reach to make it appropriate for courts to intervene in a dispute. In addition, the Supreme Court is yet to release a decision on a case related to abortions in health emergencies. The justices will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have\u00a0strict bans on abortion.

{"id": "2024_06_11_health_bird-flu-animals-humans", "text": "Mark Naniot remembers 2022 as the summer from hell. As the co-founder of Wild Instincts animal rescue in Wisconsin\u2019s Northwoods, Naniot and his team spent the season sweating in gloves, gowns, smocks and masks and going through what felt like endless rounds of disinfection as they moved between the cages of the sick and injured animals they cared for. The precautions were necessary for a trio of infectious diseases occurring with some frequency in wild animals that summer: Covid-19 was still making life difficult, and a devastating contagion called chronic wasting disease was showing up in deer in the area. Then, there was H5N1 bird flu to contend with.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s highly, highly transmissible,\u201d said Naniot, who has been involved in animal rescue for 35 years. Since it was first discovered in birds in 1996, H5N1 has shown itself to be a Swiss Army Knife of a virus, evolving the necessary tools to break into the cells of a growing list of species.\u00a0So far, it has infected and killed millions of wild and farmed birds.\u00a0It\u2019s also been found in at least 26 different kinds of mammals, including, most recently in the United States \u2014 cows, cats and house mice. The voraciousness of the virus prompted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization in April to call it \u201ca global zoonotic animal pandemic.\u201d Along the way, people have been a kind of collateral damage. Humans can be infected, but we aren\u2019t really the intended targets. That could all change quickly, however. \u201cInfluenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors don\u2019t always work in favor of the virus.\u00a0Most of the time, viruses with errors won\u2019t work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive.\u00a0But every once in a while, a random error can result in a change to the virus that give it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow. If humans happen to be that environment, and H5N1 changes at the right place at the right time, suddenly the animal pandemic could become a major problem for people, too. Naniot had seen wild birds come into Wild Instincts rescue with H5N1 \u2014 bald eagles, hawks and owls \u2014 but nothing had prepared him for the red fox kits. The baby foxes were brought in stumbling and uncoordinated, making him think they might have gotten into some kind of poison. Then the seizures started. \u201cThey would have these severe, severe seizures,\u201d Naniot said. \u201cScreaming very loud, whole-body tremors.\u201d The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. \u201cAnd then it would get longer and longer and longer,\u201d he said. Naniot hadn\u2019t known his young patients could get bird flu. Further research clued him in to the fact that foxes had recently joined a growing list of species that could succumb, usually after eating the flesh of infected dead birds. \u201cThe severity of the seizures is something I really hadn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Naniot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad thing to see, the progression of the disease.\u201d Risks to humans Though H5N1 is known to have infected nearly 900 people in the past 30 years, these infections have been sporadic and usually self-limiting. The virus can still be deadly, however: More than 50% of people who are known to have been infected with H5N1 have died. Still, the virus isn\u2019t particularly good at infecting humans. Even when virus manages to get into a person and cause symptoms, it rarely gets passed to someone else. \u201cWe call these dead-end infections,\u201d said Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinarian and expert in zoonotic infections, at the University of Guelph in Canada. The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in.\u00a0 But it is not a virus that\u2019s well-adapted to humans, so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions \u2014 the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs \u2014 which would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath. There have been at least three of these have apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who worked closely with infected milk cows.\u00a0Two of the workers developed conjunctivitis, or eye infections.  In one case, the worker reported getting splashed with raw milk in their eyes. A third developed respiratory symptoms after close contact with cows.\u00a0All were successfully treated with an antiviral medication.\u00a0None developed severe symptoms or infected others. Using a strain of H5N1 from the recent cattle outbreak, scientists recently confirmed that this version of the virus is unlikely to transmit through the air. In experiments with ferrets, which are considered the gold standard for studying how viruses transmit in people, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew a sample of the same H5N1 virus taken from a farmworker with the flu in Texas to experimentally infect six of the animals.\u00a0Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals.\u00a0These animals could touch, nose and lick the sick animals, and all of them became ill. Next, the CDC tested airborne transmission by putting three healthy ferrets into an enclosure where they could breathe the same air as sick animals but couldn\u2019t touch them.\u00a0 Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. So far, that seems to be what\u2019s happening in the real world, too.\u00a0 Though more than 80 dairy herds have tested positive across at least 12 states, the number of human infections has apparently been low, though there\u2019s been little testing to confirm that. These early ferret experiments are good news, the CDC noted, because it means the virus would need to change to become an infection spread person-to-person through the airborne droplets. The agency said it plans to repeat the tests. As Covid has shown, all of this could change in the the rub of an eye or a small cough. The more opportunity the virus has to spread, the more opportunity it has to change in ways that will help it pry its way into human cells. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand everything we know today is a snapshot of today, and these viruses can change very quickly,\u201d said Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and former director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the Chasing Life podcast. \u201cThey can adapt, and they can spread very easily when they do change,\u201d said Bright, who is now CEO of Bright Global Health.  Dr. Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says that while humans have been exposed to seasonal strains of the flu, and flu vaccines help build immunity H1 and H3 flu strains, H5N1 would look pretty different to our bodies. \u201cOur existing immunity to H3 and H1 is not necessarily going to protect us against exposure to an H5 virus,\u201d she said. The CDC\u2019s ferret study also had some sobering findings.\u00a0 In contrast to seasonal flu, which makes ferrets sick, but doesn\u2019t kill them, H5N1 killed all the ferrets that were infected. \u201cWhile the three cases of A(H5N1) in the United States have been mild, it is possible that there will be serious illnesses among people,\u201d the CDC wrote in its conclusions on the study. In the more than two dozen human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide since 2022, with the most recent iteration of the virus, there\u2019s been a wide spectrum of severity.\u00a0Fourteen illnesses were severe or critical, seven were fatal, six were mild and eight didn\u2019t have any symptoms at all, according to the CDC. Dr. Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist and immunologist at Emory University who specializes in the flu, thinks the difference in symptom severity may be due to previous exposure to seasonal viruses. Her experiments in ferrets suggest that our bodies wouldn\u2019t necessarily be totally defenseless.\u00a0 In her lab, ferrets with previous exposures to seasonal flu strains didn\u2019t get as sick when exposed to new flu viruses compared to those with no prior exposure to seasonal strains.\u00a0 She says she hasn\u2019t tested this with any of the strains involved in the cattle outbreak, however. So while we probably don\u2019t have any antibodies\u00a0\u2014 the immune system\u2019s front-line soldiers \u2014 at the ready to fight off an H5 infection, there are memory cells in our tissues that might recognize parts of a new flu virus and respond. How much help we might get from past exposures to flu viruses is difficult to predict, however, which is why vaccination would still be important to tune up our immunity. Plans to stop the virus from spreading The US has vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, and last month, government officials said 4.8 million doses are being\u00a0\u201cfilled and finished\u201d so they would be ready for use, though there\u2019s no plan to give them to anyone yet. Finland has already ordered 20,000 doses of a different H5 strain \u2014 H5N8 \u2014 which, will be used as soon as they\u2019re available to protect workers who might be vulnerable to the virus, such as scientists and those in direct contact with infected animals\u00a0on mink farms, local\u00a0officials told\u00a0health and science news outlet,\u00a0STAT News. For now, the CDC maintains its assessment that the risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, though people who work with infected animals have a higher risk and should wear protective clothing and take additional precautions to avoid getting sick. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, has made that protective equipment available to states for use on farms, and the USDA has made additional funding available to farms to support efforts to safeguard their livestock from disease. But so far, wearing this equipment is voluntary, and there are concerns that it might be difficult for farm workers to wear the full recommended kit, which includes coveralls, an apron, a mask, eye protection, a head covering, gloves and boots during the summer, which is again expected to break heat records. The government has also said it is working on the development of a rapid test for H5N1. Bright thinks severity of symptoms may depend on how much virus a person is exposed to when they are infected. Touching contaminated milk or the body of a dead bird and then\u00a0rubbing your eyes or nose might deliver a smaller dose of the virus, and ultimately result in milder symptoms. Whereas ingesting large amount of virus \u2014 as some animals do when they scavenge for food or as humans in some countries do when consuming dishes made with duck blood \u2014 could lead to severe disease. \u201cThe virus is able to infect a number of internal organs. So it doesn\u2019t just locate, say, in the lungs, as we would think most influenza viruses would,\u201d Bright said. It\u2019s also been found in \u201cthe brains and then the spleens, the intestines, and the heart and throughout the body of those animals.\u201d Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the WHO\u2019s Collaborating Centre on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s at the top of the list in terms of bad guy viruses,\u201d he said, noting that the virus is nerve-loving, or neurotropic. \u201cSo it goes to the brain and causes very, very severe disease.\u201d Infected animals often behave strangely or aggressively.\u00a0Ducks waddle in circles, twisting their necks, writhing on the ground. \u201cI would hate to see it in humans,\u201d Webby said. So far, the virus hasn\u2019t made the changes that would enable it to become a fully human pathogen, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear whether it ever will. \u201cI\u2019ve been a student of this virus. And I surely have been amazed at how it\u2019s changed over the course of the last 20-some years, but at the same time, you know, I\u2019m looking for evidence that it is likely to become a virus infecting humans and then transmitted by humans to other humans. And we just haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d he added. Naniot at the Wisconsin animal rescue said they tried to save about seven infected fox kits in the summer of 2022, but all of them died. Other rescue organizations in their network had a few foxes infected with H5N1 that survived, but they ultimately went blind. While all the precautions they took to safely work with the animals were arduous, Naniot said he\u2019s grateful they were effective. They never spread the virus to any of the other animals in the facility \u2014 including themselves. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s kind of like when Covid went through, you know, it first started someplace,\u201d he said. Naniot says he hasn\u2019t encountered any infected animals since 2022, but he\u2019s watching the news closely in case any cow herds become infected in Wisconsin, knowing that he could easily see H5N1 again. \u201cIt spread kind of like wildfire, and it\u2019s a highly, highly contagious disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/bird-flu-animals-humans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_07_health_alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Looking back, Tammy Maida, 67, said things started to change in her late 50s. At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_illegal-e-cigarettes-new-task-force", "text": "Federal health officials are partnering with the US Department of Justice to fight the illegal sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. The US Food and Drug Administration and Justice Department announced Monday that they are creating a task force to target the issue. The task force will include people from the US Marshals Service, US Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies to identify and target illegal sales and distribution of e-cigarettes. \u201cUnauthorized e-cigarettes and vaping products continue to jeopardize the health of Americans \u2013 particularly children and adolescents \u2013 across the country,\u201d Benjamin Mizer, the acting associate attorney general with the Justice Department, said in a news release Monday. \u201cThis interagency Task Force is dedicated to protecting Americans by combatting the unlawful sale and distribution of these products,\u201d Mizer said. \u201cAnd the establishment of this Task Force makes clear that vigorous enforcement of the tobacco laws is a government-wide priority.\u201d While the FDA has authorized the sale of 23 specific tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices to date, several unauthorized e-cigarettes have emerged illegally on the market, some of which appeal to minors. More than 1 in 10 young adults in the United States regularly use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey found that about 2.1 million youth reported currently using e-cigarettes. Under current regulations, new tobacco products must receive marketing authorization from the FDA before they can be sold; pre-existing e-cigarette products have been allowed to remain on the market, but the agency has asked\u00a0manufacturers to submit applications to keep them there. The new federal task force will hone in on several issues, \u201cincluding investigating and prosecuting new criminal, civil, seizure and forfeiture actions,\u201d according to the news release, and violations \u201ccan result in felony convictions and significant criminal fines and civil monetary penalties,\u201d as well as the seizures of unauthorized products. \u201cEnforcement against illegal e-cigarettes is a multi-pronged issue that necessitates a multi-pronged response,\u201d Dr. Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in the news release. \u201cThis \u2018All Government\u2019 approach \u2013 including the creation of this new Task Force - will bring the collective resources and experience of the federal government to bear on this pressing public health issue.\u201d The creation of this new task force comes after the FDA has issued more than 1,100 warning letters to several distributors, manufacturers, importers and retailers for illegally selling or distributing unauthorized tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. In December, the FDA announced seizing about 1.4 million units of unauthorized e-cigarette products. \u201cThe U.S. Marshals Service Asset Forfeiture Division stands ready to work with our Task Force partners in the seizure of unauthorized e-cigarettes from domestic distributors seeking to sell them unlawfully,\u201d Ronald Davis, director of the US Marshals Service, said in Monday\u2019s news release. Meanwhile, the American Lung Association has announced that it applauds the launch of the new federal task force. \u201cFor too long, manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers have acted without regard for the law or public health. The Lung Association has urged enhanced law enforcement actions be taken to hold manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors accountable for selling illegal tobacco products and to protect the public health, especially children\u2019s health,\u201d Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement Monday. He added that youth vaping is a \u201cserious\u201d public health concern. \u201cMany of the illegal e-cigarettes currently on the market are flavored products, which attract youth,\u201d Wimmer said in part. \u201cThe American Lung Association commends the DOJ, FDA and other agencies involved in this task force. Ongoing and coordinated enforcement is necessary to remove the illegal and addictive tobacco products from the market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/illegal-e-cigarettes-new-task-force/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

The JN.1 version of the virus, along with its descendants KP.2 and KP.3 are the most common strain of the virus that are getting people sick right now,\u00a0according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA\u2019s\u00a0committee of independent advisers\u00a0voted unanimously Wednesday to recommend that the agency tell vaccine manufacturers to update the Covid-19 shots for the fall. The FDA told the advisory committee Wednesday that studies have shown that the currently available\u00a0Covid-19 vaccines appear to be less effective against the variants that are now in circulation. When manufacturers updated their vaccines last year to better match the variants that were in circulation then, the reformulated vaccines seemed to offer better protection, the FDA said. Covid-19 cases are relatively low right now. Only 3% to 4% of people who are getting tested are positive for the virus,\u00a0the CDC told the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisers this week. By comparison during the height of the pandemic, rates were at 30%. Hospitalization rates are also currently the lowest they have been since March 2020, the CDC told the committee. Many people in the US have some protection against the virus through vaccination or prior infection, but that protection wanes over time. In just the fall and winter months last season,\u00a0Covid sent more than half a million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000 people, according to data presented at the meeting. The people most likely to get seriously ill or die were unvaccinated, studies show, and among\u00a0the children who were hospitalized, half had no underlying conditions. Covid vaccine makers Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax said their new products should be ready by the fall. The challenge may now be on how to convince people to get the Covid-19 vaccine.

{"id": "2024_03_25_health_mifepristone-abortion-pill-explained", "text": "Mifepristone can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor after the US Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit that challenged regulation of the abortion pill. Mifepristone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration decades ago and has been shown to be safe and effective. Anti-abortion advocates have claimed that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn\u2019t study it enough to approve it. A lawsuit was brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations alleged that the FDA violated the law in\u00a0how it regulated mifepristone. If a 5th\u00a0Circuit ruling had been upheld, it could have ended availability of mifepristone for medication abortion via telehealth, which would have affected abortion access \u2014 even in states where it\u2019s legal. The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. The court\u2019s reasoning could still allow other mifepristone challenges in the future. How mifepristone works Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery. Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it\u2019s sometimes known as RU-486. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period. This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show. How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country\u2019s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, that signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the FDA. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone\u2019s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show. Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra \u2013 used to treat erectile dysfunction \u2013 is nearly 10 times higher. Side effects of mifepristone Mifepristone usually doesn\u2019t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA. Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are \u201cexceedingly rare,\u201d happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations\u2019 amicus brief. How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, shows that this option has become steadily more common over the two decades it\u2019s been available, rising from less than 10% of all abortions in the US in 2001 to 53% in 2020 and 63% in 2023. Misoprostol on its own No matter the status of mifepristone,\u00a0misoprostol would still be available\u00a0and could be used for a medication abortion on its own. The only use of misoprostol that\u2019s approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it \u201coff-label\u201d by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor. Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a \u201creasonable\u201d option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective. This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization. People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, previously told CNN. \u201cMisoprostol still works very well and is very safe,\u201d Wong said. \u201cMifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.\u201d CNN\u2019s Devan Cole and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/25/health/mifepristone-abortion-pill-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added. Other finds at the site, which sits on the slope of a valley, include buildings, pits, ditches and a road that archaeologists dated to the late 5th and early 6th centuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/europe/horses-remains-graves-france-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_health_dual-mutant-drug-resistant-flu-variant", "text": "A rare flu variant that has shown some resistance to the most commonly used antiviral treatment has been detected in at least two people in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, but this variant has two concerning mutations in places that could lower the effectiveness of treatment with oseltamivir phosphate, known by the brand name Tamiflu. \u201cThere\u2019s active global surveillance going on looking for these mutations,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cWe want to know when they come up, because that could really have major implications for how we treat influenza.\u201d For now, though, experts say the threat is low. Cases of the \u201cdual mutant\u201d influenza variant were identified in 15 countries across five continents, including two cases in the US, according to a report published Wednesday in the CDC\u2019s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. But they\u2019re very infrequent, representing only about 1% of the samples collected between May 2023 and February 2024. \u201cThey appear in a lot of places, but they\u2019re never really the dominant virus in any place they appear,\u201d Pekosz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the mutation occurred someplace, and suddenly that particular virus began spreading and out-competing everything in one big wave,\u201d he said. Instead, the same mutations seem to be developing in multiple places independently. The doubly mutated variant has shown a reduction in Tamiflu effectiveness of up to 16-fold, according to the CDC report \u2013 but that\u2019s based on laboratory studies. Other influenza variants have shown much greater resistance in the lab, and there\u2019s no gauge for what this could mean in real-life clinical practice, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know really what the clinical significance of this slight resistance is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may well be that the amount of Tamiflu that we give patients is sufficient to overcome this.\u201d Laboratory testing suggests that other antiviral treatments \u2013 including a newer antiviral called baloxavir marboxil, or Xofluza \u2013 are still effective against the dual mutants, according to the CDC. And flu vaccines should offer protection against infections caused by viruses with the mutations, too. \u201cThere are no immediate implications with regard to clinical care decisions,\u201d the CDC said in an emailed statement. \u201cCDC is continuously monitoring the antiviral susceptibility of circulating seasonal influenza viruses in the U.S. and worldwide, along with global partners.

{"id": "2024_06_12_health_senate-hearing-fda-flavored-vapes", "text": "Republicans and Democrats on the US Senate Judiciary Committee showed rare agreement Wednesday as they took to task the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Justice for what they described as inaction on the country\u2019s youth vaping epidemic. Nearly three years ago, a federal court ruled that the FDA was violating the Tobacco Control Act by allowing e-cigarette products that did not have FDA pre-authorization to stay on the market. An FDA official testified Wednesday that the topic was a \u201ctop priority,\u201d but the agency has missed the September 2021 deadline that the court set to for the agency to complete its review of e-cigarette makers\u2019 applications to sell their products. Since that time, one study found, an estimated 2.1 million children have used e-cigarettes regularly, and the majority use flavored products. \u201cAfter the court-ordered deadline passed on September 9, 2021, the FDA could have ordered every single unauthorized e-cigarette off the market, and that\u2019s what it should have done,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, told Dr. Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cInstead, thousands of unauthorized e-cigarettes flooded the market.\u201d In fact, Durbin said, his staffers found vapes in flavors like Red Bull, strawberry, dragonfruit and watermelon bubble gum at a shop just a mile from FDA headquarters. \u201cNot a single one of these products has been authorized by the FDA. None of them. These illegal products, clearly designed for kids by their flavors, are being sold\u201d even in the shadow of FDA headquarters, he said. Placing one of the products in front of him, Durbin asked how the FDA could let such sales happen. \u201cThe volume of those applications and the volume of the market requires us to prioritize our enforcement efforts,\u201d King testified. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, also told the representatives from the FDA and the Department of Justice that she was displeased. \u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing to hear you kind of talk in circles about what you are planning to do, but you haven\u2019t established a plan, and you\u2019re not certain what your way forward is going to be,\u201d she said. King said the FDA has received 27 million applications for e-cigarette products. But unlike with companies that make drugs and medical devices, which pay user fees that fund the agency\u2019s work, the FDA is not allowed to\u00a0collect fees from e-cigarette makers. King asked the Senate committee for the authority to fund this increased workload. \u201cThe rapidly evolving tobacco product landscape presents an unprecedented time and resource challenge that no other center at FDA has ever faced,\u201d King said. Since June, the FDA has authorized only 23 e-cigarette products \u2013 none of them flavored \u2013 and has denied many more. Hundreds of thousands of additional applications are still pending. From 2020 to 2023, there was a 1,500% increase in flavored tobacco products sold in the US, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. He also brought in flavored vape products that his staffers bought, including watermelon bubble gum, apple melon berry and one called Tyson Heavyweight. \u201cDr. King, those are clearly designed for consumption by children, correct?\u201d Cornyn asked. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the intent of the manufacturer, but I can say that flavors do appeal to kids. Ninety percent of youth who use e-cigarettes use flavored varieties,\u201d King testified. About 10% of high school-age adolescents and nearly 5% of middle school students use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, King said. But when they do vape, teens and young adults are much more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. \u201cMore work is definitely needed,\u201d he testified. Enforcement of the law is the other challenge, the FDA and DOJ said at the hearing. The FDA has conducted thousands of inspections of e-cigarette manufacturers and distributors resulting in nearly 900 warning letters, King said. More than 500 warning letters have gone to retail stores, King said, but if the letters are ignored that\u2019s as far as the FDA can go, so it must rely on the DOJ and other agencies. It was only this week that the FDA and several law enforcement agencies announced that they were creating a task force that will use the criminal and civil tools available to fight the illegal sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. \u201cWhat in the hell have you been waiting for?\u201d Durbin asked Arun Rao, deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch in the Department of Justice. \u201cSenator, we have been acting on a number of fronts,\u201d Rao replied. He said the Justice Department has been working with the US Marshals Service and the FDA on seizures of illegal products, but he admitted that \u201cmany manufactures have exploited the premarket authorization process.\u201d Rao testified that many manufacturers whose products have been denied FDA authorization make minimal alterations and resubmit for approval. Some overseas e-cigarette makers will also misrepresent shipments in an effort to slip past regulators, and some stores make their own products. \u201cTaken together, these factors have made illegal e-cigarettes all too accessible,\u201d Rao said. Many products come from China, but that country has banned flavored e-cigarettes, and the products are not sold in Chinese stores \u2013 a point that wasn\u2019t lost on the committee. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell them in China, but you can sell them in the United States and essentially victimize and addict our children to these nicotine delivery devices,\u201d Cornyn said. Nicotine is highly addictive and hurts kids, testified Dr. Susan Walley, immediate past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Section on Nicotine and Tobacco Prevention and Treatment. Nicotine can permanently hurt a teen\u2019s developing brain, studies show, impairing working memory and attention. Flavored products are too tempting and easy to access, said Walley, who brought with her a flavored e-cigarette product called OMG Blow Pop that she said she purchased within walking distance of a school. \u201cSimply put, this is unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need the federal government to get these illegal products off the market.\u201d Even representatives of the vaping industry testified that they were unhappy with the FDA\u2019s authorization process. \u201cThis is a hot mess right now,\u201d said Tony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association. He complained that there was no clear pathway through the approval process and said that without one, \u201cwe are going to persist in having an illicit market.\u201d A high school senior, Josie Shapiro of Seattle, told the committee that vaping products are too easy to access. She said she started vaping after several friends did. \u201cThey thought vapes were harmless because of the fun flavors and colorful packaging,\u201d Shapiro testified. Shapiro said she has tried to quit several times, but vaping has taken over her and her friends\u2019 lives. \u201cI\u2019ve felt completely out of control, helpless and alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t spend quality time with my friends without thinking about when we were going to get our next hit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/health/senate-hearing-fda-flavored-vapes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_01_09_health_live-longer-diet-wellness", "text": "You can reduce your risk of an early death for any reason by nearly 20%, just by eating more foods from your choice of four healthy eating patterns, according to a new study. People who more carefully followed any of the healthy eating patterns \u2014 which all share a focus on consuming more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes \u2014 were also less likely to die from cancer, cardiovascular illness, and respiratory and neurodegenerative disease.  The results of the study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, show \u201cthere is more than one way to eat well and derive the attendant health benefits,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a lifestyle medicine specialist who was not involved in the study. People often get bored with one way of eating, study coauthor Dr. Frank Hu said, \u201cso this is good news. It means that we have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating our own healthy dietary patterns that can be tailored to individual food preferences, health conditions and cultures. \u201cFor example, if you are eating healthy Mediterranean, and after a few months you want to try something different, you can switch to a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet or you can switch to a semi-vegetarian diet,\u201d said Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology and chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cOr you can follow US dietary guidelines and create your own healthy eating plate.\u201d A long-term study The study followed the eating habits of 75,000 women participating in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and more than 44,000 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study over 36 years. None of the men and women had cardiovascular disease at the start of the study, and few were smokers. All filled out eating questionnaires every four years. \u201cThis is one of the largest and longest-running cohort studies to examine recommended dietary patterns and the long-term risk of premature deaths and deaths from major diseases,\u201d Hu said. Hu and his team scored participants on how closely they followed four healthy eating styles that are in sync with current US dietary guidelines.  One is the Mediterranean diet, which stresses eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish and a high amount of olive oil, Hu said. \u201cThis dietary pattern emphasizes healthy fats, especially monounsaturated fat, in addition to plant-based foods and moderate alcohol,\u201d he said. The next is called the healthful plant-based diet, which also focuses on eating more plant products but gives negative points for all animal products and any alcohol. \u201cIt even discourages relatively healthy options, like fish or some dairy products,\u201d Hu said, adding that the eating plan frowns on unhealthy plant-based foods such as potato products. \u201cSo you can imagine that vegetarians are probably on the higher end of this diet score,\u201d he said, \u201cand people who eat a lot of animal products or highly processed carbohydrate foods would be at the lower end of this score.\u201d The Healthy Eating Index tracks whether people follow basic US nutritional guidelines, which stress healthy, plant-based foods, frown on red and processed meat, and discourage eating added sugar, unhealthy fats and alcohol, Hu said. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index was developed at Harvard, Hu said, and uses the \u201cbest available evidence\u201d to include foods and nutrients most strongly associated with a lower risk of chronic disease. \u201cWe explicitly included nuts, seeds, whole grains and lower consumption of red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages,\u201d he added. \u201cA moderate consumption of alcohol is allowed.\u201d  Findings by disease After each person\u2019s eating pattern was scored, the participants were divided into five groups, or quintiles, from highest to lowest adherence to one or more of the eating patterns.  \u201cThe highest quintile of diet quality as compared to the lowest was associated with a roughly 20% reduction in all-cause mortality,\u201d said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. The study also found reductions in risk of death from certain chronic diseases if people improved their diet over time, Hu said. Participants who improved the health of their diet by 25% could reduce their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by a range of 6% to 13% and dying from cancer by 7% to 18%, he said. There was up to a 7% reduction in risk of death by neurodegenerative disease, such as dementia. \u201cRespiratory disease mortality reduction was actually much greater, reducing risk by 35% to 46%,\u201d Hu said. The study relied on participants\u2019 self-reports of food preferences and therefore only showed an association, not a direct cause and effect, between eating habits and health outcomes. Still, the fact that the study asked about diets every four years over such a long time frame added weight to the findings, Hu said. What is the takeaway of this large, long-term study? \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to adopt healthy eating patterns, and the benefits of eating a healthy diet can be substantial in terms of reducing total premature deaths and different causes of premature death,\u201d Hu said. \u201cPeople also have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating their own healthy dietary pattern. But the common principles \u2014 eating more-plant based foods and fewer servings of red meat, processed meats, added sugar and sodium \u2014 should be there, no matter what kind of diet that you want to create.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/01/09/health/live-longer-diet-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_01_06_health_medication-abortion-process-wellness", "text": "Mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortions, can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor following the US Supreme Court rejection of a lawsuit challenging regulation of the abortion pill. \u201cWhile many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cA growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective,\u201d he said. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks\u2019 gestation, which is \u201c70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,\u201d according to the US Food and Drug Administration. In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.  Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. \u201cSome people do this because they cannot access a clinic \u2014 particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion \u2014 or because they have a preference for self-care,\u201d said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman\u2019s health. What happens in a medication abortion What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.  CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences? Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation. An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there\u2019s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo. The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes. Then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.  A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration. Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.  In fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled. The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.  CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion? Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed. Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.  Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription. Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator,  helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That\u2019s something people could get without a prescription. Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we\u2019re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we\u2019ve been doing more research on people\u2019s experiences with medication abortion, it\u2019s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.  CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise? Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It\u2019s rare, happening in about 2 out of every 100 pregnancies \u2014 and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion. People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization. If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill. Anyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful. People with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.  CNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion? Grossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever \u2014 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider. Heavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well. One of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it\u2019s wise to be on the lookout. We usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends. Most people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.  If someone still feels pregnant, isn\u2019t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician. People should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_crows-can-count-study-scn", "text": "Perhaps \u201cbirdbrained\u201d isn\u2019t such an insult after all \u2013\u2013 crows, the ubiquitous urban bird, can vocally count up to four, the latest research has found. Not only can the inquisitive creatures count, but they can match the number of calls they make when shown a numeral, according to a new study, led by a team of researchers with the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2019s animal physiology lab in Germany. The way the birds recognize and react to numbers is similar to a process we humans use, both to learn to count as toddlers and quickly recognize how many objects we\u2019re looking at. The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, deepen our growing understanding of crow intelligence. \u201cHumans do not have a monopoly on skills such as numerical thinking, abstraction, tool manufacture, and planning ahead,\u201d said animal cognition expert Heather Williams via email. \u201cNo one should be surprised that crows are \u2018smart.\u2019\u201d Williams, a professor of biology at Williams College in Massachusetts, was not involved in the study. In the animal kingdom, counting isn\u2019t limited to crows. Chimpanzees have been taught to count in numerical order and understand the value of numerals, much like young children. In attempting to woo mates, some male frogs count the number of calls from competing males to match or even one-up that number when it\u2019s their turn to croak at a female. Scientists have even theorized that ants retrace their paths back to their colonies by counting their steps, though the method isn\u2019t always accurate. What this latest study showed is that crows, like young humans, can learn to associate numerals with values \u2013\u2013 and count out loud accordingly. Can crows count much like toddlers do? The research was inspired by toddlers learning to count, said lead study author Diana Liao, a neurobiologist and senior researcher at the T\u00fcbingen lab. Toddlers use the words of numbers to tally the number of objects in front of them: If they see three toys in front of them, their counting could sound like \u201cone, two, three\u201d or \u201cone, one, one.\u201d Maybe crows could do the same, Liao thought. She was inspired, too, by a June 2005 study on chickadees tailoring their alarm calls to a predator\u2019s size. The larger a predator\u2019s wingspan or body length, the fewer \u201cdee\u201d sounds the chickadees used in their alarm call, the study found. The opposite was true for smaller predators \u2013\u2013 the songbirds would use more \u201cdee\u201d sounds if they encountered a smaller bird, which could be greater threats to chickadees since they are more agile, Liao said. The authors of the chickadee study couldn\u2019t confirm whether the small songbirds had control over the number of sounds they made or if the number of sounds were an involuntary response. But the possibility piqued Liao\u2019s curiosity \u2013\u2013 could crows, whose intelligence has been well-documented over decades of research, show control over their ability to produce a certain number of sounds, effectively \u201ccounting\u201d like toddlers do? The crows planned their number of caws Liao and her colleagues trained three carrion crows, a European species closely related to the American crow, over more than 160 sessions. During the trainings, the birds had to learn associations between a series of visual and auditory cues from 1 to 4 and produce the corresponding number of caws. In the example researchers provided, a visual cue might look like a bright blue numeral, and its corresponding audio could be the half-second song of a drumroll. The crows were expected to perform the same number of caws as the number represented by the cue \u2013\u2013 three caws for the cue with the numeral 3 \u2013\u2013 within 10 seconds of seeing and hearing the cue. When the birds had stopped counting and cawing, they would peck at an \u201center\u201d key on the touchscreen that presented their cues to confirm that they were done. If the birds had counted correctly, they\u2019d receive a treat. It appeared that as the cues continued, the crows took longer to react to each cue. Their reaction times grew as \u201cmore vocalizations were impending,\u201d Liao wrote, suggesting that the crows planned the number of caws they were going to make before they opened their beaks. The researchers could even tell how many calls the birds planned to make by the way their first call sounded \u2013\u2013 subtle acoustic differences that showed that the crows knew how many numbers they were looking at and had synthesized the information. \u201cThey understand abstract numbers \u2026 and then plan ahead as they match their behavior to match that number,\u201d Williams said. Even the mistakes the crows made were somewhat advanced: If the crows had cawed one too many times, stuttered over the same number or submitted their responses with their beak prematurely, Liao and her researchers could detect from the sound of the first call where they went wrong. These are the \u201csame kinds of errors humans make,\u201d Williams said. We\u2019re still learning how smart crows are Birds and many other animals were previously thought to make only on-the-spot decisions based on stimuli in their immediate environments, a theory popularized by the 20th century animal behaviorist B.F. Skinner. But the latest research by Liao and her colleagues provides more evidence about crows\u2019 ability to synthesize numbers to produce a sound and suggests that the skill is within their control. The study team\u2019s findings are highly specific but still significant \u2013\u2013 they challenge the once common belief that all animals are merely stimulus-response machines, said Kevin McGowan, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, who has spent more than two decades studying wild crows in their habitats. McGowan wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study, McGowan told CNN, demonstrated that \u201ccrows aren\u2019t just simple nonthinking machines out there reacting to their environment \u2013\u2013 they\u2019re actually thinking ahead and have the ability to communicate in a structured, preplanned way. It\u2019s sort of a necessary precursor for having a language.\u201d Crow intelligence has been studied for decades. Scientists have investigated New Caledonian crows creating their own compound tools to access food. The birds appear to establish rules, according to a November 2013 study coauthored by the University of T\u00fcbingen lab\u2019s lead researcher, Andreas Nieder. Crow language has confounded scientists for decades, too, with its widely varying tones and expressions, McGowan said. The study by Liao and her colleagues isn\u2019t even the first to consider whether crows can count. That research began with Nicholas Thompson in 1968, animal cognition expert Irene Pepperberg noted. A research professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Pepperberg is best known for her work with an African grey parrot named Alex. Thompson hypothesized that crows could count based on their caws, the duration and number of which the birds appeared to control in a given burst of sound. The crows\u2019 counting abilities \u201cseem to exceed the demands which survival makes for such abilities,\u201d he wrote. Another University of T\u00fcbingen study on crows\u2019 counting abilities from September 2015 trained the birds to recognize groupings of dots and recorded the activity of neurons in the part of the crows\u2019 brains that receives and makes sense of visual stimuli. The researchers found that the crows\u2019 neurons \u201cignore the dots\u2019 size, shape and arrangement and only extract their number,\u201d the university said in a statement at the time. \u201cSo, crows\u2019 brains can represent different quantities, and crows can quickly learn to match Arabic numerals to those quantities \u2013\u2013 something humans usually explicitly teach their children,\u201d Williams said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/crows-can-count-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_earwax-eye-discharge-wellness-partner", "text": "Dry scalp? Blocked ears? Crusted eyes? Our bodies produce many different unusual, sometimes repellent secretions, and their function doesn\u2019t always seem entirely clear. But each has their own important role, which often goes unappreciated. Flaky or dry scalp is an extremely common condition, but in severe cases it certainly doesn\u2019t feel trivial. Put aside notions that it\u2019s a factor of poor hygiene \u2014 the underlying cause is not completely clear, but it may be exacerbated by hair care regimes that dry or irritate the scalp. What is known is that flakes of dandruff are made up of cell complexes, arising from sloughed off skin. The outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is composed in part of dead cells that act as an\u00a0essential protective barrier. Dead cells shed more easily and will be replaced with new ones as skin constantly regenerates and grows. If this happens at too great a rate, the result is dandruff. The first measure is to try an over-the-counter, anti-dandruff shampoo. These contain antifungal and anti-inflammatory compounds both understood to have dandruff-healing properties since fungi and inflammation are believed to be potential factors in the development of a crusty scalp. These compounds \u2014 selenium and coal tar for instance \u2014 can also help relieve the symptoms of itch that may often prove worse than the flaking. It\u2019s worthwhile trying a different formula if the first doesn\u2019t work. Certain conditions such as\u00a0psoriasis\u00a0and eczema can also be the underlying cause and may require alternative treatment. Scabs may be unsightly \u2014 but they function beautifully Scabs are the body\u2019s natural response to being wounded. Cuts, punctures or breaks in the skin open up blood vessels to the atmosphere around us. In response, the bloodstream recruits its clotting agents \u2014 the platelets \u2014 to help plug the gap. Platelets bring blood cells together to form a clot, creating a bung to stop bleeding and prevent bacteria shifting from the skin into the circulation, where they can do more damage. When the clot dries out, a scab is formed. Scabs can look horrible, but don\u2019t worry \u2013\u2014 they\u2019re meant to. Sometimes pus forms, which can give scabs a yellow rather than reddish-brown color and might suggest that an infection is brewing.\u00a0Redness of the uninjured skin\u00a0around and tracking away from the scab is another telltale sign of possible infection, too. Resist the temptation to pick off a scab from the skin, no matter how tempting it may seem. Scabs may be unsightly, or itchy, but they\u2019re performing the job they\u2019re supposed to \u2014 keeping out bugs and allowing wounds to heal. Take good care of them instead, by keeping them untouched and clean, and wait for them to shed themselves. READ MORE: Is hot yoga good for you? Exploring the science behind the sweat The eyes have it Sleep sand. Eye bogies. Doze dust. The debris we find in the corners of our eyes each morning goes by many different names. Few of us know exactly what it is, why it\u2019s there, or its scientific name, rheum. Tears lubricate the exposed surface of the eyes, stopping them from getting dry and sore. They also hose away grit and dust and have\u00a0natural antibacterial properties\u00a0to fight infections. But our eyes make more than just tears. The lids have many little glands that discharge\u00a0natural oily substances\u00a0allowing tears to spread evenly across the eye and prevent them evaporating away. In addition,\u00a0mucus-secreting glands, much like those in the nose that make snot, make a thin mucus that also helps to trap and eliminate rogue particles. In large amounts, oil and mucus can irritate the eyes but normally get swept away by tears and blinking during the day. By night, our eyes remain shut, and rheum builds up. Whether they take on the appearance of sticky bogies or crusts depends on how dry they get overnight, and may be proportional to how long you sleep. READ MORE: Why do my armpits smell? (Ear) waxing lyrical Earwax is a largely invisible entity \u2014 more often felt than seen. Notice a feeling of blocked or congested ears, or a smothered sense of hearing, and the wax in your ears might be becoming problematic. It also has a clinical name \u2014 cerumen. In part,\u00a0it\u2019s made of oils and sweat\u00a0from glands lining the ear canal. The majority of earwax though is keratin, the natural protein that toughens skin, hair and nails. This is because the\u00a0ear canal is lined with skin, all the way up to the eardrum. In mixing with the secretions, shed skin produces a waxy substance ranging in colors across the brown spectrum. Fresh, healthy earwax tends to be yellow to honey-brown in color, whereas older, thicker earwax becomes darker brown, sometimes even black. Notice red or green staining? Then blood or bacteria may be mixing with the wax. Among other diagnoses, this raises the possibility of an ear infection, especially if there\u2019s also a runny or foul-smelling discharge. Like many of the other bodily secretions, cerumen also traps debris and other nasties (even insects) that could irritate or damage the delicate eardrum. But problems arise if the wax builds up or hardens too much, blocking conduction of sound to the drum, and dampening your hearing. Nothing smaller than an index finger (with well-trimmed nails) should ever go in your ear canal. Stop cleaning with cotton buds, too. All this does is compress cerumen into little impacted cakes. Instead, medicinal olive oil from the pharmacy can help soften it down,\u00a0making it easier for the ear to clear it naturally. Blood, sweat and tears \u2014 and wax, skin and mucus \u2014 can cause many commonplace issues. But look beyond these minor ailments and be grateful that they\u2019re there. You\u2019d be sorry if they weren\u2019t.

{"id": "2024_06_10_health_fda-committee-recommends-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-donanemab", "text": "On Monday, a panel of independent advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted to endorse Eli Lilly\u2019s drug donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease, agreeing that it was safe and effective. One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, killing more people than prostate and breast cancer combined. Donanemab works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildups in the brain  that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These plaques are harmful deposits that can form in the brain as people age. Removing the plaque seems to slow down the brain changes that seem to happen with Alzheimer\u2019s. As the drug enters the brain it binds to the amyloid plaques and its presence catches the attention of the immune system that facilitates the plaque removal. There is no cure and there is still no drug to prevent the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, but donanemab and Leqembi, another drug that is already on the market made by Eisai and Biogen, has been shown to slow the progression of the disease in its early stages. Lilly told the FDA\u2019s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee that its data from late-stage clinical research showed \u201chighly meaningful results\u201d for patients who took donanemab, with a 37% lower risk of progression of the disease over a year and a half compared to patients who got the placebo. Serious adverse events were \u201cgenerally comparable\u201d among all the groups in the trials, and were infrequent, Lilly told the committee, occurring in only 2% of patients. The patients on donanemab had a slightly higher mortality rate \u2014 2%, compared with 1.7% in the placebo arm of the trial. Three people died while taking the drug after developing ARIA, or micro-hemorrhages known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. In trials of Leqembi, the drug that\u2019s already on the market, some patients experienced ARIA, but it was at a lower rate than seen in the donanemab trial. Leqembi has also been tied to patient deaths. Since most donanemab patients who experienced problems with ARIA did so in the first six weeks of the trial, Lilly told the committee that it added another MRI to the trial to look for the problem before giving the patient a second infusion. The aim would be to detect patients with asymptomatic ARIA. If it was detected, providers would pause treatment so it could resolve and not become more serious or symptomatic. Looking at these results from the late-stage clinical trials, the FDA committee voted on\u00a0two specific questions and discussed three other main topics. The committee voted an unanimous \u201cyes\u201d to the questions of whether the data showed that the drug is effective for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and whether the benefits of the drug outweighed the risks in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s in the population enrolled in the clinical trials. The FDA will take the committee\u2019s advice into consideration as it decides whether to greenlight the drug. Committee member\u00a0Dr. Dean Follmann, assistant director for Biostatistics at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he voted yes because the evidence \u201cwas strong and consistent across subgroups.\u201d In voting yes, Sarah Dolan, the acting consumer representative on the committee and a consultant with the Critical Path Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said she was pleased with the outcome of\u00a0the research. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge unmet medical need here that hopefully can be addressed,\u201d Dolan said. Committee member Dr. Kathleen Poston, the director of Stanford Movement Disorders Center, said she voted yes believing there was a benefit to the drug, \u201cas long as the risks are being monitored.\u201d The trials only included patients that had low-medium levels of tau, a protein that can become abnormal and contribute to the disease. Lilly excluded patients that had no or very low tau because the study wouldn\u2019t follow the patients long enough to see if the drug made a difference. They also excluded people with high amounts of tau. The committee had some concern about extrapolating the results to a subset of patients with other levels of tau; they wanted to see more data. The majority of the committee also wasn\u2019t comfortable with the FDA requiring a tau PET test to determine if a patient was eligible to take the drug\u00a0since the test is not widely available and would make it difficult for some people to get the drug. The\u00a0FDA also asked the committee to consider additional factors about ongoing research and factors related to the possible administration of the drug. Lilly suggests patients may be able to stop the drug if they show enough progress on it. The committee suggested research would have to show what would be the appropriate criteria to stop or restart the drug if symptoms came back. The committee also noted that there was little diversity in the trial, most participants were White, and said future research will need to include more people of color to understand how the drug works in diverse populations. The committee also noted that if the drug is approved, doctors will have to educate their patients about the benefit versus the risk of taking this medication. Initially, when the FDA said that it was going to hold this meeting, it came as a\u00a0surprise announcement\u00a0since many experts had thought the drug would have been approved by the FDA\u00a0last year. Before the votes, Dr. Reisa Sperling, a professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School told the committee that without treatments, the growing number of people with Alzheimer\u2019s could become a serious threat to the country. \u201cWe\u2019re doing such a good job at keeping people alive longer, we are creating a public health emergency if we don\u2019t find a way to stave off this disease,\u201d Sperling said. In the meantime, Lilly said it is working on additional Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cRecognizing the enormous burden this disease carries, we take the responsibility of bringing a well characterized disease modifying therapy to patients very seriously,\u201d Dr. David Hyman, chief medical officer with Eli Lilly and Company told the committee. Lilly views donanemab as \u201can important but ultimately incremental\u201d step in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Ultimately, Hyman said Lilly would like to develop a drug that would treat the disease before someone even starts to show symptoms and are working on such a drug. \u201cPatients deserve more, and we continue to work on additional approaches to address this disease,\u201d Hyman said. After the meeting, Lilly said it was happy with the committee\u2019s positive vote. \u201cWe are pleased with the committee\u2019s unanimous recognition of donanemab\u2019s positive benefit-risk profile,\u201d said Mark Mintun, Eli Lilly\u2019s group vice president of neuroscience research and development in a news release. \u201cWe look forward to bringing this treatment option to patients.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Association had urged the committee to recommend approval of donanemab, welcomed the committee\u2019s unanimous vote in favor of the drug. \u201cA future with more approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatments is a tremendous advancement for people eligible for these drugs,\u201d said Dr. Joanne Pike, Alzheimer\u2019s Association President and CEO. \u201cProgress with treatment is happening.\u201d USAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s, a national nonprofit, that testified in favor of the drug during the public comment period in the meeting said that there is an urgency and a \u201cmassive unmet need\u201d for Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cIf approved by the FDA, donanemab would be the second drug on the market to help people in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s live a better quality of life for a longer period of time, while providing patients and their doctors with another option for their treatment plans,\u201d said chair and co-founder George Vradenburg. \u201cWe are grateful to the advisory committee for its endorsement of this promising treatment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/fda-committee-recommends-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-donanemab/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "health"}}
