From this study, families and institutions should take away how early life lays the foundation to problems dealt with in adulthood, said Dr. Stuart Berger, a pediatric cardiologist and chair of the section of cardiology and cardiac surgery for the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the research. The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, analyzed data from more than 1,400 children ages 3 to 6 recruited from schools across seven cities in Spain. The children\u2019s caregivers met with researchers in person and completed questionnaires at home on physical activity, food consumption and demographics from 2019 to 2022, according to the study. Researchers divided the data from the children into three groups based on the amount of ultraprocessed food they ate. Children who consumed the most ultraprocessed foods were more likely to have risk factors like a higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure and waist-to-height ratio, the study showed. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, chicken nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. \u201cAmericans eat ultraprocessed foods every day,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. A group of Americans in a study published on May 8 ate at least three servings of ultraprocessed food a day, with one group eating an average of seven daily servings, the study showed. Many studies have shown the negative health effects of ultraprocessed foods in adults, but Friday\u2019s study is among the first to show the impact they can have on the cardiometabolic health of young children, said Berger, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago. \u201cThis particular topic, ultraprocessed food consumptions and risk, is a very important topic in kids,\u201d he said. Starting young The study is observational, meaning that while researchers can identify an association between how much ultraprocessed foods children eat and their health, they cannot say that one causes the other, Berger said. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be mindful of ultraprocessed foods for young children, because how they eat for the rest of their lives is greatly impact by their early nutrition, he said. \u201cWhat we know is people who eat a certain way, even moms who eat in utero, set up baby\u2019s preferences,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere are a ton of publications that have shown that what we eat early in life \u2026 actually sets the stage for what happens in the future.\u201d Shifting your child\u2019s diet away from ultraprocessed foods and toward more fresh options is easier to do when they are very young, Berger said. Ultra-convenient The problem is that avoiding ultraprocessed foods is not equally easy for everyone. The study found that the children with the highest amount of ultraprocessed foods in their diet had mothers who were younger, had a higher BMI and had lower levels of education and employment. In places where fresh food might be harder to obtain, ultraprocessed foods are more accessible and inexpensive, Freeman said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are also ultra-convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, people reach for them when they feed their kids, and their kids aren\u2019t hungry, but they\u2019re filled with all these different chemicals and substances and seasonings and salts of sugars and whatever that they become very addicted to.\u201d Freeman stressed that giving kids ultraprocessed foods without also providing fresh fruits and vegetables sets them up for problems down the road. Adding in more nutritious foods and encouraging physical activity as much as possible is critical, Berger added. \u201cIf you can do something to create a healthy lifestyle early, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that you can you can eliminate metabolic syndromes later in life like diabetes, obesity, and all the complications associated with diabetes and obesity,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_world_boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn", "text": "A Saturday launch for the highly anticipated crewed maiden voyage of Boeing\u2019s Starliner is off the table \u2014 and NASA has announced a new target date. Starliner\u2019s first flight carrying astronauts is now expected to lift off no earlier than June 1 at 12:25 p.m. ET, with several backup opportunities in the days following, according to a statement from NASA late Wednesday. \u201cMission managers from NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) continue to evaluate a path forward toward launching the agency\u2019s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station,\u201d the space agency said in the statement. The update comes after several previous delays this month, and a week after Starliner mission teams\u00a0reported a small helium leak\u00a0in the service module of the spacecraft. They traced the leak to a part called a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. Last week, NASA announced that teams were aiming to launch no earlier than May 25, saying the additional time before launch would give specialists more time to evaluate the issue. The agency said tests have found that the leak doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the mission. However, while studying the leak, mission teams also spotted a \u201cdesign vulnerability\u201d in the propulsion system \u2014 essentially identifying a remote scenario in which certain thrusters might fail as the vehicle was leaving Earth\u2019s orbit, without a backup method of getting home safely. NASA and Boeing have since worked with the vendor of the thruster to come up with a backup way to perform the deorbit burn, should that situation arise, said Steve Stich, manager of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, in a Friday news conference. \u201cWe have restored that redundancy for the backup capability in a very remote set of failures for the direct burn,\u201d Stich said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a (Delta-Agency\u00a0Flight\u00a0Test\u00a0Readiness Review) on May 29 to review both the leak and the changes to the way we would execute a deorbit burn in a remote set of failures.\u201d This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The historic crewed flight was about two hours from liftoff on May 6 when it was scrubbed due to\u00a0an issue with the a valve\u00a0on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families, Boeing said last week. They remain in pre-flight quarantine and continue to practice in Starliner simulators, the space agency said.  Boeing\u2019s historic goals The Crew Flight Test is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand US options for ferrying astronauts to the space station. A rocky start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. Williams and Wilmore were already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule May 6 when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the latest issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket caused\u00a0further delay. \u201cThere has been a great deal of exceptional analysis and testing over the last two weeks by the joint NASA, Boeing, and ULA teams to replace the Centaur Self Regulating Valve and troubleshoot the Starliner Service Module helium manifold leak,\u201d\u00a0Stich said. \u201cIt has been important that we take our time to understand all the complexities of each issue including the redundant capabilities of the Starliner propulsion system and any implications to our Interim Human Rating Certification,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will launch Butch and Suni on this test mission after the entire community has reviewed the teams progress and flight rationale at the upcoming Delta Agency Flight Test Readiness Review.\u201d If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit, as Starliner begins firing its own engines. The vehicle will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The history-making crew will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_michigan-bird-flu-human-case", "text": "A case of H5 influenza, also known as avian influenza or bird flu, has been reported in a farm worker in Michigan who had regular exposure to infected livestock, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s the second case reported as part of an ongoing outbreak of the virus in birds and cattle across the country and the third bird flu case ever reported in a person in the US. However, health officials emphasized Wednesday that the risk to the general public remains low. The person was being monitored for the virus because of their exposure to infected cattle, the CDC said in a news release Wednesday. A nasal swab tested negative for influenza at the state health department and later at the CDC, but an eye swab tested positive. The person reported only eye symptoms, and they have recovered. Eye symptoms such as redness, swelling and watering were also the only ones reported in the previous\u00a0human case\u00a0in this outbreak, in a dairy farm worker in Texas. That man took antiviral medications and recovered with no lasting problems. \u201cIt is not unexpected that comprehensive testing identified a human infection,\u201d the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cInformation to date suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person.\u201d The Michigan farm worker was one of about 170 people enrolled in an active monitoring program in which they received a text message from the state health department each day that asks about potential symptoms. When the person indicated the presence of symptoms, public health workers took samples, offered antiviral medications to them and their close contacts, and urged them to isolate. The CDC received the samples on Tuesday and reported the test results to Michigan health officials that night, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC. \u201cThis case was not unexpected,\u201d Shah said Wednesday, emphasizing the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to help farms prepare for the spread of the virus. \u201cIt does not change our assessment of the risk overall. What it does do, however, is it reinforces the message that CDC has been putting out since late March, which is that entities involved with this \u2013 be they local health departments, farms, farm workers and farm worker organizations \u2013 ought to be alert but not alarmed by these developments. \u201cWe have not seen evidence of other cases in this area or elsewhere in any of our monitoring systems, let alone any evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is reassuring, but the work of public health is not done. In the coming days, we\u2019ll have additional information on the genomic sequence or the DNA fingerprint of this particular virus. And we\u2019ll be able to compare it to the virus from infected cows in Michigan, as well as to compare it to the virus from the earlier human case in Texas.\u201d The fact that the nasal specimen tested negative while the eye swab was positive is also, \u201cin a sense, reassuring,\u201d Shah said, as it indicates a reduced likelihood that the virus is spreading through respiration. Although remnants of the virus have been found in samples of dairy products purchased from grocery stores, the US Food and Drug Administration \u201ccontinues to affirm our assessment of the safety of the commercial milk supply,\u201d Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the agency\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said Wednesday. \u201cTo date, the totality of the evidence \u2013 including studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization against multiple pathogens, recent studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] and eggs at lower temperatures than generally used in dairy products, and negative retail sample results to date \u2013 continue to indicate the commercial milk supply is safe. We also continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk\u201d or milk that has not been pasteurized. Testing with a substitute virus in ground beef found some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, but it was present at \u201cmuch, much reduced levels,\u201d according to Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the US Department of Agriculture, and it\u2019s not clear whether it would be enough to make someone sick.

{"id": "2024_05_14_health_drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness", "text": "After decades of decline, accidental drowning rates are rising in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. With Americans getting ready to hit swimming pools and beaches on Memorial Day weekend, a new study shows that many lack the skills they need to stay safe in the water. Roughly 15% of US adults \u2013 40 million people \u2013 say they don\u2019t know how to swim.\u00a0More than half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to a new national survey by the CDC. The new data on swimming skills in the US population is included in a Vital Signs report released Tuesday by the CDC. It comes on the heels of an increase in drowning deaths in the US in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Each year, on average, about 4,000 Americans died from accidental drowning, a number that changed little from 2011 to 2020. But that number has been about 10% higher the past few years, adding 500 to 600 more deaths each year to the annual tally.\u00a0It\u2019s the first uptick in drowning rates in the US for at least\u00a0two decades. \u201cWhen I just look at the overall numbers, with over 4,000 people dying \u2013 that\u2019s over 12 people a day \u2013 that\u2019s really one person every two hours. And those are lives, not numbers,\u201d said Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC. The increases in drownings were even more dramatic for certain ages and racial groups. Drowning has long been the leading cause of death for preschool-age children. Drowning rates increased almost 30% in this age group in 2021 and 2022. Although the number of drowning deaths in children ages 4 and younger increased among young children in 2020, the rate increase was not statistically significant that year. Black people also saw drowning rates increase faster than the general population; compared with 2019, they were nearly 30% higher in 2021.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that Black Americans reported spending less recreational time in the water than White and Hispanic people.\u00a0If drowning rates were calculated based on exposure rather than population, the study authors noted, it\u2019s likely that the disparities for Black people would be even more pronounced. Additionally, the CDC\u2019s swimming skills survey found that 1 in 3 Black adults said they couldn\u2019t swim, compared with 1 in 7 adults in the general population, a legacy of segregation and discrimination in access to swimming pools in the US, according to the CDC. Hispanic Americans, a group that doesn\u2019t traditionally have disproportionately higher drowning rates compared with White non-Hispanics, also saw drowning rates increase by nearly 25% in 2022, compared with 2019. American Indian and Alaska Natives continued to have the highest rates of drownings of any racial or ethnic group overall. In 2019, there were about 3 drowning deaths for every 100,000 people among American Indian and Alaska Natives, a rate that has seen little change over the course of the pandemic.\u00a0By comparison, there were 1.2 accidental drowning deaths for every 100,000 among White people in 2019. Houry says it\u2019s hard to say exactly how the pandemic may have played a role in the increases.\u00a0The study can only make associations \u2013 it can\u2019t untangle the causes \u2013 but she notes that it was harder to get into public pools, with many closing or implementing policies that limited access.\u00a0Staffing was also problematic for many swim venues. \u201cThere would have been people, if swimming pools were closed for that year, who didn\u2019t get swim lessons and so might have been behind in getting swim lessons,\u201d Houry said. Berkeley Champlin didn\u2019t know the statistics around drowning deaths in young children until her son, Gordie, tragically became one of them. In July 2020, 3-year-old Gordie slipped unnoticed out of the sliding glass doors in Champlin\u2019s home in Livonia, Michigan, while Champlin was at work. Normally, he would have been in day care, but like many schools, it was shut down at the time. His father, who was home with him, later found him in the family\u2019s pool. He couldn\u2019t be revived. Gordie loved animals and couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night without special stuffed animals: an elephant and a bunny. \u201cI put his elephant and his bunny in his casket with him so that he has them always, because he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Champlin said.\u00a0She has drawings of the stuffies tattooed on her forearm. \u201cI wish he would have had swim lessons,\u201d she said. Every year since Gordie died, Champlin has channeled her grief into raising money for swim lessons for other children. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive.\u00a0It costs $120 a month in some places for a child to take lessons,\u201d said Champlin, who knows that may put them out of reach for some families. Champlin set a goal of paying for three kids to learn to swim each year.\u00a0This year, 42 families reached out to her for help, and she set up a\u00a0GoFundMe account\u00a0to raise money to cover them all. \u201cIf anyone else is ever in that situation, or if you go on vacation, or you\u2019re on the lake or a new pool or something that you don\u2019t have your standard parameters around, swim lessons is the way to prevent accidents from happening,\u201d she said. Houry, from the CDC, agrees. \u201cI think we forget drowning is still a really big problem for our young kids and that we can do something about it by making sure kids know how to swim,\u201d she said. Houry said the CDC is funding programs at the Red Cross and YMCA to help lower the cost of lessons and make sure everyone who needs them can get them \u201cbecause it\u2019s so important to have that equitable access,\u201d she added. Houry said kids should start getting swim lessons between the ages of 1 and 4. \u201cIf you are an adult and you don\u2019t know how to swim, it\u2019s never too late to get that swim lesson. It\u2019s really important,\u201d she said. But Houry\u00a0said that even if kids can swim, adults shouldn\u2019t leave them unattended, drink alcohol or get distracted while watching kids in the pool. In settings like a party, where it\u2019s easy for conversations or phones to divert attention, the CDC says it can be useful to assign an adult specifically to watch kids in the pool.\u00a0When swim time is over, the\u00a0CDC recommends\u00a0shutting and locking doors that give access to water.\u00a0In the event that something does happen, learning CPR can help you save a life before paramedics arrive. Houry says fencing that completely encloses a pool can help make backyard and community pools safer.\u00a0In open water, like lakes, life jackets are important for safety, too.\u00a0 When visiting a lake or ocean beach, it\u2019s a good idea to take stock of the hazards, such as rip currents, before going into the water. As Gordie\u2019s birthday approaches on July 12, Champlin said, she finds herself wondering what kind of a party he\u2019d want at age 6. Would he still love animals and superheroes as much, or would it be some kind of gaming thing like Roblox? Just as in past years, they\u2019ll spend his birthday at the zoo, a place that still holds vivid memories of her son. \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_how-to-move-better-wellness", "text": "Countless people seek emergency care for back pain, muscle strains and similar injuries resulting from \u201cmoving wrong\u201d during mundane, everyday tasks such as bending over to tie shoes, lifting objects or doing household chores. Even the most basic of human movement patterns \u2014 walking \u2014 can land you in the emergency room due to tripping or losing balance. Falls are one of the leading causes of emergency room visits, with more than 9 million logged annually. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 older adults report falling every year. These incidents highlight the importance of understanding proper movement mechanics to prevent avoidable harm. Read on for five essential strategies to correct improper movement patterns, enhance movement quality and minimize your risk of injury. What are \u2018wrong moves\u2019? The most significant way you can move wrong is by not moving enough.The clich\u00e9d saying \u201cmove it or lose it\u201d is sage wisdom. Human bodies are inherently designed for movement. Yet in our modern, sedentary lifestyles, we often neglect the importance of moving both regularly and well. The less we move, the less we can, and the more susceptible we are to hurting ourselves by moving in a way our body is not accustomed or intended. Understanding what constitutes right and wrong movement is crucial in preventing injury. The unique blueprint of the human body ensures the ability to move in all directions based on using the joints as they were designed. For example, certain joints, such as the hips and shoulders are ball and socket, enabling 360 degrees of rotation, while knees are hinge joints that have more limited mobility. Likewise, the middle of your spine, known as the thoracic spine, is designed for rotating, while the lower back or lumbar spine is not. Core muscles need to support and stabilize any carrying or lifting to avoid low-back stress. If you attempt to twist from your lumbar spine to get out of your car or ask your knees to compensate for a lack of hip mobility in your golf swing, you are moving wrong. Bending over to pet your cat without hinging from your hips and bending your knees or carrying heavy grocery bags without engaging your core to stabilize your spine are also examples of wrong moves. All these actions put unnecessary stress on your muscles, ligaments and joints. As you continue to adopt improper movement patterns, you not only increase your risk of injury but also compromise your body\u2019s functional performance long term. Editor\u2019s\u00a0note:\u00a0Consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Stop immediately if you experience pain. How to make the right moves Developing and maintaining proper movement patterns and training to enhance your movement quality are essential to enhance functional mobility so you can navigate your life pain- and injury-free. Here are five key strategies to make the right moves: 1. Master primary movement patterns Consider the movements required to function during daily life. To get to anything on the floor, you need to squat down and hinge from your hips. When you reach for something, you push your arm or arms forward. To open a door, you grasp the handle and pull back. You rotate to grab and latch your seat belt in the car, and you must stabilize through your core to sit, stand and walk. As such, the six generally accepted primary functional movements are squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling and rotating, as well as core stabilization. By mastering these patterns of bodyweight movements and regularly performing them with good form, you develop a strong foundation for safe and efficient movement in all aspects of life. 2. Practice moving in all planes of motion As you go through daily life, performing different variations of the primary movement patterns noted above, you are also moving your body forward, backward, side to side and twisting around. These directions cover what are known as the three planes of movement: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). It\u2019s important to incorporate intentional exercises within each of these planes into your training regimen. This comprehensive approach ensures that your body is prepared for the demands of all your daily activities and sports. 3. Train for better balance Adding balance training to your workouts will improve stability and proprioception (the ability to perceive the position of your limbs). This type of training helps you to better navigate uneven terrain and sudden changes in direction to reduce the risk of falls and injury. Unilateral exercises that focus on one side of the body at a time, such as single-leg Romanian dead lifts and lunging variations, challenge your neuromuscular system, enhancing coordination and spatial awareness. Because good balance is an essential part of moving well, you should incorporate some form of unilateral balance exercises into all your workouts. 4. Include strength training in your workouts Regular strength training builds more than muscle; it also increases bone density, joint stability, endurance, metabolism and overall durability. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends adults strength train two or more days per week. Aim to incorporate resistance exercises targeting different muscle groups through all the primary movement patterns using good form to ensure safe and effective strength development. Strong muscles support the joints in functional movement to reduce the risk of injury. 5. Cultivate your mind-body connection Another key to moving better and avoiding injury is to move with intention. While exercising, focus on your breath and what you\u2019re feeling to stay connected to your body\u2019s experience. By maintaining awareness of your body\u2019s movements and associated sensations, you can set a safe and effective foundation of mindfulness and focus on proper form during exercise. This mind-body connection enhances movement efficiency and reduces incidences of injury through unintentional \u201cwrong moves.\u201d Progressive muscle relaxation is a great exercise for cultivating your mind-body connection. I recommend practicing it several times per week. Are you ready to start moving better and safeguarding your physical fitness? Try the 10-minute single dumbbell workout featured at the top of this article, which incorporates all five strategies. Remember, injury prevention begins with understanding proper movement mechanics and consistently practicing functional movement patterns. Incorporating the five keys outlined above into your fitness routine and daily life can significantly improve your movement quality and reduce the risk of avoidable injuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/how-to-move-better-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}

The researchers, from the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, are part of a federally funded program called the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response, or CEIRR.\u00a0This network has been conducting rapid research to answer pressing questions in the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle. In a research letter posted online on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers describe the results of experiments using milk from four infected cows \u2014 two from New Mexico and two from Kansas. Because H5N1 virus is considered a select agent, it was handled in a high-security Biosafety Level 3 lab at the University of Wisconsin, using strict safety protocols. First, they confirmed the raw milk was chock-full of H5N1 virus.\u00a0 Then, they stored some of the raw milk at refrigerator temperature to see if levels of the virus in milk would drop off over time.\u00a0 Over 5 weeks, viral levels in raw milk dropped a bit, but not much. \u201cThat it wasn\u2019t decaying over time is concerning,\u201d said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Emory University who is also part of the CEIRR network but was not involved in the study. In another series of tests, the researchers checked to see what types of pasteurization might work best for inactivating the virus. They heated small samples of the milk at times and temperatures used in two types of pasteurization: low-temperature, long-time, or vat pasteurization; and high-temperature short-time, or flash pasteurization, which is the most common method used in the US today,\u00a0according to\u00a0the International Dairy Foods Association. Heating the milk to 63 degrees Celsius, or 145 degrees Fahrenheit, for intervals between 5 and 30 minutes \u2014 the vat pasteurization method \u2014 reduced the virus to undetectable levels. Heating the milk to 72 degrees Celsius, or 181 degrees Fahrenheit, for 15 or 20 seconds \u2014 conditions that approximated flash pasteurization \u2014 greatly reduced levels of the virus in the milk, but it didn\u2019t inactivate it completely. Milk samples heated for 15 or 20 seconds were still able to infect incubated chicken eggs, a test the US Food and Drug Administration has called the gold-standard for determining whether viruses remain infectious in milk. \u201cBut, we emphasize that the conditions used in our laboratory study are not identical to the large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,\u201d senior study author Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist who specializes in the study of flu and Ebola, said in an email. That\u2019s a good reason not to panic over the study findings, said Lakdawala. Lakdawala said that commercial flash pasteurization involves a preheating step, which wasn\u2019t done here.\u00a0It also involves homogenization, a process that emulsifies the fat globules in milk so the cream won\u2019t separate.\u00a0Both of those steps would probably make it harder for the virus to survive, but she adds that the results of this study suggest full process of commercial flash pasteurization should be done \u201cwith all the steps in place.\u201d Recent tests of\u00a0297 dairy products\u00a0purchased at retail stores by the FDA found traces\u00a0of\u00a0genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 of 5 milk samples, and further testing confirmed the viral fragments were inert and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to the general public is low, but people\u00a0should not eat or drink\u00a0raw milk or products made from it. To date, H5N1 influenza has been found in\u00a058 dairy herds in nine states.\u00a0 Michigan has now surpassed Texas as the state with the greatest number of infected herds. To test whether the raw milk could infect other animals, researchers also squirted\u00a0some of the milk\u00a0into the mouths of mice.\u00a0 The animals showed signs of illness the next day. On day four, the mice hadn\u2019t died of their infections, but they were euthanized so that researchers could see what parts of their bodies had become infected. Scientists found the virus all over their bodies, with high viral loads in the lungs and respiratory tract.\u00a0 They also found virus in the mammary glands of the mice, even though they weren\u2019t producing milk at the time. Taken together, their findings confirm that raw milk can infect susceptible animals, the researchers said\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and that could also indicate a risk to humans. In a recent news briefing, officials with the US Department of Agriculture said that to their knowledge, none of the raw milk from farms known to have H5N1 infections was being sold to consumers. Not all dairy farms are testing their cows, however, and some of the infected cows in the current outbreak have not shown any symptoms. \u201cRaw milk is unsafe at any speed, and the notion that you could protect yourself against H5 infection by consuming it is erroneous. There are there are much safer ways to protect oneself namely avoiding raw milk,\u201d CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah said in a briefing. Asked if the\u00a0raw\u00a0milk\u00a0in the new experiments\u00a0looked different than normal, Kawaoka said the researchers only got a small number of samples but some had more debris than milk from healthy cows. That would get filtered out prior to sale, he said.\u00a0Some of the milk looked yellow-ish, but he points out that milk from healthy and infected cows would likely be mixed together in a big vat, making it look normal \u2014 and\u00a0impossible to tell whether milk is safe to drink just by looking at it. \u201cThis is good quality research with conclusions backed up by solid data,\u201d said Dr. Ruth Harvey, deputy director of the Worldwide Influenza Center at the Francis Crick Institute in London, in a comment on the study given to the nonprofit Science Media Centre. \u201cThe limitations of the experimental set-up for the heat inactivation part of the research are clearly stated: that the conditions used are not identical to large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThe findings that viable virus was found in the milk samples after 5 weeks of storage at (4 degrees Celsius), and that mice could be infected through drinking milk containing the virus, back up the conclusions that drinking raw milk could pose a risk,\u201d Harvey added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/new-experiments-milk-h5n1-infected-cows-raise-questions-flash-pasteurization/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness", "text": "Knee pain is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Whether it\u2019s due to past or current injury, arthritis or simply the wear and tear of aging, the discomfort can be debilitating. In most cases, proactive ways can help you soothe and strengthen your knees. As a mobility coach, I teach people how to use movement as medicine. In the case of knee pain, there\u2019s one simple yet effective exercise I favor to help alleviate pain and strengthen the muscles around your knees: the reverse lunge. Unlike traditional lunges, the reverse lunge is gentler on your joints. This lunge variation not only has the power to strengthen your knee function but also enhances overall lower body strength and stability. Read on to learn how incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness regimen can help you move past the pain and build a stronger foundation for knee health. Understanding your knee pain Knee pain is hard to ignore as it affects your ability to perform everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs and even sitting and standing. The knee joint is a complex structure made up of bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons, all working together to provide stability and movement. When any of these components are compromised, pain can ensue. It may be experienced as a constant or intermittent ache, throbbing or even stabbing pain that may or may not come with swelling. Common causes of knee pain include: \u2022\u00a0 Osteoarthritis: a degenerative joint disease that results in the breakdown of cartilage. \u2022\u00a0 Patellar tendinitis: inflammation of the tendons connecting the kneecap to the shinbone. \u2022\u00a0 Meniscus tears: injuries to the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee. \u2022\u00a0 Ligament injuries: tears or strains to any of the four main knee ligaments (ACL, MCL, PCL and LCL). \u2022\u00a0 Bursitis: Inflammation of the bursae, small sacs of fluid that cushion the knee joint. It\u2019s important to determine the cause of your knee pain before attempting any specific rehab plan. Addressing knee pain often requires a multifaceted approach that may include physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, medication and targeted exercises such as the reverse lunge. Before adding reverse lunges to your fitness regimen or beginning any new exercises or therapies, check with your doctor or other health care professionals you are seeing for help with your knees. Benefits of the reverse lunge The reverse lunge is a basic yet powerful exercise that strengthens the muscles around your knees, improves your core strength and enhances overall lower body strength, mobility and stability. Here are some key benefits: \u2022\u00a0 Reverse lunging strengthens muscles that support your knees. Building stabilizing muscles around the knee joints improves movement quality and reduces pain and injury risk. \u2022\u00a0 The dynamic movement of reverse lunging increases joint lubrication by stimulating the production of synovial fluid. Lubricating the knee joint reduces friction and promotes smoother, pain-free motion. \u2022\u00a0 Unlike forward lunging and other forward stepping exercises, the backward motion of reverse lunges puts less strain on the knees and emphasizes more stability, making them an ideal choice for individuals with knee pain. \u2022\u00a0 Practicing reverse lunges improves balance and stability. Because reverse lunges are unilateral, they are a balance training exercise that strengthens your core and stabilizing\u00a0 muscles to reduce the risk of injury by \u201cmoving wrong.\u201d \u2022\u00a0 They enhance mobility. Regularly practicing reverse lunges improves hip, knee and ankle mobility. \u2022\u00a0 They aid in functional activities. The movement mimics everyday activities, such as kneeling down to tie your shoes or picking something up off the floor. How to perform a reverse lunge Performing a reverse lunge correctly is crucial to reaping its benefits and avoiding injury. Follow these steps for proper form: 1.\u00a0 Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, shoulders relaxed, and arms at your sides or on your hips. Engage your core to maintain balance. 2.\u00a0 Take a step backward with your right foot, landing on the ball of your foot. Your left foot should remain in place, fully connected with the floor. 3.\u00a0 Bend both knees to lower your body until your left thigh is parallel to the ground and your right knee is either lightly touching or nearly touching the floor. 4.\u00a0 Keep most of your weight in your front foot and leg and ensure that your left knee is aligned over your left ankle, not pushed too far forward beyond your toes. 5.\u00a0 Maintain good upper-body posture with your shoulders back and chest open. Avoid leaning forward. 6.\u00a0You do not need to hold the lunge position for any specified length. Go at your own pace, returning to the starting position by pushing through your left heel to lift your body back to standing. Repeat the movement with the opposite leg. Aim for two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions on each leg, depending on your fitness level. Need to modify or want to progress? The intensity of reverse lunging can be varied to accommodate different fitness levels. Beginners or anyone struggling with balance should place one hand on a stable support, such as a chair or wall. For those wanting an advanced variation, hold dumbbells at your sides or a kettlebell at your chest or in one hand at your side or overhead to add resistance and increase the intensity. Use an appropriate weight for your fitness level and goals. To get the most out of practicing reverse lunges, keep these tips in mind: Consistency is key. Regular practice yields the best results. Aim to include reverse lunges in your routine at least two to three times per week. Focus on form. Quality over quantity. Proper form maximizes effectiveness while preventing injury. Listen to your body. If you experience any painful sensation beyond normal muscle fatigue, stop and reassess your form. Consult a health care professional if necessary. Knee pain doesn\u2019t have to sideline you from staying active and enjoying life. By incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness routine, you can take proactive steps toward healthier, pain-free knees. So, step back, lunge and move forward with stronger, more resilient knees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_health_happiness-rewire-brain-gupta-podcast-wellness", "text": "Happiness is an idea that has been woven into the fabric of humanity, going back to ancient civilizations. Roughly 250 years ago, it made its way into this country\u2019s Declaration of Independence as an unalienable right: \u201cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Although we\u2019ve grappled with it for millennia, the concept of happiness and how to attain it remains pretty elusive. Some might see it as having a sense of general well-being. For others, it might be feeling a spark of unadulterated joy. Yet others might find happiness chasing a dream and reaching it. It might be some combination of these \u2013 or something else entirely. I like to think of myself as a pretty happy guy. I have three wonderful teenage daughters and a wife, Rebecca, with whom I just celebrated a 20th anniversary; I\u2019m close to my parents, my \u201cbaby\u201d brother and his family. I have moments of complete contentment and a career that feels meaningful to me as a practicing neurosurgeon and CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent. But I also realize it\u2019s not that simple. There are other layers to happiness and a lot of nuance within those layers. The pursuit of happiness A challenging question is, what are the best ways to pursue happiness? Are we born with a stable, set level, or is it something we can cultivate, increase and strengthen? If it\u2019s the latter, how can we successfully go about it? Even though \u201cthe pursuit of Happiness\u201d is built into the country\u2019s founding, it seems that many Americans are just not that good at it. In the most recent World Happiness Report, the United States dropped to No. 23 (from No. 15 the previous year), marking the first time in the report\u2019s 12-year history that the US was not in the top 20 happiest countries. A separate Gallup poll, also from 2024, found that less than half (47%) of Americans are \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their personal lives. It\u2019s not just Americans. As it turns out, humans as a species may not excel at happiness. This may surprise you, but happiness is not necessarily something that we are genetically primed to attain. We have to really work at it. \u201cIf anything, natural selection kind of doesn\u2019t really care about our happiness that much. I mean, natural selection\u2019s job is just to keep us alive and keep us around to reproduce. And I think it does that not by making us feel these moments of contentment but maybe just the opposite,\u201d cognitive scientist Dr. Laurie Santos told me recently. \u201cIt does that by building in a negativity bias. So we\u2019re just a little bit worried that there could be a tiger around the corner, that we could get shunned at work. And we\u2019re kind of constantly on the alert for that,\u201d she said. Santos, who has a doctorate in psychology, is at Yale University, where she teaches Psychology and the Good Life, the most popular course in the university\u2019s history, and is the host of \u201cThe Happiness Lab\u201d podcast. She is also the first guest on the 10th season of my podcast, \u201cChasing Life,\u201d which kicked off this week. During this season, I talk to experts across a variety of disciplines about the scientific underpinnings of happiness \u2014 defining it, attaining it, maintaining it and increasing it \u2014 and its effects on our minds and bodies. Listen to more of my conversation with Santos here. I\u2019m happy but \u2018constructively dissatisfied\u2019 The fact that we haven\u2019t evolved to prioritize happiness may be why, despite being a generally happy person, I am also \u201cconstructively dissatisfied.\u201d It\u2019s a term I came up with on the fly while talking to Santos. And here, I\u2019m making a distinction between happiness and satisfaction. I\u2019m still happy overall, but I think if I ever became satisfied, that might erode my happiness. That\u2019s because, in my mind, satisfaction leads to complacency, which leads to stagnation. So, I seemingly have one of those personalities that needs \u2013 maybe even thrives on \u2013 dissatisfaction; being satisfied or complacent dampens my energy and enthusiasm. The times when I feel happiest are when my constructive dissatisfaction propels me into motion, contributing to the betterment of a situation, whether it\u2019s removing a brain tumor, finishing a documentary, working in my garden or even making dinner with my family. Another guest this season of the podcast, health psychologist and author Kelly McGonigal, said the term made perfect sense to her. \u201cBecause dissatisfaction often is the soil in which growth and positive change happens,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd dissatisfaction doesn\u2019t actually have to be a lack of appreciation or gratitude. If you can envision a better future for yourself or others, it requires feeling a gap between how things are and how things could be.\u201d The \u201cconstructive\u201d modifier before \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d is really important to me because I don\u2019t want to just wallow in dissatisfaction; I want it to be useful. And as long as I don\u2019t let the dissatisfaction grow too much, where it overpowers my emotional well-being, it works for me. But I have to admit, it can sometimes be a source of tension and a regular struggle. \u201cIt strikes me that you\u2019ve kind of gotten something out of the journey, gotten something out of that struggle,\u201d Santos told me. But she also warned about going overboard. \u201cWe can push ourselves and engage in challenges; those can be some of the happiest, most flow-inducing moments of our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need to make sure we\u2019re doing that in balance.\u201d She said that if we lose sleep, ignore friendships and make ourselves miserable, \u201cmaybe think about pushing yourself in a different way.\u201d Or find a way to mitigate the negative feelings. \u201cThe antidote to that would be to think what are ways that I could be on that important, purposeful journey but also bring a few more moments of true happiness into my life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, maybe I need a little bit more laughter or some breaks, or I need to engage in that purposeful pursuit with a bit more social connection, or something like that.\u201d Tried and true strategies It is true, according to Santos, that most of us have a set point of happiness. Mine is probably a little lower than my brother\u2019s, for example; he is more outgoing and outwardly cheerful, even though we have very similar nature and nurture. Winning the lottery may raise your level of happiness for a while, and a tragedy may lower it, but most people will eventually settle back to their baseline after some time. Santos believes, however, that with some diligent and intentional practice, you can start to turn up your thermostat of happiness. It is what she teaches her students, as well. For example, she not only lectures her students about the behavior and mindset shifts that are known to nudge up happiness, she makes her students practice them as homework. Instead of course requirements, she calls them course rewirements, because performing them on a regular basis actually can rewire you. Among the low-hanging fruit, Santos recommends making sure you\u2019re paying attention to healthy practices, like getting enough sleep and exercise and eating right. Also on the list: become a bit more \u201cother\u201d-oriented and try to develop an attitude of both gratitude and compassion outside yourself and internally, as well. But my favorite bit of advice is to cultivate and nurture your social connections. \u201cEvery available study of happy people suggests that happy people are more social,\u201d Santos said. And I would gather the opposite is also true: Social people are happier. \u201cSo we just need to make time for our friends and family members and loved ones.\u201d She\u2019s not the only one to preach this. Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist who runs the Harvard Study of Adult Development \u2014 the longest study of adult life, running 85-plus years and counting \u2014 said the secret of both happiness and health boils down to good relationships. How could that be? According to Waldinger, warm relationships (even just one) generally keep people\u2019s bodies stronger and brains sharper, most likely because they help buffer us against the vicissitudes of life. This reduces our exposure to circulating stress hormones (which, when they are constantly high, wreak havoc on the body and mind) as well as dials down resulting inflammation, thought to be at the root of many chronic modern diseases. So \u2014 again, for most of us \u2014 the diseases of aging are mitigated, in part, by our happiness. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to become an extrovert or the life of a party, and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend hour upon hour enduring superficial banter. But, Waldinger said, you should put some effort into consistently nurturing your relationships. To do that, he recommends a few things: Be proactive and reach out to friends; establish routines like a weekly phone call; liven up longstanding relationships by doing new things; make new friends by connecting around shared interests; and get more comfortable striking up conversations with strangers. The recipe is going to vary from person to person and depend on what amount of social interaction feels right for you. Having meaningful relationships really resonates with me. I know from my own life too that good, strong connections to family and friends are really important. And they are what ultimately make me happiest of all. Listen to the full episode with happiness professor Laurie Santos here, and join us next week on the podcast when we explore the surprising link between happiness and anxiety. Find out why it\u2019s a misunderstood emotion.

{"id": "2024_05_24_health_belly-button-health-indicator-partner-content-wellness", "text": "Navels, belly buttons, innies or outies \u2026 whatever term you use, your umbilicus may have plenty to tell you about the state of your health. For some, they are the thing of nightmares \u2013\u00a0omphalophobia\u00a0(the fear of belly buttons) is a real condition. For others, they are a fashion accessory to be shown off in a crop top, or decorated with a body piercing. Whatever your feelings about belly buttons, one thing\u2019s for sure - it once joined you to your mother. The umbilical cord is severed at birth to leave just a small clamped stump that progressively withers and falls away a week or two later. What you\u2019re left with, in most cases, is a small wrinkled depression. That\u2019s if you have an \u201cinnie\u201d, as most of us \u2013\u00a090% apparently\u00a0\u2013 do. From this point, the belly button seems to become redundant \u2013 other than to gather dust and fluff. But that\u2019s not the whole story \u2013 your navel has more depth to it than just a few millimetres. READ MORE: What your hair can tell you about your health\u00a0 The umbilicus is an access point for the vessels carrying blood to and from the fetus. These have come from the placenta and run through the\u00a0umbilical cord, coated in\u00a0Wharton\u2019s jelly\u00a0\u2013 a gelatinous connective tissue contained in the cord that insulates and protects them. There are normally three vessels within the cord. The one carrying oxygen and nutrients to the foetus is the\u00a0umbilical vein. It passes through the umbilicus and feeds into the developing foetal circulation. There are also\u00a0two umbilical arteries, though these carry deoxygenated blood and waste products, flowing in the other direction back to the placenta. This circulation is not needed after the baby is born, and once disconnected from the placenta the umbilical vessels naturally close up. But the little stump of cut cord left clinging on can still be of use for a short time, especially in newborn babies who are poorly. The vessels can have\u00a0drip lines inserted\u00a0and be used for infusions of medicine, or have blood samples taken from them for testing. READ MORE: What your skin can tell you about your health The umbilicus is a portal in the wall of the abdomen - it\u2019s a little-known fact that during your embryonic development your intestines actually have to\u00a0leave your abdominal cavity\u00a0because of limited space, but return a few weeks later. They do so via the umbilicus, passing into the cord. As a result the umbilicus is not just an access point, but a point of weakness. An\u00a0umbilical hernia\u00a0occurs if a section of intestine pokes through any gap. This may require an operation to correct it. The nun and the navel Poor\u00a0Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey. She was a nun who devoted much of her life to the care of patients in a hospital in Minnesota. She trained as a nurse, later becoming a surgical assistant to the doctor William Mayo. It was during this tenure that she highlighted an interesting observation. At the time (the late 19th century), cancers of the abdomen and pelvis were typically diagnosed much later, and unfortunately were often more extensive. We call this process\u00a0metastasis, where a cancer starts in one organ or location, then spreads to another. Mary Joseph noted that some patients with metastatic cancer had a new palpable swelling or nodule in their umbilicus. She did the noble deed of reporting this to Mayo, who fairly evidently hadn\u2019t noted it himself. He went on to rather\u00a0ignominiously publish these findings\u00a0under his own name, without giving due credit to his esteemed colleague. It was only after the deaths of Dempsey and Mayo - both in 1939 - that another doctor, Hamilton Bailey, rightly named the finding\u00a0Sister Mary Joseph\u2019s nodule. The\u00a0nodule\u00a0is firm, of variable colouring, and actually arises from spread of the cancer to the umbilical tissue. It\u2019s not seen as commonly these days, since more cancers are now diagnosed earlier before extensive spreading occurs. READ MORE: What your earwax and tears can tell you about your health\u00a0 Medusa\u2019s head Other signs can be observed in the navel that have a footing in mythology. One example allows us to draw a connection between the liver and the umbilicus. The skin around the navel has beds of\u00a0superficial veins\u00a0that feed back towards the deeper circulation. They actually drain blood into the hepatic portal vein, a large vessel that is heading into the liver, chock-full of nutrients absorbed from the gut. If the\u00a0pressure in the portal vein becomes too high\u00a0(mostly as a result of liver diseases, like alcohol cirrhosis) pressure builds in the connecting vessels too. Veins have thinner walls than arteries and tend to\u00a0balloon under pressure. As a result, the normally small veins around the navel dilate in size and become visible beneath the skin, fanning in all directions. This sign, like a head replete with snakes for hair, is named\u00a0caput medusae, or Medusa\u2019s head. In Greek mythology,\u00a0the gorgon Medusa\u00a0whose head was severed by the hero Perseus, had the ability to turn anyone who beheld her gaze to stone. READ MORE: 7 navel-gazing questions about belly buttons answered And on that topic, all that dirt, debris and dead skin in our navels should also get an honourable (or maybe dishonourable) mention - prolonged accumulation of this material within the cavity can make it harden over time, forming a stony mass. We call this an\u00a0omphalolith, or umbilical stone. So, the umbilicus is something of a reliable crystal ball in diagnosing internal illnesses. But as to whether you regard it as an attractive part of your own anatomy, one has to ask the question: are you innie or outie?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/belly-button-health-indicator-partner-content-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_fish-oil-supplement-dangers-study-wellness", "text": "As an excellent source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, daily fish oil supplements are a popular way to keep the risk of cardiovascular disease at bay. About 20% of adults older than age 60 in the United States frequently use these products with the aim of supporting heart health. However, a new study finds regular use of fish oil supplements may increase, not reduce, the risk of first-time stroke and atrial fibrillation among people in good cardiovascular health. Atrial fibrillation, also called AFib or AF, is a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat,\u00a0that people often describe as a flutter or pounding in their chests. \u201cI can see the headline for this study as \u2018Fish oil supplements: Is it time to dump them or not?\u2019\u201d said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cI say that because over-the-counter fish oil is very seldom recommended, is in none of the guidelines from professional medical societies, and yet that\u2019s what most people take,\u201d said Freeman, who was not involved in the study. Fish oil only helped people with existing heart disease The study analyzed data on over 415,000 people ages 40 to 69 participating in the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study of the health of people in the United Kingdom. Nearly one-third of those people, who were followed for an average of 12 years, said they regularly used fish oil supplements. For people without heart issues, regular use of fish oil supplements was associated with a 13% higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation and a 5% heightened risk of having a stroke, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Medicine. Over-the-counter fish oil suffers from a lack of purity and consistency, as well as the potential contaminants and heavy metals such as mercury that come with fish, Freeman said. \u201cIn addition, studies over the last 10 years have not been very positive for over-the-counter fish oil,\u201d he added. \u201cFish oil was either having no benefit or in some cases it may harm, such as with stroke and AFib. So that\u2019s not new.\u201d In fact, the new study found that people with existing heart disease at the beginning of the research had a 15% lower risk of progressing from atrial fibrillation to a heart attack and a 9% lower risk of progressing from heart failure to death when they regularly used fish oil. Instead, prescription versions of fish oil, such as Vascepa and Lovaza, are used to counter such risk factors such as high triglycerides, a type of blood fat, in people with cardiovascular disease risk, Freeman said. \u201cBut even in the prescription strength, highly purified versions of fish oil, the risk for AFib and sometimes stroke has also been present and doctors are cautious about that,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cOverall, I would say that the days where people just go to the store and buy buckets of fish oil pills to keep them well should be over, but fish oil may still have a role in people who are already sick.\u201d Try to use food sources for omega-3s When it comes to fish oil, \u201cthe devil is in the details,\u201d said Alzheimer\u2019s preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. He was not involved in the study. \u201cFirst, we recommend testing for omega-3 fatty acid levels \u2014 there are finger-prick tests you can buy online which are accurate \u2014 and then you should continue to test. You don\u2019t want to take fish oil if you don\u2019t need it,\u201d he said. Isaacson recommends trying to get your omega-3 fatty acids from food sources and says sardines and wild-caught salmon are the best sources, as they are high in these healthy unsaturated fats and lower in mercury. Farm-raised salmon is not the best choice, he said, due to impurities in the water in which they are raised. Lake trout, mackerel, herring and albacore tuna are also good sources, he said. However, due to the mercury levels in large fish such as tuna, he recommends consumption of albacore tuna should be kept to twice a week. Algae and seaweed are decent nonfish sources of omega 3s as well. Chia seeds, edamame (soy beans), flaxseed, hempseeds and walnuts are other plant-based options that are high in omega-3s. But the fatty acids are a different form than those found in fish.  Studies have found plant-based omega-3s may be harder to metabolize in people with higher levels of omega-6s, another kind of unsaturated fats that\u2019s found primarily in vegetable oils. If supplements are needed Prescription omega-3 fatty acids are superior to over-the counter options, experts say, due to their pureness and quality. But prescribed supplements can be expensive. For people who decide they want to purchase over-the-counter omega-3s, Isaacson provides these tips to his patients. First, freshness of the fish oil is key, he said, adding that \u201cbuying from an online or retail superstore, such as Amazon or Costco, isn\u2019t the best idea.\u201d \u201cWe recommend buying it from only a handful of reputable companies, and from their specific website,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cThe difference in quality between fish oil stored in a hot warehouse that\u2019s close to expiration and fish oil that\u2019s recently been produced, sent directly from the company, and kept in the home refrigerator is night and day.\u201d The US Food and Drug Administration doesn\u2019t monitor the supplement industry to assure each vitamin or mineral actually contains what it says on the label, nor does the federal agency test to see whether the ingredients are contaminated with bacteria, heavy metals, pesticides, plastic residues and other impurities. However, there are some companies that have stepped into that role by testing various supplements and even some pharmaceuticals, so look for their labels on the supplements before purchase. The nonprofit organization US Pharmacopeia, or USP, sets the most widely accepted standards for supplements, experts say, but ConsumerLab.com and NSF International also do third-party testing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/fish-oil-supplement-dangers-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish geneticist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

And if you have no idea what that sentence even means, you\u2019re probably not a member of\u00a0Generation Z. The acronym\u00a0BORG stands for\u00a0\u201cblackout rage gallon,\u201d according to the\u00a0National Capital Poison Center in Washington, DC.\u00a0The term\u00a0refers to a concoction\u00a0often prepared in a gallon-size plastic jug that typically contains\u00a0vodka\u00a0or other distilled alcohol, water, a flavor enhancer and an electrolyte powder or drink.\u00a0BORGs are often drunk at outside day parties, otherwise known as darties. The new version of jungle juice There\u2019s so much alcohol in a BORG that \u201cdrinking one can lead to potentially life-threatening consumption and alcohol poisoning,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Anna Lembke, a professor of psychiatry and addiction medicine at Stanford University in California. The large-batch drink is the new version of jungle juice, according to Sabrina Grimaldi, the creator\u00a0and editor-in-chief\u00a0of online lifestyle magazine\u00a0The Zillennial\u00a0Zine. The publication targets the\u00a0micro-generation\u00a0between millennials and Gen Z. \u201cInstead of making a party-sized mixed drink in a huge 5-gallon drink dispenser, a giant storage tub, or even the grossest trend, which was making jungle juice in a sink or bathtub, everyone has their own personal drink,\u201d Grimaldi wrote CNN in an email.\u00a0As the drink\u2019s name\u00a0suggests,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s intended to get you extremely drunk.\u201d What Lembke calls the BORG\u2019s \u201csocial contagion factor\u201d makes it even more dangerous. \u201cKids see other kids doing it and want to try it themselves,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s another real danger here \u2014 to take a dangerous deviant behavior and normalize it by spreading it on social media.\u201d Gen Z binge drinking Grimaldi, who is 24, first heard about BORGs earlier this year when her editorial intern, Kelly Xiong, 21, pitched her a\u00a0story\u00a0on the topic of why they are so popular among Gen\u00a0Zers. \u201cI graduated college in 2020 so it\u2019s safe to say I haven\u2019t been a part of the college party scene in almost 5 years (especially because of the pandemic),\u201d Grimaldi said.\u00a0\u201cEven though Kelly and I are so close in age, it\u2019s crazy how these microtrends pop up.\u201d Xiong, who\u00a0just graduated from\u00a0the University of Pittsburgh, first learned about BORGs during her sophomore year at college. \u201cIt was during a St. Patrick\u2019s Day block darty,\u00a0and almost everyone had their own BORG,\u201d she told CNN\u00a0via email, adding that the drink is particularly popular at big outdoor day parties or\u00a0\u201cspecial occasion darties.\u201d While the origins of the term are difficult to trace, BORGs have made headlines, including in March 2023 when\u00a0more than two dozen University of Massachusetts Amherst\u00a0students, many of whom were believed to be carrying BORGS, were carried away by ambulance following an off-campus event. High school students are drinking BORGs The trend is not limited to the college demographic. At the high school senior\u00a0class pool party\u00a0last year and this year, \u201ceveryone made their own\u00a0BORG,\u201d said Virginia, 18, a senior at a private high school in Tampa, Florida, who didn\u2019t want her real name used to protect her privacy. Virginia said one of the reasons BORGs appeal to her is the social aspect. \u201cYou have to name your BORG and get creative by writing the name on it with a Sharpie,\u201d she said. BORG posts starring gallon jugs with punny names such as Captain Borgan, Our Borg and Savior, Borgan Donor and Borgan Wallen proliferate on TikTok. Thinking along those lines is part of what makes BORGs potentially dangerous to the people turning to them as a party drink, Lembke said. Virginia said she recognizes the dangers of drinking BORGs. \u201cA lot of people just pour vodka in and don\u2019t measure it, so it can actually be kind of dangerous as opposed to knowing you drank three cans of beer,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cNobody is really rationing how much they\u2019re going to drink.\u201d That\u2019s true even if the person is 21, the legal age to drink in the United States, or older. A\u00a0standard drink\u00a0in the US\u00a0contains\u00a01 to 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer, according to the National Institutes of Health.\u00a0For females, drinking more than four standard drinks (and for males, more than five) over a two-hour time frame is considered a binge,\u00a0according to the NIH. \u201cA BORG often contains a fifth (25.6 fluid ounces or 3.2 cups)\u00a0of vodka or other hard alcohol, which is about 17 standard drinks, which is a massive amount of alcohol,\u201d Lembke said. No amount of alcohol is good for you It\u2019s actually best not to drink alcohol at all, as\u00a0a number of recent studies have found that\u00a0no amount of drinking is healthy. The\u00a0World Heart Federation published a policy brief in 2022 saying there is \u201cno level of\u00a0alcohol consumption that is safe for health.\u201d If you do drink, health experts encourage moderation.\u00a0That\u2019s no more than 3 ounces of alcohol for women or 4 ounces for men over the course of a day, according to the\u00a02020-2025\u00a0Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Lembke also recommended not making a regular habit of it. The liver processes about 1 ounce of alcohol per hour, or roughly one standard drink per hour, Lembke said. Depending on the alcohol quantity in the mix, drinking a BORG\u00a0\u201ctotally overwhelms the capacity of the liver to metabolize it,\u201d especially for somebody who\u2019s not already tolerant to alcohol, Lembke said. The fact that BORGS are usually sweetened with a diluting agent such as electrolyte drinks or water flavor enhancers only makes them more dangerous, she said. \u201cIt makes it more palatable, and people generally can drink more than they could of something like straight vodka,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t increase the liver\u2019s ability to metabolize alcohol better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/borg-blackout-rage-gallon-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness", "text": "The nightmares are intense and often horrifying, sometimes lasting well into the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a serial killer after me and the last few years I have the same one,\u201d according to a Canadian patient. \u201cHe\u2019s got my legs or something I can still feel something on my legs even when I\u2019m then awake.\u201d Another English patient described nightmares \u201cwhere I can\u2019t breathe and where someone is sitting on my chest.\u201d Yet another shared stories of \u201creally nasty\u201d violent visions in their sleep. \u201cHorrific, like murders, like skin coming off people,\u201d said one Irish patient about his nightmares. \u201cI think it\u2019s like when I\u2019m overwhelmed which could be the lupus being bad \u2026 so I think the more stress my body is under then the more vivid and bad the dreaming would be.\u201d Nightmares and \u201cdaymares,\u201d dreamlike hallucinations that appear when awake, may be little-known signs of the onset of lupus and other systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to a new study published Monday in the journal eClinicalMedicine. Such unusual symptoms may also be a signal that an established disease may be about to intensely worsen or \u201cflare\u201d and require medical treatment, said lead study author Melanie Sloan, a researcher in the department of public health and primary care at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. \u201cThis is particularly the case in a disease like lupus, which is well known for affecting multiple organs including the brain, but we also found these patterns of symptoms in the other rheumatological diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and systemic sclerosis,\u201d Sloan said in an email. Lupus is a long-term disease in which the body\u2019s immune system goes haywire, attacking healthy tissue and causing inflammation and pain in any part of the body, including blood cells, the brain, heart, joints and muscles, kidneys, liver, and lungs. \u201cCognitive problems and many of these other neuropsychiatric symptoms we studied can have a huge influence on people\u2019s lives, ability to work, to socialize, and just to have as much of a normal life as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThese symptoms are often invisible and (currently) untestable but that shouldn\u2019t make them any less important to be considered for treatment and support.\u201d Jennifer Mundt, an assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who was not involved in the study, said in an email she was pleased the study focused on nightmares. \u201cAlthough nightmares are a very distressing problem in many medical and psychiatric conditions, they rarely get focused on except in the context of PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome),\u201d Mundt said. \u201cA\u00a0recent study\u00a0showed that 18% of people with long-COVID have (frequent) nightmares, and this compares to a general population prevalence of about 5%,\u201d she said. \u201cHearing the patient perspective is critical so that research and clinical care can be guided by what is most important to patients themselves.\u201d Doctors and patients need to know While research in the field is rather new, a March 2019 study found patients with inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases also experienced nightmares and other REM sleep disorders such as sleep paralysis. REM is short for rapid eye movement, the stage of sleep in which people dream and information and information and experiences are consolidated and stored in memory. In that study, one 57-year-old man recalled being \u201cthreatened by feral birds of prey\u201d in his nightmares, while a 70-year-old woman dreamed her nephew was in grave danger but she could do nothing to help him. The new study surveyed 400 doctors and 676 people living with lupus and also conducted detailed interviews with 50 clinicians and 69 people living with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including lupus. Researchers found 3 in 5 lupus patients, and 1 in 3 patients with other rheumatology-related diseases, had increasingly vivid and distressing nightmares just before their hallucinations. These nightmares often involved falling or being attacked, trapped, or crushed or committing murder. \u201cI\u2019d be riding a horse, going around cutting people out with my sword. One of them was somebody attacking me and I ended up slitting their throat,\u201d the English patient said. \u201cI\u2019m not a violent person at all. I don\u2019t even kill an insect,\u201d the patient continued. \u201cAnd I came to the conclusion that\u2019s probably me fighting my own (autoimmune) system. \u2026 I\u2019m probably attacking myself, that\u2019s the only thing I can logically make sense out of it. Systemic autoimmune diseases often have a range of symptoms, called prodromes, that appear as signs of a sudden and possibly dangerous worsening of the condition. In lupus, for example, headaches, an increase in fatigue, painful, swollen joints, rashes, dizziness and a fever without an infection are well-known signs of an upcoming flare. Recognizing these warning signs are important, Sloan said, because they allow \u201cearlier detection and therefore treatment of flares, some of which can be organ damaging and even fatal in lupus patients.\u201d However, unique warning symptoms such as nightmares and daymares are not in the diagnostic criteria for lupus or other diseases, Sloan said. The study found doctors infrequently ask about such experiences, and patients often avoid talking about them to their physicians. \u201cWe are strongly encouraging more doctors to ask about nightmares and other neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 thought to be unusual, but actually very common in systemic autoimmunity \u2014 to help us detect disease flares earlier,\u201d said senior study author David D\u2019Cruz, a consultant rheumatologist at Guy\u2019s Hospital and Kings College London. Connect the dots to autoimmune disease On first glance, it would make sense that such neurological manifestations as nightmares would occur if the autoimmune disease impacts the brain, which lupus often does, Sloan said. But that\u2019s not what the study uncovered. \u201cInterestingly, we found that lupus patients who were classified as having organ involvement other than the brain, such as kidneys or lungs, often also reported a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the lead up to their kidney/lung flare,\u201d Sloan said via email. \u201cThis suggests that monitoring these symptoms \u2014 such as nightmares and changing mood \u2014 as well as the usual rashes and protein in the urine (due to inflammation in the kidneys), etc., may help with earlier flare detection in many patients, not just those who go on to develop major brain involvement,\u201d she said. However, there is no reason for people with occasional nightmares or daytime dreams to be worried they may have an inflammatory autoimmune disease, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. \u201cThis study could alarm the general public into believing or worrying\u00a0about whether they have lupus or a related autoimmune disorder if they have nightmares or hallucinations, which are what doctors call \u2018nonspecific symptoms,\u2019 meaning that a variety of conditions (medical and psychiatric) can manifest with these symptoms,\u201d Schenck said in an email. It is indeed \u201cperfectly normal\u201d to have occasional nightmares and even daymares, or hallucinations, which \u201care also more common than we think,\u201d Sloan said. However, if those are intense, upsetting and occur around other symptoms such as extreme fatigue, headaches and other signs of autoimmune disorders, they \u201cshould be discussed with a doctor,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be afraid or embarrassed to talk about these symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases, reporting these symptoms earlier, even if they seem strange and unconnected, may lead to the doctor being able to \u2018join the dot\u2019s\u2019 to diagnose an autoimmune disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_health_black-bear-kabobs-trichinellosis", "text": "It was supposed to be a celebration, but one family\u2019s unique meal of black bear meat sent several members to the hospital instead. The celebration happened in summer 2022, according to the account in the latest edition of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. An extended family \u2013 unnamed in the report \u2013 came from across the country for a reunion in South Dakota. One family member, a hunter, brought some black bear meat that he had harvested in northern Saskatchewan in May 2022. The hunter said that the hunting outfitter had recommended freezing the meat to kill any potential parasites. The meat had been frozen for 45 days before it was thawed, and the family grilled it with some vegetables and served it as kebabs. Freezing can kill some parasites commonly found in black bears, but according to the World Organisation for Animal Health, some species of parasites are freeze-tolerant. Bears and other wildlife including wild boar, wolves and squirrels can often get sick with trichinellosis, a serious disease caused by parasitic roundworms of the genus Trichinella, but they will often appear perfectly healthy. When butchering the meat, it would be difficult to tell if it was contaminated because there are few signs of the parasite. Many wildlife experts tell bear hunters to consider all bear meat infected, and the CDC recommends cooking the meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill the parasites. Smoking, salting, drying and microwaving do not always kill them, experts say. The meat at the family reunion was initially served rare, but that was not the chef\u2019s intention, the CDC said. Rather, it was \u201cdifficult for the family members to visually ascertain the level of doneness\u201d because the meat was dark in color. After some of the family noticed that it was undercooked, they put it back on the grill before it was served again. It wasn\u2019t until after people had gone home that some started to get sick. The first illness was in a 29-year-old man who had to be hospitalized twice over a\u00a0three-week period. He reported symptoms of severe muscle pain and a fever, and his eyes became swollen. Blood tests showed that he had eosinophilia, a condition involving too many eosinophils in the body, a signal to doctors that someone could have allergies, cancer or parasites. It wasn\u2019t until his second trip to the hospital that doctors learned the man had eaten bear meat and suspected that he may have trichinellosis. Tests soon confirmed that that was the case, and tests were recommended for the other family members. Trichinellosis can be a light or severe infection, and the symptoms can depend on where the larvae migrate to in the body. Light infections may not have noticeable symptoms, according to the CDC. If the parasite moves into the gastrointestinal tract, it can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea or vomiting. In muscle, it can cause a fever, rashes, conjunctivitis and facial puffiness. Occasionally, there may be life-threatening symptoms including heart problems, trouble with the central nervous symptom and breathing issues. Among the eight family members whom investigators interviewed, six had symptoms that were consistent with trichinellosis. Four had eaten bear meat and vegetables, but the other two had eaten only vegetables cooked with the meat. Three family members had to be hospitalized. The hospitalized people got trichinellosis-directed treatment with albendazole, an antiparasitic drug. Those who were not hospitalized received only supportive care since their symptoms had resolved before it was determined they had the infection. Everyone has since recovered. In the course of the investigation, CDC labs received samples of the frozen bear meat and found Trichinella larvae, and the hunter was advised to discard any remaining meat. The CDC also informed the Public Health Agency of Canada about the outbreak since the bear had come from that country. The CDC says it\u2019s important that game meat \u2013 particularly wild game harvested in northern latitudes \u2013 be cooked thoroughly. Since meat that is contaminated with Trichinella can cross-contaminate other foods, raw meat should be stored and prepared separately from other foods.\u00a0The CDC also recommends that government agencies and private groups that organize or oversee hunting should educate hunters about these risks and how to protect themselves.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/black-bear-kabobs-trichinellosis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}

Then, a physical education teacher instructed the 12-year-old to run outside on a day when the temperature climbed to\u00a0107 degrees. \u201cWe lose loved ones all the time, but he was taken in a horrific way,\u201d his mother, Janee Robinson, said from the family\u2019s Inland Empire home, about 80 miles southeast of Los Angeles. \u201cI would never want nobody to go through what I\u2019m going through.\u201d The day her son died, Robinson, who teaches phys ed, kept her elementary school students inside, and she had hoped her children\u2019s teachers would do the same. The Riverside County Coroner\u2019s Bureau ruled that Yahushua died on Aug. 29 of a heart defect, with heat and physical exertion as contributing factors. His death at Canyon Lake Middle School came on the second day of an excessive heat warning, when people were\u00a0advised to avoid strenuous activities\u00a0and limit their time outdoors. Yahushua\u2019s family is supporting\u00a0a bill\u00a0in California that would require the state Department of Education to create guidelines that govern physical activity at public schools during extreme weather, including setting threshold temperatures for when it\u2019s too hot or too cold for students to exercise or play sports outside. If the measure becomes law, the guidelines will have to be in place by Jan. 1, 2026. Many states have adopted protocols to protect student athletes from extreme heat during practices. But the California bill is broader and would require educators to consider all students throughout the school day and in any extreme weather, whether they\u2019re doing jumping jacks in fourth period or playing tag during recess. It\u2019s unclear if the bill will clear a critical committee vote scheduled for May 16. \u201cYahushua\u2019s story, it\u2019s very touching. It\u2019s very moving. I think it could have been prevented had we had the right safeguards in place,\u201d said state Sen. Melissa Hurtado (D-Bakersfield), one of the bill\u2019s authors. \u201cClimate change is impacting everyone, but it\u2019s especially impacting vulnerable communities, especially our children.\u201d Last year marked the planet\u2019s warmest on record, and extreme weather is becoming more frequent and severe, according to the\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Even though most heat deaths and illnesses are preventable, about\u00a01,220 people in the United States are killed by extreme heatevery year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Young children are especially\u00a0susceptible to heat illness\u00a0because their bodies have more trouble regulating temperature, and they rely on adults to protect them from overheating. A person can go from feeling dizzy or experiencing a headache to passing out, having a seizure, or going into a coma, said\u00a0Chad Vercio, a physician and the division chief of general pediatrics at Loma Linda University Health. \u201cIt can be a really dangerous thing,\u201d Vercio said of heat illness. \u201cIt is something that we should take seriously and figure out what we can do to avoid that.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many children have died at school from heat exposure. Eric Robinson, 15, had been sitting in his sports medicine class learning about heatstroke when his sister arrived at his high school unexpectedly the day their brother died. \u201cThey said, \u2018OK, go home, Eric. Go home early.\u2019 I walked to the car and my sister\u2019s crying. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that my little brother\u2019s gone. That I won\u2019t be able to see him again. And he\u2019d always bugged me, and I would say, \u2018Leave me alone.\u2019\u201d That morning, Eric had done Yahushua\u2019s hair and loaned him his hat and chain necklace to wear to school. As temperatures climbed into the 90s that morning, a physical education teacher instructed Yahushua to run on the blacktop. His friends told the family that the sixth grader had repeatedly asked the teacher for water but was denied, his parents said. The school district has refused to release video footage to the family showing the moment Yahushua collapsed on the blacktop. He died later that day at the hospital. Melissa Valdez, a Lake Elsinore Unified School District spokesperson, did not respond to calls seeking comment. Schoolyards can reach\u00a0dangerously high temperatures\u00a0on hot days, with asphalt sizzling up to 145 degrees, according to findings by researchers at the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. Some school districts, such as\u00a0San Diego Unified and\u00a0Santa Ana Unified, have hot weather plans or guidelines that call for limiting physical activity and providing water to kids. But there are no statewide standards that K-12 schools must implement to protect students from heat illness. Under the bill, the California Department of Education must set temperature thresholds requiring schools to modify students\u2019 physical activities during extreme weather, such as heat waves, wildfires, excessive rain, and flooding. Schools would also be required to come up with plans for alternative indoor activities, and staff must be trained to recognize and respond to weather-related distress. California has had heat rules on the books for outdoor workers since 2005, but it was a latecomer to\u00a0protecting student athletes, according to the\u00a0Korey Stringer Institute\u00a0at the University of Connecticut, which is named after a Minnesota Vikings football player who died from heatstroke in 2001. By comparison, Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, this spring\u00a0signed a law\u00a0preventing cities and counties from creating their own heat protections for outdoor workers, has the best protections for student athletes, according to the institute. Douglas Casa, a professor of kinesiology and the chief executive officer of the institute, said state regulations can establish consistency about how to respond to heat distress and save lives. \u201cThe problem is that each high school doesn\u2019t have a cardiologist and doesn\u2019t have a thermal physiologist and doesn\u2019t have a sickling expert,\u201d Casa said of the medical specialties for heat illness. In 2022, California released an\u00a0Extreme Action Heat Plan\u00a0that recommended state agencies \u201cexplore implementation of indoor and outdoor heat exposure rules for schools,\u201d but neither the administration of Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, nor lawmakers have adopted standards. Lawmakers last year failed to pass legislation that would have required schools to implement a heat plan and replace hot surfaces, such as cement and rubber, with lower-heat surfaces, such as grass and cool pavement.\u00a0That bill, which drew opposition from school administrators, stalled in committee, in part over cost concerns. Naj Alikhan, a spokesperson for the Association of California School Administrators, said the new bill takes a different approach and would not require structural and physical changes to schools. The association has not taken a position on the measure, and no other organization has registered opposition. The Robinson family said children\u2019s lives ought to outweigh any costs that might come with preparing schools to deal with the growing threat of extreme weather. Yahushua\u2018s death, they say, could save others. \u201cI really miss him. I cry every day,\u201d said Yahushua\u2019s father, Eric Robinson. \u201cThere\u2019s no one day that go by that I don\u2019t cry about my boy.\u201d KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/california-phys-ed-heat-rules-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_health_summer-health-safety-memorial-day-wellness", "text": "Memorial Day is here, and soon summer will arrive. The threat of some diseases, such as Covid-19 is receding, though there are\u00a0new coronavirus variants to keep an eye on, and a second\u00a0human case of the bird flu has just been detected in the United States. With Memorial Day gatherings getting underway in the US, how worried should people be about the coronavirus and bird flu? Knowing that there are outbreaks of bird flu among poultry and cows, is it safe to keep drinking milk and eating eggs? Are there any special precautions to take while preparing hamburgers? What are other major health issues to consider over the holidays and leading into the summer, such as keeping cool to avoid heatstroke? To help us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University, and she previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: Given the spread of avian flu and new coronavirus variants, is there anything we should do?\u00a0 Dr. Leana Wen:\u00a0Though there are\u00a0new coronavirus variants, the level of coronavirus activity in the United States is quite low. People should\u00a0assess their risk\u00a0of severe illness if they were to contract Covid-19. Those at high risk, such as those who are elderly or with chronic medical conditions, should be sure that they are up to date with vaccines and have a plan for accessing antiviral treatment. They should test if they experience symptoms, and so should others with whom they have close contact. Those who want to reduce their risk of contracting the coronavirus and other respiratory viruses further should try to attend outdoor rather than indoor gatherings when possible. When traveling in crowded airports and train stations, they could consider wearing well-fitting N95 or equivalent masks. Regarding bird flu, the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0continues to advise that the risk to Americans is low at this time. That\u2019s because there have only been\u00a0two human cases\u00a0this year, and both have been in farmworkers with direct exposure to infected cattle. Both individuals had mild symptoms, and there have been no cases of human-to-human transmission during this outbreak. People who work in the poultry and dairy industry and who otherwise come into regular contact with wild birds, backyard flocks and cows should heed the\u00a0CDC\u2019s guidance\u00a0and wear personal protective equipment when working with animals. Health care providers should be on the lookout for farmworkers with possible flulike symptoms. Other people do not need to change their behaviors at this time, and they certainly should not worry about infection with avian flu during Memorial Day or early summer gatherings. CNN: Does that mean it\u2019s still safe to keep drinking milk and eating eggs and meat? Wen:\u00a0Yes. The US Food and Drug Administration has\u00a0issued guidance\u00a0that pasteurized milk is safe to drink.\u00a0Viral fragments have been in found in the commercial milk supply; however, these were not live viruses that could cause infections. Pasteurization kills viruses, including the influenza virus. Similarly, testing by the US Department of Agriculture found\u00a0no live virus\u00a0in hamburgers cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit. The agency advises that\u00a0cooked eggs and poultry\u00a0are also safe to eat. This, of course, does not mean that people should consume raw or undercooked meat. These meats harbor a whole variety of pathogens, including bacteria like E. coli and salmonella. In addition, raw milk is not safe to drink. This, too, can harbor bacteria. Moreover, one hypothesis for how avian flu is being transmitted is through raw milk. People should not consume unpasteurized milk or products made from raw milk. CNN: How does this translate to gatherings? Is it OK to eat hamburgers and hot dogs, and enjoy barbecues and buffets? Wen:\u00a0Yes! Make sure to follow\u00a0general precautions\u00a0around preventing foodborne illnesses. Cook meat to the\u00a0recommended internal temperatures. Be aware of what containers or utensils come into contact with raw meat and keep clean utensils separate from dirty ones. Refrigerate meat until ready to cook. If you use a cooler, make sure to have an insulated one with lots of ice. And wash your hands often and well. CNN: We\u2019ve talked a lot about infections. What\u00a0are other major health issues to consider over the holidays and leading into the summer, such as keeping cool to prevent heatstroke? Wen:\u00a0When the weather gets hot outside, we have to watch out for the\u00a0effects of high temperatures on health. Heatstroke occurs when someone has a body temperature above 103 degrees Fahrenheit and can no longer effectively cool themselves. This is a medical emergency and can quickly become fatal. People should be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion, which can progress to heatstroke. They should watch out for those most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses. That includes children and the elderly and other individuals with medical conditions that reduce their ability to regulate their body temperatures. When high temperatures are forecast, everyone \u2014 especially the most vulnerable \u2014 should try to stay inside in air-conditioned spaces or under the shade if they are outdoors. They should keep hydrated and immediately seek shelter in a cool place if they develop symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, muscle aches and tiredness. CNN: And we can\u2019t forget skin protection, right? Wen:\u00a0Absolutely.\u00a0Skin cancer\u00a0is the most common cancer in the United States. One of the key risk factors is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Everyone should take steps to reduce their UV exposure. These include staying in the shade, wearing a hat and using\u00a0broad-spectrum sunscreen\u00a0with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Speaking of prevention, summers are often a period of the year when people have more time on their hands. I advise everyone to take this chance and follow up with their physician on all their health concerns. Now is the time to make sure they are up to date on\u00a0cancer screenings and to get chronic medical concerns, like high blood pressure and diabetes, under good control.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/summer-health-safety-memorial-day-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_health_meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness", "text": "Twenty years ago, Dan Harris appeared to have it all. He had joined ABC News in 2000 by age 29, and had covered the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, in addition to other historic events around the world. What viewers didn\u2019t see was the tumult behind the scenes: Harris experiencing depression from his time as a war correspondent and anxiety from working in a high-pressure industry. He tried to stay afloat by using cocaine, ecstasy and prescription sleeping pills. It would all come crashing down on June 7, 2004, when Harris had to sub for anchor Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. While reporting news updates, he had a nationally televised panic attack that \u201cwas the direct result of an extended run of mindlessness, a period of time during which I was focused on advancement and adventure, to the detriment of pretty much everything else,\u201d Harris wrote in his 2014 book, \u201c10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works.\u201d But this moment, though frightening, would be the catalyst for a journey that propelled him from anguish, drug abuse and being a meditation skeptic to mindfulness \u2014 and to a total occupational overhaul. Now, his career focus is meditation and happiness, and helping others struggling with the thought traps keeping them from a more mindful life. It did take a few years for him to get to meditation, after trying out different psychiatrists and therapy. Before Harris began meditating in summer 2009, \u201cI had no real understanding of it except for a baseline reflexive hostility,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was I raised by atheists, but they were also recovering hippies. They had forced me to do yoga and go to granola health food stores, and we did a lot of camping, and I just found all that sh*t very annoying.\u201d Raised by scientists, Harris was convinced by seeing the scientific research on meditation \u2014 studies that showed meditation can lower blood pressure, boost your immune system, and alleviate anxiety and depression. A regular practice can also rewire brain regions associated with stress, focus, compassion and self-awareness, science has shown. He also credits the work of Dr. Mark Epstein, a psychiatrist and Buddhist then in private practice in Manhattan, and Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, another scientist who teaches a secularized form of Buddhist meditation and is a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Masschusetts Medical School. (In the preface of the recently released 10th anniversary edition of his book, Harris acknowledges how the focus on Western scientists and gurus devalues the contributions of Asian and Asian American people, and how he has been complicit and tried to rectify these mistakes.) Harris is now a meditation expert himself. \u201cI find that I just am less yanked around by my urges and thoughts and emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I screw up, I\u2019m quicker to apologize. I\u2019m more focused on the baseline level of calm that I didn\u2019t have before.\u201d When it comes to the benefits, perfection isn\u2019t one of them, he noted. \u201cI retain the capacity to be a schmuck,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s more like you can get better with a little bit of work over time. And that work will build on itself \u2014 the 10% compounds annually.\u201d \u00a0 Harris tackled some common barriers to trying meditation for CNN and suggested how you can overcome them. Change \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll try\u2019 One of the most common excuses people have for not meditating is thinking they won\u2019t be able to focus or sit still long enough. But Harris contends that if you notice you\u2019re getting distracted while meditating, that\u2019s actually \u201cproof that you\u2019re doing it right.\u201d Distractibility is an evolutionarily beneficial aspect of the human condition, as it keeps us safe, he added. \u201cClearing your mind is impossible unless you\u2019re enlightened, or you have died.\u201d Therefore, the active \u201cseeing of the distraction is proof of success,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause what you want over time in meditation is to understand how the mind works.\u201d \u201cThe whole point of meditation is not to stop thinking \u2014 it\u2019s to focus on one thing, usually the breath coming in and going out. And then every time you get distracted, you start again and again and again,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat starting over is like a bicep curl for your brain, and that\u2019s the mechanism by which the brain changes.\u201d Getting familiar with the fact that you\u2019re thinking is key for developing the skill of recognizing thoughts or feelings and intentionally choosing what to do about them, rather than unconsciously and automatically reacting. It\u2019s similar to when you\u2019re exercising for the first time, and the first couple weeks might be challenging, Harris said. Then it can get easier, but it\u2019s not supposed to be effortless. Others feel they can\u2019t find the time or don\u2019t know where to start. But when you want to form a habit, the best move is to start small, Harris said. Start at one minute of meditation daily for a couple weeks before increasing your time, he recommends. Over time, you might notice yourself moving from extrinsic motivation \u2014 such as being advised to do it or reading the research on it \u2014 to the intrinsic motivation that helps you maintain the habit because you feel it\u2019s helping you. There are many free or inexpensive resources that can help you get started, such as those on apps, YouTube or Harris\u2019 own website, or in books, he said. And some cities have meditation or mindfulness centers where you can learn from a teacher and practice with others \u2014 another great way to maintain a habit since it keeps you accountable. The fear of being well Some people are also of the mindset that \u201cthe only way to survive is to be, like, constantly neurotic\u201d lest they lose their edge or ambition, Harris said. But consider prominent and successful advocates for meditation that include athletes, musicians, TV hosts or corporate executives, such as LeBron James, Oprah Winfrey, Arianna Huffington, Jerry Seinfeld, LinkedIn Executive Chairman Jeff Weiner and ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. \u201cDo these people seem like they\u2019ve lost their edge?\u201d Harris said. \u201cDo you think your edge will go away if you\u2019re more focused, less emotionally reactive and a little bit calmer during stressful situations? No, actually the opposite is true.\u201d READ MORE: One habit could reduce your fears of public speaking, criticism, failure and more Harris\u2019 own story is also a testament to how your relationship to work or your values can change once you have reached a healthier place \u2014 and how the success in that newfound reality can be different, but maybe even better or more fulfilling, than what you had imagined or planned. \u201cThis is not the version of success the pre-meditation version of me thought was what I wanted. I wanted to stay in network news and climb as high as I could,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut this opened up a whole new realm for me. I publish books, have my own podcasts and social media feeds, and I continue to have opportunities. I started a company, and I\u2019m exploring a new one. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more potential than I had imagined, and I am absolutely not less ambitious.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/health/meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn", "text": "Maybe you spotted one crawling up your leg after a hike through tall grass or felt one on your dog\u2019s back as you ran your hand through its fur. If you\u2019re unlucky, maybe you found one already burrowing into your skin, engorged with your blood. Ticks are parasitic bloodsuckers, capable of spreading deadly disease, and they\u2019re becoming increasingly common. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. Ticks 101 Ticks are arachnids, close cousins of mites and more distant cousins of spiders. There are\u00a0more than 800 species of ticks found around the world, and 84 that have been documented in the United States. However, only a handful in the US bite and transmit diseases to humans. The most common ones are blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks, but they feed on lots of animals besides deer), lone star ticks, American dog ticks and brown dog ticks. After a tick egg hatches, it goes through three life stages: larva, nymph and adult. Both male and female ticks feed on blood by inserting their barbed, straw-like mouthparts into the skin of their host (unlike mosquitoes, which only bite if they\u2019re females preparing to lay eggs). However, only female ticks drink to the point that they become engorged. \u201cWhen you see a super big and engorged female, that means she\u2019s going to be laying eggs and starting that life cycle process over again,\u201d said Kait Chapman, an extension educator and urban entomologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These arachnids change dramatically in size and appearance based on how old they are and how much blood they\u2019ve drunk. \u201cThe nymph blacklegged tick, if you put these unfed ones on a poppy seed bagel, they blend in quite nicely,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island and director of that school\u2019s Center for Vector-Borne Disease and its TickEncounter Resource Center. Meanwhile, an engorged adult female of the same species can swell to the size of a pea. Tick bites and diseases While there are some months when different species and life stages are more active, it\u2019s possible to get bitten by a tick any time of year. If you find a tick attached to you (or your pet), you should remove it carefully. \u201cThe recommendation is that you use a pair of tweezers, get the tick by its head as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to twist, because we could leave part of that mouthpart embedded in the skin. And we don\u2019t want to grab the body because if you squeeze the body the tick could regurgitate more, which means that you\u2019re increasing your chance of getting tick-borne illness.\u201d Your impulse might be to squash the freshly removed tick, but it\u2019s better if you drown it with hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol and keep it to show to an expert or at least take a photo. That way, you can identify what kind of tick it is and how long it\u2019s been feeding; the University of Rhode Island\u2019s\u00a0TickEncounter website has tools\u00a0based on coloration, size and geographic location. It\u2019s important to identify the tick because certain species carry different diseases. They pick up bacteria, viruses and other microbes from the blood of infected hosts, and when they bite a new victim, they can pass those pathogens along. Blacklegged tick larvae and nymphs, for instance, often feed on white-footed mice,\u00a0which can carry a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. When a tick that\u2019s fed on one of these infected mice then feeds on a human, it can pass along that bacterium, which causes Lyme disease. Lone star ticks, on the other hand, don\u2019t feed on white-footed mice and consequently aren\u2019t carriers of Lyme. (They do carry other disease-causing microbes, though, and their bites can introduce a sugar molecule into the bloodstream that\u00a0makes people allergic to red meat.) In\u00a0a September 2023 study, researchers identified a protein that appears to play a big part in how some ticks \u2014 including the deer tick and the Western blacklegged tick \u2014 get infected by the harmful bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum before spreading it to human hosts and causing anaplasmosis, which is different from Lyme disease. Anaplasmosis can cause severe headaches, fever and chills, vomiting, and fatigue,\u00a0according to Cedars-Sinai. Understanding this protein may give scientists a better sense of how to stop the spread of the disease through ticks, the study said. But there is still a lot of research ahead before they get there. Preventing tick bites The diseases carried by ticks can be debilitating or even life-threatening, and the risk of infection increases the longer a tick has been on you. While there are some treatments available, it\u2019s best to avoid getting bitten in the first place. Various studies have suggested factors that could play a role in tick attraction, including a recent paper showing a\u00a0connection between tick attraction and static electricity\u00a0in a laboratory setting. And while ticks are attracted to cues such as the carbon dioxide exhaled by animals, they tend to lie in wait rather than actively seeking out their prey. \u201cContrary to popular belief, they don\u2019t fall from trees. They simply sit at the edge of a tall blade of grass, for example, that\u2019s maybe hanging over someplace, and they\u2019ll put their front leg out. We call that questing,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey will wait for that host to brush right by them, and so that\u2019s primarily how people get ticks: They brush by it; it attaches to their leg or their clothes.\u201d Insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus have been\u00a0approved by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0to protect against ticks. However, these chemicals work differently against ticks than they do against mosquitoes. For instance, DEET \u201cburns the feet of ticks, and they fall off because their feet are burning,\u201d as opposed to interfering with the tick\u2019s ability to find its prey the way DEET affects mosquitoes, Mather said. What\u2019s more, \u201cas soon as the product is dried, it doesn\u2019t burn as much, so it really doesn\u2019t last very long for ticks.\u201d Instead, Chapman recommends preventing tick bites by covering your skin and tucking the bottoms of your pants into your socks. Ticks also are killed by half an hour in the dryer, so toss your clothes in as soon as you get home, even before you wash them. What\u2019s more, \u201cwe favor\u00a0wearing treated clothes with permethrin\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s far, far more effective\u201d than bug spray, Mather said. \u201cIt blocks nerve conduction in ticks, and it makes them hyper-excited and then they just lose function pretty quickly, and it actually ends up killing them.\u201d Depending on where you live, he said, it might also make sense to investigate exterminating ticks living in your yard. These precautions might seem extreme, but to Mather, they\u2019re the way of the future, because \u201cwe live in a \u2018more ticks in more places\u2019 world, and more people are being exposed.\u201d Climate change may play some role\u00a0in the spread of ticks, but Mather said he believes that the influx of the parasites has more to do with white-tailed deer becoming more common in areas where higher densities of people live. As a result, he said, \u201cMore people are being exposed to the ticks that are reproducing on white-tailed deer.\u201d Despite the spread of ticks and the severity of illnesses that they can cause, Chapman stressed that with proper precautions (for you and your pets \u2014 ask your vet for tick preventatives), they shouldn\u2019t hold you hostage inside your home. \u201cYes, ticks exist. Yes, they can be a public health concern, but we don\u2019t want you to let ticks keep you indoors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should still be able to go outside and enjoy nature, but you just have to, once again, perform those tick checks.

Do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness", "text": "A new report details the role social media plays in the lives of young people, and how they manage the various pros and cons \u2014 including in the context of being a person of color or LGBTQ+, or having depression. Those benefits and drawbacks include valuing online platforms for social connection, self-expression and information, while also feeling the brunt of social media\u2019s effects on their attention span, confidence and contentedness, according to the report released Tuesday by Common Sense Media and Hopelab, a social innovation lab and impact investor aiming to support the well-being of young people. READ MORE: How to know if you have \u2018phone addiction\u2019 \u2014 and 12 ways to address it \u201cMost conversations and headlines surrounding social media and youth mental (health) focus solely on the harms, portraying young people as passive consumers. This research shows that it\u2019s much more complex,\u201d said Amy Green, head of research at Hopelab, in a news release. \u201cIf we truly want to improve the well-being of young people, we need to listen to their experiences and ensure that we do not inadvertently remove access to crucial positive benefits.\u201d Also driving the research is the national youth mental health crisis, the authors said, marked by increasing rates of mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and antidepressant medications prescribed to youth. In conversations about these phenomena, social media has consistently been at the center, though mental health issues can have multiple contributing factors.\u00a0 Conducted by the NORC \u2014 previously called the National Opinion Research Center \u2014 at the University of Chicago, the research includes 1,274 teens (ages 14 to 17) and young adults (ages 18 to 22) recruited online between October and November 2023. The young people \u201cprovided direction and input regarding survey content\u201d and participated in focus groups and interviews to help the research team prioritize and interpret results, according to a news release. The report is the third in a series tracking the influence of social media on well-being among youth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The researchers found the rate of depressive symptoms among youth is about 10% down from pandemic highs but is still high and comparable to the elevated levels of 2018. Nearly half of young people reported experiencing any severity of depression, and nearly a third (28%) said they had moderate to severe symptoms. Additionally, about half of LGBTQ+ youth reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, compared to nearly one-quarter of their non-LGBTQ+ peers. Those with depression were more susceptible to social comparison and pressure to show their best selves on social media. But they were also more likely to find resources to support their well-being and curate their feeds for this purpose \u2014 done by selecting a \u201cnot interested\u201d button on content they don\u2019t like, flagging inappropriate or offensive content, or blocking someone whose content bothered them. These youth also positively curated feeds by \u201cliking\u201d and spending more time on content they did enjoy, since many social media algorithms work by giving you more content based on your level of engagement with certain topics. This was especially important for LGBTQ+ youth who, along with Black and Latinx young people, faced more exposure to harassment and stress online. \u201cIn focus groups, Black youth told us their experiences with in-person harassment lowered their tolerance for similar behavior on social media, and meant they were more willing to give up the benefits to protect themselves from hateful comments,\u201d said lead researcher Amanda Lenhart, head of research at Common Sense Media, via email. The findings confirm what many researchers have seen scientifically and anecdotally, said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association, via email. Prinstein wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Social media and mental health Many participants also revealed the positives they gain from social media, citing online platforms as a place to seek support and advice; decompress; connect with loved ones and others who share their experiences, interests or identities; stay informed; and keep up with their favorite influencers or content creators. \u201cAnother important finding is the importance of social media as a space of connection, creativity and professional opportunities for Black youth,\u201d Lenhart said. Dr. Douglas Gentile, distinguished professor of psychology at Iowa State University, encouraged being \u201ccareful about interpreting (self-reported) data like these,\u201d he said via email. \u201cPeople are surprisingly bad at actually knowing what the effects of media use are on themselves,\u201d Gentile, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, added. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that anyone is lying. Just that we only see little pieces of how the media influence us.\u201d Nearly one-fourth of participants reported using social media almost constantly throughout the day, up 7% from the rate the authors found in their 2018 report, the authors found. Many young people reported an inability to control their use, social media distracting from other activities and unconsciously reaching for social media when bored. To counteract these behaviors, on top of customizing their feeds, many have also taken breaks from social media to avoid the temptation or deleted their accounts permanently. \u201cSocial media could offer (more) benefits to youth if it was designed with a primary focus on youth well-being rather than a focus on keeping kids engaged for as long as possible to make a profit from their data,\u201d Prinstein said. While, or after, using social media, try doing an emotional check-in, Lenhart said. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018How am I feeling right now? Did I see anything that made me feel sad?\u2019\u201d Taking a temporary or permanent break from the content causing the most distress could be helpful, Lenhart added, especially if you already struggle with depression. If you\u2019re a parent or guardian wondering how to best manage your teen\u2019s social media use, one of the most important things you can do is \u201ckeep communication channels open,\u201d Lenhart said. Parental involvement is important, as young adults have expressed regret that their parents allowed them to use social media so young, wishing they could go back and tell their parents to not give in to their demands, Prinstein said. Ask the teens in your life what they like about these platforms and what types of connections or activities support their mental health, Lenhart said. Let them know you\u2019re there to help figure out a solution if social media is upsetting them or interfering with other responsibilities. Respect \u201cthat each young person is an expert in their own lived experience,\u201d Lenhart said. \u201cYoung people are valuable teachers in their own right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}

Florida enacted a new law\u00a0on May 1, 2024, that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, with\u00a0a few exceptions\u00a0\u2013 including documented rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Florida joins the majority of\u00a0Southern states\u00a0that now have complete bans or highly restrictive abortion laws, enacted since the Supreme Court overturned the\u00a0federal right to get an abortion\u00a0in June 2022. Many of the restrictive laws ban abortion after a set number of weeks. Florida Republicans supporting the bill have labeled it a\u00a0reasonable compromise between a full abortion ban and few abortion restrictions. READ MORE: Mexico is a destination for Americans seeking reproductive health services  Some OB-GYNs\u00a0have explained that\u00a0many women\u00a0do not even know they are pregnant at\u00a0six weeks.\u00a0Research shows that women\u00a0on average find out they are pregnant at five and a half weeks. About 23% do not know until seven weeks of pregnancy or later. So, do Americans, including those enacting six-week bans, actually understand how the timing or dating of pregnancy works? We are\u00a0scholars\u00a0of\u00a0political science,\u00a0gender and public opinion\u00a0and are writing a book about public opinion on abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the federal right to get an abortion in June 2022. How does pregnancy work? To gain insights into this issue, we developed a few pregnancy questions and included them in a research survey in late September 2023. The survey had 1,356 respondents, who were broadly representative of the U.S. population. The respondents\u2019 median age was 46. Approximately 49% of these people were men, while 70% were white and 29% were college graduates. Meanwhile, 43% of them were Democrats, and 38% were Republicans. READ MORE: Fetal personhood rulings could nullify a pregnant patient\u2019s wishes for\u00a0end-of-life\u00a0care The first question asked respondents how pregnancies are dated.\u00a0The correct answer\u00a0is that pregnancies are dated using the first day of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period, which is often two to three weeks before conception. The second question asked about trimesters. Many Americans are familiar with the term trimester, and\u00a0polling consistently shows\u00a0that Americans find abortion most acceptable during the first trimester. We asked Americans if they knew approximately how many weeks a trimester was. The correct answer is 13. Americans\u2019 pregnancy knowledge We found that only one-third of respondents knew how pregnancy is dated. A majority \u2013 approximately 60% \u2013 falsely thought that pregnancy is dated from conception or in the weeks since the woman last had sex. Less than one-fourth of the respondents answered both pregnancy knowledge questions correctly. In our survey, we also asked respondents whether they support a six-week abortion ban. Similar to other\u00a0national surveys, we find that most Americans oppose strict abortion restrictions \u2013 only 35% support six-week bans. Importantly, we find that those who support six-week abortion bans are significantly less likely than others to correctly understand the timing of pregnancy. The statistically significant relationship between having low levels of pregnancy timing knowledge and support for a six-week abortion ban holds in analyses controlling for potentially confounding variables. Some anti-abortion lawmakers\u00a0have demonstrated\u00a0their\u00a0ignorance\u00a0about pregnancy\u00a0before. There is, for example, a long history of some anti-abortion politicians saying, incorrectly, that it is\u00a0extremely rare\u00a0for a person who is raped to get pregnant. Our survey shows that a large swath of those opposing abortion lack knowledge about the basics of pregnancy. A gender disparity Perhaps not surprisingly, women in this survey knew more about pregnancy than men. The question about how pregnancies are dated, for example, was answered correctly by 43% of women compared with only 23% of men. As mentioned above, a majority of Americans incorrectly believe pregnancy is dated from conception, but significantly more men than women think this is true. This finding is particularly important when considering the gender breakdown of the Florida state lawmakers who approved the six-week ban. Although we do not have data on the pregnancy knowledge of those legislators, we do know that those who voted for the ban were\u00a0overwhelmingly men. Florida\u2019s six-week ban will make it much harder for anyone to get abortions there \u2013 and it will also affect people in\u00a0neighboring states\u00a0who want or need an abortion. In 2023, Florida was home to the closest abortion clinic for\u00a06.4 million women\u00a0living in the South. In 2023,\u00a0around 7,700 women\u00a0from other Southern states,\u00a0where abortion is now largely banned, traveled to Florida to get abortions. Overall, our findings raise serious questions about whether Americans without medical training \u2013 much like those in our state legislatures \u2013 have the necessary knowledge needed to regulate abortion access.

{"id": "2024_05_20_health_meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging doctors to be on the lookout for potentially deadly meningococcal disease linked to travel to Saudi Arabia. Since April, there have been 12 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease associated with travel for Umrah, an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad in Saudi Arabia. Believers in the Muslim faith make Umrah trips to Mecca throughout the year to receive blessings. Muslims also make a longer, more ritualized pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime during a set time of year called Hajj. This year\u2019s Hajj is June 14 to 19. Five of the pilgrims who got sick this year live in the United States. France has had four cases, and the United Kingdom has had three. Ten of the people who got sick had been to Mecca, and two had a close association with someone who did. Meningococcal disease is highly contagious among unvaccinated people. Of the patients whose vaccination status is known, nine were unvaccinated. Meningococcal disease, including meningitis, is an uncommon illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. It can cause infection in the lining of the brain and spinal cord that can cause a lifetime of medical problems such as memory and concentration issues, seizures, balance problems, hearing loss and blindness. The disease can also lead to a serious blood infection called septicemia or blood poisoning. Research shows that\u00a0an estimated\u00a010% to 15% of cases end in death, even with appropriate treatment. The number of cases in the US has been on the rise, according to the CDC. This year, 143 cases were reported as of the end of March, compared with 81 for the same period last year. There were 422 cases in all of 2023, the most since 2014, according to the CDC. Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics if it\u2019s caught early enough. However, diagnosis is often delayed because the symptoms can mimic those of other infectious diseases like Covid-19 or the flu. Symptoms include fever, a headache, nausea or vomiting, trouble walking, a stiff neck, a skin rash, sensitivity to light and brain fog. Tests of the bacteria in the newly confirmed cases showed that in one case in the US and one in France, it was resistant to ciprofloxacin, one of the first-line antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease. Eight cases responded to treatment with penicillin or ciprofloxacin. Vaccines and boosters available Saudi Arabia requires all Umrah or Hajj pilgrims age 1 and older to have gotten the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine, also known as the meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccine.\u00a0It protects against four variations of the bacteria that are in wide circulation:\u00a0A, C, W, and Y. Overall, most cases in the US are related to serogroup Y. In the US, doctors may also recommend the MenB vaccine to protect against the B-variation of the bacteria. A shot made by Pfizer that was approved in the US last year, Penbraya, protects against all five of these most common serogroups that cause meningococcal disease. Most of the pilgrims who got sick tested positive for the W variation. One case in the United States was caused by serogroup C. In the US, the vaccine is routinely recommended for all preteens and teens\u00a0and for some younger children and adults under specific circumstances. One such instance is before travel to countries where meningococcal disease is more common. This includes a recommendation for a booster if the last time a traveler got the shot was three to five or more years before their trip. The CDC said Monday that health care providers should work with patients who are considering travel for Hajj or Umrah to make sure they have received the MenACWY vaccine within the past five years or get the shot at least 10 days before they leave for their trip. In the new notice, which was issued through the CDC\u2019s Health Alert Network, the agency also reminded providers to suspect meningococcal disease in anyone who has symptoms after recent travel for Hajj or Umrah. The CDC told health departments and providers to consider using several of the preferred antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease in people associated with travel to Mecca. People who come into close contact with someone with meningococcal disease should get an antibiotic as soon as possible after exposure, regardless of their vaccination status, the CDC said, and ideally within a day after the initial patient has been identified. The most recent outbreak connected to a mass gathering was in 2000-01, the CDC said, and it was primarily caused by the W variation of the bacteria. It\u2019s only since 2002 that Saudi Arabia has required all pilgrims to provide proof of vaccination against meningococcal disease, but vaccination coverage among these travelers is \u201cknown to be incomplete,\u201d the CDC said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}

Can you picture the scene? The ability to remember things that happened to you in the past, especially to go back and recall little incidental details, is a hallmark of what psychologists call episodic memory \u2014 and new research indicates that it\u2019s an ability humans may share with birds called Eurasian jays. With episodic memory, \u201cyou\u2019re remembering an event or an episode, hence the name,\u201d said James Davies, first author of the study that appeared May 15 in the journal PLOS One. \u201cYou kind of mentally relive it. It also involves other kinds of details that make up that experience, so sounds, sights, even your thoughts or your mood at the time.\u201d Episodic memory differs from semantic memory, which is the recall of factual information, added Davies, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Comparative Cognition Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s often helpful to think about episodic memory as remembering, whereas semantic memory is just knowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really a conscious recall involved.\u201d While episodic memory is integral to how most people experience the world, it can be difficult for scientists to prove whether nonhuman animals share this ability \u2014 after all, they can\u2019t tell us what they\u2019re thinking. However, for several decades, scientists have been devising experiments to delve into animals\u2019 ability to remember previous events, and they have found evidence of episodic-like memory in creatures as varied as pigeons, dogs and cuttlefish. Corvids \u2014 the group of birds that includes crows, ravens and jays \u2014 are famously smart, and previous studies have suggested that they are capable of episodic-like memory, which may help them find bits of food that they\u2019ve hidden for later. In 1998, Dr. Nicola Clayton devised an experiment with scrub jays in which the birds appeared to remember what kinds of foods they\u2019d hidden in different spots and how long ago. This means of finding evidence of episodic-like recall \u2014 called a \u201cwhat, when, where\u201d protocol \u2014 has become standard among scientists studying animal memory. But Davies, who is Clayton\u2019s advisee, wanted to find other ways to test for this cognitive capability. \u201cIf you\u2019re only using one methodology, then potentially there\u2019s some error in that method,\u201d Davies said. \u201cIf you use multiple different methodologies that test the same thing in quite different ways, then that leads to much more conclusive evidence.\u201d The researchers devised a fresh approach involving Eurasian jays,\u00a0and what they found could have implications for the study of human memory. Testing incidental memory Davies and Clayton\u2019s new experimental design drew upon the concept of incidental memory. \u201cThe idea is that with human episodic memory, we remember details of events that, at the time, weren\u2019t necessarily relevant to anything. We weren\u2019t actively trying to remember this,\u201d Davies said. \u201cBut then if you were to be asked about it a few days later, you might remember those details.\u201d It\u2019s a seemingly unimportant bit of information that you didn\u2019t consciously commit to memory \u2014 for instance, remembering what you had for lunch yesterday. This aspect of episodic memory is sometimes referred to as \u201cmental time travel.\u201d To find out whether Eurasian jays are capable of mental time travel, the researchers worked with birds that had been trained to find food hidden under cups. Davies set out a row of four identical red plastic cups and allowed the birds to observe him putting a piece of food under one of the cups. The jays then had to recall which cup the food had been hidden under. Easy enough. For the next step of the experiment, Davies made little changes to the cups\u2019 appearances, such as adding stickers or colorful strings, but once again hid the food under the same cup in the lineup. For a bird looking for a treat, those strings and stickers were seemingly unimportant incidental info \u2014 at this point, they only needed to worry about the position of the cup to find the food. But in the final stage of the experiment, those little details of cup decoration became unexpectedly important. Davies changed the position of the cups so that the birds could no longer rely on the once-crucial information of which cup in the row contained food. (The treats had since been removed from the cups, to rule out the possibility that the birds were just finding the food by scent.) However, after a 10-minute break, the jays were still able to find the cups with the treats. Davies suggested that the birds\u2019 mental process might have involved asking themselves, \u201c\u2018Where\u2019s the food? I remember going to the one with the black square on it. I\u2019ll go to that one,\u2019\u201d Davies said. The jays appeared to be going back in their memories to retrieve details about the cup decorations, and they were highly successful in using that information to find the hidden food. \u201cThis study provides strong evidence for episodic memory in Eurasian jays,\u201d said Dr. Jonathon Crystal, a provost professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Indiana Bloomington who was not involved with the project. \u201cIf you can answer that unexpected question after incidental encoding, that becomes a strong argument that you can remember back in time to the earlier episode, which is at the heart of documenting episodic memory.\u201d Crystal said that studies such as this one, which aim to identify animals\u2019 abilities to form episodic memories, are important in part because of their potential role in the field of human memory research. \u201cThe big disease of memory is Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and of course, the most debilitating aspect of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a profound loss of episodic memory,\u201d Crystal said. Since Alzheimer\u2019s drugs for humans invariably undergo animal testing before they reach human trials, he noted that it\u2019s important for scientists to be able to drill down into whether these drugs actually affect the kind of memories that Alzheimer\u2019s patients lose. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just improve memory, we need to improve episodic memory,\u201d he said, and a better understanding of how to test for episodic-like memory in animals could help make that possible.

{"id": "2024_05_27_health_pregnancy-energetic-cost-wellness-scn", "text": "Having a baby is energetically much more expensive than commonly thought, according to new research. In fact, over the course of a pregnancy, creating and carrying a little one takes 49,753 dietary\u00a0calories \u2014 the equivalent of 164 Snickers candy bars, said Dr. Dustin Marshall, a coauthor of the study published May 16 in the journal Science. For the meta-analysis, Marshall, a professor of evolutionary biology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and a team of researchers used data from thousands of existing scientific articles to look at the energy cost of several species. \u201cWhile most folks probably intuit, or have actually experienced the high energy demands that come from gestating a baby, our work assigns explicit values to these costs across a wide range of species \u2014 from insects to lizards to humans,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Samuel Ginther, a postdoctoral researcher of biological sciences at Monash University, in an email. \u201cWe found that the total energy it takes to reproduce is much more substantial than previously considered.\u201d The bulk of the additional energy a pregnant person needs goes toward developing and carrying the fetus, Ginther added. \u201cMost of (the) energy that mammals put into reproduction is \u2018boiled off\u2019 as metabolic heat, only 10% ends up in the actual baby,\u201d Marshall said in an email. \u201cWhen both lactation and metabolic loads are accounted for, the baby itself represents less than 1/20th of the total reproductive investment.\u201d The research could make a big difference in perceptions of pregnancy needs, said Dr. Eve Feinberg, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the research. \u201cI think this study is groundbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cAny working pregnant woman could tell you the sheer level of exhaustion when you are pregnant \u2026 and how it consumes your life.\u201d How to break down what you need The extra calorie needs were not equal across the term of the pregnancy \u2014 you need less early on and much more as time goes on, Marshall said. Once you get to the second trimester, you need about 350 extra calories a day, while you need 450 more calories daily in the third trimester, said dietitian Natalie Mokari of Charlotte, North Carolina. If you breastfeed after the baby is born, you will need to add 450 to 500 more calories to your prepregnancy diet, she added. You can think of it as an additional substantial snack or mini meal in your day around the second trimester, Mokari said. And by the third trimester and breastfeeding, the additional calories amount to a meal. \u201cYour body is in overdrive. Your metabolism is working hard to build another human,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty monumental.\u201d What to eat How you eat will depend on your pregnancy, Mokari said. She recommends trying to eat every three to four hours or add smaller snacks every two hours throughout the day if that works better for your pregnancy symptoms, she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be three standard meals with a few snacks in between, because sometimes you can\u2019t handle that in pregnancy if you\u2019ve got nausea or anything like that,\u201d Mokari said. Mokari stressed the importance of carbs for energy, protein and healthy fat \u2014 \u201cthose high-quality fats that are going to promote good brain health for the baby.\u201d What constitutes a healthy fat? Fatty fish such as salmon, olive oil, avocados, avocado oil, peanut butter and almond butter are all great examples, Mokari said. Milk and dairy can also provide that fat along with other vitamins, and eggs can be a good source of both protein and fat, she added. \u201cYou really want your energy to come from good, whole foods,\u201d Feinberg added. Get some sleep This study also suggests that sleep is probably especially important during pregnancy, Feinberg said. \u201cIf you feel tired, go to sleep, and really understand that you\u2019re not being a wimp, that you\u2019re exhausted in pregnancy,\u201d Feinberg said. Unfortunately, there can be a stigma around pregnant people having higher sleep needs, but the study\u2019s findings should work against that, she said. \u201cThese data really give some solid numbers to say that the exhaustion women feel is very real and probably needs to be paid more attention to,\u201d Feinberg said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/pregnancy-energetic-cost-wellness-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_weekly-insulin-fda-committee", "text": "Most types of insulin therapy, an important part of diabetes treatment for many people, are given as daily injections to help manage blood sugar levels. Now, the maker of a once-weekly insulin injection is seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but a committee of agency advisers is divided on whether the benefits of the product may outweigh the risks. In a meeting Friday, the FDA\u2019s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee weighed whether the benefits of Novo Nordisk\u2019s weekly product, called insulin icodec, outweigh its risks. If the agency signs off, the treatment will be the first weekly insulin available in the United States. The committee\u2019s discussions focused on the safety and efficacy of insulin icodec, specifically in people with type 1 diabetes. The advisers were asked to answer a question of, based on the available data, whether Novo Nordisk has demonstrated that the benefits of insulin icodec outweigh its risks for improving glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Four voted yes. Seven voted no. The advisory committee\u2019s discussions and voting outcomes will be shared with the FDA, which takes into consideration but does not have to follow the committee\u2019s advice when deciding whether to approve the treatment. An analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials found that once-weekly insulin icodec was better at reducing high blood glucose levels in comparison with the once-daily therapy insulin degludec, but insulin icodec was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia, also known as low blood glucose, which can lead to a loss of consciousness or seizures. \u201cInsulin icodec was associated with 50 to 80% more clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia compared to insulin degludec at Week 52, depending on the method of analysis,\u201d the committee\u2019s meeting materials say. If the product is approved by the FDA, some panel members said, there should be guidance on ways to mitigate and treat the risk of hypoglycemia. Committee member Dr. Barbara Onumah, a endocrinology in Largo, Maryland, voted yes on the benefits of insulin icodec outweighing its risks. \u201cThis would add a tool to the toolbox for clinicians,\u201d Onumah said. \u201cIt will not be beneficial for every person, but it might be useful for some persons,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a few risk mitigation things that need to be ironed out clearly so that for the general provider or practitioner who would be writing this prescription, should it be approved, will be doing it correctly and safely \u2013 because safety would be very important.\u201d Committee member Dr. Matthew Drake, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, voted no. Drake said his rationale was based on comparing insulin icodec with the current gold standard of insulin degludec, \u201cwhich has a good safety profile in my experience,\u201d he said. Committee member Erica Brittain also voted no but called it a hard decision. \u201cI agree that there\u2019s theoretical benefits, and anyone could understand wanting to have fewer injections, and that\u2019s very important,\u201d said Brittain, a biostatistician at the National Institutes of Health. \u201cUnfortunately, within the trial data, we don\u2019t see the benefit of better glycemic control, which I think was promised in terms of adherence. I understand that that would be hard to show in this clinical trial population, but things kind of go the other way,\u201d she said. The committee also discussed how a weekly insulin injection might be an easier treatment regimen to follow than daily injections. Studies suggest that about 53% of adults with type 1 diabetes adhere to existing insulin therapy schedules, \u201cwith approximately 22% of patients missing at least one basal insulin dose over any 14-day period,\u201d according to the FDA advisory committee\u2019s meeting materials. \u201cNonadherence to insulin therapy is a precipitating factor for diabetic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.\u201d Novo Nordisk isn\u2019t the only company developing a weekly insulin therapy for diabetes patients. Last week, Eli Lilly announced that its once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa was \u201cequally safe and effective\u201d in Phase 3 trials involving adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin for the first time and those who require multiple daily insulin injections.

However, the protective nature of the diets could be sabotaged if poor dietary choices were made, the study authors said via email. \u201cDiets that emphasize consumption of unhealthy plant foods, such as fruit juices, refined grains, potato chips, and even sodas\u201d might counter the positives of a plant-based diet for health, said study coauthor Dr. Federica Guaraldi, medical director of the pituitary unit at the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna in Italy. Fruit juices, which are \u201cfull of sugars or sweetener,\u201d Guaraldi said, \u201c(were) recently demonstrated to have detrimental impact on metabolism as much as or even more than white sugar.\u201d Results may be affected by other lifestyle factors Researchers have long known that people who follow plant-based diets often live healthier lives full of exercise and an avoidance of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains, snacks, alcohol and tobacco, the study said. \u201cWhat is attributed to diet here may be in part due to other lifestyle practices,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThat is a minor concern, however,\u201d Katz said in an email. \u201cThe net effect of plant-predominant dietary patterns is clearly favorable to crucial health outcomes even if some of the observed benefit is attributable to other lifestyle practices.\u201d In fact, adopting a plant-based diet, even without additional exercise, could still yield health benefits, according to a November study on twins by Christopher Gardner, one of the coauthors of the umbrella analysis published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. In the 2023 study, healthy twins who ate a vegan diet for eight weeks had lower \u201cbad\u201d\u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, better\u00a0blood sugar levels and\u00a0greater weight loss\u00a0than siblings who ate a diet of meat and vegetables, according to Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in Palo Alto, California. \u201cThere was a 10% to 15% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 25% drop in insulin, and a 3% drop in body weight in just eight weeks, all by eating real food without animal products,\u201d Gardner told CNN at the time. One reason for that may be the nutritional boost that plants provide, including high levels of vitamins, minerals and other substances with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, while also reducing the inflammatory impact of meat and processed food, the authors said. \u201cPlants have more fiber (animal foods have zero), less saturated fat and zero cholesterol (all animal foods have cholesterol),\u201d Gardner said in an email. \u201cAn entirely separate category is phytochemicals (literally, \u2018plant chemicals\u2019) such as antioxidants. By definition there are no phytochemicals in animal foods.\u201d No meat, poultry or seafood, but dairy and eggs are OK The new review analyzed 48 metanalyses that had investigated the impact of eating a vegetarian or vegan diet on the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease and early death. \u201cWe analyzed reviews considering\u00a0vegan and vegetarian diets that completely exclude(ed) meat, poultry and seafood,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Davide Gori, an associate professor of biomedical and neuromotor sciences at the University of Bologna in Italy. \u201cTo be more precise regarding vegetarian diets, lacto-vegetarian (allowing certain dairy products such as yogurt, cheese and milk), ovo-vegetarian (allowing whole eggs, egg whites and egg-containing foods such as mayonnaise, egg noodles and certain baked goods), (and) lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets were included,\u201d Gori said in an email. However, vegetarian diets limiting but not completely excluding certain types of meat and fish, such as pesco- or pollo-vegetarian diets, were excluded, he said. The review found eating these plant-based diets reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and inflammation by affecting risk factors such as body mass index, fasting glucose and other measures of blood sugar control, and the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) measurements of blood pressure. The diets also significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and \u201cC-reactive protein \u2014 an index of inflammation that is typically higher in cardiovascular and metabolic disease,\u201d Gori said. Metabolic disease is a constellation of symptoms such as obesity, high blood pressure and poor control of cholesterol and blood sugars that can all lead to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. However, there was no benefit in eating plants for pregnant women, an \u201cintriguing finding\u201d that needs further research, said Guaraldi of the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences. It\u2019s also possible that the hormones of pregnancy might affect findings, and \u201cwe cannot rule out that participants have taken supplements during the study period that could have altered the impact of diet on the considered parameters.\u201d Special considerations of plant-based diets Because certain vitamin and minerals are more easily found and absorbed from meat, dairy or fish, vegetarians and vegans must take extra precautions to add those into their diets, experts say. Unless the diet is carefully optimized, additional sources of B12, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin D may be needed to avoid a deficiency, according to the Mayo Clinic. \u201cStrictly vegan diets can be deficient in vitamin B12,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThis is easily resolved by consuming foods fortified with (vitamin) B12 \u2014 easy to do because the recommended daily allowance for B12 is lower than any other vitamin or mineral. \u201cIron is another nutrient that is harder to get from a fully vegan diet,\u201d Gardner added. \u201cMany plant foods are relatively high in iron (beans/legumes). Again, supplements can be helpful.\u201d Protein is also a challenge, but good sources in plants include legumes such as lentils, chickpeas and beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains and soy products such as edamame, tempeh and tofu. Processed meat substitutes are options as well, experts say, but due to the processing can be packed with sodium, so read labels carefully.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}

The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other.

{"id": "2024_05_24_health_dairy-cow-meat-bird-flu", "text": "Meat from a dairy cow that was culled from its herd and sent to slaughter has tested positive for traces of the H5N1 bird flu virus, the US Department of Agriculture announced Friday, but no meat from the cow entered the food supply. The USDA said viral particles of H5N1 were detected during testing of various tissues, including samples from the diaphragm muscle, which sits below the lungs. The testing was done as a standard part of the food inspection process, the USDA said. Infectious disease experts around the world have been on alert since the USDA announced March 25 that a dairy cow tested positive for H5N1 influenza. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic form of bird flu that scientists have watched closely since it was detected in 1996. It has decimated wild bird populations and poultry flocks but only sporadically infects humans. When it does, it can be fatal: About half of the roughly 900 people known to be infected around the world over the past two decades have died. In the past two years, the virus has changed and begun to infect a growing assortment of mammals. Experts never expected the virus to show up in cows, as it was thought that they didn\u2019t have the right receptors on their cells to catch A-strain flu viruses \u2013 but it turns out they do. In this outbreak, the virus has mostly been showing up in the milk of dairy cows and causing mastitis, or an infection of the mammary gland. Cows stop producing as much milk, but they generally recover after a few weeks. Two US farmworkers are known to have tested positive in conjunction with the ongoing dairy cow outbreak. In both cases, the virus infected their eyes, causing redness and swelling, but they recovered. Finding a cow that tested positive for H5N1 postmortem, after systemic disease, suggests that some sick animals are going undetected.\u00a0It also suggests that the owners may not have tested the animal before its slaughter and that other cows in the herd may be infected. The USDA said the dead cow tested positive for H5N1 on May 22.\u00a0It has notified the owners and is tracing the animal to the herd it came from to get more information, the agency said. The USDA says samples taken from\u00a095 other cows\u00a0that were culled and condemned for illness tested negative for the virus\u00a0as of May 22,\u00a0and testing is underway on about a dozen more samples.\u00a0The test the USDA used, which is called polymerase chain reaction testing or PCR, identified genetic material from H5N1 virus, but it could not determine whether that material was infectious and could have made someone sick. Earlier tests on samples of ground beef using a different virus as a stand-in for H5N1 found that the virus was killed when the burgers were cooked to at least\u00a0145 degrees Fahrenheit,\u00a0or medium.\u00a0Cooking burgers\u00a0to rare, a temperature of 120 degrees,\u00a0substantially reduced levels of active virus but did not kill it all.\u00a0The USDA already recommends that burgers be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees to kill dangerous pathogens such as salmonella and E. coli.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/dairy-cow-meat-bird-flu/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_ozempic-benefits-diabetic-kidney-disease", "text": "Weekly injections of semaglutide medications like Ozempic significantly reduce the risk of serious kidney outcomes, major cardiovascular events and death among people who have type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, according to a new study. Diabetes is a key risk factor for kidney disease, which is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide; about 1 in 3 people with diabetes also has chronic kidney disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But new research shows that weekly injections of semaglutide cut the risk of severe outcomes from diabetic kidney disease by about 24%. These severe outcomes \u2013 including significant loss of kidney function, kidney failure and death from kidney or cardiovascular causes \u2013 occurred 331 times among trial participants who were treated with semaglutide, compared with 410 events among those who received the placebo. When scaled by the number of years each person was in the trial, there were 5.8 events for every 100 years of follow-up among those taking semaglutide, compared with 7.5 events for every 100 years of follow-up among those who received the placebo. High sugar levels in the blood of people with diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the kidneys, and this can also cause strain on the heart. The new study found even broader related benefits of semaglutide treatment among people with diabetic kidney disease. Kidney function declined more slowly overall, the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack was 18% lower and the risk of death from any cause was 20% lower among people who were treated with semaglutide compared with those who received the placebo, the research found. The study, published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Renal Association Congress, is based on the results of a drug trial conducted among about 3,500 people across 28 countries who were living with both type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. About half of the participants received weekly 1-milligram injections of semaglutide \u2013 the dose approved to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic in the US \u2013 and the others got a placebo treatment. Overall, the study participants were followed for an average of about 3\u00bd years. The trial was initially expected to last about four or five years, but findings at the midpoint check-in were so promising that an independent monitoring committee recommended that it end early. \u201cIn this trial, we\u2019re able to show benefits that highlight how transforming semaglutide can be for people with diabetes and kidney disease,\u201d said Dr. Vlado Perkovic, a nephrologist and provost at the the University of New South Wales Sydney. He chairs the trial\u2019s steering committee and was lead author of the new study. \u201cThe effect size was a bit larger than we had expected, and therefore, the results were highly statistically significant. So the likelihood of this being a chance finding is infinitesimally small, and I think we can be highly confident that the results are robust and real.\u201d Three other drug treatments have been shown to provide benefits for people with diabetic kidney disease, and the researchers note in the new study that \u201cclinicians and patients will need to consider the order and priority of use for semaglutide.\u201d A combination of therapies could be important, and many of the trial participants were also receiving some other type of treatment for their diabetes. \u201cSemaglutide showed some benefits on top of what is currently considered standard of care,\u201d said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development for Novo Nordisk. The Danish company is the only drug manufacturer with semaglutide products that are approved for use in the US \u2013 Ozempic for treatment of diabetes and Wegovy for treatment of obesity \u2013 and it funded the new study. Similar benefits were found across all levels of starting kidney function, but there was a particular focus on those at highest risk. More than two-thirds of trial participants were considered to be at very high risk of severe outcomes including kidney failure, cardiovascular events or death, according to risk calculators outlined in global clinical practice guidelines. In part, focusing on this high-risk group offers clearer insight into the benefits of treatment. But, experts say, many people also don\u2019t realize they have kidney disease until it has reached later stages \u2013 and many don\u2019t realize just how dangerous it can be. During each year of this trial, about 8% of the participants had a major kidney event, and almost 5% of people died. \u201cKidney disease attributed to diabetes, or diabetic kidney disease, is one of the most common and deadly complications of diabetes. Yet, unfortunately, there\u2019s very low awareness around it,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Tuttle, chair of the Diabetic Kidney Disease Collaborative for the American Society of Nephrology. She is also the executive director for research at Providence Inland Northwest Health, an investigator with the Institute of Translational Health Sciences and professor of medicine at the University of Washington. \u201cPart of the problem is that the condition is asymptomatic until late stages, so physicians and patients have to be very intentional about identifying kidney disease.\u201d It\u2019s recommended that people with diabetes get tested for kidney disease every six months with blood or urine tests. But this doesn\u2019t always happen, and some people wait until they have symptoms such as fatigue, swelling or changes in urination frequency. Diabetes treatments are in high demand because it\u2019s such a common disease, said Tuttle, who was also part of the new research. But semaglutide is so promising because it seems to have benefits that apply to multiple complications that can arise because of it. In addition to lowering blood sugar, semaglutide products have been shown to help with weight loss, heart failure and potentially curbing addictive behaviors. \u201cI think these drugs that affect multiple final common pathways are really highly effective because when we try to just treat one risk factor, it\u2019s almost like putting your finger in the dike. You can\u2019t plug all the holes. To me, what semaglutide really does is, it addresses a broad spectrum of risk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does reduce weight, it does lower glucose in does lower blood pressure a little bit, and then we think on top of that, it has the direct effects on the kidney. It\u2019s really the whole package.\u201d There are significant disparities in diabetes prevalence and kidney disease in the US. Black, Hispanic and American Indian adults are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes than White adults, according to CDC data. And Black people in the US are about three times more likely to have kidney failure than White adults. However, most of the participants in the semaglutide trial were White, and the findings could not be assessed among important subgroups. \u201cWhen we have something that\u2019s effective, we also have to turn our sights to getting treatments to patients,\u201d Tuttle said. But many of the highest-risk people who could benefit most from treatment don\u2019t have access to it. \u201cNow, we have a highly effective therapy that reduces things that really matter to patients, families and communities: keeping their kidney function, preserving life and reducing the rates of cardiovascular events. But that\u2019s all great only if people get the treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cSo now, really, the challenge before all of us is to move much more expeditiously from evidence generation to implementation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/ozempic-benefits-diabetic-kidney-disease/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness", "text": "One may think young people are the main group enjoying the freedom of legalized weed, but in Canada, the greatest increase in users after legalization was among older adults \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s sending them to the hospital, according to new research. The rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults during the period of legalization of dried cannabis flower and edibles \u2014 October 2018 through December 2022 \u2014 in Canada was significantly higher than that of the pre-legalization period, according to a research letter published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Edibles, which include baked goods, candies and beverages, are increasingly popular, said lead research author Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician and clinician scientist at Sinai Health in Ontario. But some older adults may be unaware of the strength of today\u2019s weed, and little is known about the health effects of legalizing edible cannabis on older adults \u2014 the age group with the largest growth in overall cannabis use a year after dried cannabis flower was legalized in Canada, Stall said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an age-related bias that many health care practitioners, and frankly society, hold that older adults are not using drugs. And that\u2019s not true,\u201d Stall said. \u201cWe found that the largest increases in emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning among seniors occurred after edible cannabis became legal for retail sale in January 2020.\u201d The authors used the Ontario Ministry of Health\u2019s administrative data to examine the rates of emergency room visits for cannabis poisoning among older adults during the pre-legalization period \u2014 January 2015 to September 2018 \u2014 and the two legalization periods: October 2018 through December 2019, which permitted the sale of dried cannabis flower only, and January 2020 through December 2022, which marked the legalization of cannabis edibles. When people have cannabis poisoning, according to Stall, they may experience confusion; psychosis, including hallucinations; anxiety or panic attacks; rapid heartbeat; chest pain; nausea; and vomiting.\u00a0 During the eight-year study period, there were 2,322 emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults who were age 69 on average. Nearly 17% of those adults were simultaneously intoxicated with alcohol, about 38% had cancer and 6.5% had dementia. Compared with pre-legalization, legalization period No. 1 saw a twice higher rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning. The rate during the second legalization period tripled that of pre-legalization. \u201cThis study provides a cautionary tale of legalization of substances without adequate research, education, and counseling of users regarding adverse effects and safe usage, particularly in older adults,\u201d said Dr. Lona Mody and Dr. Sharon K. Inouye, who weren\u2019t involved in the research, in a commentary on the research. Mody is the Amanda Sanford Hickey Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Inouye is director of the Aging Brain Center at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research in Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The sneaky effects of edibles When it comes to explaining the higher rates, both unintentional and intentional use of edible cannabis are worth discussing, experts said. \u201cEdible cannabis products may be particularly dangerous because they are often indistinguishable from non-cannabis containing foods and may contain high amounts of THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), the major active ingredient in both medical and recreational cannabis,\u201d Mody and Inouye said. In his own practice, Stall has seen a common scenario resulting from the lack of distinction, he said: An emergency department doctor is not able to figure out why an older adult patient is neurologically impaired via any typical tests \u2014 only for a toxicology screen to come back positive for cannabis, much to the patient\u2019s surprise. \u201cThe other thing is that cannabis today is very different than cannabis was as recently as the early \u201990s and mid \u201980s,\u201d Stall explained. \u201cToday\u2019s cannabis extracts contain as much as 30 times more THC. \u2026 Older adults who may not have used cannabis in decades and are now trying again in this post-legalization era may not be aware.\u201d Additionally, age-related changes in organ function and how the drug is distributed throughout the body \u2014 as well as having health conditions or being on prescription drugs, especially psychoactive ones \u2014 can make it easier for an older adult to experience cannabis poisoning, Stall added. Some people who intentionally consume cannabis edibles may not be aware that this form has a more delayed effect than an inhalant, which goes straight to the bloodstream, he said. Thinking the edible isn\u2019t working, they take another one too soon and end up getting more than they bargained for. There are also people whose prescription medications for pain management, insomnia or dementia symptoms aren\u2019t effective, so they consume edibles for therapeutic purposes but without consulting a doctor first, Stall said. Reducing harm from cannabis use Abstaining from cannabis use may be \u201cappropriate\u201d for some individuals, but \u201cI would be hesitant to give a blanket recommendation (that) no other adults should be using this because there are people who are going to use it even if that recommendation is given,\u201d Stall said. Therefore, preventing cannabis-related harms in older adults requires a multipronged approach, he added, including storing cannabis edibles in locked locations and in clearly identified packaging. Products older adults intentionally use should have dosing information with specific guidance for older adults, \u201crecognizing that the amount of drug they may need is a lot less than younger populations,\u201d Stall said. \u201cIn geriatric medicine, we have a mantra: Start low and go slow. That same mantra applies here.\u201d The amount at which cannabis can become poisonous can depend on multiple personal factors, but some studies have indicated people should wait at least three hours before taking a second dose, Stall said. Health care providers should also have open and judgment-free conversations with older adults about cannabis use and its benefits and risks, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_microplastics-testicles-study-wellness", "text": "Human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas, a new small study found. \u201cThese plastics are often nano-scale, typically less than half a micron in length and maybe like 20 to 200 nanometers in width,\u201d said toxicologist Matthew Campen, coauthor of the study that published May 15 in the journal Toxicological Sciences. \u201cThey look like little shards, tiny broken bits from very, very old plastics,\u201d said Campen, a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Such minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, interrupting cellular processes and potentially depositing\u00a0endocrine-disrupting chemicals\u00a0such as\u00a0bisphenols,\u00a0phthalates,\u00a0flame retardants,\u00a0per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and\u00a0heavy metals. Endocrine disruptors interfere with the human reproductive system, leading to genital and reproductive malformations as well as female infertility and a decline in sperm count, according to the Endocrine Society. In fact, sperm counts in parts of the world, including the United States, have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, the society stated on its website. \u201cThis is an eyes wide open situation right now,\u201d Campen said. \u201cWe\u2019re just now realizing how much plastic is in our bodies. We need a surge of research around this topic to confirm or deny a role for microplastics in driving infertility, testicular cancer and other cancers.\u201d \u2018Action is desperately needed now\u2019 The new study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d Polyethylene, one of the most widely used plastics in the world, was the predominant type of polymer in both species, followed by PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, another commonly used chemical that can contain chemical additives and heavy metals including phthalates, cadmium and lead. Phthalates, called\u00a0 \u201ceverywhere chemicals\u201d because they are so common, are added to consumer products to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break. Researchers expected to find more plastic shards in the testicles of older men in the study, but that wasn\u2019t the case, Campen said. \u201cIt seems that in peak reproductive years for men, which is from 20 to 45, there are higher levels of plastics, which then begin to decline after the age of 55,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests the human body can eliminate these plastics.\u201d But there is a downside. The finding also suggests that the increased energy needs of a younger testicle may \u201calso pull more plastic into that organ,\u201d Campen said. \u201cAdd to that the fact that the number of plastics we\u2019re exposed to is doubling at a rate of every 10 to 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen in 15 years when we are exposed to twice the amount or 30 years when we are exposed to four times the amount? That is why action is desperately needed now.\u201d The American Chemistry Council, an industry association, told CNN in a previous interview that plastics \u201chelp protect us, improve healthcare outcomes, and contribute to a more sustainable world.\u201d \u201cPlastic makers have a\u00a0goal\u00a0for all US plastic packaging to be reused, recycled, or recovered by 2040,\u201d said Dr. Kimberly Wise White, the council\u2019s vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs. More plastics than placentas Researchers also compared the testes results with microplastic levels found in an earlier study on 62 human placentas, the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to a developing fetus in the womb. In that February study, led by Campen, researchers found microplastics at levels of 6.5 to 790 micrograms per gram of tissue in all the placenta samples studied. \u201cIn testes, the levels of plastic was three times as much as we saw in placentas,\u201d Campen said. \u201cBut you have to consider that the placenta only has a life of about eight months.\u201d The latest study isn\u2019t the first report to find plastics in reproductive tissue. A team of Beijing-based researchers found microplastics in six human testes and 30 semen samples in a June 2023 study, while animal studies have shown tiny plastics can impact sperm count and contribute to hormone and other disruptions in male sexual organs. In studies of pregnant mice, researchers have found plastic chemicals in the brain, heart, liver, kidney and lungs of the developing fetus 24 hours after the pregnant mother ingested or breathed in plastic particles. Other\u00a0research\u00a0has shown that micro- and nanoplastics may cause oxidative stress, tissue damage and inflammation in cells, while animal studies have shown such particles may alter heart rate and impede cardiac function. How to limit plastic in your life There are steps one can take to reduce exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in food and food packaging products, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cLook at the recycling code on the bottom of products to find the plastic type, and avoid plastics with recycling codes 3, which typically contain phthalates,\u201d he added. Cut down on the use of disposable plastics, suggests the\u00a0Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Other suggestions include bringing reusable bags to the grocery store. Invest in a zippered fabric bag and ask the dry cleaner to return your clothes in that instead of those thin sheets of plastic. Bring a travel mug to the local coffee store for takeout and silverware to the office and cut back on plastic cups and utensils.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/microplastics-testicles-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "health"}}
