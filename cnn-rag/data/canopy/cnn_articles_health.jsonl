The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state\u2019s law where it conflicts with federal law. With Thursday\u2019s decision, the state would not be allowed to deny an emergency abortion to a pregnant person whose health is in danger, at least while the case makes its way through the courts. On Wednesday, the decision was mistakenly posted on the US Supreme Court website, and was first reported by Bloomberg News. The final opinion on Thursday was a sigh of relief, but doctors and legal experts acknowledged it\u2019s a temporary reprieve. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a separate opinion. \u201cIt is a delay.\u201d \u201cStorm clouds loom ahead,\u201d she wrote. Idaho\u2019s strict ban criminalizes performing most abortions and does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion if the patient\u2019s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself in most circumstances. The Biden administration argued that the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also known as EMTALA. EMTALA requires all US hospitals that have received Medicare money \u2014 essentially nearly all of them \u2014 to screen everyone who comes into their emergency rooms to determine whether the person has an emergency medical condition without regard for their ability to pay for those services. The 1986 law requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or to transfer them to another facility that has that capacity. The hospitals must also treat these patients\u00a0\u201cuntil the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.\u201d Pregnant people were singled out in the law\u00a0in 1989, after reports that some hospitals were refusing to care for uninsured women in labor. Congress expanded EMTALA to specify how it included people who were pregnant and having contractions. In 2021, the Biden administration released the\u00a0Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor\u2019s duty to provide stabilizing treatment \u201cpreempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,\u201d although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided. In July 2022, the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0guidance\u00a0clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision means a hospital must provide an abortion if it\u2019s medically indicated in an emergency situation, even in states that have abortion bans or restrictions that don\u2019t provide an exception to protect the health of the mother \u2013 at least as the case makes it way through the courts. But the move would only delay the issue, says Molly Meegan, chief legal officer for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a professional organization that represents the majority of practitioners in the United States. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem at all. In fact, pregnant patients are still trying to obtain care and unable to get it, and physicians are trying to provide care without clear parameters and with draconian criminal penalties hanging over their heads if they get the question wrong,\u201d she said. Dr. Stella Dantas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision shows exactly why clinicians need to be protected from outside interference in their relationship with patients, particularly when they need emergency care. Dantas said a law created by politicians that restricts a doctor\u2019s ability to provide care in an emergency is like having someone who has never flown a plane create restrictions on what a pilot could do during a flight emergency. \u201cIf that person couldn\u2019t do x, y, or z, when they were trained, in a split-second, if something flew into the engine, you wouldn\u2019t feel safe, and it wouldn\u2019t be the best for any of those people flying on a plane,\u201d Dantas said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cThis case has illustrated for many how critical abortion care is for all of us. For clinicians who care about their patients, for patients who may someday need an abortion and for the people that love them. \u201cDepriving patients of evidence-based care is unacceptable.\u201d Idaho\u2019s abortion law had an immediate effect on hospitals in the state.\u00a0On January 5, the Supreme Court lifted an injunction so Idaho no longer had EMTALA protections for pregnancy complications. St. Luke\u2019s, the state\u2019s largest provider of emergency services, said in April it had to send six pregnant patients from its emergency department out of state via air transport to protect their health. The year before, when the injunction was in effect, the hospital had to do this only once. Meegan said the law hasn\u2019t just hurt patient care. Physicians have told the group that they are leaving the state because they don\u2019t feel that they can practice medicine in a way that\u2019s consistent with their ethical obligations, training and judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s an untenable situation,\u201d Meegan said. Dr. Kara Cadwallader, a doctor who works in Idaho and is a member of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, said that even last week, her hospital had to send a pregnant person out of state for care even though they typically could have treated her. She said Wednesday she was \u201cvery excited\u201d about the ruling, even if it is a \u201csmall step.\u201d \u201cBeyond all the political reasons, it\u2019s incredibly important for pregnant patients here in Idaho, who now will be able to access emergency care appropriately,\u201d Cadwallader said. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said that with this decision, the Biden administration will continue to uphold the law and the right to emergency care. The administration also plans to make it easier for someone who is denied care to be able to file a complaint. \u201cWhen the Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it unleashed an unprecedented assault on reproductive rights, and every day we see the consequences,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cUnder President Biden\u2019s leadership, we have worked directly with providers, hospitals, and community leaders across the country to navigate the chaos that the decision introduced.\u201d Still, abortion regulations around the country are murky. Professor Elizabeth Sepper, of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that \u201cin every other state with an abortion ban, confusion will continue to reign.\u201d \u201cEven where states have \u2018health\u2019 exceptions in their laws, they typically are narrower than what EMTALA requires,\u201d Sepper wrote in an email. Forty-one states have abortion bans in effect with only limited exceptions, and 14 states have total bans. Around the country, doctors are confused about what they are allowed to do, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a privately owned health care company that provides abortion care. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t only about Idaho. This is really something that all eyes and ears are watching from multiple states across the country to try to figure out what we\u2019re able to do to provide basic health care, even if abortion has been restricted,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cAbortion saves lives. Abortion is absolutely necessary, oftentimes in emergency room settings to protect the health of the pregnant person. I think providers really understand that their hands have been tied post-Roe here, since the Dobbs decision, in numerous states and numerous parts of the country. Standard care for a woman who needs an emergency abortion does not vary from state to state, said Dr. Nisha Verma, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Emory University in Georgia. However, she said, the kind of care a patient will receive is totally dependent on where she lives. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case did not address the medical complexities this kind of care requires, and it will lead to confusion, fear and delays in what can be life-saving care, she said. \u201cWhat we had really hoped for is the Supreme Court to come down very firmly that doctors should be able to provide care for patients, including in emergency situations where abortion care can often be needed to stabilize patients. I think that working here in Georgia, we are constantly in a state of confusion trying to navigate incredibly confusing laws with exceptions that just don\u2019t make sense on the ground, that don\u2019t take into consideration all of the complexity that we deal with every day,\u201d Verma said. The ruling does not change the situation in Texas, reproductive legal advocates say. Texas sued the US government over EMTALA guidance, and in 2022 a federal judge allowed the EMTALA to be blocked. The federal government has asked the Supreme Court to review the law. That case could potentially go before the Supreme Court next term. \u201cWe should have never been in a place where states like Idaho, Texas, and others across the country could have state bans that seek to ignore federal law, forcing providers to forfeit their best medical judgment and second guess the care they can provide out of fear of criminalization and other penalties,\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood said at a news conference Thursday. She called Thursday\u2019s decision \u201csupreme gaslighting\u201d that will allow the court to come back to the decisions down the road, \u201cperhaps leaving it for when it\u2019s more politically convenient.\u201d \u201cOur bodies, lives and futures are still under deliberation,\u201d McGill said. Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, said she sees Idaho as a \u201cvery cruel case study\u201d of what happens when the law strips pregnant people of their right to emergency abortion care. She said Wednesday that she was disappointed in the ruling because the court had the opportunity to uphold a law that gives everyone access to care \u2014 but failed to do so. \u201cThe right to emergency care is perhaps one of the most basic rights there is,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cWe were fighting for scraps in this case, and even with that, a majority of the Supreme Court was not willing to recognize the humanity of pregnant people, that they would be entitled to this basic right to emergency care.\u201d CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Carma Hassan, Jamie Gumbrecht and John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/emtala-emergency-care-scotus/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_gun-violence-stop-the-bleed-children-gupta", "text": "When I visited Rocklin Elementary school, I sat in on a lesson with a third-grade class \u2013\u00a0a lesson I would never have imagined as a father, a journalist or a trauma surgeon. \u201cChances are, you\u2019re never ever going to have to use this. If you do, it\u2019s gonna be scary,\u201d Kate Carleton told the 20 or so 8- and 9-year-olds. \u201cBut because we\u2019ve taught you what to do, it makes it a little less scary.\u201d She spent the next 30 minutes teaching them how to stop a wound from bleeding out. The lesson is appropriately titled \u201cStop the Bleed.\u201d Carleton is a trauma nurse at Sutter Roseville Medical Center, a level 2 trauma center in Rocklin,\u00a0California, a northern suburb of Sacramento. At the beginning of her 17-year career, she saw a lot of car crashes, motorcycle accidents and falls. More recently, the number of gunshot wounds coming through her hospital has increased, most often from domestic violence or suicide. On this day, she was\u00a0kneeling on the ground\u00a0to show these little kids the techniques paramedics often use in the field to stop bleeding. And as I looked around the classroom, I could tell that the kids were really listening. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ve got that bleeding to stop on that person, what did you do for their life?\u201d she asked the kids. Hands flew up. \u201cYou saved their life,\u201d answered one little girl. Born out of tragedy A litt\ufeffle\u00a0more than\u00a0seven years ago, Carleton was watching a special about the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, and like so many parents, she wondered about her own children, then in kindergarten and second grade. Was there anything she could do to make a difference and help keep them safer in a moment like that? Carleton\u00a0approached her daughter\u2019s kindergarten teacher and asked whether it was possible to create a curriculum to teach them how to handle these injuries. She wasn\u2019t sure what the response would be because after all, these were young children. But as the number of mass shootings continued to grow, so did the realization that anyone could suddenly become a first responder \u2014 even a child. The proposal was approved, and since then, she has been teaching classes to students throughout the Rocklin school district on the basics of bleeding control. Carleton is part of a larger movement also known as \u201cStop the Bleed,\u201d a campaign that was born out of the tragedy at Sandy Hook. Hartford Hospital trauma surgeon Dr. Lenworth Jacobs was tasked with reviewing the autopsies of the 20 children and six adults killed that day,\u00a0to find any lessons\u00a0that could be\u00a0learned out\u00a0of the horror. \u201cYou cannot imagine what the kinetic energy of an AR-15 does, or a bullet does, to a 6-year-old,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThis is not civilized.\u201d School shootings are rare, but gunshot injuries are not Although a child dying at school in a mass shooting may be unlikely, a child dying from a gunshot is not. Firearms are the leading cause of death among people 18 and\u00a0younger\u00a0in the US, accounting for nearly\u00a019% of all childhood deaths. The\u00a0most recent data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that both the rate and the number of children dying from gunshot wounds are the highest they have been since 1999, when data on children\u2019s mortality and firearms was first collected. And although firearm mortality in the adult population is most often from suicide, for children, homicide is driving the deaths. After poring over the autopsies, Jacobs gathered trauma specialists from across the country and developed \u201ca protocol for national policy to enhance survivability from active shooter and intentional mass casualty events,\u201d known as the\u00a0Hartford Consensus. The nearly 100-page document included a letter from then-Vice President Joe Biden, who said the report was a \u201ccall to action.\u201d \u201cWith very little training and equipment, the individuals\u00a0closest to the scene of an accident or mass casualty situation can control bleeding until first responders arrive to take over treatment,\u201d Biden wrote. Much of the Hartford Consensus was adopted from lessons learned in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the military, it\u2019s known as\u00a0\u201cbuddy aid\u201d: the practice of fellow troops being trained in first aid to help wounded colleagues on the battlefield. The practices are basic, but stopping bleeding, using a tourniquet and putting these steps into practice before a wounded soldier reaches the hospital greatly improves their chances of survival. Those troops who had tourniquets applied before their bodies went into shock had\u00a0a survival rate of 96%, compared with just 4% of those who got a tourniquet after blood loss caused them to go into shock. A driving tenet of the Hartford Consensus was time. \u201cPretty much all of these (mass casualty) events are over in 15 minutes, and it takes more than that to get the system to respond to you,\u201d Jacobs explained. Experts say that the average response time for an ambulance in urban areas in the US is\u00a0about eight minutes\u00a0\u2014 more time than it takes for a person to bleed out from a gunshot wound. Turning bystanders into first responders To give a person the best chance at survival after being shot, the priority is simple. \u201cStop the bleeding. Keep the blood inside the body,\u201d Jacobs said. The most efficient and quickest way to do that: turn bystanders into immediate responders by teaching them to pack a wound and use a tourniquet. \ufeffEleven years\u00a0after Jacobs and other experts first met to discuss what would ultimately become the Hartford Consensus,\u00a0more than 3 million people\u00a0worldwide have learned the basic principles of \u201cStop the Bleed\u201d through a certification program developed by the American College of Surgeons and the\u00a0American\u00a0Red Cross. According to the ACS, bleeding control kits containing gauze and tourniquets are now required in schools in at least\u00a010\u00a0states, and teachers and staff are required to be trained in at least\u00a0three\u00a0states. Two states require schools to offer Stop the Bleed training to students: in Arkansas for students in ninth grade and above and in Texas for those in seventh grade and above. After 19 fourth-graders and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022, a state representative introduced a bill proposing to lower the minimum grade for Stop the Bleed training to third grade. The bill never made it out of committee because of pushback. Carleton says she\u2019s not surprised. \u201cWhy it got started is frightening,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut I do think there\u2019s a way to teach the information where it\u2019s not.\u201d Meeting kids where they\u2019re at When Carleton speaks to the kids, she doesn\u2019t mention guns or violence at all. During the class I visited, she asked the kids how many of their parents use power tools or could be hurt working around the house. \u201cIf I\u2019m working in the kitchen and I\u2019m cutting vegetables, can I get cut? Can that cause me to bleed?\u201d she\u00a0asked the students. She uses language that kids can easily grasp: \u201cLook for when blood puddles or when it rains like a sprinkler. The first step, take any cloth you can find and stuff a corner of it into the wound as deep as you can.\u201d She was teaching them the basic principles of packing a wound. On the day I was there, she told the kids they could\u00a0use anything to pack a wound, even a \u201cdirty, smelly sock.\u201d \u201cStopping the bleeding was most important, and they could give antibiotics later in the hospital to prevent infections,\u201d she said. \u201cDo whatever you can to just stop the bleed.\u201d It\u2019s the same kind of approach that pediatric trauma nurse Missy Anderson takes when she teaches Scout troops and children\u2019s groups in Denver. Anderson is the pediatric trauma program manager at Denver Health and describes the tourniquets as \u201cmagical bracelets\u201d \u2014 a concept that most kids can immediately understand. Carleton stopped bringing up gun violence after a handful of parents complained, but she doesn\u2019t shy away\u00a0when someone raises it.\u00a0In a sixth-grade class I visited, a student asked, if someone was shot in multiple places, where should they try to stop the bleed? Carleton answered quickly, \u201cWhere they are bleeding the most.\u201d \u201cI try to acknowledge the kids on where they\u2019re at,\u201d she told me. \u201cI acknowledge it and we move on so that we can continue to talk about how to get the bleeding to stop.\u201d But\u00a0the topic of gun violence\u00a0gives her pause. \u201cIt tugs at my heartstrings a little bit, for sure,\u201d she said. Like Carleton, Anderson keeps the focus on safety, not violence. \u201cWhat if no guns existed in the whole world? We wipe them all out, there\u2019s not a single gun in the whole universe? People still get hurt, and they still can have bleeding,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThis course should not be affiliated with gun violence. This is about helping people that are bleeding in any scenario.\u201d The goal of the campaign has always been to train everyone, including children, said Dr. Kenji Inaba, chair of the Stop the Bleed Committee for the American College of Surgeons. Inaba said he taught his\u00a0now-teenage son, an avid mountain biker, how to pack a wound and use a tourniquet by the time he was 10 years old. \u201cHe\u2019s always in the middle of nowhere, by himself or with some friends, and I want him to know that knowledge.\u201d Inaba said that after discussion with pediatric surgeons, pediatricians and parents, the committee concluded that there really is no age limit on who should be taught these skills. \u201cEvery child is different in their development. Every child is different in their experience,\u201d he said. Inaba added that the group is in discussion with child development experts and teachers to create a curriculum for younger kids. Reaching kids where they are means designing education that meets not only their emotional needs but their physical needs. For example, Carleton explained to me that younger kids can more effectively put pressure and stop bleeding by using all of their body weight. She showed the kids how to put their knee directly on the wound. \u201cIt\u2019ll make it a little bit easier for you, and you won\u2019t get tired,\u201d she told them. I watched as she stood in front of the class and demonstrated how to apply pressure with a rubber dummy limb, the same kind used to train EMTs. Carleton explained that adults will typically use their hands and press down as hard as possible over a packed wound, \u201cbecause I\u2019m stronger than you,\u201d she said. One kid shouted out \u201cMom power!\u201d and the class giggled. Carleton then quickly divided the class into groups of four or five kids, led by volunteers from the fire department, to practice on dummy limbs. \u201cIf you were in that situation, do you think you could do it now? Does that make you nervous at all?\u201d I asked\u00a0Harlow, a third-grader. \u201cJust the feeling of how it would be an actual person instead of a fake leg. That\u2019s scary,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you think based on what you learned, if it was an actual person, you\u2019d be able to do that?\u201d\u00a0\ufeffI responded. \u201cYeah,\u201d Harlow responded confidently. Even young children know how to help Studies find that young people can learn lifesaving\u00a0lessons. Though they aren\u2019t as young as the students I visited, a 2019 study of high school students found that\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of them were able to position a tourniquet correctly after being taught either in person or online. A small\u00a02022\u00a0study of 11- and 12-year-olds found that\u00a097% of the students\u00a0grasped the lessons of bleeding control and tourniquet use after Stop the Bleed training. A recent study from the\u00a0American Heart Association\u00a0found that children as young as 4 know how to call for help in a medical emergency and that by age 10 to 12, children can administer\u00a0effective\u00a0CPR. Harlow\u2019s classmate Jeremy told me that the best part of learning all of this was that he was prepared to help anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling you get when you get to see them go to the hospital and know that they\u2019re OK and the feeling that you\u2019ve saved someone\u2019s life,\u201d he said. And the lessons seem to stick with them. A sixth-grader, Piper, told me that although she would probably be nervous to apply these skills in a \u201creal situation\u201d when someone was \u201cactually bleeding out and there was a puddle,\u201d she was glad they had a trial run through the lessons in the classroom. \u201cIt kind of loosens things up and doesn\u2019t make things so scary.\u201d Carleton\u2019s daughter and Piper\u2019s classmate, Quinn, agreed. \u201cWhen a situation comes for something like this, it won\u2019t be as scary, since we know what to do because we\u2019ve already practiced it,\u201d she said. A new \u2018stop, drop and roll\u2019 As impressed as I was with how quick and engaged the kids were, I couldn\u2019t help but feel sad that this is where we are\u00a0as\u00a0a country. A time when tourniquets and bleeding control kits are as routine as \u201cstop, drop and roll,\u201d the fire safety instructions that generations of children have learned in their classrooms. When I shared that with Carleton, she told me that she felt the same way at first, but she had to change her approach. \u201cWhen I would initially go into that with that kind of feeling, I just found that I couldn\u2019t teach the information in a way that it really resonated with them. It was being taught out of fear from me, and I don\u2019t want that,\u201d she said. It is hard, however, to disentangle gun violence from the situations where these lessons could be most impactful. Gun violence has become such a prevalent part of American life, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has now issued an\u00a0advisory\u00a0calling firearm violence an urgent public health crisis. The advisory notes that half of children ages 14 to 17 worry about school shootings and nearly 60% of them have thought about \u201cwhat would happen if a person with a gun entered\u201d their school. According to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive,\u00a0last year alone, 1,682 children died and another 4,512 were injured by gun violence. So a grass-roots movement to train elementary-age children continues, with people like Carleton leading the charge. \u201cWe can teach it, like teaching hands-only\u00a0CPR or how to use an AED. It just becomes part of what we do,\u201d Carleton told me. \u201cIt can be used in all situations, whether it\u2019s a violent situation or not. But either way, it\u2019s saving somebody\u2019s life.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/gun-violence-stop-the-bleed-children-gupta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_resistance-training-older-adults-wellness", "text": "Retirement should be filled with time with loved ones, relaxation and\u2014according to new research\u2014heavy lifting. As people get older, their skeletal muscle function declines, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine. \u201cIf you do resistance training at this age, benefits in some parameters may last several years,\u201d said lead study author \ufeffMads Bloch-Ibenfeldt, a doctoral student at the Institute of Sports Medicine at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. To investigate whether resistance exercise programs could be helpful in the long term, researchers performed a randomized control trial with 369 recently retired and healthy adults who were between 64 and 75 years old. The participants were assigned one of three exercise programs for a year. They either lifted weights three times a week, did moderate-intensity training using their body weight and resistance bands three times a week, or did not change their usual exercise routines, the study said. Researchers measured their bone and muscle strength as well as body fat levels at the start of the trial at the end of the one-year program and then two and four years later, according to the study. It was up to the individuals whether they continued their strength training regimen or went back to their normal exercise level, Resistance training with heavy loads yielded the greatest long-lasting benefit in leg strength, the study showed. Even four years after the training, their leg strength was unaltered, whereas the moderate-intensity group did see a decrease \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t significant, the study showed. \u201cExercise is critically important across the life span. This study does show that even in those engaging in activity later in life around retirement can lead to marked benefits to one\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the School of Medicine (Geriatric Medicine) and in the Gillings School of Global Public Health (Nutrition). He was not involved in the research. What counts as resistance training? The umbrella of exercise includes aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance activities, Batsis said. \u201cEach of these have important consequences if one regularly performs them or does not on overall health (including cognition) and physical function,\u201d Batsis\ufeff said in an email. You can think of resistance training as \u201cexercises that improve strength by making muscles work against a force,\u201d said CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a mind-body coach for professional athletes. That force can include weights, resistance bands or your own body weight\u2014like with pushups or squats, she added. \u201cFor older adults, resistance training is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, and mobility,\u201d she said. According to the recent study, adding heavier weight seems to be important, Bloch-Ibenfeldt said. What you can do at home One limitation of the exercise proposed in the recent study is that the weighted exercises were done at a gym, which is something not everyone has the time, money or transportation to do, Batsis said. While you should consult a certified trainer or physical therapist to ensure\ufeff you are exercising safely, there are things you can do from home, Santas said. For older adults, it is important to strengthen in ways that are important to functional movements of everyday living, she added. Santas recommends box squats, where you sit lightly on a chair seat and stand back up. If you don\u2019t need to hold the arms of the chair for support, add some dumbbells, Santas said. The added weight gives \u201cadditional resistance while also improving\u00a0grip strength, which is essential for functional independence and serves as (a) marker for heart health,\u201d she added.

{"id": "2024_06_19_health_microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness", "text": "Scientists have found microplastics in human penises for the first time, as concerns over the tiny particles\u2019 proliferation and potential health effects mount. Seven different kinds of microplastics were found in four out of five samples of penis tissue taken from five different men as part of a study published in IJIR: Your Sexual Medicine Journal on Wednesday. Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. They form when larger plastics break down,\u00a0either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. Some minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, and evidence is mounting that they are increasingly present in our bodies. Study lead author Ranjith Ramasamy, an expert in reproductive urology who conducted the research while working at the University of Miami, told CNN that he used a previous study that found evidence of microplastics in the human heart as a basis for his research. Ramasamy said he wasn\u2019t surprised to find microplastics in the penis, as it is a \u201cvery vascular organ,\u201d like the heart. The samples were taken from study participants who had been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction (ED) and were in the hospital to undergo surgery for penile implants to treat the condition at the University of Miami between August and September 2023. The samples were then analyzed using chemical imaging, which revealed that four of the five men had microplastics in their penile tissue. Seven different types of microplastics were detected, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) the most prevalent, according to the study.  Now their presence has been confirmed, more research is needed to investigate potential links to conditions such as ED, Ramasamy said. \u201cWe need to identify whether microplastics are linked to ED and if there is a level beyond which it causes pathology and what types of microplastics are pathologic,\u201d he said. As for the wider implications of the findings, Ramasamy said he hoped the study would \u201ccreate more awareness about the presence of foreign bodies within human organs and foster more research surrounding this topic.\u201d Prior research has found that one liter of bottled water \u2014 the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters \u2014 contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles. \u201cI think we need to be mindful about consuming water and food from plastic bottles and containers and try and limit the use until more research is done to identify levels that could cause pathology,\u201d Ramasamy said. Toxicologist Matthew J. Campen told CNN that this is \u201can interesting study that confirms the ubiquity of plastics in the body.\u201d \u201cAs we are trying to understand the potential health effects of plastics, this is another concerning paper,\u201d said Campen,\u00a0a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cPlastics are generally non-reactive with the cells and chemicals of our bodies, but they could be physically disruptive to the many processes our bodies undertake for normal function, including functions related to erection and sperm production.\u201d Campen coauthored a study published in May that found that human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas. The study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers of males who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said at the time the study was published. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d There are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to microplastics. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_birth-control-drops-after-abortion-bans", "text": "Women in states with the most restrictive abortion laws have also become less likely to access prescription birth control, a new study suggests. In a dozen states that have enacted near-total abortion bans, monthly prescription rates for birth control pills and emergency contraceptives were significantly lower in the second half of 2023 than they were before the US Supreme Court Dobbs decision that revoked the federal right to abortion, according to the study published Wednesday in the JAMA Network Open medical journal. The researchers point to the closures of some family planning clinics and broad public confusion about what options remain legal in the wake of the June 2022 Dobbs decision as key factors contributing to this trend. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to recognize that these issues all fall under the scope of reproductive health care,\u201d said Dr. Michael Belmonte, an Ob-Gyn and fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists focused on complex family planning. He was not involved in the new research. \u201cWhen something touches on abortion care, that will ultimately have ripple effects for miscarriage care, for contraception and emergency contraception, and, quite frankly, access to general medical health care for many women across the United States.\u201d For the new study, researchers tracked trends in monthly birth control prescription rates from March to November 2021 \u2013 a period before the Dobbs decision leaked \u2013 and after the decision, from July 2022 to October 2023. They compared rates in a group of 12 states that enacted the most restrictive policies to a group of 14 states where abortion policy remained relatively consistent. The use of birth control pills has been trending down in the US overall \u2013 and other research suggests that use of IUDs, a longer-acting form of birth control, has been growing for decades \u2013 but the prescription fill rate fell about 4% more than expected in states with the most restrictive laws post-Dobbs, according to the new research. States with abortion bans saw an even more significant drop in prescriptions for emergency contraception \u2013 including levonorgestrel, such as Plan B, and ulipristal, such as Ella. Both groups of states studied \u2013 those that enacted bans and those where abortion policies stayed more consistent \u2013 had a similar prescription fill rate pre-Dobbs and both and saw an initial spike following the decision.\u00a0But by the second half of 2023, the prescription rate for emergency contraception in the states with bans was less than half of what it was before the Dobbs decision \u2013 dropping from about 20 fills for every 100,000 women of reproductive age each month down to eight fills. In states where abortion policies stayed consistent, the rate actually ticked up in the same timeframe \u2013 from 20 to 21 fills. \u201cThese findings suggest that efforts to protect and improve access to oral contraceptives are needed, especially for emergency contraceptives in states where abortion is most strongly restricted,\u201d the study authors wrote. Emergency contraception has become enmeshed in the abortion debate, and survey data suggests that there was widespread public confusion around the legality of emergency contraception months after the Dobbs decision and how it differed from medication abortion. Nearly a third of adults were \u201cunsure\u201d if emergency contraceptive pills were legal in their state, according to a KFF survey from January 2023. The confusion was even greater in states with abortion bans, where half of women either incorrectly thought that it was illegal or were unsure. \u201cThis drives home the importance for proper and accurate patient education, consumer education, and the need to combat disinformation and misinformation about the conflation and confusion between (emergency contraception and abortion,\u201d said Karen Diep, a women\u2019s health policy analyst with KFF who was not involved in the new research. In December 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration adjusted the Plan B label to explicitly state that it \u201cdoes not terminate pregnancy.\u201d All while reproductive health care deserts are getting worse. About 1 in 9 women of reproductive age in the US \u2013 and closer to 1 in 5 Black and Hispanic women \u2013 rely on family planning clinics to get contraception, according to a KFF analysis from 2022. But dozens of clinics closed post-Dobbs \u2013 and the new study found that declines in emergency contraception prescriptions were greatest in states that saw more widespread closures of family planning clinics. And the landscape continues to change rapidly, adding to the confusion and challenges around access. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted to block a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to contraception nationwide. But the Biden administration has \u201credoubled\u201d commitments to protect access to reproductive health care, including support for Title X family planning clinics and work to ensure birth control remains accessible under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIn the two years since\u00a0Dobbs, we have witnessed the devastating impacts. Many women, especially those in states with stringent abortion\u00a0restrictions, have found themselves navigating care deserts, forced to travel great distances to\u00a0receive essential services. These barriers disproportionately affect marginalized communities,\u00a0exacerbating existing health disparities,\u201d US Department of Health and Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration stands firm in its commitment to defending reproductive rights. We believe that no woman should have fewer rights than her mother and that women must have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies without fear or interference from politicians,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/birth-control-drops-after-abortion-bans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_health_covid-summer-wave", "text": "Covid-19 levels have been rising in the United States for weeks as new variants drive what\u2019s become an annual summer surge. Covid-19 surveillance has been scaled back significantly since the US public health emergency ended more than a year ago \u2014 individual cases are no longer counted, and severe outcomes are based on representative samples of the population \u2014 but the data that is available is showing a consistent upward trend. Infections are probably growing in at least 38 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wastewater surveillance suggests that viral activity is still relatively low, but hospitalizations and deaths are also ticking up. Covid-19 levels are especially high in the West, where viral levels are back to what they were in February, and in the South, according to the CDC. \u201cThe virus tends to replicate well and to stay alive in an environment with warm and moist conditions. That fits with what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, a nonprofit public health organization. \u201cThe South and the West are steamy and hot right now.\u201d The summer bump has become a familiar seasonal pattern, but experts warn that the coronavirus can still be quite unpredictable. \u201cI think it\u2019s still a bit early to say what the pattern is,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cA large portion of the population has had some exposure to the virus, the peaks have been a little bit less high, and we have tended to see a summer bump as well as a winter increase. But whether that pattern is going to continue or whether it will become an all-year-round disease or whether it will stay in one particular time \u2014 I think it\u2019s a little early to say.\u201d Data from WastewaterSCAN, a nationwide sewage surveillance network based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, suggests that this summer wave started weeks earlier than last summer\u2019s wave and has reached levels similar to last summer\u2019s peak. \u201cIt remains to be seen if this will be a peak level for this surge,\u201d said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, assistant professor of environmental health at Emory and program director for WastewaterSCAN. \u201cWe are always trying to unpack what is potential seasonality with Covid and also what are the impacts of new variants that may be coming through that drive these surges that we see more regularly, more frequently than we do for influenza and RSV,\u201d she said. Over the past few months, the JN.1 virus variant that drove this winter\u2019s surge has been overtaken by newer offshoots. These so-called FLiRT variants \u2014 an acronym that refers to the locations of the amino acid\u00a0mutations that the virus has picked up \u2014 have changes in some places that help them evade the body\u2019s immune response and others that help them become more transmissible. Two of them \u2014 KP.3 and KP.2 \u2014 now account for more than half of the new Covid infections in the US, according to CDC data. Expect an updated vaccine this fall Because of manufacturing timelines, experts have to make predictions now if they want a new vaccine for fall. Earlier this month, the FDA endorsed a plan to update the Covid-19 shots to be more effective against the JN.1 lineage of the coronavirus. But the agency later updated its own recommendation. Vaccine manufacturers were advised to target the KP.2 strain if possible, in part because of the \u201crecent rise in cases.\u201d \u201cJN.1 has continued to evolve, and it makes it somewhat difficult to pick the particular specific strain to be used,\u201d Dr. Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told an independent advisory committee ahead of the initial recommendation. The new vaccines \u2014 some that will make the switch to target KP.2 \u2014 are anticipated to become available between mid-August and late September. That\u2019s enough time to offer protection during the winter respiratory virus season but probably after this summer\u2019s wave has ebbed. On Thursday, the CDC recommended that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated Covid-19 vaccine for the 2024-25 season. The recommendation echoes the vote of that agency\u2019s independent advisory committee. \u201cIt makes sense to do that vaccine at the same time that you\u2019re expecting flu and RSV, because you just want to reduce the overall incidence of disease,\u201d Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told CNN. Protection from Covid-19 vaccines wanes, and the timing of the shot prioritizes maximum protection when there have typically been higher and more sustained peaks, Plescia said. Unlike flu and RSV, Covid-19 is constantly circulating; it doesn\u2019t offer a reprieve. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever get a break,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do get a break from flu and RSV. You get through the season, and then you\u2019re done. You can prepare for the next one. [Covid] is just kind of always there.\u201d Flu and RSV levels now remain low in the US, according to the latest CDC update. But vaccination rates for all three major respiratory viruses lagged during the winter season, and the CDC advisers also looked ahead to the upcoming season with discussions around vaccine coverage recommendations for flu and RSV. On Wednesday, the CDC updated its recommendations on who should get the RSV vaccine. For the upcoming respiratory virus season, everyone 75 and older is urged to get an RSV vaccine, as well as those ages 60 to 74 who are at higher risk of severe illness. The changes are meant to \u201csimplify RSV vaccine decision-making for clinicians and the public,\u201d the agency said. When it comes to infectious respiratory diseases, Plescia said, \u201cpeople need to remember that there are things you can do to reduce your risk. And getting vaccinated is the main one.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/covid-summer-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_bids-for-connection-better-relationship-wellness", "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s a woodpecker over there!\u201d Alyssa Caribardi watched as her friend whipped her head around to look out the window and seek out the bird. And with that simple gesture, Caribardi knew their friendship would last. In what may seem like a small, everyday exchange, her friend\u2019s reaction was an important indicator for their relationship: She had responded to Caribardi\u2019s \u201cbid for connection,\u201d a term coined by relationship experts at the\u00a0Gottman Institute\u00a0in Seattle. Their interaction might not look important to outsiders, but Caribardi had given someone close to her an opportunity to connect, and her friend had reciprocated. \u201cBids for connection are when one partner reaches out to the other person for either interest, or a conversation or expressing a need,\u201d said Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, a clinical psychologist who has researched couples and long-lasting marriages alongside her husband, Dr. John Gottman, for more than 40 years. \u201cDepending on how the partner responds, the relationship either succeeds or doesn\u2019t do so well.\u201d The bids can be verbal or physical, such as pointing out a bird in a tree, repeating something heard on TV, asking for advice or even simply directing a smile at the other person. Whether the bid is big or small doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 what is important is the other person\u2019s response,\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said. And it\u2019s not just important for couples to know about these opportunities to connect \u2014 it also affects parent-child relationships, friendships, even business ties, she noted. How to recognize a \u2018bid for connection\u2019 The basis of \u201cbids for connection\u201d stems from the Gottmans\u2019 \u201cLove Lab\u201d research, which started\u00a0in 1986 and tracked couples for six years. At the end of that time, the couples still together were found to have responded to each other\u2019s bids 86% of the time, while those who split up only responded 33% of the time. Caribardi knows that feeling. The Leander, Texas, native said she thought the woodpecker was neat, partially because she had never seen one before. But the fun part was her friend\u2019s reciprocated interest that spiraled into a deep-dive Google session on the bird. \u201cWe can talk about literally anything and everything \u2014 a brick wall could talk to us. And the woodpecker showed me that,\u201d Caribardi said. \u201cBut even if she just said, like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that is really cool,\u2019 that\u2019s literally the only thing that you need. Just someone to acknowledge what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Caribardi posted her experience with the woodpecker on TikTok in October, referring to it as \u201cthe bird test,\u201d alongside others who took to the app to recount their experience with giving out small bids \u2014 such as pointing out cool birds \u2014 to their friends and partners. Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said this test is a good example of the importance of \u201cturning toward\u201d a partner, one of the three responses someone can have to a bid. If a partner responds to a bid, even with a simple acknowledgement that the other person was heard, it is the best and most beneficial response to have. If the partner were to ignore the other person and have no verbal response to the bid being made, she calls that \u201cturning away.\u201d But the worst response is what\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0calls \u201cturning against,\u201d which happens when there is hostility toward the bid. Partners may respond with a comment such as \u201cStop interrupting what I\u2019m doing,\u201d or another variation that tells the other person they don\u2019t care about the bid. \u201cMost of us, at the end of the day, want to be seen and understood and feel important. And so, when there are too many bids that are missed or rejected, it leaves you feeling the opposite: unseen, unimportant, misunderstood,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Fogel Mersy, a licensed psychologist and sex therapist based in Minnesota. \u201cIf that happens more often than not, it starts to erode connection and safety and trust in a relationship.\u201d What to do when your partner wants to connect While bids look to be crucial in a relationship, no one is perfect and should not be expected to answer a bid all the time, Fogel Mersy said. \u201cYou just want a ratio of more positive to negative responses to bids.\u201d If someone notices a partner has missed or continuously misses a bid, she recommends communicating the intent for attention by saying, \u201cHey, that was my way of trying to connect with you,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m looking to converse with you, or get some attention from you, is now a good time?\u201d Fogel Mersy also recommends people become more aware of their own responses when partners make a bid and even ask their partners directly if they feel they are getting responses to their calls for attention. The more direct a person is with a bid and its intent, the more likely the bid is to be reciprocated, she added. It\u2019s OK if a person notices that a partner is sending out a bid to connect but isn\u2019t feeling up to connecting at the moment, maybe because they are too tired or have a lot on their mind.\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0recommends communicating those feelings directly and honestly to the partner, instead of lashing out with a \u201cturning against\u201d response. \u201cMost of the time, if the response is positive, it\u2019s not really going to matter how small or big (the bid) is, but with negative \u2018turning away,\u2019 or \u2018turning against,\u2019 those can cause some real emotional damage in the relationship,\u201d\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said. The takeaway is \u201cthat turning toward one another is really the foundation of a good strong friendship \u2014 and also passion and romance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/bids-for-connection-better-relationship-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

{"id": "2024_07_01_health_alzheimers-association-criteria", "text": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0\u201cDr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: The Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient\u201d airs at 8 p.m. ET Sunday, July 7, on CNN. With another pricey Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment expected to receive an approval decision soon, the nonprofit Alzheimer\u2019s Association has published the final version of its new diagnostic criteria for the disease. And for the first time, the criteria call on doctors diagnosing the disease to rely on biomarkers \u2014 pieces of beta amyloid and tau proteins picked up by lab tests or on brain scans \u2014 rather than pen-and-paper tests of memory and thinking. The idea behind the change, the authors say, is to catch the condition in its earliest and most treatable stages, even before symptoms develop.\u00a0However, it also means people could be diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s based on a blood test alone, even if they don\u2019t have any memory difficulties. Biology should be the basis of the diagnosis, the authors argue, rather than symptoms.\u00a0Furthermore, they say, just because a person doesn\u2019t have symptoms doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t develop them down the line. But the criteria have been criticized by outside experts and drug industry watchdog groups who point out that people can have beta amyloid proteins in their brains and blood without ever developing dementia symptoms. They also point out that there\u2019s no research to support the idea that giving a person expensive, risky injected medications before they show symptoms will benefit them in the long run. Risks and benefits of early diagnosis In clinical trials, the new drugs \u2013 which are antibodies that recognize and grab onto pieces of beta amyloid to remove them from the brain \u2013 showed modest benefits. Beta amyloid peptides are protein pieces that form sticky plaques in the brain. Together with another protein, tau, which makes fibrous tangles that block the communication of nerve cells, they are considered a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There\u2019s still debate about the role of beta amyloid in the disease, however, and some experts contend that plaques are a consequence of the condition rather than its cause. In an 18-month study of people who were in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the antibody lecanemab \u2013 which the US Food and Drug Administration approved in 2023 \u2013 slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 27% compared with a placebo. Also last year, the experimental drug donanemab appeared to slow the progression of disease by about 35% compared with a placebo.\u00a0This month, a group of experts that advises the FDA on its drug approval decisions unanimously recommended the approval of donanemab for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The drugs come with some risk.\u00a0As they remove amyloid, they can lead to fluid accumulation, swelling and even microbleeds in the brain, which may lead to hospitalization. Both trials were in people who had early symptoms of memory decline. Studies that have tested antibodies in patients who had amyloid buildup in their brains but no symptoms have not found a benefit to patients. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence for it,\u201d said Dr. George Perry, a neurobiologist and editor of the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Critics say the new criteria could dramatically expand the number of people eligible to take the new drugs and could generate huge profits for drug manufacturers in the process. \u201cThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association should lose all credibility by releasing\u00a0guidelines labeling perfectly normal people as having Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, director of PharmedOut, a program based at Georgetown University that tracks pharmaceutical marketing tactics. \u201cIf followed, these guidelines will ruin the lives of tens of thousands of\u00a0people who\u00a0will be misinformed that they have dementia,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only entities that gain from this travesty are the pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s and the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, which is preying\u00a0on fear.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Association says its criteria is based on the latest developments in Alzheimer\u2019s science. Because Alzheimer\u2019s therapies haven\u2019t been approved for people without symptoms, for now, it recommends against diagnostic testing in people without cognitive impairment, according to the working group that developed the criteria. \u201cOur goal in sharing them now \u2014 even as the field and our knowledge continues to evolve \u2014 is to advance diagnosis, treatment and prevention in order to improve individual care and reduce the societal impact of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Dr. Maria C. Carrillo, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association\u2019s chief science officer and medical affairs lead, and senior author on the new criteria. Financial conflicts of interest The new criteria \u2013 from the leading patient advocacy organization for Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 were developed by a 20-member working group, many of whom reported financial ties to many of the companies that are marketing new drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s or that have new drugs in development. A third of the expert panel is directly employed by pharmaceutical companies, while another third has reported some other kind of payment from pharmaceutical or testing companies.\u00a0Two members of the panel were employees of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, which also takes funding from pharmaceutical companies.\u00a0Only a handful of members of the work group declared no relevant conflicts of interest. \u201cWe should not be relying on this paper that was basically developed by industry. It\u2019s just not standard of practice how we think about guidelines,\u201d said Dr. Eric Widera, a geriatrician at the University of California San Francisco who authored a commentary in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society on the new criteria. Widera says it\u2019s a familiar playbook for the pharmaceutical industry: expanding the market for a drug by first expanding the population diagnosed with the disease that it treats. \u201cThis is diagnostic creep,\u201d he said. He cites examples such as the \u201cIs it low T?\u201d awareness campaign, launched by Abbott Labs, which made a testosterone replacement product as well as a more sensitive test for the hormone. Biogen similarly created the \u201cIt\u2019s Time We Know\u201d campaign in 2021 to spread awareness of mild cognitive impairment after its Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm won a controversial FDA approval the same year. Aduhelm has since been taken off the market. Widera estimates that as many as 1 in 10 normally functioning 50-year-olds would test positive for beta amyloid under the new criteria. Currently, about 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s, but estimates suggest roughly 40 million would test positive for beta amyloid. \u201cPublications such as this are a necessary component of a strategy aimed at selling as many monoclonal antibodies as possible,\u201d said Dr. Karl Herrup, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Defending the need for industry input Dr. Clifford Jack, who studies brain imaging at the Mayo Clinic, led the development of the new guidelines and says he is proud of what the committee accomplished. \u201cI personally wrote about 99% of the text in the final document. And I have no conflict of interest at all,\u201d he said. The change in the guidelines was spurred, the authors say, by the availability of the first drugs to slow the progress of the disease as well as new blood tests for amyloid and tau proteins.\u00a0Those tests are available to doctors and patients through the specialty labs that make them, but they have not been approved by the FDA, which requires rigorous proof that a test doesn\u2019t give too many false negative or false positive results before it gives a green light for widespread use. In a comment on the new criteria, published Friday in the journal Nature Medicine, members of the work group said it was composed of members from industry, clinical medicine and academia as well as the FDA and the federal National Institute on Aging, to incorporate a diversity of viewpoints. \u201cWe want these criteria to reflect the best available current scientific knowledge, and some of that knowledge is contained in industry, who are the ones who are actually running these trials,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI can honestly say that I did not see any attempt at any point by a committee member to insert any kind of commercial interest into these guidelines,\u201d he said. The first draft of the criteria, which were first presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in 2023, noted that they were being developed as a collaboration between the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and the National Institute on Aging. But the new criteria received criticism, and the institute removed its name from the title after it was asked to do so by administration within the wider National Institutes of Health.\u00a0The collaboration violated an NIH policy not to endorse private entities, products or services, according to an email from the National Institute on Aging. \u201cNIA continues to serve on the working group and looks forward to continuing its collaborative efforts with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and other involved workgroup organizations,\u201d the agency said in a statement. Since the draft criteria were released, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association has clarified that these are not meant to serve as detailed diagnostic guidelines for clinicians. Instead, the criteria are meant to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between research and the doctor\u2019s office. New guidelines in the works The association said it plans to convene a new workgroup, with different members, to develop \u201cnuts-and-bolts\u201d guidelines for Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis for doctors.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear how much those guidelines will be based on the diagnostic criteria. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be very concrete, and it probably will include recommendations that describe specific commercial products,\u201d Jack said. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association is committed to the development of trustworthy clinical practice guidelines \u201cand other types of evidence-based guidance informing clinical decision-making at the individual, health system, and population levels,\u201d spokesperson Niles Franz said. \u201cA core criterion for trustworthy guidelines, as defined by the National Academy of Medicine, involves collaboration between an organizing body and panels of clinical and subject-matter experts who are minimally conflicted both intellectually and financially,\u201d Franz said in a statement. \u201cTo that end, the Association recently established rules for collecting [conflict of interest] disclosures from guideline panel nominees, criteria for evaluating these forms and selecting panel members, and process for managing existing and new conflicts during and after guideline development,\u201d he said. Franz said the association hopes to have the new clinical guidelines ready for publication by 2025. In the meantime, Widera and others say the decision to take one of the new amyloid-clearing drugs is highly personal and one that should be made in close collaboration with a physician. \u201cThere is, I would say, probably more controversy around these guidelines than there are about the drugs themselves,\u201d Widera said. Widera says he hopes that in the next round of guidelines, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association will consider the risks involved. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to broaden the definition of what a disease is, you should also say what is the risk and harm of doing so,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/alzheimers-association-criteria/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_low-back-pain-walking-wellness", "text": "Low back pain affects at least 619 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to increase to 843 million people by 2050, according to research estimates. Unfortunately, nearly 70% of people who recover from an episode of low back pain have a recurrence within a year, experts say. In addition to acute physical discomfort and lost time at work, treatment often requires education, physical therapy and exercises such as Pilates that may require fees or specialized equipment. Yet there is an easy, free way to prevent low back pain, at least for a while, according to a new randomized clinical trial. People in the study who walked regularly after having at least one episode of low back pain were pain free nearly twice as long as those who did not. \u201cThe intervention group had fewer occurrences of activity-limiting pain compared to the control group, and a longer average period before they had a recurrence, with a median of 208 days compared to 112 days,\u201d said senior author Mark Hancock, a professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University in Sydney. \u201cWalking is a low-cost, widely accessible and simple exercise that almost anyone can engage in, regardless of geographic location, age or socio-economic status,\u201d Hancock said in a statement. Walking for at least 30 minutes The study, published Wednesday in The Lancet journal, followed 701 Australian adults, mostly women in their 50s, who had recently recovered from an episode of low back pain that derailed their ability to perform daily activities. Each person was randomly assigned to a control group with no intervention or an individualized walking and educational program. Those in the intervention group were asked to build up to 30 minutes of walking five times a week over a six-month period at speeds adjusted for age, physical capacity and individual preferences. Jogging was also allowed. \u201cAfter three months, most of the people who took part were walking three to five days a week for an average of 130 minutes in total,\u201d Hancock told CNN via email. Participants were asked to wear pedometers to track their daily steps and keep a walking diary. At three months into the program, they also wore an accelerometer that objectively measured daily step count and the amount of brisk walking or other physical activity. The program also provided six physiotherapist-guided education sessions over six months, a more cost-effective model than typical treatment, Hancock said. \u201cWe included 3 standard sessions with a physiotherapist and 3 brief phone catch ups,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn the few previous studies of prevention exercise programs for back pain the intervention included approximately 20 group classes. \u201cWe also discussed simple strategies to reduce the risk of a recurrence of low back pain and instructions on how to self-manage any minor recurrences. The education was embedded in the same sessions as the walking prescription.\u201d Cost-effective intervention In addition to providing participants with longer pain-free periods, the walking program reduced the amount of time taken off work and medical visits by half, said lead study author\u00a0Natasha Pocovi, a postdoctoral fellow at Macquarie. \u201cThe exercise-based interventions to prevent back pain that have been explored previously are typically group-based and need close clinical supervision and expensive equipment, so they are much less accessible to the majority of patients,\u201d Pocovi said in a statement. \u201cOur study has shown that this effective and accessible means of exercise has the potential to be successfully implemented at a much larger scale than other forms of exercise.\u201d Due to the structure of the study, it was not possible to determine how much of the benefit was due to walking or the educational program provided by physiotherapists, Hancock said. \u201cWe believe it is likely the two components complement each other, with education helping to overcome avoidance and fear of movement, while the health coaching and walking program resulted in behavior change,\u201d he said. However, because the intervention appeared to be behavioral coaching, and not actual physical therapy, the act of walking may indeed have been the key reason for improvement, said A. Lynn Millar, a retired physical therapist\u00a0and former professor at Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was not involved in the study. \u201cThis is important, as many studies have shown that pain response is partially a behavioral response,\u201d Millar said in an email. \u201cThe coaching was limited in duration, thus they can suggest that the primary intervention of walking was the major contributor to the long term response.\u201d What walking does for the body What is it about walking that is so helpful for lower back pain? For one, exercise is good for every part of the body. \u201cFirst, the person is sitting less, and sitting is not the best posture for the back,\u201d Millar said. \u201cSecond, walking will improve general circulation,\u00a0and will improve blood circulation to the\u00a0muscles of the back that\u00a0are\u00a0actively supporting the individual during the motion. Movement of a joint also helps circulate the\u00a0joint fluids,\u00a0thus the\u00a0joints of the\u00a0spine may be benefiting from the motion.\u201d Walking improves metabolism and the amount of calories burned, experts say. Lower weight can ease the load on the back and legs, ensuring better spinal health. Taking a brisk stroll also improves the strength of core muscles around the spine and in the legs, all of which can improve posture and provide better support to the spine. Walking also increases muscle endurance, assuring muscles are less susceptible to fatigue and injury. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking increase bone density, protecting against injury while stimulating the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good hormones that reduce pain and stress. When starting a walking program, good shoes and arch supports are necessary,\u00a0and potential problems may be offset by exercise programs such as resistance training and stretching, Millar said. \u201cI also think it is important to have varied paces and distances throughout the week. Some problems are caused by progressing too rapidly, and not paying attention to initial\u00a0aches,\u201d she said. \u201cI also used to see people that were walking in shoes that did not have good support, or they had become so worn, the support was gone,\u201d she added. If your \u201cback goes out\u201d during walking, activity modification such as cycling or swimming may be necessary, Millar said.\u00a0 Taking a day or two off from walking and doing some back exercises and stretching can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/low-back-pain-walking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness", "text": "More water, please. Millions of Americans are experiencing a record-breaking heat wave that has continued for days on end. We know that keeping hydrated is important to staying healthy in the summer heat, but is water still the best drink during a heat wave? Or should people turn to sports drinks instead? What about soda, coffee and beer \u2014 is it advisable to keep drinking these beverages during extremely hot weather? To help guide us through drinks we should choose \u2014 and avoid \u2014 during hot weather events, I spoke with CNN wellness health expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: How much water should people normally drink, and does that change during extreme hot weather? Dr. Leana Wen: A quick rule of thumb that\u2019s often cited is the \u201c8 x 8 rule,\u201d which is eight 8-ounce glasses of water, or 64 ounces, of water per day for adults. That\u2019s half a gallon. This rule is not set in stone. There are many factors that influence how much water people need, including the type of food they eat, their body size and their physical activity. Other factors include air temperature and humidity, and, specifically, how much time you spend outdoors during hot weather. People working in the heat or otherwise engaging in physical activity should drink an 8-ounce cup of water every 15 to 20 minutes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This would total about 24 to 32 ounces per hour. People should also keep well hydrated before and after their outdoor time in the heat. CNN: Is it possible to drink too much water? Wen: Yes. The CDC guidance is that people should not drink more than 48 ounces (about 1.5 quarts) of water or other fluids in an hour. A large amount of fluid all at once can dilute the concentration of salts in our blood and be unsafe. CNN: When it\u2019s really hot outside, is water still the best fluid, or should people turn to sports drinks?  Wen: Sports drinks are beverages with added electrolytes. Their main purpose is to replenish water and electrolytes that are lost with sweating. These drinks contain electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Some have added sugars like fructose, glucose and sucrose.  Most people do not need drinks other than water. In general, adults engaging in mild to moderate physical activity and kids playing on the playground or doing recreational after-school sports do not need electrolyte replacement. The foods that we eat contain the electrolytes we need. People who could consider sports drinks are athletes who are engaging in vigorous exercise for at least an hour outdoors in hot weather. Again, though, not all these individuals will need electrolyte replacement beyond what they get from eating normally. Whether they do depends on factors such as how much they sweat, how hot and humid the environment is and how intensely they exercise. CNN: What\u2019s better, a sports drink that comes ready-made in a bottle or an electrolyte powder that you can add to make your own drink? Wen: Personally, I prefer the powder. There are also tablets that dissolve in water. These do-it-yourself options are cheaper, and I like to choose the brands that don\u2019t have much added sugar or chemicals. But this is a question of personal preference. Whatever you buy, make sure to look carefully at the ingredients. For instance, if you don\u2019t want added sugar or caffeine, make sure what you\u2019re drinking doesn\u2019t have these ingredients. CNN: What about energy drinks? Are these a good replacement for water? Wen: This is an important question. The short answer is no, energy drinks are not a replacement for water. They should be used with caution in adults, and children should not drink them. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which are meant to help you restore water and electrolytes. Energy drinks are not meant mainly to hydrate you. They often contain large amounts of caffeine and other legal stimulants such as L-carnitine and guarana. While caffeine can boost energy in the short term, it is also a diuretic, meaning that it causes someone to lose water. Too much caffeine also can cause jitteriness, anxiety and irregular heartbeats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against energy drinks for children and adolescents. In some studies, though, as many as 30% to 50% of adolescents report using energy drinks. I urge parents to be careful to distinguish between sports drinks and energy drinks. Neither are needed, but energy drinks, in particular, should be used with caution. CNN: What about other drinks with caffeine, like coffee? Is a cold brew or iced mocha a bad idea in hot weather? Wen: Not necessarily, though people should be aware that these caffeinated drinks may not hydrate you and may even dehydrate you further. This doesn\u2019t mean you should stop all coffee when it\u2019s hot outside. Just be aware of the effect of caffeine and consider drinking extra water while you are enjoying caffeinated beverages. CNN: What about sodas, punches and alcoholic beverages? Wen: Sodas and punches are considered ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to many adverse long-term health consequences, such as increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. Consumption should generally be kept at a minimum, and hot weather is no exception. Again, water is the preferred substance for hydration. Alcohol is best avoided when it\u2019s very hot outside. Be especially careful not to drink large amounts and become inebriated, as this could blunt your body\u2019s response to temperature regulation. You also may miss early signs of heat-related illnesses. Alcohol can be dehydrating as well. If you do choose to drink alcohol, limit your drinks, make sure there are people around you in case you get into trouble medically and be sure to drink plenty of additional nonalcoholic fluids. CNN: What about kids who are in all-day sports camps? Wen: It\u2019s hard to answer this without knowing exactly how the camp is structured. Many sports camps have indoor activities for at least a portion of the day, and even those that are predominantly outdoors should move their activities indoors during extreme heat warnings. When in doubt, it\u2019s advisable to speak with the camp director and ask about how much time will be spent outdoors. If the time is limited, there are regular breaks and much of the activity is low to moderate intensity, it\u2019s probably sufficient to hydrate with water and supplement with nutrient-dense snacks such as watermelon, coconut and avocado. Also focus on hydrating before and after camp. Sports drinks probably aren\u2019t needed, and, again, it\u2019s advisable for children to avoid energy drinks. CNN: What other precautions would you follow during extreme heat? Wen: Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Take extra care of children and the elderly, as well as people with chronic medical conditions that could be exacerbated by the heat. Be careful while exercising and try to move activities indoors or go in the early morning or late evening. And make sure to keep well-hydrated with the best substance for hydration \u2014 water!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_er-visits-heat-related-illnesses-wellness", "text": "As heat blankets much of the US, hospitals in many states are seeing extremely high rates of heat-related emergencies, according to data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and forecasters say more abnormally warm weather is on the way later this summer. According to the CDC\u2019s map, the regions hardest hit by heat illnesses are not always the ones seeing the highest temperatures. While temperatures have soared to 100 degrees and even beyond across much of the South and Southwest, the states seeing the highest numbers of heat-related ER visits are in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Mountain west, where temperatures have been in the 80s and 90s. But the heat is much more unusual, especially in mid-June, for these locations,\u00a0trending well above historical averages. On Saturday, for example, when the heat was reaching a climax in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, hospitals in more than two dozen states across six regions reported \u201cextremely high\u201d rates of heat-related emergencies despite temperatures hovering in that lower range. The CDC defines \u201cextremely high\u201d as being in the top 5% of busiest days for heat-related illnesses over the last five years, from 2018 through 2023. Hot buildings, inexperience put people at risk CDC health scientist Claudia Brown says that\u2019s because built environments in those areas aren\u2019t designed to deal with heat and people\u2019s bodies aren\u2019t as used to handling high temperatures. \u201cSo in these more northern regions, for example, there tends to be less prevalence of air conditioning in the homes,\u201d said Brown,\u00a0who works in the Climate and Health Program at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health.\u00a0\u201cSo you may not have as high of temperatures as you have in, say, Arizona, but you have a higher health impact because they don\u2019t have, necessarily, the infrastructure in place to deal with that heat.\u201d With climate change increasing both the number and intensity of heat waves, the CDC earlier this year launched a new heat risk tool where people can look up their ZIP code and see a heat forecast and recommendations to stay safe. Dr. Cheyenne Falat works in the emergency department at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, a city that declared a code red heat alert over the weekend and opened cooling stations for residents. \u201cWe have seen some pretty significant cases of heat stroke and other heat illnesses coming in over the past few weeks, not just the past few days,\u201d said Falat, who also specializes in environmental medicine.\u00a0 She\u2019s bracing for more. In Baltimore, where there are high rates of substance use disorders, people can get into trouble if they take drugs and pass out in a car with no one around.\u00a0 Other patients have been older adults who live in homes without air conditioning, outdoor workers, and people who underestimate the heat when they head outside for a workout. Falat said heat is a serious health threat Americans are just learning how to grapple with.  \u201cHeat waves as a natural phenomenon kill more people, on average, than any other extreme weather event,\u201d she said. Staying safe in extreme heat Dr. William Brady, who works in the emergency department at the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville said he thinks inexperience has a lot to do with it, too. \u201cYou know, if you live in New Hampshire, you\u2019re used to really not dealing with terribly high periods of heat,\u201d Brady said. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that way, that I have to be careful with the heat.\u201d Brady said their ER is seeing an uptick in cases of heat exhaustion, usually in people who work or exercise outdoors.\u00a0 They come in with \u201cnausea, vomiting, headache, that sort of thing.\u201d So far, he says, he hasn\u2019t seen any cases of heat stroke, which can be life-threatening. Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, where patients have a throbbing headache, a rapid heart rate, high fever, as well as neurological symptoms like confusion. They may also faint or pass out. Brady said he\u2019s also seeing more people with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk from climbing temperatures such as emphysema, heart failure and diabetes. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more patients that are coming in just not tolerating the heat,\u201d he said. With climate change driving longer, ever hotter waves of high temperatures, Americans are on a steep learning curve when it comes to heat. \u201cWe know that heat is uncomfortable when temperatures and humidity reach a certain height,\u201d Brady said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not really used to being threatened by it the way other parts of the world have had been.\u201d Brady recently attended a medical conference in Taiwan and took a class to learn how to manage large crowds and mass gatherings during periods of high heat, to cut down on the risk of heat injury. \u201cThis is a potentially new issue that were beginning to face,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAnd we need to pay attention to it because it is exceedingly dangerous.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/er-visits-heat-related-illnesses-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}

The Maryland-based company halted ice cream production and distribution and recalled the products after FDA sampling revealed potential traces of Listeria monocytogenes. There are no reports of illnesses so far, the company said. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can cause listeriosis, the\u00a0third leading cause\u00a0of death from foodborne illness in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Listeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in pregnant women, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, while healthy people may experience short-term symptoms like high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, according to the recall notice.

{"id": "2024_06_21_health_tiktok-falsehoods-sun-protection-wellness", "text": "As our planet endures what may be the hottest year on record, social media influencers are spawning messages about the sun and sunscreen that are not only false, but dangerous, say experts. \u201cStop wearing sunscreen,\u201d says a TikTok influencer with 1.6 million followers and 36 million likes. \u201cThe more time you spend outside, the less likely you are to get sunburned,\u201d proclaims a shirtless TikTokker with nearly 90,000 followers and over 11 million likes. \u201cThe sun does not cause skin cancer,\u201d insists a TikTok pundit with 76,000 followers in a post that has been bookmarked nearly 4,000 times. \u201cCooling down the skin can help prevent sunburns,\u201d claims another TikTokker with over 4 million likes. \u201cWhen I feel my skin starting to get hot in the sun, I\u2019ll go in the ocean or I\u2019ll go in the pool, and I\u2019ll cool down.\u201d Such assertions fly in the face of decades of scientific research on the dangers of sun exposure and the protective role of sunscreen, experts say. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a \u201cproven human carcinogen,\u201d causing squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, which works closely with industry. Long-wave ultraviolet A rays (UVA) and short-wave ultraviolet B rays (UVB) penetrate the ozone layer\u00a0and can burn, damage and age skin\u00a0even on cloudy days. \u201cExtensive research has shown that UV radiation from the sun is a significant cause of skin cancers such as melanoma. It\u2019s really indisputable at this point,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen Suozzi, a dermatologic surgeon at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cUV radiation has both UVA and UVB, and we know that both of them damage the DNA in skin cells,\u201d she said. \u201cThese mutations accumulate over time and then lead to skin cancer \u2014 which can quickly spread throughout the body \u2014 as well as wrinkles, dark spots and other signs of skin aging.\u201d What should you do? Wearing a hat, sunglasses and protective clothing \u2014 along with sunscreen and staying in the shade during the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \u2014 will help protect the skin from sun damage, experts say. Jumping in the water to cool off the skin, however, does not. \u201cIt\u2019s really the exact opposite,\u201d Suozzi said. \u201cYou\u2019ll just lose the sense of heat, so you\u2019ll get a higher exposure to UV without knowing it, and because the water is reflective, you\u2019ll get a double hit of exposure to your face.\u201d Early sun damage can lead to melanoma years later Historically, younger generations often fail to adequately protect themselves from the sun, experts say. Surveys show that trend continues today among Gen Z young adults. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only 8% of men and 26% of women younger than 30 said they always used sunscreen when outside for more than an hour on a sunny day. \u201cSunlight isn\u2019t toxic, sunscreen is,\u201d according to an X contributor who says he has a doctorate in tanning without sunscreen. While some products do contain worrisome chemicals, many do not, and today\u2019s broad spectrum sunscreens do a much better job at protecting the skin from UVA and UVB rays, said David Andrews, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a consumer organization which advocates for sunscreen safety. \u201cMineral-based sunscreens are not absorbed into the skin and are better for the environment,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThere are many good, safe choices on the market that don\u2019t leave a white cast on the skin.\u201d Unless accelerated by a tanning bed, skin damage can take years, if not decades to develop, experts say, leaving today\u2019s unwary youth at risk for early skin aging and lethal skin cancers such as melanoma. \u201cMelanoma is the deadliest cancer known to man,\u201d said Dr. Kelly Olino, clinical director of the Smilow Melanoma Program at the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cMelanoma is the only type of cancer where, if it is two-millimeters in size, we say \u2018Goodness, this is serious,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf you had a two-millimeter colon cancer, we\u2019d be having a parade saying, \u2018Wow, we got this one really, really early.\u2019\u201d Sun tanning versus sunburns While getting a sunburn appears to be a no-no for many of these social media gurus, they do encourage their followers to get a tan. The reasoning goes like this: As UV exposure is increased, a pigment in the skin called melanin darkens. Melanin has protective properties against UV radiation; therefore tanning should be encouraged. \u201cSlow exposure to the sun allows you to build melanin and protect skin the natural way,\u201d says a Tiktokker who has gathered over 3 million likes. \u201cAs long as\u00a0you have a good tan, you don\u2019t need sunscreen. It\u2019s much better to just quietly, slowly build up a tan during the spring,\u201d said a computer scientist interviewed on X, formerly known as Twitter. That\u2019s just so wrong, according to experts. \u201cTanning is the body\u2019s response to being damaged, so tanned skin is already damaged skin, and all you\u2019re doing is creating more and more damage,\u201d Olino said. \u201cIn the best case scenario with your \u2018base tan\u2019 or sun damaged skin, the melanin that\u2019s produced gives you an SPF of 2 to 4 or so, and we would never tell people that anything less than 30 SPF would be protective from additional sun damage,\u201d she said. In fact, a sunburn is much more than a red flag for a little sun damage. It\u2019s a sign of actual cell death, Suozzi explained. \u201cWe see this under the microscope,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call them sunburnt cells, and you can see them actually dying. And when they die, the body creates inflammation, and that\u2019s what causes the redness. It\u2019s a very inflammatory process.\u201d When it comes to vitamin D, 15 minutes of sun on the skin each day is all that is needed, said Andrews, and the skin does not need to be free of sunscreen for that to happen. \u201cVitamin D can still be generated when you\u2019re wearing sunscreen,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cYou can actually still have that beneficial sun exposure while you\u2019re wearing a sunscreen that\u2019s reducing the risk of sunburn and preventing overexposure to the sun.\u201d A little truth, a lot of malarky Social media pundits often espouse ideas that distort a grain of truth, such as pointing to data that shows a simultaneous rise in sunscreen use and new melanoma diagnoses. \u201cSince sunscreen came out, the rise of skin cancer has only gone up and up,\u201d says one TikTok influencer. \u201cIf you think sunscreen is protecting you from melanoma, why is the rate going up?\u201d asks the computer scientist in her TikTok interview. It is true that the rate of melanoma cases has been rising, but it\u2019s not due to sunscreen, Suozzi said. Instead, credit dermatologists, who are detecting skin cancers at earlier stages and saving lives. That\u2019s a good thing. \u201cDue to better screening we are detecting melanomas at earlier stages, which leads to higher reported incidence rates,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition, the sun exposure that\u2019s causing the increase in melanomas today occurred 40 or 50 years ago, when people were in their 20s and unlikely to use sunscreen. So the driving force is exposure years and years ago, not the increased use of sunscreen today.\u201d Sunglasses are another target. As one TikTok influencer told his friend: \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get sunburned if you wear sunglasses. \u201cOur eyes can sense the sun \u2026. and when it\u2019s harsh lighting our eyes tell us to produce melanin in our skin,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf our eyes can\u2019t realize that the sun is that harsh because we\u2019re wearing a lens over top, it\u2019s gonna burn your skin.\u201d So if people go out into the sun with sunglasses on, \u201cyou can burn a lot easier because your brain didn\u2019t get the message that the sun\u2019s hot,\u201d another said. While the eyes do contain melanin \u2014 that\u2019s what determines our eye color \u2014 the vast majority of the body\u2019s pigmentation is produced by cells in the skin, which is the largest organ of the body. Ultraviolet light penetrates deep into the lower layer of the epidermis to trigger the process. \u201cThe videos seem to imply that if you weren\u2019t wearing sunglasses, you\u2019d also get tanned under your clothes, which we absolutely know doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d EWG\u2019s Andrews said. \u201cIf it\u2019s only going to the brain, then your whole body would be perfectly tanned, right? \u201cIt made me laugh and cry. It\u2019s frightening, and I know those videos have thousands of views, which is shocking, because the message is so separated from reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these falsehoods are only influencing a few people, that\u2019s one person too many.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/tiktok-falsehoods-sun-protection-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_health_hiking-heat-safety-wellness", "text": "With summer officially here, many people are excited to go hiking along their favorite local trails or tackle an out-of-town bucket-list hike. But before you grab your backpack and race out the door, hiking and safety officials urge caution. Temperatures are already soaring in many parts of the nation and around the world, and high heat has the potential to make any hike risky \u2014 and even deadly. Earlier in June, a young couple was rescued on a hiking trail in the California desert after running out of water and becoming dehydrated. The boyfriend was conscious during the rescue, but the girlfriend appeared unconscious, and medical officials referred to her \u201csevere condition,\u201d according to KTLA in Los Angeles. Others have not been as fortunate. Last year, a 14-year-old boy died while hiking with two family members in Texas\u2019 Big Bend National Park. The temperature was 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius). In 2021, a couple, their 1-year-old child and their dog all died in California while hiking in Devil\u2019s Gulch Valley on an extremely hot day. Experts said they likely perished from hyperthermia (an abnormally high body temperature) and dehydration. In Phoenix, where more than 200 hikers are rescued every year \u2014 mostly due to hiking during the hottest part of the day \u2014 the city instituted a program to close certain trails when the heat reaches excessive levels. How to tackle hiking in the heat Despite these heat-related dangers, it\u2019s possible to hit the trails safely when temperatures soar. Here\u2019s how to do so, according to experts. Prepare for a hot hike ahead of time Whether it\u2019s hot or cool, you should be in reasonable shape before tackling any hike. If you\u2019re planning a hilly, 5-mile trek, for example, make sure you\u2019re able to hike 5 challenging miles before arriving at the trailhead. To prepare for heat, become acclimatized to hot weather. You can do so by taking short, easy hikes in warm weather, progressing up to longer, more difficult hikes in hot weather. If that\u2019s not possible and you\u2019re traveling to a hot locale for your hike, schedule the trek several days into the trip when your body will be more accustomed to the weather. It\u2019s also good to know your sweat rate, said Dr. Floris Wardenaar, an assistant professor of nutrition\u00a0at Arizona State University in Phoenix. Wardenaar, who studies the physiological aspect of hiking, recommended weighing yourself before and after several hikes, then comparing any weight loss with the amount of water you consumed during the hike. \u201cBody mass loss is a good proxy marker of sweat loss,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lose more than 2% of your body weight on a hike.\u201d If you\u2019re losing more weight than that, you should be drinking more fluids. Load up on water and carry a water filter Water is essential for any hike, no matter the season \u2014 but it\u2019s critical in hot weather. Unfortunately, many people underestimate the amount of water they\u2019ll need. \u201cAlways hike with a water treatment device, too, and carry electrolytes,\u201d Martinez said. Electrolyte tablets or drinks help replace the salts and minerals lost through sweat, which assists in preventing heat-related ailments such as heatstroke and heat exhaustion. \u201cBring extra water, even if it\u2019s heavy,\u201d said Teresa Ana Martinez, executive director and cofounder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition. The Continental Divide Trail stretches 3,100 miles (4,989 kilometers) from Mexico to Canada, including some 800 miles (1,287.5\u00a0kilometers) in New Mexico, where there\u2019s plenty of desert terrain. Hike in the morning, preferably on shady trails \u201cThe benefit of hiking earlier in the day versus later in the evening is that in the evening, the earth still holds heat from the day,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cIt will radiate from the rocks, too.\u201d If possible, select a trail that winds through shady woods, along water or even in a cool canyon or cave. This way, should you struggle with the heat, you can find shade and water for cooling off. Wear light, loose clothing that covers most of your skin A long-sleeve shirt and pants might seem counterintuitive on a hot day, but they\u2019ll prevent sunburn and stop your skin and body from heating up. A neck buff and hiking gloves are also a good idea, said Abe Christian, operations manager for the Florida Trail Association. The Florida Trail meanders more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) through the state, from Big Cypress Swamp on the southern tip of the peninsula to Fort Pickens in the panhandle. \u201cThere are plenty of places on the Florida Trail where the sun can beat you to death,\u201d Christian said. \u201cSo you need to cover your skin as best as possible.\u201d The buff can also double as a compress should the heat get to you. Just dip it in water and place on your head and neck. Take along a sun umbrella, phone \u2014 and a buddy Make sure you have a fully charged phone in case you need to call for help. A portable battery is helpful, too. Martinez swears by a sun umbrella, which keeps the sun\u2019s rays from heating your head. (Look for those with an ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF, label or a seal of recommendation from groups such as the Skin Cancer Foundation.) If possible, bring along a friend. Sometimes when you\u2019re experiencing dehydration, heat exhaustion or heatstroke, you\u2019re not thinking clearly and don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in danger. When in doubt, turn around \u201cIf you start your hike and think it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too hot,\u201d Martinez said. Just turn around and come back another day, she said. Another tip: Turn around when half of your water is gone, even if you haven\u2019t reached your goal. \u201cYour ego is your worst enemy,\u201d Martinez warned. \u201cPeople underestimate how quickly things can escalate. You don\u2019t know when your body will say, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/health/hiking-heat-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_politics_chevron-ruling-explained-supreme-court-meaning", "text": "A major Supreme Court ruling Friday that shifted power from the executive branch to the judiciary stands to transform how the federal government works. By overturning a 1984 precedent, the court\u2019s conservative majority has made countless regulations vulnerable to legal challenge. The types of executive branch moves that the ruling jeopardizes include a plan to put Wi-Fi on school buses, a new ban on noncompete clauses, health care coverage rules being implemented through Obamacare, and the latest plan to forgive student loan debt. The Supreme Court ruling could boost efforts by conservatives who have taken aim at the Biden Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s rules limiting planet-warming pollution from vehicles, oil and gas wells and pipelines, and power plants. \u201cThere is no substantive area that this doctrine does not touch,\u201d said Kent Barnett, a University of Georgia School of Law professor who specializes in administrative law. The so-called Chevron doctrine \u2014 named after the case, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council \u2014 told courts to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute in circumstances in which the law in question is vaguely written. The precedent is deeply entrenched in administrative law, with Republican and Democratic administrations alike using it to shield regulatory action from legal attack. \u201cEssentially, anytime where an agency has a dispute with either an individual or some other entity \u2014 sometimes even the federal government versus the state government \u2014 Chevron deference could come up,\u201d said Thomas Berry, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion overruling the precedent, writing for an ideologically split 6-3 court that \u201cCourts must exercise their independent judgement in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority.\u201d The Roberts court has been chipping away at the precedent over the years. But in the case before the justices this term \u2014 two lawsuits challenging regulations requiring that fishermen pay environmental monitors they are required to carry on their boats \u2014 the high court dealt the final blow. The ruling has injected legal uncertainty into regulations of all types, including those on technology, labor, the environment and health care. There are so many highly complex scientific policy decisions that it would be nearly impossible for Congress to draft legislation with enough detail to account for every regulatory scenario,\u00a0legal scholars argue. Roberts said the new opinion should not be used to upend previous cases upholding regulations absent a \u201cspecial justification.\u201d But Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissent joined by the court\u2019s two other liberals,\u00a0questioned whether that threshold would really constrain the ruling\u2019s reach, given the possibility of new lawsuits against regulations that went unchallenged because of the protections of Chevron, as well as the ability of lower courts to find a \u201cspecial justification\u201d in almost any circumstance. For now, opponents of regulations are constrained by a six-year statute of limitation for challenging executive branch actions under the relevant law. But the Supreme Court has yet to decide a case heard this term that might gut that limitation.\u00a0That decision is expected Monday. Here is a partial look at what could be affected by the new ruling: Consumer safeguards Agencies charged with consumer protection, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, often face opposition\u00a0from\u00a0financial service firms and other private-sector companies, which may claim that new rules constrain their ability to compete or cost them too much. Think of issues like what shows up on your credit report, what fees banks and other consumer service providers can charge, how lenders make credit decisions, and rules governing the protection of consumers from scams and fraud. Lawsuits that block those regulations could be costly for consumers, advocates say. Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, pointed to a recent ruling in Texas in which a federal court paused CFPB\u2019s new rule limiting credit card late fees. \u201cEvery day that rule remains stayed, consumers pay $27 million in late fees that they otherwise would not have had to pay if the rule were in place,\u201d Rust said. Giving power to the judicial branch to interpret how agencies can apply consumer laws when there are statutory ambiguities will hurt consumers and \u201crubber-stamp\u201d the political aims of \u201cactivist judges,\u201d Rust said, adding that it will also limit the ability of consumer advocates to weigh in on regulatory policy. \u201cI can\u2019t get a meeting with the Supreme Court, but I can get a meeting with the CFPB,\u201d Rust said, referring to public comments solicited by the agency while regulations are crafted. \u201cI don\u2019t think many in the public are up to writing an amicus brief.\u201d Proposed employer rules and employee rights may be more constrained Overtime pay, benefits, workplace retirement plans, the minimum wage, independent contractors and employee rights to unionize are just some of the critical workplace issues for which guardrails set by agencies charged with enforcing workplace laws\u00a0may be contested more vociferously than they already are now. The decision may immediately affect a hot-button rule issued this year by the Federal Trade Commission banning noncompete clauses in employer contracts, a regulation the agency says could benefit 1 in 5 US workers but is being challenged by business groups. \u201cThe noncompete case is among the most vulnerable, along with many Securities and Exchange Commission cases,\u201d said Andrew Schwartzman, senior counselor at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society. When it comes to regulatory agencies like the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, they will no longer be given an automatic advantage when a case is brought challenging how they chose to interpret a law. \u201cWhat this decision changes is that the agency no longer gets a boost when it comes into court. If a case was like a race, the agency often started a few legs ahead. Today it starts at the same line as the challenger,\u201d said Alexander MacDonald, a partner and member of the Workplace Policy Institute at Littler, a law firm representing employers. \u201cNothing about today\u2019s decision means the agency loses. It just means the challenger has an equal opportunity to put forth its interpretation of the law,\u201d MacDonald added. When it comes to supporting and upholding worker rights and protections, the ruling on its face may not signal that courts would necessarily disadvantage federal agencies, said Sharon Block, a Harvard Law School professor and executive director of its Center for Labor and a Just Economy. But practically speaking, if a court or particular judge is hostile to a given issue, that may tip the scales against them. \u201cThe ruling says courts may be informed by the agency\u2019s interpretation. That also means they may not. It\u2019s up to them,\u201d Block said. \u201cThe least democratic part of the government will determine what kind of protections the American people have \u2026 that Congress has entrusted to agencies.\u201d With this ruling, she said, the Supreme Court, has sent \u201can engraved invitation to aggressive challenges to anything these agencies do.\u201d Potential weakening of patient and consumer health care protections Friday\u2019s ruling\u00a0could open the door to legal challenges to the decisions made by the government\u2019s public health agencies, with the American Cancer Society and other health associations warning\u00a0in a friend-of-the-court brief\u00a0that the reversal of Chevron could unleash a \u201clitigation tsunami,\u201d even on long-settled policy. The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Health and Human Services (through its Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) rely heavily on the flexibility that the Chevron deference provides to manage a highly detailed and sometimes unavoidably complex regulatory process. On Medicaid alone, the law is what one federal judge\u00a0famously described as\u00a0\u201calmost unintelligible to the uninitiated.\u201d The laws created to allow these health agencies the authority to regulate the country\u2019s complex health sector were written in a purposely ambiguous way,\u00a0legal scholars say. Ambiguity was necessary to give the agencies the flexibility to use their technical and scientific expertise to make the countless real-world policy decisions that make up the regulatory foundation of programs that directly affect the health of nearly every American. The multitude of Health and Human Services Department regulations that govern the Affordable Care Act exchanges, Medicaid, Medicare, insurance coverage and more could now be more easily challenged in court. Several regulations \u2014 including those involving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal premium tax credits, annual out-of-pocket limits, the adequacy of in-network doctor options and preventive health services at no cost to patients \u2014 could be subject to litigation by those seeking to challenge the agency\u2019s interpretations of the congressional statutes, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research and polling organization. In addition, challengers could have more chances of success in lawsuits against HHS regulations issued by the Biden administration that ban health care providers and insurers from discriminating based on gender identity and sexual orientation and that interpret the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, as prohibiting the disclosure of information on reproductive health care, including abortions, said Andrew Twinamatsiko, a director at the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. \u201cIt really moves away from the understanding that we have a robust scientific community that protects our health,\u201d Twinamatsiko said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have everybody coming in and second-guessing what these agencies are doing, and thereby creating this chaos and also a lack of trust in the system.\u201d Other programs that could be in jeopardy include the FDA\u2019s\u00a0Fast\u00a0Track\u00a0approval process, with which the agency has sole discretion over which drugs or devices qualify for expedited approval. Some scholars say\u00a0the\u00a0FDA\u00a0approval process as a whole could also be undermined by Chevron\u2019s reversal. Drugs and devices are approved by the FDA based on evidence that companies submit from what the law calls\u00a0\u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d investigations. However, the definition of such an investigation is left up to FDA interpretation. Challenges to tech regulations, such as new net neutrality rules The end of Chevron could complicate the US government\u2019s efforts to regulate data brokers, social media platforms, generative artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency and more as agencies scramble to interpret their congressional mandates to fit those new challenges. Shifting regulatory power from agencies to the courts gives well-resourced companies with armies of lawyers even more power to fend off regulations they view as harmful. \u201cCongress rarely gets anything done on tech, so agencies do most of the regulatory work,\u201d said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the market research firm TD Cowen. \u201cBut if the court reduces their rulemaking power, it would be particularly helpful in protecting the major tech platforms against new regulations that currently appear likely if Biden is reelected.\u201d In the telecom sector, Chevron has been a major reason the Federal Communications Commission is recognized as having the power to regulate \u2014 and deregulate \u2014 internet service providers (ISPs). Using that authority, the agency voted in April to restore net neutrality rules for ISPs, prohibiting them from blocking or slowing down websites, a move that instantly triggered industry lawsuits. Major questions doctrine is the next big regulatory legal fight In some ways, the court\u2019s decision overturning Chevron simply makes official what has already been the reality in practice, other legal experts say. \u201cFor quite some time, Chevron has been a dead letter for several reasons,\u201d said David Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor and former director of the FTC\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cBy and large, Chevron is no longer cited, let alone relied on, in lower courts.\u201d Faced with a hostile Supreme Court,\u00a0the EPA has relied on Chevron less and less in recent years. Still, the end of the precedent takes another tool out of the agency\u2019s legal toolbox. For instance, the Supreme Court in 2014 cited Chevron to uphold a version of the EPA\u2019s so-called good-neighbor rule, which addresses the problem of air pollution that travels across state lines. The Supreme Court put the latest iteration of the regulation on hold last week after a lower court \u2014 in a decision that did not cite Chevron \u2014 said the new pollution rules could be implemented. Overturning Chevron could also theoretically hamstring a future Republican administration trying to implement its own rules. Chevron\u2019s reversal \u201cdoesn\u2019t eliminate agency authority; it shifts the burden of how you interpret a statute,\u201d said Ann Carlson, the former acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. In her view, the major questions doctrine \u2014 which says agencies can\u2019t regulate things of \u201cmajor\u201d economic or political significance if Congress hasn\u2019t given them explicit authority to do so \u2014 is what to watch. Major questions, if used often and effectively to attack the EPA and other agencies, could render them useless because it argues they cannot operate without Congress passing laws explicitly giving them approval to do things, Carlson and other environmental law experts said. Given extreme political polarization, things often move at a glacial pace in Congress. Whether the Supreme Court is overturning Chevron or reviving major questions, David Doniger, a senior federal strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN,\u00a0\u201ctheir goal is enfeebling the federal government.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/chevron-ruling-explained-supreme-court-meaning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning\u00a0to doctors on Tuesday to be on the look out for cases of dengue. A surge in dengue cases globally is raising the risk that people could catch the disease in the US. The number of people who develop the mosquito-borne disease has been increasing globally as the world\u2019s climate warms due to the human-made climate crisis. The infected mosquitos that spread the disease, the Aedes aegypti, and sometimes\u00a0Aedes albopictus, mosquitoes like warmer and wetter weather. Generally, dengue had been relatively rare in the continental US with most people getting sick after having traveled to popular destinations overseas where the disease is more common. So far this year, a higher-than-expected number of dengue cases have been identified among US travelers, with 745 cases in records kept through June 24, the CDC said. In 2023, 1,829 travel-associated cases were reported by US travelers, the highest number of travel-associated cases since dengue became reportable in the US in 2010, according to the CDC.  Twenty-three countries reported outbreaks last year with more than 5 million cases reported to the World Health Organization and 4,000 deaths in the Americas alone. Over the years there have been a handful of outbreaks in locally-transmitted cases in states with warmer climates and habitat friendly to the kind of mosquito that spread dengue like Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona. California reported its first locally transmitted case in Pasadena last year. Tuesday\u2019s warning from the CDC says that the number of global infections in 2024 have been the highest on record. Cases in the Americas have already exceeded the highest number ever recorded in a single year,\u00a0with more than 9.7 million people getting sick with dengue; that\u2019s twice as many cases in all of 2023. So many people have gotten sick with dengue in Puerto Rico, local public health officials declared a public health emergency. Other areas with frequent dengue transmission associated with the US include American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. The CDC warning instructs doctors to test patients with symptoms that look like dengue, especially those patients who have traveled to a part of the world where the disease is more common. Symptoms typically start about a week after the person has been bitten by the infected mosquito, although 40 to 80% of infections are asymptomatic, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA). Symptoms of dengue can include a fever, vomiting, muscle aches, joint and bone pain, pain behind the eyes, headache, nausea, low white blood cell counts and a fever. Most people recover after about a week. The CDC said warning signs that the dengue is progressing to a more serious form of the disease include persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, bleeding from the nose or gums, liver enlargement, being tired and abdominal pain. Severe disease can bring with it severe bleeding, respiratory distress, and a person\u2019s organs can start shutting down and people can die. Mortality can be as high as 13% in untreated patients, the IDSA said. Infants, pregnant people and the elderly are at an increased risk for severe dengue, along with people who have certain underlying medical conditions. Other than supportive care including treatment with fluids and rest, there are no specific medicines to treat dengue. There is no dengue vaccine recommended for travelers or for adults. There was a vaccine, Dengvaxia, but Sanofi Pasteur stopped making it citing a lack of demand. The public health departments in Puerto Rico will still be giving the shots to children aged 9 to 16 years with a lab-confirmed case who live in areas with frequent transmission until the doses expire in 2026. In April of this year the CDC had launched an emergency response that addresses the increasing dengue caseload in the US. It also expanded lab capacity and is working with local leaders to strengthen surveillance for the disease. To prevent dengue, use bug spray when outside, particularly when traveling to parts of the world where dengue is common. Wear loose-fitting and long-sleeved shirts and pants. Run the air conditioning or use window screens so mosquitos stay outside.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_health_bionic-leg-ami-neuroprosthesis", "text": "Amy Pietrafitta has learned to walk seven times. First was as a child and then after an industrial burn led to the amputation of her left leg in 2018. Since then, she\u2019s had \u201cfirst steps\u201d in prosthetic legs for running, water, high heels, rowing and everyday walking. Her latest \u201cfirst steps\u201d were different. This time, she was fitted with a bionic leg that was fully connected to her brain, allowing her to walk and move like anyone else. With this new leg, she said, she couldn\u2019t even tell there was a difference. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like my leg had been amputated,\u201d the 47-year-old from Massachusetts said. \u201cIt was the happiest moment in my life.\u201d Pietrafitta was part of a study of a new neuroprosthesis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that\u2019s fully controlled by the nervous system. Her leg had been amputated using a novel muscle-pairing technique called agonist-antagonist myoneural interface, or AMI, which preserves signaling between the muscles and the brain. The neuroprosthesis uses sensors placed between the reconstructed amputation site and the bionic leg to transmit electrical signals from the brain. This allows the prosthetic to sense its position and movement and to send this information back to the patient, enabling a sense of proprioception: the brain\u2019s ability to sense self-movement and location in space. The study,\u00a0published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, indicated that participants who\u2019d had the specialized amputation and neuroprosthesis increased their walking speed 41%, matching the ranges and abilities of people without leg amputations. The results also suggested that the bionic limb could be controlled using just 18% of natural proprioception.  This is the first bionic leg fully controlled by the human nervous system to demonstrate natural walking speeds and gait patterns, according to Dr. Hugh Herr, principal investigator and senior author of the study and co-lead of the\u00a0Yang Center for Bionics\u00a0at MIT, where the research took place. \u201cIt feels natural, as if the limb were made of flesh and bone. It\u2019s as if the central brain isn\u2019t aware the limb is amputated because the brain is getting normal sensations,\u201d said Herr, who had both legs amputated below the knee after a climbing accident in 1982. Herr embarked on the project after observing a trend of prosthetics being increasingly controlled by robotic algorithms rather than the human nervous system. \u201cWe want to rebuild human bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reconstruct and give people back what they so seek. We don\u2019t just want to build fancier and fancier robotic tools or devices.\u201d To test the interface, 14 participants were split into two groups and fitted with bionic prosthetic legs. Seven had undergone AMI surgery, and seven had not. The results suggested that those with AMI amputations navigated real-world environments better, including slopes, stairs, obstructed pathways and even an \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d-style course, according to Pietrafitta and Dr. Matthew J. Carty, the lead surgeon in the first AMI procedure and a co-author of the new study. \u201cThis is a fundamental paradigm shift in the way we think about amputation in conjunction with technology: treating it as a restorative procedure as opposed to a failure,\u201d Carty said. Beyond first steps The technology also allows users to switch between speeds without changing prosthetics. This reduces the hassle of swapping legs, avoids unwanted attention and restores a sense of normalcy, according to Pietrafitta. \u201cIt felt normal. \u2026 I was ready to run. I kept wanting to take my hands off [the supports], to get out and start moving,\u201d she said. Restoring a normal gait is about more than getting from point A to point B. According to Pietrafitta, it\u2019s about re-entering society. \u201cIt meant my life could begin again. \u2026 I could go out there and live the way I wanted to,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in your home and you\u2019re bedridden, family and friends start to dwindle away. It\u2019s too hard for people to come in and see you in pain.\u201d For John Rheinstein, a lower and upper limb prosthetic specialist and clinic manager at the Hanger Clinic in New York, the physical prosthesis is only part of a successful amputation outcome. \u201cCare has improved over the years (in part) as a result of advances in understanding and treating the emotional impacts of losing a limb,\u201d he wrote in an email. Is innovation accessible? An estimated 1.9 million Americans live with limb loss, a figure expected to double by 2050, largely due to increasing rates of diabetes, a known risk factor, according to a 2018 report published by the federal\u00a0Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Herr said his team aims to make fully neuro-controlled prosthetics commercially available within five years. However, the 2018 report estimates that fewer than half of people with amputations receive prosthetic prescriptions. People with amputations may struggle to get prescriptions and insurance coverage for prosthetic devices, especially for options with more advanced technology. Rheinstein cites insurance coverage for prosthetic limbs \u2014 specifically the lack of coverage for activity-specific prosthetics \u2014 as one of the most difficult parts of his patients\u2019 rehabilitation journeys. \u201cDemonstrating to payers the value of the outcomes we provide and how outcomes-based prosthetic care reduces overall healthcare costs\u201d is one of the biggest challenges the industry faces today, he said. For example, the\u00a0BionX emPOWER prosthetic is the only motor-driven prosthetic on the market, according to Herr, and many people with limb loss aren\u2019t able to access it. Although AMI neuroprostheses aren\u2019t available to the public, the AMI surgery has been performed on about 60 people around the world, according to Herr. At the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, where Carty is a staff surgeon in the Division of Plastic Surgery, AMI is now the standard of care for amputations, Carty said. \u201cThe [hospital\u2019s] ethical board determined it\u2019s unethical to offer the standard amputation, because we now know the AMI amputation is so beneficial,\u201d Herr said. \u201cWe hope it\u2019ll be standard not only in Boston, but in clinical sites all over the world.\u201d The more surgeons, prosthetists, researchers and patients work together on new developments, the better, according to Rheinstein, who hopes the AMI technique will \u201cbring attention to the importance of thoughtfully planned amputation surgery to a patient\u2019s successful rehabilitation.\u201d \u201cHollywood for decades has given us visions of these remarkable bionic humans \u2026 but science reality has been slower than science fiction,\u201d Herr added. \u201cWe\u2019re finally producing systems that we\u2019ve seen in the movies.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/bionic-leg-ami-neuroprosthesis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_social-media-mental-health-limited-science-wellness", "text": "When US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy pushed last week for a tobacco-style warning on social media, he called the mental\u00a0health\u00a0crisis in young people an emergency that demanded action without waiting for \u201cperfect information.\u201d Even among experts, questions remain about the exact role that social media plays in the mental\u00a0health\u00a0of children and teens. Authors of a sweeping new review of research into social media and mental\u00a0health\u00a0say there\u2019s still key information missing to know whether prevention programs and interventions will work. In the study, published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, researchers reviewed nearly 150 studies on the relationship between social media and the mental health of adolescents. They found an overall link between anxiety and depression in adolescents and the time spent on social media platforms, as well as a link between the types of activities and content they were interacting with. However, the level of impact varied enough to suggest that the findings shouldn\u2019t be generalized to the population as a whole. The researchers found that very few studies assessed the relationship between social media use and adolescents who were experiencing mental health symptoms at clinical levels \u2014 where they\u2019re seeking health services or have an active diagnosis, for example \u2014 which further clouds the findings. There\u2019s a \u201creal risk that we are incorrectly generalizing results from the general population to young people with mental\u00a0health\u00a0conditions,\u201d wrote the study authors, from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and Stellenbosch University in South Africa. \u201cIn a world increasingly saturated by digital technology, we cannot afford to design prevention programs, interventions, and regulations without knowing that they work for everyone, especially those who are most vulnerable.\u201d Another analysis of existing research, published by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in December, also highlighted key questions that remain to be answered. \u201cThere is not enough evidence to say that social media causes changes in adolescent health at the population level,\u201d according to a news release from the independent organization about the report. And \u201cdespite many years of research, the evidence clarifying precisely how social media influences health is limited.\u201d While the science suggests there is a link between social media and mental health, there is often a lack of clarity on whether social media is influencing an individual\u2019s mental health or whether an individual\u2019s mental health is influencing their use of social media, said Dr. Sandro Galea, chair of an ad-hoc National Academies committee that authored the analysis of research and dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. Future research should focus on following trends over time \u2013 tracking the mental health of the same children before and after exposure to social media to see what effects it has \u2013 and digging in on more specific measures that capture how social media is used, he said. For Murthy, the urgency of the youth mental health crisis is dominant \u2014\u00a0and there\u2019s enough evidence to act now. In a New York Times op-ed, Murthy advocated for a warning label that would \u201cregularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe\u201d among other interventions. Murthy cited two key reports in support of a warning label: one study from 2019 that found that adolescents who spent more time on social media faced increased risk for anxiety and depression and one survey from 2022 in which nearly half of adolescents said that social media makes them feel worse about their bodies. \u201cOne of the most important lessons I learned in medical school was that in an emergency, you don\u2019t have the luxury to wait for perfect information. You assess the available facts, you use your best judgment, and you act quickly,\u201d Murthy wrote in his essay. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor.\u201d Public health often lacks \u2018perfect\u2019 data Many experts agree that the surgeon general is starting an important conversation and that the need for more information shouldn\u2019t lead to passiveness, but a social media warning label will require nuance in language and implementation. It will also require Congress to act to make it a reality. \u201cThe Surgeon General is identifying something that he sees as a challenge to the health of the public and thinking about ways to act to mitigate the challenge. Through that lens, I think he\u2019s doing exactly what a surgeon general should do,\u201d Galea said. \u201cPublic health action, not infrequently, has to happen absent complete or perfect data.\u201d The National Academies committee specifically recommended against a social media ban. Despite potential harms \u2013 such as unhealthy social comparisons and distracting from other important healthy behaviors such as sleep, exercise and studying \u2013 social media can also benefit young people by helping to foster connection with friends and family, and with online support communities. But there is an important distinction between benefits and safety, Murthy said Friday on The Daily, a podcast from the the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at the research question broadly. What we\u2019re trying to understand first and foremost is the answer to the question parents are asking us, which is, \u2018Is social media safe from my kids?\u2019 And if you ask researchers, \u2018What does data tell us about safety? Where is the data that tells us these platforms are safe?\u2019 That data is not there. So there\u2019s not evidence of safety. There is growing evidence of harm,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain benefits, but getting some benefits does not justify forcing kids to endure significant harm.\u201d Still, social media is not the same as cigarettes. Smoking has a much stronger and more direct link with negative health effects, and cessation is not the end goal with social media. Instead, a social media warning label should be more like those on bicycles and motor vehicles, said Pamela Wisniewski, an associate professor in human-computer interaction at Vanderbilt University, whose research has focused on the relationship between social media, privacy, and online safety for adolescents. \u201cThe key is to focus on solutions that empower youth and give them choices and opportunities to maximize the benefits of social media use, while minimizing risks, as opposed to taking restrictive and surveillance-based approaches that are heavily rooted in fear,\u201d she said. The goal should be to ensure proper use, not just focus on the risks and harm. There is an expectation that products children interact with are tested for safety, and a warning label on social media could deliver a clear message that there are \u201ca lot of safety gaps,\u201d said Dr. Jenny\u00a0Radesky, co-medical director of the American Academy of Pediatrics Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health. \u201cWe expect that infant formula is tested for bacteria, toys are tested for lead paint, and that there are rules about safety for everything from cribs to cars. These safety guardrails that prioritize children\u2019s well-being in digital products do not exist in the US,\u201d she said. Still, warning labels are brief and nuance can be lost in the \u201cnoise of the internet,\u201d Radesky said. \u201cFamily conversations to support healthy media use take a long time and need to happen over and over.\u201d For the surgeon general, a warning label is part of a holistic strategy to reduce the risks that social media poses to young people in the US. Systematic design changes by the platforms and legislation to support those changes remain the priority. \u201cTo be clear, a warning label would not, on its own, make social media safe for young people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese harms are not a failure of willpower and parenting; they are the consequence of unleashing powerful technology without adequate safety measures, transparency or accountability.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/social-media-mental-health-limited-science-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_study-infant-mortality-texas-invs", "text": "A new study has drawn\u00a0a possible\u00a0link between rising infant mortality in Texas and the state\u2019s abortion restrictions, which, when they took effect in 2021, were the strictest in the nation. The\u00a0study, published today in JAMA Pediatrics \u2013 a publication\u00a0of\u00a0the Journal of the American Medical Association \u2013 cited an\u00a0investigative report\u00a0by CNN last year that revealed a sudden spike in infant deaths in the wake of the law\u2019s passage. \u201cA report from the media found an increase in infant deaths in Texas between 2021 and 2022, suggesting that Texas\u2019 abortion policy could be responsible,\u201d according to the study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Michigan State University. \u201cHowever, to our knowledge, no studies have conducted a systematic evaluation of infant mortality after the passage of Texas\u2019 (law).\u201d The authors say their study is the first attempt to do so, and their conclusions echo the findings of CNN\u2019s story. In\u00a0September\u00a02021, Texas banned nearly all abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy. When the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother. The study looks at the effects of the\u00a02021\u00a0law, called Senate Bill 8, which made no exceptions for rape or incest, forcing women to carry a pregnancy to term even under traumatic circumstances. It also made no exceptions for congenital anomalies, also known as birth defects. The only exception that allowed for an abortion to be obtained after six weeks was \u201cif a physician believes that a medical emergency exists,\u201d according to the language of the bill. The new JAMA Pediatrics study found that, between 2021 and 2022, infant deaths in Texas surged 12.9%, compared with a much smaller increase\u00a0in the rest of the US\u00a0of 1.8%. It also found a significant jump in the rate of infant mortality in Texas \u2013 or the number of deaths per thousand live births \u2013 relative to\u00a0the rest of the country, suggesting that the increase in the number of infant deaths was not solely the byproduct of a rise in births. In that same time period, infant mortality rates rose 8.3% in Texas, compared with an increase of 2.2% in the rest of the nation. The neonatal mortality rate \u2013 or the death rates of babies younger than 28 days \u2013 also increased in Texas by 5.8% but decreased in the rest of the US, the study found. \u201cThis study provides some of the first empirical evidence on the association of restrictive abortion policies with infant deaths by using population-based data and a rigorous causal inference technique,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAlthough replication and further analyses are needed to understand the mechanisms behind these findings, our results indicate that restrictive abortion policies may have important unintended consequences in terms of trauma to families and medical cost.\u201d The study \u2013 whose lead author, Dr. Alison Gemmill, is a demographer and perinatal epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University \u2013\u00a0was published alongside a critique\u00a0of the Texas law by three unaffiliated medical experts in an editorial. \u201cIn the coming years, as more people continue to be harmed by abortion bans across the country, we anticipate that more research will illuminate what Texans already know to be true: abortion bans harm everyone,\u201d wrote Ghazaleh Moayedi and Aketch Osamba, both of the  Pegasus Health Justice Center in Dallas, and Atsuko Koyama, of the University of Arizona, in the editorial. \u201cFuture scholarship should focus on best practices and implementation strategies for collective action against and resistance to the increasing trend of extremist ideologies influencing the practice of medicine,\u201d the authors wrote. The study also found that\u00a0the number of\u00a0congenital anomalies increased in Texas\u00a0from 2021 to 2022\u00a0but not\u00a0in\u00a0the rest of the US. The authors based their study on publicly available death-certificate data and looked at infant and neonatal deaths across the country from January 2018 to December 2022.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/study-infant-mortality-texas-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_health_worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness", "text": "Eating higher levels of ultraprocessed food may shorten lifespans by more than 10%, according to a new, unpublished study of over 500,000 people whom researchers followed for nearly three decades. The risk went up to 15% for men and 14% for women once the data was adjusted, said study lead author Erikka Loftfield, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Asked about their consumption of 124 foods, people in the top 90th percentile of ultraprocessed food consumption said overly processed drinks topped their list. \u201cDiet soft drinks were the key contributor to ultraprocessed food consumption. The second one was sugary soft drinks,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cBeverages are a very important component of the diet and the contribution to ultraprocessed food.\u201d Refined grains such as ultraprocessed breads and baked goods ranked next in popularity, the study found. \u201cThis is one more large, long-duration cohort study confirming the association between UPF (ultraprocessed food) intake and all-cause mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Carlos Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health at Brazil\u2019s University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in an email. Monteiro coined the term ultraprocessed food and created the NOVA food classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made. Monteiro was not involved in the study, but several members of the NOVA classification system were coauthors. The NOVA classification system sorts foods from minimally processed \u2014 whole foods such as fruits and vegetables \u2014 to processed foods such as deli meat and sausage \u2014 to ultraprocessed. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food appetizing. Health risks linked to processed meats and soft drinks The preliminary study, presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago, analyzed dietary data gathered in 1995 from nearly 541,000 Americans ages 50 to 71 who were participating in the US National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. Researchers linked the dietary data to death rates over the next 20 to 30 years. Compared with those in the bottom 10% of ultraprocessed food consumption, people who ate the most overly processed food were more likely to die from heart disease or diabetes, according to the study. Unlike other studies, however, researchers found no rise in cancer-related death. Some ultraprocessed foods carried more of a risk than others, Loftfield said: \u201cHighly processed meat and soft drinks were a couple of the subgroups of ultraprocessed food most strongly associated with mortality risk.\u201d Diet drinks are considered ultraprocessed food because they contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium and stevia, and additional additives not found in whole foods. Diet beverages have been linked to a higher risk of dying early from cardiovascular disease as well as the onset of dementia,\u00a0type 2 diabetes,\u00a0obesity, stroke and\u00a0metabolic syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes. The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans already recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to premature death and the development of chronic disease. A March 2019 study found women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages\u00a0\u2014 defined as a standard glass, bottle or can \u2014 had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared with women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk. Processed meats such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, ham, corned beef, jerky and deli meats are also not recommended; studies have linked red and processed meats to bowel and stomach cancers, heart disease, diabetes and early death from any cause. \u201cThe evidence from this new study indicates that processed meat may be one of the most unhealthy foods, but people do not tend to view ham or chicken nuggets as UPF (ultraprocessed food),\u201d said Rosie Green,\u00a0a professor of environment, food and health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in a statement. She was not involved in the study. The study found that people who consumed the most ultraprocessed food were younger and heavier, and had an overall poorer quality of diet than those who ate fewer ultraprocessed foods. However, the increased health risk could not be explained by these differences, because even people with normal weight and better diets were also at some risk for early death from ultraprocessed foods, the study found. Results may underestimate risk One key limitation of the study was that the dietary data was gathered only once some 30 years ago, Green said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how dietary habits might have changed between then and now.\u201d Ultraprocessed food manufacturing has exploded since the mid-1990s, however, with estimates that as nearly 60% of the average American\u2019s daily calories come from ultraprocessed foods. That\u2019s not surprising, considering as much as 70% of the food in any grocery store may be ultraprocessed. \u201cIf anything, we are probably underestimating ultraprocessed food consumption in our study because we\u2019re being very conservative,\u201d Loftfield said. \u201cThe intake is likely to have only grown over the years.\u201d In fact, a study published in May that found similar results \u2014 a higher risk of premature death and death from cardiovascular disease in over 100,000 health professionals who ate ultraprocessed foods \u2014 accessed ultraprocessed food intake every four years and found consumption doubled between the mid-1980s and 2018. \u201cFor example, the daily intake of packaged savory snacks and dairy-based desserts, such as ice cream, has essentially doubled since the \u201890s,\u201d said the lead author of the May study, Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIn our study, just as in this new one, the positive association was mainly driven by a few subgroups, including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d Song said. \u201cHowever, all categories of ultraprocessed food were associated with increased risk.\u201d Choosing more minimally processed foods is a one way to limit ultraprocessed foods in one\u2019s diet, Loftfield said. \u201cWe should really be focusing on eating diets that are rich in whole foods,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if the food is ultraprocessed, then look to see the levels of sodium and added sugars and try to make the best decision possible using the nutrition facts label.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2023_08_18_health_dengue-what-to-know-wellness", "text": "Dengue virus is the most common mosquito-spread virus globally, but generally relatively rare in the continental United States. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week about a higher-than-expected number of dengue cases among US travelers \u2014 745 cases through June 24 \u2014 as well as a public health emergency in Puerto Rico, where the virus is endemic. Global infections in 2024 have been the highest on record, with cases in the Americas already reaching 9.7 million \u2014\u00a0exceeding the highest number ever recorded\u00a0in a single year. What is dengue, and where is it common? Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is spread mainly via the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also known to carry several other viruses such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the CDC. Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to WHO. It\u2019s also endemic in the US territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and American Samoa. More than 34,000 locally acquired cases were reported in the US between 2010 and 2023, according to CDC data. A handful of outbreaks of locally transmitted cases have been reported in states with warmer climates, including Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona. California reported its first locally-transmitted case in Pasadena\u00a0last year. But almost all US cases are reported in Puerto Rico, says Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey, chief of the Dengue Branch in the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told CNN previously. And that\u2019s not a surprise. \u201cIt has the perfect climate for it. It\u2019s a tropical island,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are indeed efforts from the health department and other organizations like the Puerto Rico vector control unit to control dengue in the area.\u201d This includes public education and integrated mosquito management such as \u201cremoving places where the mosquitoes lay eggs, and that is done through community engagement, but also clean-up campaigns,\u201d Paz-Bailey said. Similar efforts are also recommended in the rest of the US and its territories, she noted. Dengue symptoms Only about 1 in 4 people infected with dengue will have symptoms. The most common symptom is fever, and it can also cause nausea, vomiting, rash or aches and pains \u2013 typically behind the eyes or muscle, joint or bone pain. There are four strains of the virus, or serotypes, according to the World Health Organization. Once someone catches one of the strains, it can\u2019t infect them again. But the more times someone is infected with different strains, the more likely they are to become severely ill. Severe dengue\u00a0is less common, with about 1 in 20 people developing it. But the symptoms are more troubling. It can cause shock, internal bleeding and even death. About 100 million people get sick and 40,000 die of severe dengue around the world each year, according to the CDC. Testing for dengue If you get sick and live in an area where dengue might be spreading or have traveled to a place where the virus is common, the CDC recommends consulting your doctor. The only definite way to know if you have the virus is through blood testing, which varies from place to place, Paz-Bailey said. The general recommendation is to do a PCR test, she says, if your symptoms started within a week or less. \u201cIf the person presents beyond the seven-day window, a serological test to measure IgM antibodies is recommended,\u201d Paz-Bailey said. It can take a day to a week to get those results, she says. Dengue vaccine and treatment The US Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine for dengue in 2019 and the CDC recommends it to children ages 9 to 16 who have laboratory-confirmed evidence of a dengue infection and who live in areas of the United States where dengue is endemic or regularly occurring. The vaccine requires three doses, given six months apart. However, Sanofi-Pasteur said it will stop manufacturing the vaccine, Dengvaxia, due to a lack of demand in the global market. There is no dengue vaccine available for adults in the US. The CDC said there are two other dengue vaccines approved or in development, but they are not currently available in the United States. There\u2019s also no specific medicine to treat dengue, the CDC says. Over-the-counter meds like acetaminophen can ease fever or pain, but experts say not to take aspirin or ibuprofen because they can increase the risk of hemorrhaging sometimes seen with dengue. Protecting yourself from dengue Preventing mosquito bites\u00a0and\u00a0controlling mosquitoes\u00a0in and around the home are the key ways to prevent dengue. If you\u2019re going outside, the CDC recommends US Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellents to prevent bites from mosquitoes that may be carrying dengue. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants is another option, along with treating your clothing with 0.5% permethrin, an insecticide. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which spreads dengue and other viruses, does not like to travel far and prefers to breed in our backyards, said Dr. Isik Unlu, acting director and operations manager of the Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control Division. \u201cThey prefer to be around people. That is the problem,\u201d she said, adding that the species is often found in containers that collect rainwater, especially during the summer months. Almost everything you see in a backyard can become a breeding ground, Unlu says, including birdbaths, plant saucers, tires, extension gutters and kiddie pools. Unlu and Paz-Bailey recommend removing standing water around your home as often as possible to prevent mosquitoes from gathering and breeding. Mosquito surveillance in the US In Florida, Unlu and her team are often called out to homes where mosquito infestations are reported. If they find a large population of adult mosquitoes, the team heads out in the middle of the night to spray the area with insecticide. Her county has hundreds of mosquito traps set. \u201cWhen we collect the mosquitos from these traps, especially if it\u2019s an area that we suspect dengue is circulating or we have confirmed cases, our research team assists us to process these mosquitos,\u201d Unlu said. The mosquitos are evaluated for sex, counted, put in test tubes and sent to a lab outside Orlando to be tested for dengue and other viruses. Dengue is not considered endemic to Florida, according to the CDC. Unlu says this is largely due to disease surveillance operations. But the virus is present in the southern part of the state because of people traveling to places where it is endemic, such as Cuba or Brazil. \u201cWe get residents who go on vacation or visit their family where dengue is endemic and more common, and they get bitten there, and then they travel back here,\u201d Unlu said. \u201cAnd since we have the vector, Aedes aegypti, here, when they get bit, the mosquitos then get infected, and then they bite another human being who never traveled outside Miami, and they get sick.\u201d The CDC\u2019s Paz-Bailey says climate change will also encourage the spread of dengue around the world. \u201cHigher temperatures will probably expand the range of places where a mosquito can survive. And then it can also facilitate transmission through other ways, like faster viral replication in the mosquito and increased survival of mosquitoes,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_06_28_health_fda-bird-flu-flash-pasteurization", "text": "New test results released by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday found that bird flu virus is making its way from dairy farms and into milk processing plants but also confirmed that the commonly used flash pasteurization method fully neutralizes the virus. The FDA collected and tested 275 bulk samples of raw milk collected from farms in four states where herds had tested positive for H5N1, or bird flu. The samples were collected between April 18 and 27. Half of those samples were positive for traces of influenza. A quarter of those positive samples also proved to be infectious, meaning the virus grew when it was inoculated into fertilized chicken eggs, the gold-standard test for determining whether a virus is viable and could make someone sick. Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, noted that the milk the agency tested was bound for pasteurization and was not going directly to store shelves. But he says he is aware that some states allow the sale of raw milk for human or animal consumption. \u201cThat\u2019s why we put out the messaging that we have around raw milk, because it could be a potential route of exposure,\u201d Prater said. The FDA has long recommended against consuming raw milk because of potential contamination. It urged states this month to to\u00a0warn the public more strongly about the dangers of raw milk\u00a0and to\u00a0test\u00a0herds that produce it for sale. The\u00a0FDA\u00a0also recommended that states use their regulatory authorities to stop the sale of raw milk\u00a0within the state or\u00a0in areas where dairy herds have tested positive. Prater says the FDA tested the raw milk to get an idea of how much virus might be in milk that was making it to pasteurization plants. Based on the concentrations of virus in the samples they collected, FDA scientists next took uninfected raw milk from the University of Georgia dairy and laced it with live H5N1 virus. They ran it through a machine they built that replicated all steps of flash pasteurization, where milk is heated to 161 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 seconds. Their testing included a preheating step that was missing from earlier studies that had tested the same times and temperatures to kill live virus. In fact, the preheating step fully neutralized all the infectious virus, Prater said, proving that it was a critical element of the process. \u201cWe built an instrument so that we could sample milk as it goes through these different stages\u201d of the pasteurization process, Prater said, \u201cand what we found is that the virus was actually inactivated even before it got into the holding tube.\u201d Prater says the new study really helps explain earlier research that found that 1 in 5 dairy products pulled from store shelves contained inert fragments of the H5N1 virus. \u201cThis information really helps explain what\u2019s happening via commercial processing,\u201d Prater said, and confirms that pasteurized milk is safe to drink. The FDA has announced that it will do another round of sampling of dairy products purchased at grocery stores, including cheese made from raw milk, but has not released the results of that testing. The FDA released its latest study as a preprint, ahead of peer review, and said it had submitted the research to the Journal of Food Protection for publishing consideration.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/fda-bird-flu-flash-pasteurization/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness", "text": "Some seniors across the United States continue to take a daily aspirin in the hopes of reducing their cardiovascular disease risk, even though the practice is only recommended for certain high-risk patients \u2014 and taking it without a doctor\u2019s recommendation can come with significant risks. Cardiovascular diseases affect the heart and blood vessels and sometimes can lead to heart attacks or strokes. Most heart attacks and strokes occur when a blockage in the arteries, caused by plaque buildup, stops blood from traveling to the heart muscle or the brain \u2014 but here\u2019s where aspirin comes in. Aspirin helps thin the blood, which can prevent these blood clots from forming. That is why it had long been recommended to take a daily low-dose aspirin to reduce your risk. However, because aspirin thins the blood, it comes with the risk of excessive bleeding. In recent years, the medical and scientific communities have realized that the risk of aspirin may outweigh the benefits for many patients, especially older adults and adults already taking statins or other medications. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association updated their guidelines in 2019 to say that \u201caspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention\u201d of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because of lack of net benefit. Primary prevention refers to patients who have no history of cardiovascular disease, heart attack or stroke and are taking aspirin to prevent a first case. The US Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s final recommendations on aspirin use, issued in 2022, came after years of recommending aspirin to prevent heart attack and stroke. The USPSTF \u2014 a group of independent experts that makes recommendations to help guide doctors\u2019 decisions and their recommendations also influence insurance companies\u2019 reimbursement decisions \u2014 now recommends against adults 60 or older starting to take a low-dose aspirin for the prevention of a first cardiovascular disease event. It\u2019s recommended that adults ages 40 to 59 who have a 10% or greater risk of developing the disease in the next decade make individual decisions on whether to start taking a low-dose aspirin regularly. Yet several doctors say that despite the risks, some of their patients continue to follow the outdated guidance and take a daily low-dose aspirin when it\u2019s not recommended. The latest research on the prevalence of aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease suggests that in 2021, nearly a third of adults 60 or older without cardiovascular disease were still using aspirin. The study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, includes data on more than 180,000 people from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Health Interview Survey. An analysis of the data found that about 19% of surveyed adults 40 or older reported taking aspirin for the primary prevention of the disease. Among adults 60 or older, nearly 30% reported taking aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease, and around 5% of all adults 60 or older reported using aspirin without medical advice. \u201cI was somewhat surprised by the magnitude of ongoing aspirin use in older adults,\u201d Dr. Mohak Gupta, resident physician at Cleveland Clinic and lead author of the study, said in an email. The study suggests that millions of US adults who\u2019ve never had cardiovascular disease could still be taking a daily aspirin, despite recommendations against it. A separate survey conducted last year by researchers at the University of Michigan found that about 1 in 4 adults surveyed, ages 50 to 80, reported taking aspirin regularly, around three or more days in a typical week \u2013 and this was seen among more men than women. Among those regularly taking aspirin, 89% reported taking a low-dose aspirin, according to the survey, while 11% indicated they take regular strength aspirin, which makes their risk of excessive bleeding even higher. About half of older adults regularly taking aspirin reported starting more than five years ago; about 19% said they started four to five years ago, and 30% started within the past three years. The survey, called the National Poll on Healthy Aging, was administered online and via telephone in July and August 2023 and included more than 2,600 adults. \u2018This is the nature of science\u2019 Because aspirin historically has been seen as a preventive tool for cardiovascular disease, it has been difficult to change some of the societal views and behaviors among older adults. \u201cAspirin has been recommended for preventing a first heart attack or stroke since the late 1990s,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cAs a result, aspirin use for primary prevention\u00a0of cardiovascular disease has remained\u00a0highly prevalent, especially among older adults who are at higher risk of cardiovascular events.\u201d Early studies on aspirin use, dating back to the 1980s and 1990s, showed that there was benefit to taking aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, said cardiologist Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a past president\u00a0of the American Heart Association and chair of the department of preventive medicine at Northwestern University. \u201cBut think back at what else was happening at those times. We didn\u2019t really use statins in very many patients. We weren\u2019t doing a good job controlling blood pressure. And so aspirin, as the final safety net for preventing a heart attack or stroke, because it prevents blood clot formation, aspirin had room and it had space to work,\u201d Lloyd-Jones said. As aspirin was studied more closely, and as more patients at risk of cardiovascular disease started to take statins to help control their cholesterol levels, it became clear that the risks of aspirin use outweighed the benefits for certain patients, Lloyd-Jones said. He added, however, that there are still subgroups of people for which the benefits of aspirin continue to outweigh the risks, and the guidance for them should not be ignored either. \u201cThis is the nature of science. We make these broad recommendations for populations, but as we study individuals, we find that there are actually still situations where the benefit of aspirin \u2014 that is, the likelihood that we\u2019re going to prevent a heart attack or stroke \u2014 will outweigh the risk of aspirin, which is that we could cause major bleeding,\u201d said Lloyd-Jones, who was not involved in the new study on aspirin use among US adults. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re crystal clear and precise that people who\u2019ve had a heart attack or a stroke or who have a stent should be taking aspirin,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my own patients come back and say, \u2018Oh yeah, I saw the news. I stopped my aspirin,\u2019 and that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d The American Heart Association\u2019s current recommendation is that no one should take daily low-dose aspirin without talking to their doctor first, especially if they have an aspirin intolerance, are at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke, drink alcohol regularly, are undergoing any simple medical or dental procedures, or are older than 70. For people who have had a heart attack or stroke, their health care providers may want them to take aspirin to help prevent another event. Yet it remains unclear when someone already taking a daily low-dose aspirin for their cardiovascular health should stop \u2014 and that might be an individual decision between a patient and their doctor. \u201cWhile guidelines recommend against starting preventive aspirin in older adults, there is uncertainty about the optimal age to discontinue preventive aspirin in those already taking it, as these two scenarios have different risk-benefit considerations,\u201d Gupta said. \u2018Communication gap is the chief reason\u2019 The new study in Annals of Internal Medicine underscores \u201can important and concerning trend,\u201d that many older adults continue to take aspirin for their cardiovascular health despite the updated recommendations, Dr. Dave Montgomery, a cardiologist at Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta, who was not involved in the new research, said in an email to CNN. \u201cIt brings to light a gap in effective dissemination of these guidelines to the general public. The other\u00a0alarming aspect is that many individuals are taking aspirin without the guidance of a healthcare provider,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cThe communication gap is the chief reason for this. The guidelines are clear and based on good science. We just haven\u2019t communicated this new guidance effectively or broadly enough,\u201d he added. \u201cThe decision to use aspirin must be an individual one, based on the person\u2019s unique risk profile. No two cases are exactly the same, and I strongly advise that no one should make a change in their prevention strategy without the counsel of a medical professional.\u201d Dr. Howard Weintraub, a preventive cardiologist at NYU Langone Health in New York, said that he has seen among his own patients that some older adults continue to regularly take aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease despite the shift in guidance. For those patients, Weintraub said that he can conduct tests to analyze their blood pressure, cholesterol levels and weigh a personalized risk-benefit profile for them in order to recommend whether they stop taking aspirin or continue to do so. For some patients, the risk of excessive bleeding that comes with taking aspirin regularly outweighs the benefits. \u201cThe drug that they may feel to be very benign, may have some baggage or potential adverse events,\u201d Weintraub said. But for others, aspirin may still be the right choice. Regardless, any patient taking aspirin regularly should discuss that behavior with their physician, Weintraub said. \u201cThey should disclose that they\u2019re using it. They should have a conversation with their primary or cardiologist, whoever is in their mind trustworthy, and come to an understanding as to how they should go forward,\u201d Weintraub said. \u201cAdopting a more personalized, individualized course of therapy may have a great benefit.\u201d And to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, Weintraub recommended that people stop smoking if they smoke, lose weight, eat healthy foods, control their cholesterol levels and try to prevent high blood pressure.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn", "text": "Do you yearn for long days and short nights? Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers. The summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It\u2019s the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It\u2019s also the first official day of summer. Our ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion.\u00a0Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge). Pagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe. The mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility \u2013 both the plant and human variety \u2013 in destinations worldwide. The science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia. Summer solstice science Is it summer solstice all over the world? No. It\u2019s only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world\u2019s population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there. When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on\u00a0June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that\u2019s 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool. Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador\u2019s capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight. But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn\u2019t get that dark.\u00a0 The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They\u2019ll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order. Why don\u2019t we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night\u00a0back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That\u2019s because the Earth is aligned on an\u00a0axis, an imaginary pole\u00a0going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts \u2013 at\u00a0an angle of 23.5 degrees. \u201cAs Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun\u2019s direct rays,\u201d explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that\u2019s the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox. Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it\u2019s not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US. \u201cOn average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\u201d says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward. \u201cTemperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night \u2013 so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\u201d says Ward. \u201cThe only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\u201d\u00a0because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August. The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe. How to celebrate summer solstice What does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically. The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at\u00a0summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times. The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise. What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day. In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night \u2013 a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires. In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations\u2019 International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_exercise-summer-heat-wellness", "text": "For people in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s summer and you might be inspired to get outdoors to move more.\u00a0But the weather is getting too warm in some places for people to exercise safely outside. We know that adults should aim for at least\u00a0150 minutes \u00a0of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly. This can include exercises such as brisk walking, biking, playing basketball, swimming and more vigorous household tasks like mowing the lawn and vacuuming, also called functional fitness.\u00a0But is that all safe to do at high temperatures? How hot is too hot for exercising outdoors? Is it safe to exercise outside at some times of the day? Should younger or older people take more precautions in the heat? What about people who have heart and kidney conditions or take certain medications? To help us stay fit and safe in the summer heat, I spoke with CNN wellness analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What precautions should people take before exercising during the summer? Wen:\u00a0Summer can be a fantastic time to get outside and become more active, but as temperatures rise to unsafe levels,\u00a0people should be aware of the risk of\u00a0heat-related illnesses. I\u2019d advise that people look at the weather forecast before exercising. If a\u00a0heat wave\u00a0is expected, avoid exercising in the hottest part of the day and instead go out in the morning or evening. If it\u2019s going to be very hot all day and into the night, don\u2019t do your workout outside. CNN: What can happen if people work or exercise too much outside in the heat? Wen:\u00a0Someone working or exercising outside for prolonged periods of time may experience symptoms of heat exhaustion, including headache, weakness, dizziness\u00a0and nausea. When this happens, get out of the sun and into a cool, air-conditioned space. If symptoms worsen and the person develops confusion and vomiting, for instance, they may have\u00a0heat stroke, which is an emergency and requires immediate medical attention. CNN: Which people are most at risk during a heat wave?\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0\u00a0People who are the most vulnerable include those who are very young and elderly, and those who have chronic medical conditions. Several underlying conditions, such as heart, lung and kidney problems, can be exacerbated by heat. CNN: Do any medications make people more vulnerable during a heat wave? Wen:\u00a0Several medications can increase risk during times of extreme heat. Common blood pressure medications, like calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics, can have effects such as increasing the likelihood of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances during extreme heat. There are medications used for some mental health conditions that can affect the body\u2019s normal response to regulate temperature. That includes some antidepressants and stimulants used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Over-the-counter medicines can also have these effects. Diphenhydramine, for instance, and doxylamine are common antihistamines that can make people sweat less and affect temperature regulation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/exercise-summer-heat-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_opinions_bird-flu-eggs-food-health-safety-farms-ruhlman", "text": "I\u2019m writing from an organic farm and ecotourism site in Tuscany called\u00a0Spannocchia. I\u2019ve just made myself a couple of\u00a0mollet eggs\u00a0\u2014 whites cooked, yolks runny. Delicious \u2014 but also perhaps slightly worrying, given the emerging reports of\u00a0bird flu on poultry and dairy farms. Should I be concerned? And should you be as well, as you prepare your favorite meals at home? There have been numerous reported cases of wild birds and marine animals said to be carrying this virus and its variants, as well as the documented\u00a0spread to mammals\u00a0beyond cows, such as\u00a0cats, dogs\u00a0and mice. Should any of that determine the temperature at which I cook my eggs? And just as importantly, what should I tell home cooks who seek my advice on the matter? This avian flu virus is clearly something to take seriously as it spreads rapidly through dairy farms across the United States affecting\u00a0more than 90 herds in 12 states since March. It\u2019s clear that drinking\u00a0raw or unpasteurized milk is now high-risk. \u201cOur national dairy industry is clearly fighting a major epidemic of H5N1 avian flu,\u201d Donald G. McNeil Jr., a journalist who has covered epidemics for decades,\u00a0wrote. Even though I know it may contain harmful bacteria, I\u2019ve had raw milk. It\u2019s delicious \u2014 and at the time I drank it, it seemed worth the risk. But viruses are not bacteria. They are a different kind of microorganism, capable of mutating. Since we know that this virus is spreading through our dairy farms, it\u2019s clearly foolhardy to drink raw milk. Not just so that you don\u2019t get sick yourself but just as importantly, so that you don\u2019t become a spreader. Fortunately, with avian flu so far, there\u2019s no evidence yet of human-to-human transmission. But again, viruses mutate. There\u2019s no guarantee that transmissions between humans won\u2019t occur in the future. We have substantial evidence that heat inactivates the virus.\u00a0The USDA reports\u00a0that ground beef inoculated with the virus was virus-free when cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and higher. For a burger or steak, that would be medium to well-done, with no pink at the center. Live virus is likewise\u00a0not present in pasteurized milk. So where does all of this leave us in terms of how you should proceed in your kitchen? Most food authorities couch their your-food-is-safe-to-eat opinions with the caveat \u201cas long as it\u2019s properly cooked.\u201d But even with cooked food, there is some risk of becoming ill if an entire dish is not heated to pasteurization temperatures (between 145 degrees and 160 degrees Fahrenheit). Until we learn otherwise, I would say the best guidance for now is that it\u2019s probably safe to continue to prepare your meals as you always have \u2014 runny eggs and all. Most professional chefs I\u2019ve spoken to are comfortable with that guidance. They haven\u2019t changed kitchen protocol in terms of cooking times and temperatures as a result of bird flu. We need to monitor how and where the virus is spreading. For now,\u00a0the CDC risk assessment to humans from bird flu is low. But home cooks should keep an ear to the ground from health authorities for changes in that guidance. Is there a danger that our avian flu could cause chefs and food writers like me to rethink that guidance? Yes, I\u2019m afraid so. The virus has been found in the muscle of infected cattle, it\u2019s alive in raw milk, and it is small enough to pass through the pores of eggshells. As I was writing this piece, I reached out a few chefs and others including McNeil, who is a leading authority on viruses and how they spread to get their views on the potential danger to our food chain posed by bird flu. McNeil told me that he felt US food authorities could have done more \u2014 and done it much sooner \u2014 to sound the alarm to the public about the emergence and spread of bird flu. There are\u00a0plenty of experts\u00a0in the scientific community who agree with him. The government needs to do more to make industrial farms comply with inspections that some have been resistant to. Moreover, he wrote to me by email that \u201cit\u2019s clear that many dairy farmers are resisting letting inspectors onto their property to test either their cows or their workers. I think that\u2019s outrageous. Hidden transmission creates the perfect setting for an epidemic.\u201d Months into this bird flu outbreak, guidance from the government is less clear than we\u2019d like about what we should and shouldn\u2019t consume and how we should prepare the foods we love, and for a lot of people \u2014 including food professionals like me \u2014that\u2019s frustrating. As the H5N1 virus spreads, there might come a moment when food authorities decide we should be taking greater precautions than we did before its emergence. That could mean cooking all burgers medium to well, all eggs till they\u2019re hard and taking steak tartare topped with a raw egg yolk totally off the menu. With no evidence that the virus is in anything we eat raw other than milk, I\u2019ll continue to prepare my eggs so that the yolk is runny, and I\u2019ll keep ordering the beef tartare for dinner at my neighborhood bistro. It\u2019s funny, though. The Italian farm where I\u2019m staying employs numerous international interns. On the morning I began writing this essay, the first words I heard came from one of those interns, outside my window. She called out to her colleague, \u201cOne of the chickens is dead.\u201d Chickens on farms die for all kinds of reasons, but the timing seemed an ominous reminder that we need to be alert and to pay attention. Until we hear something definitive however, I\u2019m trying not to be afraid of my food, and advise you to do the same.\u00a0Bon appetit!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/opinions/bird-flu-eggs-food-health-safety-farms-ruhlman/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_health_child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness", "text": "Chicago native Jeffrey Odwazny\u00a0says he has been addicted to ultraprocessed food since he was a child. \u201cI was driven to eat and eat and eat, and while I would overeat healthy food, what really got me were the candies, the cakes, the pies, the ice cream,\u201d said the 54-year-old former warehouse supervisor. \u201cI really gravitated towards the sugary ultraprocessed foods \u2014 it was like a physical drive, I had to have it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents would find hefty bags full of candy wrappers hidden in my closet. I would steal things from stores as a kid and later as an adult.\u201d Some 12% of the nearly 73 million children and adolescents in the United States today struggle with a similar food addiction, according to research. To be diagnosed, children must meet Yale Food Addiction Scale criteria as stringent as any for alcohol use disorder or other addictions. \u201cKids are losing control and eating to the point where they feel physically ill,\u201d said Ashley Gearhardt, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who conducted the research and developed the Yale addiction scale. \u201cThey have intense cravings and may be sneaking, stealing or hiding ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cThey may stop going out with friends or doing other activities they used to enjoy in order to stay at home and eat, or they feel too sluggish from overeating to participate in other activities.\u201d Her research also shows about 14% of adults are clinically addicted to food, predominantly ultraprocessed foods with higher levels of sugar, salt, fat and additives. For comparison, 10.5% of Americans age 12 or older were diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in 2022, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. While many people addicted to food will say that their symptoms began to worsen significantly in adolescence, some recall a childhood focused on ultraprocessed food. \u201cBy age 2 or 3, children are likely eating more ultraprocessed foods in any given day than a fruit or vegetable, especially if they\u2019re poor and don\u2019t have enough money in their family to have enough quality food to eat,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are cheap and literally everywhere, so this is also a social justice issue.\u201d An addiction to ultraprocessed foods can highjack a young brain\u2019s reward circuitry, putting the primitive \u201creptilian brain,\u201d or amygdala, in charge \u2014 thus bypassing the prefrontal cortex where rational decision-making occurs, said Los Angeles registered dietitian nutritionist\u00a0David Wiss, who specializes in treating food addiction. \u201cUltraprocessed food addiction also teaches the young brain what to expect from food, like how much sugar reward one should get from eating a snack,\u201d said Wiss, which makes healthier options less appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s almost virtually impossible for a child, or even a 14- or 15-year-old, to be able to override all of this biology for very long,\u201d he added. The Institute of Food Technologists, an association of food professionals and technologists, does not agree with the research on ultraprocessed food addiction. \u201cWhile there is growing concern that some foods may be addictive for certain sub-populations including children, there is currently no scientific consensus to support that concern,\u201d said IFT\u2019s chief science and technology officer, Bryan Hitchcock, in an email. Food addiction is also not recognized by the World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Diseases and is a subject of debate in the scientific community, according to the International Food and Beverage Alliance, an industry association. \u201cSome believe markers of food addiction indicate eating disorders rather than substance use disorders,\u201d said IFBA\u2019s secretary-general, Rocco Renaldi, in an email. \u2018This disorder has almost killed me\u2019 Traumatic experiences in early childhood helped to trigger and nurture his addiction to ultraprocessed foods, Odwazny said. \u201cOne of my earliest memories is being in a high chair with ashtrays going over my head and plates smashing into the walls,\u201d Odwazny said. \u201cInstead of saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 or showing love, my family would feed me.\u201d At first, he said his parents thought his overeating was funny and began calling him names such as \u201cthe creeper\u201d when he would escape from his crib in the night to raid the refrigerator. As he grew, however, Odwazny\u2019s parents began to put locks on the refrigerator and kitchen cabinets. He was often ashamed of his eating. \u201cThere was a lot of name-calling. I was nicknamed everything from butterball to fat ass and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know the dads of some kids would call, \u2018Hey, buddy or pal,\u2019 but my dad used to call me \u2018the Orca.\u2019\u201d Despite his preoccupation with food, Odwazny was careful not to overeat in front of strangers as he grew up. Instead, when faced at a party with trigger foods such as chocolate-covered peanut butter cups, he would leave to buy that specific food. \u201cI would go to one store until I bought it all out, and then I would have to travel to another store,\u201d he said. \u201cI would buy two or three family-size bags, and I would eat so much in one sitting that I would be in a fog. Sugary food is a drug for me.\u201d The disorder took over his life. Before one meal of highly processed food was over, he was thinking about where to find the next. By 2016, his food addiction was at its worst. \u201cI would steal food or eat things that were burnt or spoiled,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve often gotten sick and had to go to the hospital. In fact, this disorder has almost killed me several times.\u201d The food-addicted brain Eating\u00a0higher amounts\u00a0of\u00a0ultraprocessed food raises the risk of obesity and the development of chronic conditions including\u00a0cancer,\u00a0cardiovascular disease,\u00a0obesity,\u00a0type 2 diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0depression. Still, many people find it hard to stop eating overly processed convenience foods such as hot dogs, French fries, crackers, frozen pizza, sausages, sodas, doughnuts, candy and ice cream. Ultraprocessed foods often contain flavors, different textures and \u201cadditives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Such foods are designed to maximize levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain, experts say. Added fats increase calories and improve the \u201cmouthfeel\u201d that makes food pleasing. Texture plays a role as well. \u201cFoods that melt in the mouth and are smooth or creamy, or alternatively, foods with crunch, can create an immediate neurochemical reward,\u201d Wiss said. \u201cA lot of food science goes into this and lot of research and development by manufacturers.\u201d Copious amounts of salt improve flavor. Sugar is so powerful that it\u2019s used as a replacement for pain medication for minor surgeries in babies: \u201cFor circumcisions or shots, they\u2019ll give babies a dose of sugar because it releases opioids in the brain and dulls pain,\u201d Gearhardt said. In fact, animal studies suggest sugar levels in ultraprocessed foods may be as addictive to the brain as alcohol or tobacco, she said. \u201cThese are really invasive studies, with wires in the brain,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cSugar creates the same amount of dopamine release that mimics what you see with nicotine and ethanol \u2014 around 150% to 200% above baseline. \u201cCocaine is much more addictive, between 1,000% and 2,000% above baseline,\u201d she said. \u201cBut animals still often choose a sweet taste over cocaine.\u201d The makers of ultraprocessed food strive to meet this dopamine \u201cbliss point\u201d via secret, proprietary mixtures of sugar, fat, salt and flavor additives that experts say trigger the basest of our animal instincts \u2014 the need for survival. \u201cIf there is a really high value meal in front of you, something rich and fatty that has a lot of calories in it, the brain is set up to say, \u2018Go ahead and eat it,\u2019 even if you are full because our ancestors had no guarantee they would find food the next day,\u201d said appetite specialist Alexandra DiFeliceantonio, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. The brain is also wired to remember and crave the pleasurable flavor of a food and its lifesaving calories in a process similar to Pavlovian, or classical conditioning, said DiFeliceantonio, who is also associate director of the Center for Health Behaviors Research at Virginia Tech. \u201cIt\u2019s what we all learned in Psychology 101, right?\u00a0 Light comes on; food drops; dog salivates,\u201d she said. Food processing plays a role How ultraprocessed foods are made may also contribute to addiction, experts say. Due to manufacturing methods that break down cell structures within foods \u2014 in essence predigesting the food \u2014 many ultraprocessed foods pass rapidly through the human gastrointestinal tract. That\u2019s confusing to a digestive system designed to slowly break down whole foods that have been torn and chewed, and to a brain that\u2019s used to getting a slow trickle of reward. With ultraprocessed foods, the brain receives surges of delight almost as quickly as the food is eaten, DiFeliceantonio said. \u201cThe majority of usable calories, boosted by intense flavors from whatever additives are in there, are quickly dumped into the upper intestine, sending signals to the brain all at once,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening really rapidly, and it\u2019s happening really strongly.\u201d The result, experts say, is a brain that fails to recognize ultraprocessed calories as filling. That, along with the rush of dopamine, may be a reason the brain has trouble saying, \u201cHalt!\u201d to ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThese foods appear to leave our brain in a state of perpetual vulnerability to rewarding substances and never feeling nourished or satiated,\u201d Gearhardt said. Nutrition is another issue. Ultraprocessed foods are often missing critical nutrients the body needs, which are especially important during childhood when the brain and body are growing. \u201cWhat is left after all the high heat and manipulation needed to create the ultraprocessed foods are the macronutrients \u2014 the calories, the carbohydrates, the fats and sometimes a little protein,\u201d Wiss said. \u201cMicronutrients are typically destroyed, which include the vitamins, minerals and antioxidant compounds that are known to confer health benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren who eat a lot of ultraprocessed foods could well be malnourished.\u201d According to the International Food and Beverage Alliance, however, there is no clear, objective, reliable or scientifically validated definition for \u201cultraprocessed\u201d food. \u201cIt is a catch-all, non-scientific concept that doesn\u2019t adequately account for nutritional differences in products:\u00a0the scientific evidence to date, and agreed upon by many authorities internationally, is that it is ultimately\u00a0the nutritional composition of foods, and of an individual\u2019s diet, that matters,\u201d said the IFBA\u2019s Renaldi. \u2018Our disease wants us to be separate\u2019 Overcoming his addiction to food \u2014 and later alcohol \u2014 has been a difficult journey for Odwazny. In an attempt to control his eating, he underwent two bariatric surgeries that typically have a high success rate. \u201cEach time I would pray, \u2018Please be it, please make this the answer.\u2019 But I would ultimately start binging on ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Odwazny said. \u201cThose surgeries were operating on the wrong part of my body, my stomach, but my eating disorder is right here,\u201d he said, tapping his head. Miserable and so overweight he could no longer do his job, Odwazny went on short-term disability and checked into rehab for a binge-eating disorder. That treatment plan didn\u2019t work, so he tried another, then another. Finally, he found a program that combined traditional treatment for binge-eating disorder with one for food addiction. Listening to other patients and staff speak about their own issues with food was life-changing, Odwazny said. \u201cOur disease wants us to be separate,\u201d he said. \u201cOur disease wants us to be not part of something else, because we want to isolate and think that we\u2019re the only ones. But when I heard the staff and some of the doctors talk about their own addictions, I knew the people that were treating me finally understood.\u201d A program that incorporates interventions for food addiction with treatment for restrictive eating disorders is relatively new and somewhat controversial, said food addiction specialist Dr. Kimberly Dennis, who is cofounder, CEO and chief medical officer at SunCloud Health in Chicago, where Odwazny\u00a0is in treatment. \u201cTreatment for a restrictive eating disorder, like binge eating or bulimia, focuses on helping the person overcome any aversion to food,\u201d said Dennis, who is also a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Medicine. \u201cAs soon as a person says, \u2018I can\u2019t safely eat that candy,\u201d the eating disorder therapist says, \u2018That\u2019s just the eating disorder talking, all foods are fine, and nothing is off-limits.\u2019\u201d Such treatment is a gold standard for someone who is avoiding food and malnourished, said Dennis, who is in recovery for food addiction and binge-eating disorder. \u201cSo a doughnut for breakfast, cupcake with lunch, and cookies as an afternoon snack would be a really good challenge for that person.\u201d However, if that person also has a food addiction, the approach may cause them to quit treatment, she said. \u201cTheir experience with eating that cupcake would be more like, \u2018I feel really triggered and worried that if I did this at home, I would be through the whole box of cupcakes by now.\u2019\u201d Today, Odwazny\u00a0is in recovery and is studying to become a certified alcohol and drug counselor in the Chicago area. He credits much of his success to his wife, Kimmy, whom he met during the Covid-19 pandemic while attending support groups at SunCloud. \u201cMy wife is also in the program, so we both know our food plans. My wife and I have our meals together \u2014 there\u2019s no sneaking, there\u2019s no hiding. I don\u2019t binge, but there are also certain foods that I don\u2019t eat,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I was in recovery, I never could imagine I would have such a beautiful wife that loves me, because no one loved me. Today I\u2019m free.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "health"}}
