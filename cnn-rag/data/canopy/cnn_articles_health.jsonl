{"id": "2024_07_15_health_malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli", "text": "Children in Ivory Coast received the first doses of a new, relatively cheap malaria vaccine on Monday, a step that has been hailed as a major milestone in the battle against one of the world\u2019s most deadly diseases. The R21 vaccine, developed by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India (SII), has been sent to several African countries and will also be administered in South Sudan Tuesday, the University of Oxford said in a statement sent to CNN. The vaccine costs less than $4 a dose, making it \u201crealistic to roll out in many tens of millions of doses from now on,\u201d and it has high efficacy levels of around 75%-80% in young children, Professor Adrian Hill, director\u00a0of the\u00a0Jenner Institute\u00a0at\u00a0Oxford University, who led the development of the vaccine, said in an interview with BBC Radio on Monday. Up to 500,000 child deaths could be saved every year with the widespread implementation of R21, alongside its counterpart RTS,S vaccine, according to modeling by the World Health Organization (WHO). Spread by some types of mosquitoes, malaria is preventable and curable but still killed around 608,000 people around the world in 2022, according to WHO. About 95% of those deaths occurred in Africa, where children under the age of 5 account for around 80% of all malaria deaths across the continent. The SIII has already manufactured more than 25 million doses and has committed to producing up to 100 million doses a year, a scale that allows the vaccine to remain affordable, according to the statement from the University of Oxford. There are enough doses that 250,000 children under the age of 2 will initially be vaccinated in Ivory Coast, while Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic have all authorized the vaccine, too, the university said.   R21 will be used alongside the RTS,S vaccine, which has already been delivered to more than 2 million children over a four-year pilot program in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, where it reduced all-cause mortality by 13%, according to UNICEF. Both these vaccines have been approved by the WHO and are expected to have a hugely positive impact on public health, alongside other prevention strategies like mosquito nets. Hill added that there is still \u201ca lot of work for people in-country to get set up, particularly when you\u2019re aiming to distribute millions of doses from this year.\u201d \u201cThis is a three-dose vaccine, typically (given at) five, six, seven months of age and then a booster a year later. That\u2019s not a time point that other vaccines are usually given at, so there\u2019s training required in these largely relatively low income countries.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_ecigarettes-nicotine-exposure-children-wellness", "text": "Children who live in homes where adults use e-cigarettes are exposed to significantly less nicotine through secondhand aerosols than children in homes where adults use traditional cigarettes, a new study shows. But vaping still exposes kids to nicotine and may present other risks, too. To keep children completely nicotine-free, according to the researchers, people shouldn\u2019t smoke or vape around kids at all. The researchers said they did the study in part because of the perception that e-cigarettes were safer than traditional cigarettes and because people are using them more than regular cigarettes inside the home. The study published Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Vaping has been promoted to adults as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes and as a potential smoking cessation device, although experts say more research is needed. One reason some doctors prefer that their patients use e-cigarettes is because they expose users to fewer toxic chemicals such as tobacco and the dozens of other carcinogens found in cigarettes, like N-nitrosamines and aldehydes, that can cause cancer and other serious health problems. But what the new study shows, experts say, is that harm reduction for the user is not necessarily the same as harm removal for everyone around them \u2014 and this could be a significant issue for children, whose lungs are still developing. The study looked at the lives of 1,777 children who were were part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a racially diverse government study designed to continuously assess US child and adult health and nutrition. Tobacco use in the home was reported by parents or guardians. More than 270 of the kids were exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke at home, 45 were exposed to secondhand e-cigarette vapor only, and 1,476 had neither kind of user in their home. Scientists included children between the ages of 3 and 11 because they were less likely than older kids to use nicotine products. The researchers determined children\u2019s nicotine levels using blood samples taken between 2017 and 2020. Although new vaping devices have been introduced to the US since that time and exposure levels may be different depending on device, the authors say their study can provide a good general understanding of nicotine exposure in the home. Exposure levels in the study are generally considered an undercount, they said. The children in the study who had the most nicotine exposure by far were those who lived with people who smoked traditional tobacco products like cigarettes. With these products, kids have two chances to be exposed to nicotine: when the user exhales and in between puffs, when a lit cigarette or cigar sits in an ashtray. E-cigarette users are believed to absorb 99% of the nicotine they inhale, but some of it gets released when they exhale after taking a drag on their device. The children in the study with the lowest nicotine levels were those who had no exposure to secondhand aerosols of any kind at home. Kids who were exposed to e-cigarettes had some nicotine in their bodies, but they had absorbed 84% less than those who lived in homes with people who smoked only tobacco. The takeaway from the research, the authors said, is that people need to stop any kind of vaping or smoking\u00a0at home. \u201cVaping inside the home around children should be avoided given that, even though nicotine itself has a limited risk profile, the increased absorption of nicotine from secondhand vapor suggests that the children were also exposed to other potentially harmful excipients from e-cigarettes,\u201d the study says. Earlier studies have found similar nicotine exposure among children in homes with cigarette and e-cigarette users. Dr. Terry Gordon, a professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU\u2019s Langone Health who has done nicotine exposure research, said he was surprised that nicotine levels weren\u2019t higher in households with e-cigarette users. Some of his research has shown much higher nicotine levels in e-cigarette households than in the new study. Either way, he said, all of these studies should be a good reminder to vape users that they need to be careful around others, especially kids. \u201cMost of us toxicologists, we believe e-cigs are safer, but no one is ready to say they are safe because of the primary users of the devices as well as those who are exposed to secondary aerosols,\u201d said Gordon, who was not involved in the latest study. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how harmful secondhand vape aerosols can be. It took years to understand this with cigarettes, said Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonologist and volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association. Secondhand smoke from cigarettes has done real damage, said Galiatsatos, who was not involved in the new study. He said he has treated an entire generation of people who have developed cancer and other lung problems not because they smoked but because they grew up around adults who did. In 2020, Galiatsatos published what is believed to be the first study to document significant injury in an adult with secondhand e-cigarette exposure. He says adults shouldn\u2019t take a chance with a child\u2019s health by vaping around them. \u201cA child who is growing, their lungs are so vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t completely know the effect it\u2019s going to have on the next generation, just like we didn\u2019t know what secondhand smoke did, but why even put your child in a position of becoming a future patient?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/ecigarettes-nicotine-exposure-children-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_health_womens-health-state-rankings-commonwealth-fund", "text": "Women in the United States face a growing number of threats to their health and well-being, a new report says, and there are vast disparities from state to state. In their inaugural state-by-state analysis on women\u2019s health, researchers at the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on health issues, collected data on health care quality, outcomes and access for women in the US. The data came from several sources, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the researchers evaluated states on 32 specific metrics, scoring them relative to each other. The report, released Thursday, reveals that states in the Northeast scored highest. Massachusetts came out on top as \u201cthe best-performing health system for women overall,\u201d with Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire rounding out the top five. The poorest performers were spread across the southern half of the country. Mississippi had the lowest score overall, followed by Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma and Arkansas. \u201cThis is the very first time we at the Fund have created a scorecard exclusively focused on states\u2019 performance in reproductive care and women\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund. \u201cWhile some states undoubtedly are championing women\u2019s continued access to vital health and reproductive services, many others are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the health care they need. This failure is having a disproportionate impact on women of color and women with low incomes,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is that policymakers can use these findings to identify and address gaps in care, guaranteeing that all women across the United States can live healthy lives with access to quality, affordable care \u2013 no matter where they live or what their background is.\u201d \u2018Health of women \u2026 is in a perilous place\u2019 The new report reveals that life expectancy for US women is the lowest it\u2019s been in nearly two decades \u2013 since 2006. \u201cThe health of women in the United States is in a perilous place,\u201d the authors wrote, highlighting nationwide increases in deaths from preventable causes, as well as significant state-by-state differences in how many women are dying in reproductive age. In 2022, the mortality rate ranged from about 204 deaths for every 100,000 women of reproductive age in West Virginia to around 71 deaths per 100,000 in Hawaii, the report says. \u201cWe looked at deaths from all causes among women and girls ages 15 to 44, a common way to identify women of reproductive age, and we found a threefold difference across states, with the highest rates of death concentrated in the Southeastern states,\u201d said David Radley, a senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Tracking Health System Performance initiative. Causes of death included those related to pregnancy \u2013 with mental health conditions as the most frequently reported cause of preventable pregnancy-related deaths \u2013 as well as other preventable causes such as substance use, Covid-19 and treatable chronic health conditions. The report also noted that the maternal death rate nearly doubled between 2018 and 2022, with rates for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native women increasing the most. Deaths from breast and cervical cancer also are considered in the new report as preventable and treatable with timely screening and health care. Breast and cervical cancer deaths were found to be highest in Southern states. \u201cWe also saw big differences across states in women\u2019s ability to access care,\u201d Radley said. \u201cThe state of health care for women in this country is in a vulnerable place.\u201d A fractured landscape of health policies \u2013 including Medicaid coverage and access to abortion and reproductive care \u2013 contributes to significant state-level inequalities for women across the country, according to the new report. \u201cWe found big differences across states in a woman\u2019s ability to access reproductive health care services, the quality of care she\u2019s likely to receive and the outcomes she\u2019s likely to experience,\u201d Radley said. \u201cWe looked at insurance coverage and found that uninsured rates among women ranged from 2.5% to over 20% uninsured, with the highest uninsured rates in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs.\u201d Expanding Medicaid coverage to cover more people with household incomes below a certain level is linked with lower rates of maternal mortality, smaller racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and infant health outcomes, and broader use of reproductive health care services, according to the report. The three states with the lowest maternal mortality rates \u2013 Vermont, California and Connecticut \u2013 have all expanded Medicaid. Ten states have not expanded Medicaid \u2013 Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming \u2013 leaving about 800,000 women uninsured. Each of those states, except for Wisconsin, ranked below the average on women\u2019s health. Women in states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility were among those most at risk of lacking insurance coverage, the researchers found. Among women ages 15 to 44, those in Texas, Georgia and Oklahoma had the highest rates of being uninsured. Those in Massachusetts, the District of Columbia and Vermont had the lowest uninsured rates. \u201cBut access isn\u2019t just about having coverage, it\u2019s also about being able to get to a service provider when care is needed. It\u2019s estimated that over 5 million women already live in a county that\u2019s considered a maternity care desert, meaning there\u2019s no hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and there are no obstetric providers,\u201d Radley said. \u201cWe looked at the adequacy of the maternity care workforce in each state and found that states with the most restrictive abortion policies also tended to have the fewest maternity care providers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s concern among experts that abortion bans and restrictions may reduce the number of maternity care providers even further.\u201d \u2018Are those divides \u2026 going to continue?\u2019 States with abortion restrictions tend to have the fewest maternity care providers, higher rates of maternal mortality and broad disparities in health systems, according to the new report. Fourteen states \u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia \u2013 have enacted near-total bans on abortion since the US Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion two years ago. All but one of those states ranked below average in the new ranking of women\u2019s health from the Commonwealth Fund, and seven were among the poorest-performing states. The policy choices that state lawmakers put forth, including fully expanding Medicaid and imposing abortion restrictions, have \u201cclearly had implications for people in their states,\u201d said Sara Collins, senior scholar and vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at the Commonwealth Fund. \u201cThose are clear policy choices that states are making that are linked to the politics in their state and that are having an impact on women\u2019s access to health care,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAre those divides that we\u2019re seeing going to continue into the future?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre there going to be more women who are living in states that don\u2019t have full access to reproductive health care? Or are those trends going to reverse? And a lot of that is tied to the politics, both in states but also at the federal level.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/health/womens-health-state-rankings-commonwealth-fund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_sex-gender-child-brain", "text": "Sex and gender are often conflated or equated in everyday conversations, and most American adults believe a person\u2019s gender is determined by sex assigned at birth. But a new study of nearly 5,000 9- and 10-year-olds found that sex and gender map onto largely distinct parts of the brain. The research gives a first insight into how sex and gender may have \u201cmeasurable and unique influences\u201d on the brain, study authors said, just as other experiences have been shown to shape the brain. \u201cMoving forward, we really need to consider both sexes and genders separately if we better want to understand the brain,\u201d said Dr. Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and the Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, California, and a co-author of the study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances. The researchers on the new study defined sex as what was assigned to the child at birth. In the US, clinicians make this assignment based on genitalia. Most people are assigned either female or male, according to the research; the rest are intersex, a person whose sexual or reproductive anatomy doesn\u2019t fit this male/female binary. The researchers defined gender as an individual\u2019s attitude, feelings and behaviors, as well as socially constructed roles. They noted specifically that gender is not binary, meaning not all people identify as either female or male. Both sex and gender are a core part of human experience. They\u2019re key to how people perceive others and how they understand themselves. Both can influence behavior as well as health, the study authors say. The researchers looked at brain imaging data from 4,757 children in the United States, 2,315 assigned female at birth and 2,442 assigned male at birth, who were ages 9 and 10 and were a subset of the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. Over a period of 10 years, the children in the ABCD study underwent comprehensive neuroimaging, behavioral, developmental and psychiatric assessments. Beyond tests such as MRIs, the scientists did surveys of the children and their parents that were focused on gender, both at the beginning of the research and then a year later. The children were asked about how they expressed their gender and how they felt about it. The parents were asked about a child\u2019s sex-typed behavior during play and whether the child had any gender dysphoria, a term that mental health professionals use to describe clinically significant distress felt because a person\u2019s sense of their gender does not match their sex the assigned at birth. Parents were a key part of the study, said study co-author Dr. Dani S. Bassett, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania with appointments in the Departments of Bioengineering, Electrical & Systems Engineering, Physics & Astronomy, Neurology, and Psychiatry. \u201cWhen kids have a particular kind of gender behavior or gender expression, that will influence how their parents and also other caregivers and friends and family \u2026 et cetera interact with them,\u201d Bassett said. Information about a parent\u2019s perception of a child\u2019s gender gives researchers a better sense of the child\u2019s social environment and how it may affect their brain development. The authors used a kind of artificial intelligence called machine learning that built a model that could predict a child\u2019s sex and reported gender from their brain scan.  When the researchers looked the children\u2019s brain scans, the results seemed to show that sex influenced different regions of the brain that are involved in visual processing, sensory processing and motor control and some regions involved in executive function, which lets an individual organize and integrate information across time. Gender seems to influence some of the more sensory-specific networks that are associated with sex, but it also seems to have a broader influence and can be detected on different brain networks involved in executive function, including things like attention, social cognition and emotional processing. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re able to capture how gender maps onto the brain basically just tells us that gender is influencing our brain,\u201d Dhamala said. The structure of the human brain can be shaped by expertise and experiences. Research on London taxi drivers \u2014 who must take extensive tests to show that they can navigate the city\u2019s streets without maps or GPS \u2014 seems to show that they have significantly larger posterior hippocampi, the part of the brain related to spatial memory and navigation, than in people who aren\u2019t taxi drivers. \u201cSimilarly, as individuals and as humans, we are experts about ourselves and our genders. So it makes sense that gender will also be mapped within our brains,\u201d Dhamala said. What the new study cannot do is predict what gender a person may identify with beyond one limited snapshot in time captured by the scans and surveys. Gender, the authors note, is not something that is necessarily static, and a person\u2019s understanding of their gender can change throughout their lifetime. The study also can\u2019t determine what things in someone\u2019s environment will influence their brain function in terms of sex or gender, nor can it identify what a person\u2019s sexual orientation might be. \u201cSexual orientation is independent from gender and from sex,\u201d Bassett said, and it may be differently mapped in the brain. The researchers say they hope to someday learn more about how sex and gender interact in a person\u2019s life and how they influence one another and the brain throughout a lifetime. They also hope to see how different cultures affect a person\u2019s gender and their brain development. A 2022 poll showed that most American adults \u2014 and the vast majority of conservatives \u2014 believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. The distinction is key to gender-affirming care, medical treatment for people who identify as a gender that is different from the one they were assigned at birth. Conservative politicians have pushed for a record number of bans on such care, and nearly half of US states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care for minors. The study did not look at whether sex or gender were congruent or incongruent in any study participant. Rather, it looked at the child\u2019s binary sex and gender across self- and parent-reported measures. The study couldn\u2019t provide any specific findings if sex and gender were incongruent. \u201cGoing forward, the hope is that we can motivate other scientists to consider science and gender in their analyses in the data collections in their programs and research,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Avram Holmes, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers University. The field of neuroscience has only just begun to acknowledge and address the presence of biases and barriers to inclusivity within research, Holmes said. A fuller understanding of the way the brain works in terms of sex and gender could also have practical implications and potentially help scientists find better ways to treat people with brain-related illnesses. For instance, the study pointed to how people assigned male at birth are more likely to be diagnosed with substance use and attention deficit disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that sex and gender necessarily drive illness rates, but the cultures people are embedded in can also influence the likelihood they may or may not develop a particular illness,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cSo the types of environmental pressures a child undergoes across development could increase or decrease their risk for experiencing illness, independent of their initial brain biology.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/sex-gender-child-brain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_health_tennessee-sex-workers-sex-offender-registry-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "The Tennessee government has agreed to begin scrubbing its sex offender registry of dozens of people who were convicted of prostitution\u00a0while having HIV, reversing a practice that federal lawsuits have challenged as draconian and discriminatory. For more than three decades, Tennessee\u2019s \u201caggravated prostitution\u201d laws have made prostitution a misdemeanor for most sex workers but a felony for those who are HIV-positive. Tennessee toughened penalties in 2010 by reclassifying prostitution with HIV as a \u201cviolent sexual offense\u201d with a lifetime registration as a sex offender \u2014 even if protection is used. At least 83 people are believed to be on Tennessee\u2019s sex offender registry solely because of these laws, with most living in the Memphis area, where undercover police officers and prosecutors most often invoked the statute, commonly against Black and transgender women, according to a lawsuit filed last year by the American Civil Liberties Union and four women who were convicted of aggravated prostitution. The Department of Justice challenged the law in a separate suit earlier this year. Both lawsuits argue that Tennessee law does not account for\u00a0evolving science\u00a0on the transmission of HIV or\u00a0precautions that prevent its spread, like use of condoms. Both lawsuits also argue that labeling a person as a sex offender because of HIV unfairly limits where they can live and work and stops them from being alone with grandchildren or minor relatives. \u201cTennessee\u2019s Aggravated Prostitution statute is the only law in the nation that treats people living with HIV who engage in\u00a0any\u00a0sex work, even risk-free encounters, as \u2018violent sex offenders\u2019 subjected to lifetime registration,\u201d the ACLU lawsuit states. \u201cThat individuals living with HIV are treated so differently can only be understood as a remnant of the profoundly prejudiced early response to the AIDS epidemic.\u201d In a\u00a0settlement agreement\u00a0signed by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on July 15 and filed in both lawsuits on July 17, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said it would comb through the state\u2019s sex offender registry to find those added solely because of aggravated prostitution convictions, then send letters alerting those people that they can make a written request to be removed. The language of the settlement suggests that people will need to request their removal from the registry, but the agency said in the agreement it will make \u201cits best effort\u201d to act on the requests \u201cpromptly in the order in which they are received.\u201d The Tennessee attorney general\u2019s office, which represents the state in both the ACLU and DOJ lawsuits and approved the settlement agreement, said in an email statement it would \u201ccontinue to defend Tennessee\u2019s prohibition on aggravated prostitution.\u201d In an email statement, the ACLU celebrated the settlement as \u201cone step toward remedying the harms by addressing the sex offender registration,\u201d but said its work in Tennessee was not done because aggravated prostitution remained a felony charge that it would \u201cfight to overturn.\u201d Molly Quinn, executive director of LGBTQ+ support organization\u00a0OUTMemphis, another plaintiff in the ACLU lawsuit, said both organizations would help eligible people with the paperwork to get removed from the registry. \u201cWe would not have agreed to settle if we did not feel like this was a process that would be extremely beneficial,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cBut, we\u2019re sad that the statute existed as long as it did and sad that there is any process at all that folks have to go through after living with this extraordinary burden of being on the sex offender registry for really an irrelevant reason.\u201d Michelle Anderson, a Memphis resident who is one of the plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit, said in court records that since being convicted of aggravated prostitution, the sex offender label has made it so difficult to find a home and a job that she was \u201cunhoused for about a year\u201d and has at times \u201cfelt she had no option but to continue to engage in sex work to survive.\u201d Like the other plaintiffs, Anderson said her conviction kept her minor relatives at a distance. \u201cMs. Anderson has a nephew she loves, but she cannot have a close relationship with him,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cEven though Ms. Anderson\u2019s convictions had nothing to do with children, she cannot legally be alone with her nephew.\u201d The Tennessee settlement comes months after state lawmakers softened the law so no one else should be added to the sex offender registry for aggravated prostitution. Lawmakers removed the registration requirement and made convictions eligible for expungement if the defendant testifies they were a victim of human trafficking. State Sen. Page Walley (R-Savannah), who supported the original aggravated prostitution law passed in 1991 and co-sponsored the recent bill to amend it, said on the floor of the legislature that the changes do not prevent prosecutors from charging people with a felony for aggravated prostitution. Instead, he said, the amendments undo the 2010 law that put those who are convicted on the registry \u201calong with pedophiles and rapists for a lifetime, with no recourse for removal.\u201d \u201cHaving stood, as I mentioned, in 1991 and passed this,\u201d Walley said, \u201cit is a particular gratifying moment for me to see how we continue to evolve and seek what\u2019s just and what\u2019s right and what\u2019s best.\u201d KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 an independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

{"id": "2024_07_17_health_endometriosis-ovarian-cancer-higher-risk-study-wellness", "text": "The risk of developing ovarian cancer appears to jump about fourfold among women with endometriosis, compared with women who haven\u2019t been diagnosed with the condition, a new study finds. Scientists have known that endometriosis may be linked with an increased ovarian cancer risk, but the study details how that risk can vary by subtypes of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common and often painful condition that happens when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus itself. It\u2019s estimated to affect more than 11% of women between the ages of 15 and 44 across the United States. Women with severe forms \u2014 either deep infiltrating endometriosis, ovarian endometriomas or both \u2014 have an overall ovarian cancer risk that\u2019s \u201cmarkedly increased,\u201d at about 9.7 times higher, relative to women without endometriosis, according to the study, published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA. The form of endometriosis that is deeply infiltrating is found deep within the tissue or organ and ovarian endometriomas, sometimes called \u201cchocolate cysts,\u201d are cysts that form in the ovary. And women with deep infiltrating endometriosis, ovarian endometriomas or both appear to face nearly 19 times the risk of type I ovarian cancer, which tends to grow more slowly, compared with women without endometriosis, according to the study. But people with endometriosis should not panic about the new study findings, experts say, because ovarian cancer itself is still rare. About 1.1% of US women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer at some point in their lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, it is estimated that there will be nearly 20,000 new cases of ovarian cancer, and about 13,000 people will die of the disease. \u201cIt should be noted that, because of the rarity of ovarian cancer, the association with endometriosis only increased the number of cancer cases by 10 to 20 per 10,000 women,\u201d said Karen Schliep, senior author of the new study and an associate professor in the Division of Public Health at the University of Utah School of Medicine. \u201cWe would not recommend, at this point, any change in clinical care or policy,\u201d she added. \u201cThe best way of preventing ovarian cancer is still the recommendation of exercise, not smoking and limiting alcohol.\u201d Other than age, having a family history of ovarian cancer, breast cancer or colorectal cancer is also an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. Overall, people with endometriosis should be aware of the warning signs of ovarian cancer, including bloating, abdominal pain and changes in bowel or bladder function, Dr. BJ Rimel, a gynecologic oncologist and medical director of the Cancer Clinical Trials Office at Cedars-Sinai, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. \u201cIf a person has endometriosis and oral contraceptive pills have been recommended by their doctor for either treatment or for just plain old contraception, then I would definitely consider taking them,\u201d Rimel said. \u201cOral contraceptive pills are associated with a 50% risk reduction of ovarian cancer which is great news.\u201d Researchers find \u2018shocking\u2019 increases For the new study, a team of researchers in the United States analyzed data on nearly 500,000 women in Utah, ages 18 to 55. The data came from the Utah Population Database at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, and the researchers took a close look at how many women were identified as having endometriosis in their electronic health records as well as how many developed ovarian cancer between 1992 and 2019, based on the Utah Cancer Registry. The researchers found that the risk of all ovarian cancer types was 4.2-fold higher among women with endometriosis than in women without the condition. The risk of type I ovarian cancer specifically was \u201cespecially high,\u201d according to the study, at around 7.5-fold higher among women with endometriosis, and the risk of developing type II ovarian cancer \u2013 which can be more aggressive \u2013 was about 2.7 times more likely. \u201cMagnitudes of these associations varied by endometriosis subtype. Individuals diagnosed with deep infiltrating endometriosis and/or ovarian endometriomas had 9.66 times the risk of ovarian cancer when compared with individuals without endometriosis,\u201d the researchers wrote. The researchers found that, relative to women without any type of endometriosis, women with deep infiltrating endometriosis had the highest risk of ovarian cancer overall \u2014 around 18.8 times higher \u2014 and women with deep infiltrating endometriosis along with ovarian endometriomas had the second-highest risk, about 13-fold higher. Those dramatic increases were surprising to Schliep and her colleagues. \u201cTo see this jump tenfold, with fairly tight confidence intervals between eightfold and 12-fold, and then a 19-fold higher risk, as an epidemiologist, you don\u2019t always see those types of relationships,\u201d Schliep said. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that was shocking to me, just from an epidemiology point of view.\u201d The study data did not indicate which women with endometriosis were treated specifically with oral contraceptives or with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, which could slightly skew the data, as birth control pills are associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer and it remains unclear what associations gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists may have with cancer risk. Additionally, some women indicated as not having endometriosis in the data could have been undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. But overall, the study adds to the body of research suggesting a link between endometriosis and ovarian cancer risk, Dr. Michael McHale of the University of California, San Diego, wrote in an editorial accompanying the new study in JAMA. \u201cMoreover, these data support the importance of counseling women with deep infiltrating and/or ovarian endometriosis regarding the increased risk for ovarian cancer. Although the absolute number of ovarian cancers is limited, the increased risk is significant,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn those women who have completed childbearing or have alternative fertility options, consideration for more definitive surgery should be discussed and considered. As always, shared decision-making is essential given these evolving data.\u201d \u2018Risk is, overall, still on the lower side\u2019 The new study shows the strongest association to date between endometriosis and ovarian cancer risk, said Dr. Tatnai Burnett, a\u00a0minimally invasive gynecology surgery specialist at Mayo Clinic\u00a0in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the research but whose work focuses on endometriosis. He added that this association could be driven by a number of factors. \u201cWe know that an abnormal proliferation of cells \u2014 so in endometriosis, we\u2019re seeing cells where they\u2019re not supposed to be \u2014 and that\u2019s a genetic phenomenon. Cells gain the ability to move or be in places, and there probably is some relationship there genetically,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cBut then there\u2019s a host of other potential connections, from inflammatory connections to immunological factors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe are multiple potential associations, so I don\u2019t think we can effectively guess at one particular thing.\u201d Still, people who have endometriosis should not panic about the association, Burnett said. \u201cThe risk is, overall, still on the lower side of cancer risks,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently, even with the known risk levels, we haven\u2019t recommended any universal screening for patients with endometriosis, and I don\u2019t see that necessarily changing. We already do follow women with endometriomas or cystic endometriosis with ultrasound, to rule out the development of malignancy. So I don\u2019t see this changing our recommendations at this point.\u201d Endometriosis itself is a diagnosis that\u2019s not fully understood, which makes the association with ovarian cancer difficult to completely comprehend as well, said Dr. Deanna Gerber, a gynecologic oncologist at the Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Hospital\u2013Long Island in New York, who was not involved in the new study. There could be a genetic factor driving the association, or the inflammation that is often seen with endometriosis could increase ovarian cancer risk, she said, but hormonal factors could be driving the association, as well. Patients should remember that \u201cthe risk of ovarian cancer is extremely low in the general population. It\u2019s less than 2%, which is much, much less than a common cancer like breast cancer,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cSo, in the study, a fourfold increased risk in ovarian cancer still keeps women at a very low risk.\u201d The new study demonstrates an association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer but not causation \u2013 and what exactly drives that association remains unclear, according to Rimel of Cedars-Sinai. \u201cThere are several proposed mechanisms but none are completely proven. Some mutations in genes such as ARID1A are associated with endometriosis and endometrial cancer, which may link the two,\u201d Rimel wrote in an email. She added that another possible mechanism could involve the way in which endometriosis forms and how that formation may damage tissue, creating a more prone environment for cancer \u2014 but more research is needed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/endometriosis-ovarian-cancer-higher-risk-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_health_dr-sanjay-gupta-analysis-trump", "text": "It has been nearly a week since gunfire erupted at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, resulting in an injury to the former president, the death of one attendee, Corey Comperatore, and severe injuries to two others. And although the images we\u2019ve seen of Trump since his attempted assassination have been those of a person who was barely injured and is now in high spirits, what we\u2019ve been told by the campaign offers very little insight into the former president\u2019s condition, what kind of care he received or how his medical team will monitor him in the days and weeks ahead. A full public assessment of Trump\u2019s injuries is necessary, for both the former president\u2019s own health and the clarity it can provide for voters about the recovery of the man who could become president of the United States once again. The concern is that gunshot blasts near the head can cause injuries that aren\u2019t immediately noticeable, such as bleeding in or on the brain, damage to the inner ear or even psychological trauma. As a trauma neurosurgeon, I have seen how a thorough evaluation after any kind of gunshot wound can provide a complete picture and lead to a speedier recovery. The first hour The first official communication about Trump\u2019s health from his campaign came about 40 minutes after the shooting. It simply said Trump was \u201cfine\u201d and was \u201cbeing checked out at a local medical facility.\u201d It added that more details would follow. Two hours later, in a post by Trump himself on Truth Social, he wrote: \u201cI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.\u201d In his speech at the Republican National Convention Thursday night, Trump described the moment of the shooting\u00a0but didn\u2019t shed new light on his condition or the care he received.\u00a0Beyond that, most of what we know about his injury is based on what we\u2019ve seen in pictures and video, and from secondhand accounts. A source familiar with the matter told CNN on Sunday that Trump underwent a number of \u201croutine\u201d tests at the hospital, including a CT scan that came back normal. CNN has repeatedly reached out to the Trump campaign and Butler Memorial Hospital, where Trump was treated, for more information but has not received further details about his condition or care.\u00a0CNN reached out to the Trump campaign for comment again Thursday. What we know about Trump\u2019s injury In the moments immediately following the sounds of gunfire on Saturday, we saw Trump raise his right hand to his ear and the side of his face. He did not collapse but seemed to duck to the ground of his own accord. With US Secret Service surrounding him, he stood up about a minute later, raised his right arm and was able to walk and speak immediately. We saw him rouse the audience, telling them to \u201cFight!\u201d as he pumped his fist in the air. From a medical standpoint, these are all very good signs and, despite the visible blood on his face, provided evidence that he wasn\u2019t severely injured. US Rep. Ronny Jackson, Trump\u2019s former White House physician, said during an interview Monday on \u201cThe Benny Show\u201d podcast, that he \u201cchecked out\u201d the wound to Trump\u2019s ear and bandaged it himself. He added that \u201cthere was no concussive effect from the bullet\u201d because it was far enough from Trump\u2019s head. \u201cIt just took the top of his ear off, a little bit of the top of his ear off, as it passed through,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt was bleeding like crazy.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Trump was transported to nearby Butler Memorial Hospital. Dr. David Rottinghaus, an emergency room physician there, said the hospital had been in contact with the Secret Service before Saturday\u2019s rally. Rottinghaus, who did not treat Trump himself and would not comment on Trump\u2019s treatment or condition, said he came to the hospital shortly after the shooting to help triage patients. \u201cWe do prepare for incidents like this. We had had advanced visits in the past for rallies when Mr. Trump was here. The last was the end of 2020. We have worked with the Secret Service in the past and local and federal law enforcement to come up with plans about if an incident like this happened,\u201d Rottinghaus told CNN. Those plans included designating a bed in the ER in case it was needed, having clinical teams at the rally itself to treat patients on-site for minor medical issues, and avoiding overwhelming the hospital if there were a crisis. When the unthinkable happened, Rottinghaus said, it took just minutes for Butler Memorial to put its plan into action, locking down the hospital and diverting patients to other health care facilities. Although we were told that Trump had a CT scan and other routine exams, it is not clear when these tests were performed, who read the scans or whether his brain specifically was examined. In the Monday interview, Jackson said Trump\u2019s injury was \u201cdressed up. He\u2019ll be OK. \u2026 It\u2019s going to granulate and heal in, and he\u2019s not going to need anything to be done with it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0On Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Eric Trump said that his father had \u201cno stitches but certainly, certainly a nice flesh wound.\u201d And Trump has been moving around the RNC in Milwaukee this week, talking and smiling through speeches with a bandage on his ear. What we don\u2019t know All of this points to a favorable prognosis. But it is still surprising that we have not heard more about the exact diagnosis and care of what may have been a catastrophic injury. And, while all the attention has been on his ear and right side of his head, that doesn\u2019t mean other injuries may not be present. It\u2019s not even clear that he was struck by a primary projectile from the rifle, a secondary projectile or a combination of both. Sometimes, it can be difficult to know without an in-depth evaluation. We do know that the shooter used an AR-15-style weapon, and in my experience in the operating room, I\u2019ve witnessed the kind of trauma this weapon can cause. The kinetic energy of it is significant: A rifle like the AR-15 can produce up to 1,300 foot-pounds of force. With that much power close to the head, there can be injuries beyond what\u2019s visible. For example, a fracture to the thin bone in that region of the skull, an epidural hematoma (or bleeding between the skull and the brain) and damage to the bones of the inner ear, which can result in hearing loss, vertigo or dizziness. A CT scan can usually detect such injuries, but they aren\u2019t always immediately apparent. As a result, sometimes patients are observed in the hospital and may even undergo a repeat CT scan. The stress from a shooting can also have psychological effects. \u201cIn the chaos that immediately follows being shot, these psychological impacts don\u2019t always manifest,\u201d said Dr. Kenji Inaba, a trauma surgeon with the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt can come up later on, and it\u2019s something that we always need to be acutely aware of.\u201d The good news is that most physical symptoms of an injury would probably have revealed themselves over the past few days. At this point, however,\u00a0the Trump campaign hasn\u2019t yet shared whether a full workup was done at the time or if there has been any follow-up since. Presidents and presidential candidates are not required to share their medical histories with the public, but voters have said that the health conditions of their leaders matter to them in this election. More information helps everyone make better decisions. Rottinghaus, the Butler Memorial physician, told CNN that after all the preparation for the unthinkable, \u201cthe unexpected happened\u201d on Saturday. Still, the hospital considers it a successful day: Staff juggled the arrival of a former president with care for their other patients. What made it work, he said, was communication, clear planning and preparation to act. In an intense political season for the country, that kind of collaboration and communication may be a lesson for the candidates, too.

{"id": "2024_07_19_health_personalized-mobility-routine-wellness", "text": "Your body is the living, breathing vehicle you rely on to navigate your life, so maintaining mobility is an essential part of your overall well-being. Unfortunately, one-size-fits-all workouts often fall short of delivering a functional, pain-free range of motion. The good news is that creating an effective, personalized mobility routine can be simple and time efficient. Whether you\u2019re a busy professional, stay-at-home parent or seasoned athlete, you can follow the 10 practical steps below to create your own custom mobility program to enhance your range of motion, reduce pain, improve stability and more. Editor\u2019s note: Consult with your doctor before beginning any new fitness program. 1. Assess your current mobility To create a personalized mobility routine, it\u2019s crucial to understand how you currently move. Working with a certified trainer or physical therapist, you can get a comprehensive Functional Movement Screen, or FMS, which is what I use to assess professional athletes. You can also do a self-assessment using simple functional exercises to evaluate your range of motion and identify limitations. To self-assess, stand in front of a mirror and perform a variety of basic movements that incorporate the upper and lower body, such as squats, lunges and arm raises, noting any movement restrictions, imbalances or feelings of discomfort. For more comprehensive results, assess yourself doing exercises from all six categories of functional human movement: squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling, rotating and core stabilization (see video above). Tip: Record yourself from different angles during your assessment for a better view. Save the recordings to use for comparison as you progress in your program. 2. Identify areas of improvement The limitations revealed in your assessment offer areas of opportunity for improvement. Identify and prioritize areas based on factors such as how often you rely on that particular area of your body to perform similar movements in daily life, the degree of limitation or imbalance you experience, and the level of discomfort you feel. If you feel acute pain, seek assistance from a health care professional before proceeding. Common areas offering opportunities for improvement include the hips and lower back. Tip: If your balance was challenged during the assessment exercises, I recommend further assessment with a basic one-leg stand test. 3. Set goals Setting clear goals provides direction for your mobility routine. Is there a particular task or daily activity that enhanced mobility would enable you to do better? Define two or three actionable goals that relate to the areas in need of improvement identified in the preceding step. For example, if you found limitations in your ability to squat and you are an avid golfer who would like to improve mobility to play better, consider framing one of your goals like this: I will improve my hip mobility and knee stability to be able to squat down to pick up my ball, swing my club and walk the course with greater ease. Tip: Setting specific goals relevant to your lifestyle will allow you to recognize your progress in daily activities more easily, increasing your motivation. 4. Choose the right exercises Your mobility routine should include eight to 12 exercises that give your body the chance to practice a full range of motion while also zeroing in on the target areas identified in your assessment. To address total-body mobility, focus on a variety of exercises that get you moving in all directions and take you through all three planes of motion: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). Then identify exercises specific to your target areas and goals. For instance, in the example provided in step three, you would want to include hip mobility and knee stability exercises to improve your squatting and golf game, such as lateral lunges, reverse lunges and box squats. Tip: You can do an online search to determine exercises specific to your needs and goals. Staying with the same example above, you would search \u201chip mobility and knee stability exercises to improve squatting.\u201d Just vet any resources to be sure they are reputable. 5. Create a routine that fits your lifestyle Personalized mobility is much more effective and efficient than one-size-fits-all training, so you do not need to spend hours each week on it. With the right mobility plan, you can achieve results in less than an hour a week spread out over days. For instance, you could practice a 10-minute routine three times per week or a five-minute routine five times per week while also repeating two or three targeted exercises in shorter one- or two-minute spurts daily. Tip: Your personalized mobility routine can serve as the perfect warmup before any other regular exercise program, such as strength training or cardiovascular activities. 6. Incorporate exercises into daily activities Your mobility training should be designed to fit seamlessly into your daily life to avoid any barriers to consistency. One of the best ways to do that is through habit stacking, a technique that involves performing the desired new habit just before, during or after an ingrained habit, and pairing them together in a way that makes maintaining the new habit easier. To do this, stack your targeted mobility exercises with daily habits such as brushing your teeth, making the bed or putting on shoes. Tip: Make stretching on your couch part of your TV-watching habit. 7. Stay consistent Consistency is the most critical factor in seeing improvement. Set reminders on your smart devices and take the habit-stacking advice from the preceding step to integrate your mobility exercises into your daily routine. If you struggle with accountability, get a friend to practice with you. Tip: Do not be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Recommit and start fresh the next day. 8. Track your progress Monitoring your improvements provides motivation and important insights. Use a digital diary or a notebook to track changes in your range of motion, imbalances, sensations and so on. Tip: Reassess yourself every six to eight weeks, referring back to your original assessment recording to measure changes. 9. Adjust as needed As you progress, it\u2019s important to adjust your routine based on your evolving needs. If you hit a plateau, do not hesitate to modify your exercises and/or seek advice from a professional. Tip: Be sure to update your goals as you progress or make new goals that are more appropriate as you incorporate changes in your lifestyle. 10. Celebrate your successes Noticed any increase in range of motion? Celebrate your achievements, no matter how modest they may seem, as they signify forward momentum. Simply sticking to your routine consistently is cause for celebration. Tip: Rewarding yourself with small gifts or indulgences for hitting milestones can reinforce positive behavior and keep you motivated. By following these 10 steps, you can design a personalized mobility routine that fits your lifestyle, addresses your unique needs and helps you achieve lasting results. Your body will thank you for it!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/health/personalized-mobility-routine-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_bird-flu-cases-extreme-heat", "text": "Searing heat may have played a role in the infections of five workers who fell ill last week while culling a large flock of chickens infected with the H5N1 virus in Colorado, health officials said Tuesday. \u201cAt the time transmission is thought to have occurred, Colorado was experiencing 104-plus-degree heat,\u201d and it was probably hotter inside the barns, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0The CDC is investigating the outbreak along with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. This made the use of personal protective equipment a challenge, Shah said. In addition, to bring down temperatures in the sweltering barns, large industrial fans were blowing, moving air as well as dust and feathers.\u00a0Feathers from infected birds are known to carry the H5N1 virus. \u201cWe understand those large fans \u2026 were moving so much air \u2026 the workers were finding it hard to maintain a good seal or a good fit either between the mask or with eye protection,\u201d Shah said. Four of the Colorado cases have been confirmed by the CDC. A fifth tested positive at a state lab and has been sent to the CDC for confirmation. The incident has quickly doubled the number of farm workers known to be infected with H5N1 virus in the United States, and it is the largest number of workers known to be infected in connection with a single farm. In 2022, a poultry worker tested positive for H5N1 in Colorado.\u00a0This year, four other farm workers have tested positive \u2014 one in Texas, two in Michigan and another in Colorado \u2014 after working with infected dairy cattle.\u00a0Cases are believed to be undercounted because farm workers are often reluctant to be tested for fear of losing work and income. Genetic analysis of the virus from one of the recent human cases involved in the poultry culling was reassuring, Shah said, because it didn\u2019t show any mutations that might indicate the virus is spreading more readily to people. Testing also showed that the virus was closely related to the strain spreading in cattle. At the state of Colorado\u2019s request, the CDC has sent a 10-person team to assist with the investigation and contact tracing in the outbreak.\u00a0Sixty people have shown symptoms consistent with bird flu, and all but five have tested negative at a state laboratory, Shah said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen strong uptake of testing across this particular farm in Colorado,\u201d he added. None of the workers was hospitalized, and many had traditional flu symptoms, including conjunctivitis or eye infections, fever, chills, coughing and sore throats.\u00a0The workers have been offered an antiviral medication and are recovering. Altogether, about 160 people are involved in the culling, or killing, of 1.8 million egg-laying chickens on the Colorado farm, which is a \u201csignificant\u201d egg-producing operation that officials didn\u2019t name.\u00a0The culling operation is expected to continue another 10 to 14 days. It is not clear how the birds became infected, but viruses isolated from the birds are closely related to the same strain that\u2019s infecting dairy cattle, said Dr. Eric Deeble, the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s acting senior adviser of the H5N1 response. The CDC maintains that the threat to the public of the H5N1 bird flu virus is low. However, farm workers are at higher risk of catching the infection, which has recently spread from domestic and wild birds to dairy cattle and other mammals. To stay safe, the CDC recommends that people working with sick or dead cattle or birds wear personal protective equipment, or PPE, which includes waterproof coveralls, a face mask, goggles or a face shield, boots, gloves and a head covering. Workers involved in the culling of the chickens in Colorado were required to wear the full uniform, but environmental conditions made it difficult to keep on. \u201cWe understand that PPE use was not optimal, particularly the masks and the eye protection,\u201d Shah said. The United Farm Workers labor union has questioned whether the CDC\u2019s recommendations are practical given the record-breaking heat enveloping much of the United States this summer.\u00a0It had called on the CDC to rethink its PPE guidance so more people could follow it. \u201cThese are people that are being asked to put their lives on the line for a virus we don\u2019t understand all that well when they have no reasonable way of protecting themselves from either the virus or from heat illness,\u201d Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers, said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re being put in an impossible position.\u201d Workers wear fluid-proof coveralls, Strater points out, which prevent sweat from cooling their bodies, making it easy to overheat.\u00a0In dirty, wet environments like a barn, masks and respirators can become clogged or soggy within minutes. The CDC said it is working to refine its PPE recommendations to account for the heat.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve sent, as part of our team, a specialist in these matters, an industrial hygienist who can help implement improved engineering controls that may make PPE use more uniform as well as more palatable,\u201d Shah said. Strater said it\u2019s time for the CDC to consider vaccinating farmworkers, as Finland is, to give them \u2013 and the general public \u2013 an added layer of protection from the virus and from the threat of another pandemic if it spreads. \u201cThey need to be prioritized, not just because it\u2019s moral to protect their lives by prioritizing vaccination, but it\u2019s a relatively small group of people, when you think about the sort of firewall they\u2019re creating around the rest of the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a huge number of people we need to be protecting. These are people who are on the front lines and who are so intimately exposed.\u201d Although US health officials have stressed that they have no plans to distribute an H5N1 vaccine, they are getting several candidates ready to be deployed in case the virus becomes more dangerous. In May, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was ordering 4.8 million doses of H5N1 vaccine to be manufactured from bulk ingredients in the country\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile. Those doses are expected to be ready by the end of the month. In early July, HHS announced that it had paid Moderna $176 million to support the development of an mRNA-based vaccine against H5N1. The agency said it expects to see phase 1 clinical trial results on the safety of that vaccine by the end of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/bird-flu-cases-extreme-heat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_geriatrician-healthy-aging-wellness", "text": "Longevity isn\u2019t just about living a long life but also about living well. More than 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 or older by 2040, the Department of Health and Human Services projects. And more than 56% of those turning 65 will need some sort of long-term service. Fortunately, there are things you can do at any age to ensure that you will maintain your health as the years go on, according to Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Batsis, an associate professor at UNC\u2019s School of Medicine and Gillings School of Global Public Health, spoke with CNN about what people should know about healthy aging. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: Some people may find it hard to relate their health behaviors now to outcomes in their later years. Why should people start to think about healthy aging early? Dr. John Batsis: There will be individuals who may become sick and frail. There will be individuals who are robust into their 90s. I have patients who are still extremely fit and active \u2014 they may not be as active as they were 20 years ago, but they are still doing the things that they want to do. You have to find a sense of self, a sense of purpose. You have to find a sense of what makes you happy, and it may be different at each stage of life. You can\u2019t change your genetics; you can\u2019t change your past. You can try to change your future with things that are modifiable. If it means altering what you\u2019re eating or how much you\u2019re exercising or engaging in the community, or stopping smoking or drinking \u2014 these are things that are in your control. And there are tools \u2014 like working with your health care team and community resources \u2014 that may be available to be able to help you achieve those. Part of it is really getting to a point that you\u2019re saying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m willing to change.\u201d You have to be willing to change to effect that change. CNN: What are the things you would like people to change earlier in their lives to impact how they age? Batsis: That\u2019s a really great question, and one that often is asked to me \u2014 not only by my patients but their children and by my own family and friends as well. There are a number of factors that have been shown time and time again to lead to healthy aging, but really you can kind of drill it down to kind of a couple. First is proper nutrition, and that really starts from infancy to childhood into adolescence and throughout even into old age. Secondly, regular physical activity and exercise are critically important. And then the third big category is social connections. We often think about these independently as silos, and really you need to be thinking about these jointly and together and synergistically. One can affect the other, but it\u2019s really kind of the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. CNN: What do you mean by proper nutrition? Batsis: We often think of healthy nutrition as having a balanced diet, a Mediterranean-type diet. The food environment often can be challenging, particularly in Western industrialized societies. The fast-food industry is very difficult to get away from. But home-cooked meals \u2014 cooking your own fresh fruit and vegetables, thinking about having these types of meals \u2014 is really, really important and nutritious. Really try to stay away from processed foods and think about more holistic type of foodstuffs. This is really thinking about it more consistently. Food is medicine, and I think this is a concept that is increasingly being sought and advocated by both health and nonhealth providers. And this kind of goes beyond aging. Start young, start early, get it into schools and start to engage individuals and children early on, so they develop skills and practices that are sustainable over their lives. It becomes part of the routine, and it\u2019s not thought to be a chore. CNN: What kind of exercise is most important? Batsis: Regular walking, regular activity. The 150 minutes of activity per week divided by 30 minutes over five days of moderate activity is what\u2019s really recommended. In addition to that, one should think about not only aerobic activity but resistance-based activities. This is more important as one ages to maintain muscle mass and muscle strength, because we know that you lose that capability to maintain that as you age. CNN: Why is social connection so important? Batsis: The importance of social connection in aging is often overlooked, understudied and underappreciated. One of the challenges here in our country is that a lot of us are spread out. And this is not seen as much in other countries that are geographically not as dispersed, or where family units are right next door or within the same neighborhood. It\u2019s not uncommon where I have patients whose children may be on opposite ends of the country, for instance, or their friends may be on opposite ends of the country. The social networking is really helpful to engage in stimulating conversations. And it\u2019s a sense of self, it\u2019s a sense of well-being, it\u2019s a sense of purpose, it\u2019s sharing stories, sharing community. It\u2019s having fun. It helps one\u2019s mental health. We know that depression in individuals can be a risk in old age, and it\u2019s really challenging. CNN: What about the older adults who are reading this? Does the advice still apply? Batsis: Healthy aging can occur at any stage of life. It\u2019s not only as a young adult or middle-aged adult, not only around retirement age. It still can occur well into one\u2019s 80s and 90s. The definition of what constitutes healthy aging may differ, and it\u2019s really about asking what does it mean to you? What\u2019s important to you at this stage of life? How can we achieve what is important to you, and then coming up with a plan and strategies to help our individual patient achieve that? That is the key, and it shouldn\u2019t be a top-down approach. It really needs to be engaging the patient, figuring out from within what is important to them, and helping them and giving them strategies to help them achieve what\u2019s important to them. It comes from within.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/geriatrician-healthy-aging-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_science_strawberry-full-moon-june-scn", "text": "Despite its name, June\u2019s full moon will not look like a strawberry. But the bright orb could still turn heads Friday night with an appearance that is bigger and more colorful than the average moon. The full moon \u2014 which will reach the crest of its fullness\u00a0at 9:08\u00a0p.m. ET Friday\u00a0\u2014 comes one day after the\u00a0summer solstice, the day of the year when the sun appears the highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. Since a full moon is opposite the sun, this strawberry moon will shine lower in the sky than usual, according to\u00a0NASA. Because of this \u201clower than average path across the sky,\u201d the full moon could have an \u201corange- or amber-colored appearance, for the same reason sunsets appear orange or reddish,\u201d said Preston Dyches, a science communicator with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. Dyches said the effect is the result of the moon\u2019s reflected light having to travel a longer distance throughout Earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering away most blue wavelengths (which are shorter than red wavelengths). Native American tribes across North America gave the strawberry moon its name to mark the in-season ripeness of strawberries, according to\u00a0The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The moon\u2019s low placement in the sky could also cause the orb to appear bigger than usual, according to\u00a0NASA,\u00a0due to an effect dubbed the moon illusion. Scientists don\u2019t really know why this optical illusion happens, but it\u2019s believed to be a combination of how our brain processes visual information and the moon\u2019s size in comparison with smaller objects near the horizon, such as trees or the roofs of houses. For optimal viewing, Dyches recommends looking when the moon is rising or setting to see the effects of the moon illusion. No equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features, according to\u00a0NASA\u2019s Moon Viewing Guide. \u201cWhenever something beautiful about the natural world can be experienced from your doorstep, it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time,\u201d Dyches said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to marvel at the sight of another giant world. \u2026 I like to gaze up and think of it as a place people will live and work someday.\u201d How to see the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019 in the night sky Because the moon appears full for three days a month surrounding its peak, the strawberry moon will be visible to almost everyone worldwide. However, it will be more difficult to observe for those farther north, such as in Alaska or Denmark, where the low-traversing moon will only briefly rise above the horizon, Dyches said. Besides the full moon, those in the Northern Hemisphere can spot the \u201cSummer Triangle,\u201d an arrangement of three bright stars whose presence in the sky symbolizes summertime in the north, said Dyches, who also produces the space agency\u2019s monthly sky-watching highlights video called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up.\u201d To find the triangular pattern, it is easiest to look for the brightest of the three stars, Vega, which will be near the east in the sky, according to EarthSky. The second brightest, Altair, will be to the lower right, and the star Deneb, to the lower left of Vega, will finish off the sides of the triangle. Those away from bright city lights can spot the center of the Milky Way as a \u201chazy band of dim clouds arching across the sky,\u201d and the constellation Scorpius can be seen as it \u201cpoints the way to the galaxy\u2019s core,\u201d Dyches added. Remaining moons of 2024 There are six more full moons set to shine bright in the sky this year,\u00a0according to EarthSky. Here are the remaining full moons of 2024 and their peak dates: July 21: Buck moon August 19: Sturgeon moon September 17: Harvest moon October 17: Hunter\u2019s moon November 15: Beaver moon December 15: Cold moon", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/science/strawberry-full-moon-june-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_summer-body-image-wellness", "text": "Did you sculpt your \u201cbikini body\u201d? Is your skin soft and tan and free of body hair? Are you ready for your summer vacation? The pressures around how people\u2019s bodies look can feel particularly high in summer, and it can come from everywhere: advertisements, celebrities, influencers, your friends on social media and even that voice in your head when looking in the mirror. \u201cI see it impact people \u2026 whether it\u2019s a mom who doesn\u2019t let herself go in the pool with her kids because she\u2019s afraid of how she looks in a swimsuit, or people with eating disorders who will choose to not go out with friends because they\u2019re struggling particularly hard that day,\u201d said Rebecca Moravec, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Denver. \u201cThe way we\u2019re in relationship with our bodies directly impacts how we participate in our day-to-day life.\u201d Body image is the way you think and feel about your body, but it isn\u2019t influenced just by what you see in the mirror, said Bri Campos, a body image coach in Paramus, New Jersey. Messages from the culture around you and even your broader mental health can affect your relationship with your body, she said. In the thick of summer, here are the things that might be affecting your relationship with your body and what you can do about them \u2014 so you can enjoy the season with less stress. Comfort and connection In addition to all the messages about what people should look like, the physical sensations of summer often bring increased attention to people\u2019s bodies, Campos said. \u201cYou\u2019re being forced to feel your body when you\u2019re forced to feel that sweat, to feel that heat \u2014 it can be really uncomfortable,\u201d she said. But instead of acknowledging that heat, sweating, sticking and chafing are just part of the experience of summer, people often attribute it to a problem with themselves, Campos said. \u201cWhen we experience discomfort, our brain is automatically going to try to find whose fault is it. And for most of us, we\u2019re going to blame our body,\u201d she added. For a better relationship with your body this summer, Campos recommends finding ways to connect with yourself in more enjoyable ways. Wearing ill-fitting clothing \u2014 whether too large or too small \u2014 will make you feel uncomfortable and angry at your body all day, she said. Instead, put something on that feels good. And look for ways to connect with your body that aren\u2019t uncomfortable \u2014 such as focusing your attention on how it feels to dunk in a cool pool, take that first sip of coffee in the morning, cuddle with a pet or hug someone you love, she said. \u201cThat is a connected moment where I can say, \u2018This feels good in my body,\u2019\u201d Campos said. Instagram vs. reality Summer can look glamorous on social media \u2014 perfectly posed bathing suit pictures, luxurious vacations and radiant sunshine. It can feel as though everyone is having a better and more beautiful time than you, Moravec said. And many people think if they don\u2019t fit that image, everyone will notice, said Dr. Whitney Trotter, a doctor of nursing practice, psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner and registered dietitian in Austin, Texas. Campos\u2019 clients often share that they feel worried about going to cookouts and get-togethers over the summer because they think others will be eyeing the choices they make around food. \u201cMost people are worried about their own bodies, and they\u2019re worried about their own food choices, but yet the pressure is still there,\u201d she said. One helpful practice can be to go out into the world \u2014 parties, the beach, the pool or restaurants \u2014 and simply observe who is out there participating, Moravec said. It isn\u2019t just the curated images of social media. Instead you\u2019ll find people of all shapes, sizes and backgrounds who are getting together and having fun. \u201cThe reality is that life is happening with or without (the image management),\u201d she said. \u201cIf you were to focus on simply connecting with other people connecting with yourself, what would life look like?\u201d Looking for belonging Often, behind the efforts to achieve the socially ideal body are notions that you will have access to the more important things once you get it. \u201cWe all carry an underlying story about what we need or who we need to be to get love or belonging or safety,\u201d Moravec said. And bodies are an easy target. If only you looked different, then maybe you would also be staring at a sunset with someone you love, splashing in the waves happily with your kids or enjoying a vacation with a group of close friends, right? \u201cOur work is to really challenge that,\u201d Moravec said. \u201cWhen I think about the friends that I have the deepest friendships with, I\u2019m not thinking about how tan their skin is. I\u2019m not thinking about how they look in a bathing suit.\u201d The idea that a different image may help foster a sense of belonging in a season of vacationing may feel present for people of color, Trotter said. \u201cFor African Americans, (vacationing in popular locations) was not always available,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is kind of this pressure now \u2026 \u2018How do I vacation the right way?\u2019 \u201cAnd oftentimes, that leads to dieting and weight loss, because they want to have a thin body, or a body that appears more accessible,\u201d Trotter said. Moravec recommends shifting the focus away from how your body looks and striving toward those things you desire in your life. \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s having a hard body image day \u2026 I want them to check in about what else is going on,\u201d she said. \u201cAre they feeling lonely? Are they feeling disconnected? Are they not feeling good enough?\u201d Rarely, if ever, do we love people just because of how they look, so there are better ways than changing your body to get the connection you are looking for, Moravec said. Can you spend more quality time with your loved ones? Can you be more present by playing in the pool without worrying about what you look like? Be aware that changing your body doesn\u2019t always mean problems of connection and belonging will be fixed, Campos said. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a haircut after a breakup,\u201d she added. \u201cYou might feel better, but it doesn\u2019t actually change anything in your body. It is just in the temporary relief from a bigger, more systemic issue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/summer-body-image-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_mediterranean-diet-children-cardiometabolic-health-wellness", "text": "The Mediterranean diet has been linked to many health benefits for adults. Now, a new study suggests it could be\u00a0beneficial to children\u2019s heart health\u00a0as well. An analysis of nine earlier studies including 577 participants from the ages of 3 to 18 has found incorporating the Mediterranean diet for at least eight weeks had a significant association with lowering blood pressure and total cholesterol, according to the study published Friday in the\u00a0journal JAMA Network Open. The research further supports that incorporating healthy dietary habits early in life can help prevent cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders, such as high blood pressure and\u00a0diabetes, which often originate in childhood, researchers say. \u201cEarly dietary habits significantly influence long-term health outcomes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Jos\u00e9 Francisco L\u00f3pez-Gil, a senior researcher with One Health Research Group at the University of the Americas in Quito, Ecuador, in an email. \u201cThe key takeaway for parents is the importance of promoting a diet rich in whole foods and healthy fats to optimize their children\u2019s health and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.\u201d Knowing the benefits the Mediterranean diet has for adults\u2019 cardiometabolic health, the findings are not surprising but provide further emphasis on the importance of having a diet of\u00a0unprocessed foods\u00a0such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats and fish for all stages of life, said Dr. Stuart Berger, division head of pediatric cardiology at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago. Berger was not involved with the study. Here\u2019s how parents and guardians could help their children benefit from the Mediterranean eating plan, according to experts. Should kids eat the Mediterranean diet? The\u00a0Mediterranean diet\u00a0is a way of eating that includes plant-based cooking with an emphasis on healthy fats. Fruits, vegetables, beans, seeds, nuts, whole grains, lean meats and fish are all contributors to the\u00a0dietary plan. Not every child needs to adopt a Mediterranean diet, but it is important to increase \u201creal foods\u201d in children\u2019s diets and decrease highly processed foods that have added sugars and sodium, said Dr. Natalie Muth, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, who was not involved with the research. \u201cWe know that calories from ultraprocessed foods\u00a0make up about 70%\u00a0of a typical teenager\u2019s intake. Any change that can lower intake of things like chips, cookies, and sodas and increase intake of fruits and vegetables is a big win,\u201d said Muth, a\u00a0pediatrician and registered dietitian at the WELL Clinic at Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group in San Diego, in an email. But it is always important to keep in mind a child\u2019s preferences and to incorporate cultural traditions into any guidance around food choices, Muth added. For those looking to shift to the Mediterranean eating plan, following age-appropriate dietary plans and exercise recommended by a child\u2019s pediatrician is also key, said Berger, who is a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Gathering\u00a0together as a family over a meal as a way to connect also plays a major role\u00a0in the Mediterranean diet,\u00a0said Dr. Tamara Hannon, director of the clinical pediatric diabetes program at Riley Hospital for Children\u00a0at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis. \u201cParents need to lead by example by eating using this pattern, offering structured meals and snacks (scheduled), and exercising daily,\u201d she added in an email. Hannon, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, was not involved with the research. Hannon also recommends parents and guardians limit their children\u2019s eating between structured meals and snacks as well as eliminating sugary beverages and juices to improve blood glucose and weight management. Future research on improving children\u2019s heart health The authors of the new report found a variation in results across the earlier studies analyzed, which can be attributed to the differing factors of diet and physical activity each study displayed. Despite the variations, the Mediterranean diet consistently improved\u00a0blood pressure levels and\u00a0lipid profiles, L\u00f3pez-Gil said, which can lower the risk of cardiometabolic problems later in life such as heart attacks, strokes and diabetes. The researchers were surprised they didn\u2019t find evidence of any effects on glucose and insulin levels, L\u00f3pez-Gil said. The impact the Mediterranean diet has on these health factors could be less pronounced, or could require a longer time frame to have an effect, he added. The study looked at the results of kids adopting the dietary plan from eight to 40 weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to do more studies on kids in particular,\u201d Berger said, \u201cbut reviewing these studies suggest the \u2026 beneficial effects of the so-called Mediterranean diet and everything associated with it.\u201d Further research should include larger sample sizes and more diverse populations as well as longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of the Mediterranean diet on kids\u2019 cardiometabolic health, L\u00f3pez-Gil said. \u201cThe growing research shows the value (in the Mediterranean diet) to be the same for children and adolescents (as in adults),\u201d Muth said. \u201cOne of the most impactful steps a parent can take to help improve kids\u2019 nutrition is to commit to regular family meals and try to prepare foods at home, as often as possible.\u00a0The more kids are exposed to fruits, vegetables, and fish, the more likely they will try them and like them eventually.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/mediterranean-diet-children-cardiometabolic-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_health_bird-flu-colorado", "text": "A new human case of H5 highly pathogenic avian flu has been identified\u00a0in Colorado, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said Sunday that\u00a0five human cases of bird flu had been detected in poultry workers believed to have caught the bird flu virus through direct work with infected birds. The latest case is from an additional worker from this cohort. The workers had been involved in culling birds, a process used to control the spread of disease by selectively removing or killing infected animals. The six infected workers have experienced mild symptoms, including pink eye and respiratory issues, and all exposed workers have been offered antiviral medication, according to the CDC. Genetic sequencing of a sample from one of the Colorado cases shows that it\u2019s closely related to the first human case of bird flu discovered in Michigan, a sign that the virus has not experienced any changes due to antiviral resistance, according to the agency. These findings are \u201creassuring,\u201d it said Friday. A CDC field team, including epidemiologists, veterinarians, clinicians and an industrial hygienist, is assisting with Colorado\u2019s outbreak investigation. Since April, there have been 10 reported human cases of avian influenza in the US, four linked to exposure to sick dairy cows and six connected to infected poultry, according to the CDC. Friday\u2019s confirmation includes the latest case in Colorado. The virus has affected 18.32 million birds from 34 commercial flocks and 16 backyard flocks since April. The US Department of Agriculture is also reporting a growing number of infected cattle, with confirmed cases in 157 dairy cow herds across 13 states. The organizations say they are working to respond to the ongoing \u201cpublic health challenge\u201d posed by the multistate outbreak of bird flu. In part of this effort, the full sequence of the detected virus has been made available to the public so researchers in the US and around the world can analyze it. In humans, the CDC\u2019s risk assessment for the general public remains low. Poultry products are still safe to eat if they have been properly handled and cooked, the Colorado health department says. The CDC advises that everyone avoid close or long exposure to sick or dead animals, animal poop or bedding. Experts also recommend against\u00a0consuming unpasteurized or raw milk\u00a0due to the potential for contamination.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/health/bird-flu-colorado/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}

The researchers used data from the\u00a0Nurses\u2019 Health Study,\u00a0which included nearly 50,000 women between ages 69 and 96 who completed a six-item\u00a0gratitude questionnaire\u00a0in 2016. By asking participants to rank how strongly they agreed with statements such as \u201cI have so much in life to be thankful for\u201d and \u201cI am grateful to a wide variety of people,\u201d the research team was able to determine the percentage of women who had the highest and lowest feelings of gratitude. When the researchers reviewed the data three years later, they found the women who had the highest levels of gratitude experienced a 9% lower risk of death of any cause, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disease, according to the study published July 3 in the\u00a0journal JAMA Psychiatry. \u201cGratitude is powerful: powerful for happiness, powerful for addressing at least more minor depressive symptoms, powerful for improving health, powerful for protecting against premature death \u2014 and it is something that anyone can do,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Tyler VanderWeele, who is the John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. During the three years of follow-up in the study, there were 4,608 deaths among participants \u2014 2,153 of those were women who reported experiencing the lowest amount of gratitude, while 1,273 deaths were of women who were in the middle tier. There were 1,182 deaths among women who reported the highest amount of gratitude. The study also found those who reported feeling more gratitude were more likely to be slightly younger, have a partner, participate in social or religious groups, or have overall better health. \u201cI think things that are going well in life, whether that\u2019s one\u2019s health or one\u2019s social relationships, (it\u2019s) going to make one more grateful,\u201d said VanderWeele, who is also director of the\u00a0Human Flourishing Program, which aims to study and promote human well-being, and codirector of the\u00a0Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion\u00a0at Harvard. For the analysis of longevity, researchers controlled the data group by comparing similar women who only differed in their gratitude scores, VanderWeele said.\u00a0The researchers controlled for factors such as psychological well-being, health issues and other demographics including social and religious participation. \u201cIt\u2019s still quite meaningful \u2014 even after controlling for social connectedness and other aspects of psychological well-being and a host of baseline health characteristics and money and income and so on \u2014 you\u2019re still finding those who are grateful versus those who are not with about a 10% reduced mortality risk,\u201d VanderWeele said. \u201cThose other things are important, but it doesn\u2019t explain away the whole of the effect of gratitude.\u201d The authors noted in the study that the participants were mostly White, older women in the United States, and future studies with a more representative sample would be needed to find out more on the effects of gratitude and longevity for other demographics. How to practice gratitude \u201cIt\u2019s not completely surprising to me, just given what we know on the health benefits\u00a0of positive emotions\u00a0more generally, that a person\u2019s disposition for gratitude might actually even lengthen their life,\u201d said Dr. Philip Watkins, a professor of psychology at Eastern Washington University and author of the book \u201cGratitude and the Good Life: Toward a Psychology of Appreciation.\u201d Research has found that gratitude benefits individuals\u2019 happiness and flourishing, added Watkins, who was not involved with the new study. Having more gratitude has been linked to improving\u00a0physical health, such as strengthening the\u00a0immune system, lowering blood pressure and benefiting the\u00a0heart. Those who are more grateful also tend to get a better night\u2019s sleep and have\u00a0increased self-esteem\u00a0and lower anxiety, stress and\u00a0depression\u00a0levels. While the new study looked at people who are naturally more grateful, there are ways to practice having more gratitude on a day-to-day basis, said Dr. Emiliana\u00a0Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center \u2014 a research institute that studies the psychology, sociology, and\u00a0neuroscience of well-being\u00a0\u2014 at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for each individual to start from a place of their own comfort zone,\u201d said Simon-Thomas, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cIt is unfair to demand gratitude from anyone if they\u2019re feeling particularly impoverished. But it\u2019s not unfair to point out some of the simple and easy immediate factors that are actually a source of goodness. \u201cIt could be (as simple as) the feeling of warm sun through a window on your shoulder \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of really noticing that there are things around you even in moments that are difficult,\u201d she added. There are three strategies Simon-Thomas recommends for those looking to implement more feelings of gratitude. First, keep a gratitude journal where you can write a few things you are grateful for, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a washing machine in your home, or electric light, or the opportunity to go on a camping trip with friends \u2014 the list could go on.\u201d Another way to practice gratitude is by writing letters to others who have had a positive impact on your life; the sense of gratitude is even more pronounced when those letters are delivered to the other person, Simon-Thomas said. A third way to feel more gratitude is to be more specific when giving out thanks \u2014 when someone gets you a coffee to start your day, instead of just saying, \u201cThank you,\u201d try to extend it to something like, \u201cI really appreciate that you brought me a coffee today, I know you have a lot of other things to do \u2026 and I got a lot of stuff done, because you brought me back coffee,\u201d Simon-Thomas said. There\u2019s no clear consensus on how often one should practice gratitude, Simon-Thomas said. She recommends trying out different methods for what feels right to you. Practicing gratitude is not only key for health and well-being, but it is also important to try to be more grateful because it is a good virtue and can positively affect your relationships, too, Watkins said. Having more gratitude has also been linked to being more optimistic in general, and people who express higher levels of gratitude tend to look more for the good in life, Watkins added. \u201cResearch shows we have a lot more good stuff happen to us than bad stuff, but we very easily focus on the bad stuff,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons gratitude \u2026 and being a grateful person is so important is because they help us have a more balanced view of life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/gratitude-benefits-longer-life-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_tampons-lead-arsenic-plastics-wellness", "text": "The average menstruating person will spend about five years of their total reproductive lifespan using an estimated 11,000 tampons, sanitary pads, panty liners and other menstrual products, experts say. What if some of those menstrual aids contain heavy metals or potentially toxic chemicals linked to chronic diseases and reproductive and developmental problems? Past research has found tampons and other menstrual products may contain chemicals such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS; plasticizers, also known as phthalates; and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, emitted as gas or fragrances from many consumer products. All these chemical groups have been shown to disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine system, which regulates sexual development, metabolism, blood sugar, mood, sleep and more. Recently, a small pilot study found arsenic and lead in organic and nonorganic tampons \u2014 and while the levels were small, there is no safe level of exposure to lead, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, that study was unable to determine whether heavy metals might leach from tampons into the body, thus making any potential health impact unknown, said senior study author Kathrin Schilling, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. \u201cI do not want people to panic, but to be aware that heavy metals have been found in these menstrual products,\u201d Schilling said. \u201cObviously, the next step is to do research that would show if the metals leach from the tampon into the body.\u201d The study was also unable to determine whether any metal, even if released into the body, can be absorbed into the vaginal lining and subsequently into the bloodstream, said Amanda Hils, a spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration, which regulates tampons and other menstrual products as medical devices. \u201cWe plan to evaluate the study closely, and take any action warranted to safeguard the health of consumers who use these products,\u201d Hils said in an email. Vaginal tissue is more permeable than other parts of the body, so if studies were to find that heavy metals \u2014 or worrisome chemicals \u2014 do leach from menstrual products into the body, it could be a significant problem, said Anna Pollack, associate professor of global and community health at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. She was not involved in the pilot study. \u201cI am most concerned with menstrual products that are used inside the body,\u201d said Pollack, who coauthored a review of 10 years of studies on contaminants in tampons, sanitary pads, menstrual cups and other products. \u201cHowever, there is no reason for people to be afraid to use menstrual products at this time,\u201d she added. \u201cI would just be aware of the issue and monitor any research that develops.\u201d Heavy metals in tampons Schilling and her team tested 30 tampons from 14 brands purchased from major online retailers and stores in the United States, United Kingdom and Greece. The researchers conducted a blinded study, so they did not know the brands. The team ran tests for 16 heavy metals: arsenic, barium, calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, strontium, vanadium and zinc. \u201cWe found an average of 100 nanograms per gram of lead, and 2 nanograms per gram of arsenic in the tampons,\u201d Schilling said, \u201cbut there was no detectable level of chromium and no detectable level of mercury, which is very good.\u201d Organic tampons contained higher levels of arsenic, while nonorganic tampons had higher levels of lead, the study found. \u201cThe average lead concentration in\u00a0tampons\u00a0was about 10 times higher than the maximum levels currently allowed in drinking water,\u201d Schilling said, adding that arsenic levels were five times lower than current limits for drinking water. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that arsenic shouldn\u2019t be present in\u00a0tampons\u00a0at all, and we don\u2019t yet understand the effects of vaginal exposure since it hasn\u2019t been studied,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no safe level of lead exposure, and it has been shown to cause reproductive health issues in women.\u201d How did detectable levels of these heavy metals get into tampons in the first place? First, most tampons are made of cotton or a mixture of cotton and rayon, a semi-synthetic fiber made from\u00a0wood pulp. Arsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, while lead and other heavy metals are a natural part of Earth\u2019s crust \u2014 so plants can easily absorb metals as they develop. Additional chemicals found in menstrual products The soil and water of the United States and other parts of the world are also heavily contaminated with both metals and chemicals used to produce plastic products, experts say. Heavy metals can be byproducts of manufacturing plants, mining facilities and smelting processes, while PFAS and other chemicals enter the air, soil and groundwater from human waste, consumer products discarded in landfills and byproducts from fluorochemical manufacturing plants. Nearly half of the drinking water in the US is contaminated with some of the 12,000 types of PFAS, according to an August 2023 study by the US Geological Survey. Chemicals called phthalates have been discovered in sanitary pads, panty liners and tampons, according to Pollack\u2019s review. Phthalates are in consumer products such as shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys and have been linked to\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and undescended testes\u00a0in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and\u00a0testosterone levels\u00a0in adult males. Both phthalates and PFAS have also been linked to the rise in early menarche in teens and preteens. In 2022, advocacy groups Mamavation and Environmental Health News, in collaboration with the Institute for Green Science\u00a0at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, looked at levels of PFAS in menstrual products. The investigation found 48%\u00a0of sanitary pads, incontinence pads and tested panty liners contained PFAS, as did\u00a022%\u00a0of tampons and\u00a065%\u00a0of period underwear. Manufacturers use PFAS, often called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they\u00a0do not easily break down\u00a0in the environment, in\u00a0food packaging\u00a0to prevent grease and water from soaking through food wrappers and beverage cups. The chemicals are also used to make carpeting, clothing and furniture resistant to stains, water and grease damage. A February 2023 study found PFAS may alter hormonal and metabolic pathways needed for growth and development in young children, teens and young adults. PFAS chemicals have also been linked to an increased risk of adult kidney cancer and abnormally high cholesterol levels and decreased antibody response to vaccines in both adults and children. However, the mere presence of a chemical is not an indication of risk or adverse effect, according to the American Chemistry Council, an industry association. \u201cAs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0emphasizes, \u2018The measurement of an environmental chemical in a person\u2019s blood or urine is a measure of exposure; it does not by itself mean that the chemical causes disease or an adverse effect,\u2019\u201d a spokesperson for the council told CNN. How to protect yourself Tampon makers and the FDA recommend that tampons not be used at night or for longer than eight hours due to a greater risk of toxic shock syndrome, a deadly bacterial infection that can cause organ failure and death if not treated. That advice also applies to anyone concerned about heavy metals or chemicals in their menstrual products, said Nancy King Reame, professor emerita of health promotion and risk reduction at the School of Nursing at Columbia University Medical Center. \u201cBut because the vaginal microbiome, including menstrual fluid, is the least understood organ system in the body, real world advice on the use of period products based on these findings is premature to say the least,\u201d said Reame, who assisted on the tampon study. Other recommendations include washing your hands before and after inserting or removing a tampon to reduce bacterial spread, changing tampons every four to eight hours and using the lowest absorbency possible. \u201cIf you can wear one tampon up to eight hours without changing it, the absorbency may be too high,\u201d the FDA noted on its website. Signs of toxic shock, which include a sudden high fever, diarrhea, dizziness, vomiting or a rash that looks like a sunburn, need immediate medical attention. In addition, \u201cif you have discomfort, pain or other unexpected symptoms like unusual discharge when trying to insert or wear a tampon, or if you have an allergic reaction, stop using tampons and contact your provider,\u201d the FDA said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/tampons-lead-arsenic-plastics-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_travel_camp-stove-cooking-wellness", "text": "You know what I love doing in the summer? I\u2019ll give you three things: \u2022 Taking road trip vacations\u2022 Eating well on my road trips\u2022 Not going over my food budget while on a road trip That last one is a little tricky to pull off because \u2014 and I admit this might be an obvious statement \u2014 the cost of eating adds up over the course of a vacation. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who loves to fill up on a big, leisurely brunch, finding affordable but memorable options for every meal during a long trip can be challenging. I used to make do with deli sandwiches and brought-from-home snacks, but now I have a secret weapon for quick but satisfying road trip lunches: my Coleman camp stove. Despite my outdoorsy hippie reputation among friends, this was the first time I dove into cooking on an outdoor propane stove before renting a camper van for a cross-country trip with my husband on Route 66. But once we were on the road and figured out the logistics of our travel routine, I realized the stove\u2019s versatility and utility, not to mention the genuine fun of being able to cook lunch on the go. With a two-burner stove and pump sink in the back of our camper van, we could pull over and cook lunch pretty much anywhere during each day\u2019s adventures. I made pesto rotini in the parking lot of Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s historic home in Missouri, flipped grilled cheese sandwiches in a local park in Baxter Springs, Kansas, and slurped up cheesy zoodles outside the Painted Desert Inn in Petrified Forest National Park. Now I\u2019m a seasoned outdoor cook and have invested in a full mini kitchen setup for my camping excursions. I\u2019ve fallen in love with camp stove cooking so much that I now bring it with us on most of our summer road trips \u2014 whether we\u2019re camping or not. Coupled with my trusty 10-inch cast-iron skillet, the camp stove gives me a way to save a few bucks and eat well during the day so we can have a big dinner out. I might get a few stares in hotel parking lots and patio areas, but it\u2019s worth it for the convenience and reassurance of a good meal while sticking to my frugal budget. Hey, I own all these items already \u2014 why not use them? My road-trip stove setup Along with my stove and skillet, I also bring a few basic tools for cooking and cleaning. I keep a crate packed with the following: \u2022 Metal tongs\u2022 Fish spatula (slotted spatula)\u2022 Silicone spoonula\u2022 Silicone trivet\u2022 Olive oil (in a small squeeze bottle)\u2022 Kosher salt\u2022 Bar towels\u2022 Washcloth\u2022 Laundry tub\u2022 Castile soap Because I\u2019m using a propane stove, I only cook in well-ventilated outdoor areas and bring a foldable metal table to make sure there is a safe cooking surface no matter where I\u2019ll be. Keep meals simple with pre-prepped ingredients Simplicity is the key to easy camp stove lunches. When I\u2019m planning these meals, I don\u2019t want to complicate my prep with anything that requires chopping on-site. Remember, all equipment needs to be washed in your hotel bathroom, so this is no time to get fancy. To accomplish this, I turn to pre-prepped ingredients, a departure from my usual higher-maintenance home cooking. However, these items are easy to find in many US grocery stores, so they don\u2019t need to be packed in advance. With these versatile building blocks, I can make a variety of meals. I start with a base of shelf-stable carbs, such as bagged, ready-to-eat pasta, rice or grain blends. Protein comes in the form of beans, whether canned or bagged, frozen mini meatballs or seasoned tofu or seitan from the refrigerated section. The frozen and refrigerated produce sections offer a cornucopia of quick-cooking vegetable choices, including zoodles, cauliflower rice and stir-fry blends, pre-chopped onions and peppers, green beans, snap peas, baby spinach, and broccoli florets. Sauces can be as varied as pesto, marinara, salsa, salad dressings, or simply a bit of butter and salt. I\u2019ve also been known to bring some cheese powder from my pantry to make a macaroni and cheese meal as well. Don\u2019t forget that a one-skillet meal can also be as easy as a quesadilla, nachos, flatbreads or a homemade grilled cheese that beats the pants off a basic cold deli sandwich. Mix and match these ingredients and find the fun in cooking outdoors on your camp stove for your next road trip.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/travel/camp-stove-cooking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_long-term-care-residents-texas-power-outage-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "As Tina Kitzmiller sat inside her sweltering apartment, windows and doors open in the hope of catching even the slightest breeze, she was frustrated and worried for her dog and her neighbors. It had been days since Hurricane Beryl blew ashore from the Gulf of Mexico on July 8, causing widespread destruction and knocking out power to more than 2 million people, including the Houston senior independent living facility where Kitzmiller lives. Outdoor temperatures had reached at least 90 degrees most days, and the heat inside the building was stifling. Kitzmiller moved there not long ago with Kai, her 12-year-old dog, shortly after riding out 90-plus-mph winds from a\u00a0May derecho\u00a0under a comforter on the floor of the 33-foot RV she called home. She didn\u2019t need medical care, as a nursing home would offer, and thought she and Kai could be safer at an independent senior facility than in the RV. She assumed her new home would have an emergency power system in place at least equivalent to that of the post offices she\u2019d worked in for 35 years. \u201cI checked out the food. I checked out the activities,\u201d said Kitzmiller, 61, now retired. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I needed to inquire about a generator.\u201d Even after multiple incidents of extreme weather \u2014 including a\u00a02021 Texas winter storm\u00a0that caused widespread blackouts and prompted a\u00a0U.S. Senate investigation\u00a0\u2014 not much has changed for those living in long-term care facilities when natural disasters strike in Texas or elsewhere. \u201cThere has been some movement, but I think it\u2019s been way too slow,\u201d said\u00a0David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWe keep getting tested and we keep failing the test. But I do think we are going to have to face this issue.\u201d A power outage can be difficult for anyone, but older adults are especially vulnerable to temperature extremes, with medications or medical conditions affecting their bodies\u2019\u00a0ability to regulate heat\u00a0and\u00a0cold. Additionally, some medications need\u00a0refrigeration while others cannot get too cold. Federal guidelines require nursing homes to maintain safe indoor temperatures but do not regulate how. For example, facilities face no requirement that generators or other alternative energy sources support heating and air conditioning systems. States are largely responsible for compliance, Grabowski said, and if states are failing in that regard, change doesn\u2019t happen. Furthermore, while nursing homes face such federal oversight, lower-care-level facilities that provide some medical care \u2014 known as assisted living \u2014 are regulated at the state level, so the rules for emergency preparedness vary widely. Some states have toughened those guidelines. Maryland\u00a0adopted rules for generators\u00a0in assisted living facilities following Hurricane Isabel, which left more than 1.2 million residents in the state without power in 2003. Florida\u00a0did so for nursing homes and assisted living facilities\u00a0in 2018, after Hurricane Irma led to deaths at one facility. But Texas has not. And no requirements for generators exist in Texas for the roughly 2,000 assisted living facilities or the even less regulated independent living sites, like Kitzmiller\u2019s. Generally, apartment complexes marketed to senior citizens, known in the industry as independent living facilities, don\u2019t have any special regulations in Texas and many other states. Nationally, assisted living facilities and independent living facilities have been the fastest-growing sectors in senior living. Residents at such facilities often have medical needs, Grabowski said, but for a variety of reasons have chosen to live in an environment that allows more independence than a nursing home, which would provide medical care. That doesn\u2019t mean the residents in these lower-care-level facilities are any less susceptible to extreme temperatures when the power goes out. \u201cIf you\u2019re overwhelmed by the heat in your apartment, that\u2019s unsafe,\u201d he said. Republican state Rep.\u00a0Ed Thompson\u00a0tried several times since 2020 to pass legislation requiring assisted living facilities in Texas to have backup generators. But the bills failed. He is not seeking reelection this year. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible what the state of Texas is doing,\u201d said Thompson, blaming corporate greed and politicians more interested in stirring up their base and raising their national profile than improving the lives of Texans. \u201cHow we treat our elderly says something about us \u2014 and they\u2019re not being treated right.\u201d Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said at\u00a0a July 11 press conference\u00a0that senior facility operators are accountable if they do not keep residents safe. \u201cThat location is responsible for the health, safety, and welfare of the patients and residents that are there,\u201d he\u00a0told reporters. \u201cIt is that facility\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Under\u00a0Texas law, power restoration is supposed to be prioritized for nursing, assisted living, and hospice facilities. The resistance to adding oversight or more governmental protections has not surprised\u00a0Gregory Shelley, a senior manager at the Harris County Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program at UTHealth Houston\u2019s Cizik School of Nursing. He said that while he believes the safety and health of residents are paramount, he recognizes that installing generators is expensive. He also said some people within the industry continue to believe extreme events are rare. \u201cBut all of us in Houston this year already learned that they\u2019re happening more frequently,\u201d Shelley said. \u201cThis is already the third time since May that big portions of Houston have been without power for long periods of time.\u201d After the 2021 blackouts, Texas\u2019 Health and Human Services Commission conducted a\u00a0voluntary survey\u00a0that found 47% of the assisted living and 99% of the nursing care facilities that responded reported having generators. The U.S. Senate investigation following the 2021 Texas storm recommended a national requirement that assisted living facilities have emergency power supplies to both maintain safe temperatures and keep medical equipment running. A\u00a02023 annual report\u00a0from Texas\u2019 long-term care ombudsman, Patty Ducayet, also recommended requiring generators at assisted living centers. The report suggested that all long-term care facilities maintain safe temperatures in a location that can be accessed by every resident. The report recommended requiring assisted living facilities to annually submit emergency response plans to state regulators to be reviewed by state officials. The recommendations have not been adopted. On July 15 \u2014 more than a week after Beryl hit \u2014 Kitzmiller said she just wanted the power back on. She praised the staff at her facility but said she worried for residents who were isolated on her building\u2019s second and third floors, which were hotter amid the outage. Some were unable to keep required medicine refrigerated, she said. And without functioning elevators, many couldn\u2019t get to the first floor, where it was cooler. Mostly, Kitzmiller said, she was frustrated with companies and politicians who hadn\u2019t yet fixed the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s their mothers, their grandmothers, and their family in these homes, these facilities,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I can think is \u2018Shame on you.\u2019\u201d KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 an independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/long-term-care-residents-texas-power-outage-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_science_ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white", "text": "During the Cretaceous Period, a genus of sharks roamed the sea with rows of unusual teeth. Mostly large and rounded, these chompers were not meant to slice through their prey, but to grind and crush shelled creatures. However, since the sharks\u2019 presence in the fossil record has mostly consisted of isolated teeth, scientists have been left to speculate on what the rest of this ancient predator looked like since its\u00a0discovery in the 18th century. Now, remains uncovered from limestone quarries in northeastern Mexico are finally giving researchers a clearer idea of the shark\u2019s appearance, including one fossil that shows almost all skeletal elements and an outline of the specimen\u2019s soft-tissue body. The find also reveals where the genus, known as Ptychodus, sat on the shark evolutionary tree, and other previously unknown traits of this \u201clong-standing enigma,\u201d according to a study published in April in the journal\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. \u201cThe finding of the skeletal remains in Mexico not only allow us to unite these teeth that have been searching for a long time for a skeleton, but also allow us as scientists to revise our previous hypotheses regarding its biology and relationships and see what we got right and what we got wrong,\u201d said study coauthor\u00a0Dr. Eduardo Villalobos Segura, an assistant professor in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna, Austria, in an email. The discovery also provides insight into the evolutionary history of sharks found in our oceans today, experts say. Ancient relative of the great white shark Most species of Ptychodus lived between 100 and 80 million years ago during the\u00a0late Cretaceous period. The deposits in which the fossils were discovered \u2014 in Nuevo Le\u00f3n near the municipality of Vallecillo \u2014 date back to\u00a0approximately 93.9 to 91.85 million\u00a0years ago, Villalobos Segura said. Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage, they do not fossilize well, typically leaving archaeologists only teeth and few skeletal remains to find. But evidence suggests the\u00a0Nuevo Le\u00f3n fossils ended up in mostly stagnant conditions that would have allowed for an oxygen-deficient zone, resulting in the preservation of the soft skeletons, Villalobos Segura said. In the study, the researchers analyzed six fossils found at the site, including the complete specimen. Three other fossils were almost complete, and two were incomplete. With these remains, the study authors determined that Ptychodus belonged to the order of sharks known as Lamniformes, or mackerel sharks, the same group that the extinct\u00a0Otodus megalodon\u00a0and the modern great white shark belong to. Lamniformes also includes the modern species of megamouth, sand, goblin and basking sharks,\u00a0among others. \u201cPresent-day\u00a0sharks represent just a vanishingly minimal portion of the astonishing biodiversity that occurred throughout their entire evolutionary history (spanning almost 400 million years) \u2026 studying fossil\u00a0sharks is crucial to understand fully the evolutionary phenomena related to current groups,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Manuel Amadori, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna in Austria, in an email. The existence of mackerel sharks with crushing teeth was unknown until now, Amadori said. \u201cThere is still much more to discover, but we can say that we have taken another important step forward in understanding the complex evolutionary history of mackerel sharks,\u201d he added. The outline of the body, which revealed the shark\u2019s shape and fin location, also provides evidence that the prehistoric fish was not just a bottom-dweller as previously believed, but instead, a fast-swimming predator that might have hunted and eaten sea turtles and large ammonites instead of only eating mollusks found on the ocean floor, according to the study authors. Although the shark\u2019s exact diet is still unknown, the researchers suggest that this revised hypothesis about what it ate could be a hint at the cause of Ptychodus\u2019 extinction, since it puts the shark in competition with other Late Cretaceous marine predators with similar diets. \u201cWithout a complete specimen (hard evidence), what was known about Ptychodus beyond the teeth was largely scientific guesswork,\u201d said Michael Everhart, an adjunct curator of paleontology at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas, and an expert on\u00a0Late Cretaceous marine fossils, in an email. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThe new specimens answer questions that go back 180+ years to the 1830s when\u00a0Louis Agassiz\u00a0(an early renowned scientist and paleontologist)\u00a0first coined the name Ptychodus,\u201d which means rugous or\u00a0wrinkled tooth, Everhart added. Massive shell-crushing sharks The findings also suggested that the largest species of Ptychodus may have been slightly smaller than previously thought, reaching a maximum length of 9.7 meters (nearly 32 feet). Previous estimates of a species known as Ptychodus mortoni put it at 11.2 meters (nearly 37 feet), but the revised size is still larger than modern apex shark predators, the authors note in the study. Great whites today reach up to\u00a06 meters (20 feet)\u00a0in length. There are modern shell-crushing species, the largest being the Zebra shark, which reaches a maximum length of a little over 3.5 meters (12 feet) \u2014 not near as gigantic as Ptychodus. \u201cThe crushing teeth together with the gigantic size make Ptychodus a very unique shark,\u201d Amadori said. \u201c(In the fossil record) some teeth are massive, polygonal and almost flat, while others have strange, rounded protuberances or pointed cusps on the top surface. All these were joined together to form massive tooth plates, which this predator of the past could have used to crush almost anything it encountered.\u201d A new fossil revealing the complete side view of Ptychodus measured nearly 1.5 meters (about 5 feet) in length, suggesting it was from was of a much smaller shark. This could be due to the remains belonging to a younger shark, or because the Ptychodus genus included various species of different sizes, Villalobos Segura said. According to the nonprofit Mindat.org database, there are 22 species of Ptychodus currently known. Most species and individuals of Ptychodus were likely smaller than the largest Ptychodus mortoni specimen discovered, but there could also be the possibility of larger species yet to be found, Everhart said. Often, researchers can tell apart the different species of Ptychodus by varying features in the teeth, but the study authors were unable to identify which\u00a0species of Ptychodus\u00a0the six fossils studied belonged to due to the teeth being too worn down, Villalobos Segura said. The researchers said they hope future research reveals more about the ancient shark, including its diet and its role in past marine food chains and ecosystems. \u201c(The April study) is a comprehensive review of some remarkably complete fossils of the strange Cretaceous shark, Ptychodus,\u201d said Dr. Bretton Kent, an emeritus principal lecturer in the department of entomology at the University of Maryland, who has\u00a0studied and lectured\u00a0on the diversification of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). He was not involved in the study. \u201cOur present world can act like a set of blinders, limiting the scope of possible lifestyles we can envision for extinct animals. \u2026 Modern durophagous sharks (that consume hard-shelled organisms) are demersal, feeding on or near the bottom. And their bodies are frequently small and not particularly streamlined. So a gigantic, streamlined, high speed durophage that was much larger than a modern great white shark is quite remarkable,\u201d Kent added, in an email.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/science/ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_988-suicide-lifeline-numbers", "text": "Two years after the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched, the service has answered over 10 million texts, calls and chats, according to new data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The lifeline, formerly a 10-digit number, transitioned to three digits in July 2022 as part of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s\u00a0strategy\u00a0to \u201caddress our national mental health crisis.\u201d Since 2022, the administration has invested over $1.5 billion in the effort, including expanding access to services for Spanish speakers, LGBTQI+ youth and young adults, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing, according to HHS. Those in crisis can reach the lifeline through a phone call, text, web chat and video chat. This year, text messages to 988 have increased 51% and calls 34% from the year before, a sign of the effects of expanded services, according to senior administration officials. Last year,\u00a0text messages through the lifeline increased 1,135%, chats answered increased 141% and calls answered increased 46%, a report from the department showed. The lifeline has made 110,000 contacts in Spanish and 475,000 with LGBTQI+ youth and young adults this year, the new report says. About 20,000 videophone contacts in American Sign Language were made, and 1.2 million calls were answered by the Veterans Crisis Line through 988\u2019s Press 1 option. \u201c988 is available to everyone,\u201d emphasized Andrea Palm, deputy secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cHaving someone on the other end of the line to listen and provide support makes a difference. It really does save lives, and that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d This year, HHS expects to roll out georouting technology to route 988 callers and texters based on their physical location versus their area code, the agency says. The move, which would follow an April\u00a0proposal\u00a0from the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to improve cell phone users\u2019 connectivity to local services and maintain additional privacy. The agency also pointed to the bolstering of a national backup system. Funneling federal funding to this system will help ensure that all contacts to 988 are able to be answered, regardless of a state\u2019s local capacity. A 911 for mental health crises In 2022, the year 988 debuted, suicide deaths reached a\u00a0record high\u00a0in the US, according to provisional\u00a0data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, the US surgeon general called for the implementation of a national prevention strategy in response to suicide rates that have been rising for decades. 988, like 911, is easy to remember. The switch to the three-digit lifeline saw an over\u00a045% increase\u00a0in overall contact volume in just the first month, according to HHS. \u201cTo remember 10 digits to call for help is not easy. That\u2019s why 911 is only three digits.\u201d said Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer at the National Alliance on Mental Illness or NAMI. \u201cTransitioning to a shorter number and a number that is focused on our wider array of mental health crises, not just suicide, opens up the door for people to reach out and be connected to the support they need.\u201d The hundreds of thousands of people who have contacted 988 in the past two years and the growth in its usage reflect the need for increased mental health services nationwide, she said. Behind the numbers Despite 988\u2019s growth, 3 in 4 Americans say they are not content with mental health treatment in this country, a July poll from the National Alliance on Mental Illness found. The NAMI/Ipsos poll also found that only 23% percent of Americans say they are familiar with 988. This is an increase from 17% in June 2023 but has not changed since October. \u201cWe need that number much higher,\u201d Wesolowski said. \u201cThis data speaks to the urgency of having awareness so people who need help can get connected to that help.\u201d However, the poll showed 72% of Americans said they are comfortable contacting the lifeline. Of those who had contacted 988 this year or whose loved one had done so, nearly 7 in 10 said they had received some or all of the help they needed. This sentiment is up 55% from June 2023, according to NAMI. HHS is prioritizing raising awareness about the lifeline and emphasizing that 988 is available not only for crises but for anytime someone needs to talk, according to senior administration officials. What happens when you contact 988 When someone calls 988, they first hear a greeting message. They are given the option to connect with specialized services and subsequently routed to a national network or local 988 Lifeline network crisis center. According to the\u00a0Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a trained crisis counselor answers the phone, listens to the caller, works to understand how the problem is affecting them, provides support and shares resources, if needed. Similarly, users can receive care through texting 988, an increasingly popular option. On a call with reporters Tuesday, Palm shared anecdotes from the progress the lifeline has made, emphasizing the real-life impact of the calls that make up this year\u2019s 988 data. \u201cA really important point are countless stories of real people whose lives have been changed forever,\u201d she said, sharing the story of Florida 988 counselor Kelly, who joined the service after losing her 18-year-old son to suicide. \u201cShe believes that if 988 had been in existence for her son, that it would have saved his life,\u201d Palm said. After the call The lifeline has reached millions in crisis since its debut, but what happens after they hang up the phone? Although the vast majority of calls do not escalate to emergency services being dispatched, users who need more help than can be provided over the phone or by chat may be contacted by local services, including mobile crisis and law enforcement teams. \u201cWe know [a police response] is not the best response for people in crisis,\u201d Wesolowski said, pointing to the need for mental health professionals to respond to cases of mental health crisis. According to senior administration officials, one of the goals of the lifeline is to divert from unnecessary police response and to ensure that users are safe while providing support based on individual needs, something that may require coordination between 988 and law enforcement. Next steps for 988 According to Palm, the administration still has more work to do to reach people who need help. \u201cNot everyone can access the support they need. And in other cases, stigma prevents them from reaching out at all,\u201d she said. Studies have shown that after speaking with a trained crisis counselor, most callers feel more hopeful and less depressed, suicidal and overwhelmed. Collaboration on the federal and state level for continued support of 988 is necessary for the success of the program to continue this impact, according to Palm and senior administration officials. \u201cIn the two years since we launched 988, it\u2019s become one of the most effective first line responses that we have to help individuals who feel alone and without options,\u201d she said. \u201cMake no mistake, 988 saves lives,\u201d Neera Tanden, White House domestic policy adviser, said on Tuesday\u2019s call. \u201cAs a country, we have a moral obligation to be there for each other, to reach out to offer help for just a listening ear.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/988-suicide-lifeline-numbers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_health_cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness", "text": "About 40% of new cancer cases among adults ages 30 and older in the United States \u2014 and nearly half of deaths \u2014\u00a0could be attributed to preventable risk factors, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society. \u201cThese are things that people can practically change how they live every single day to reduce their risk of cancer,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Arif\u00a0Kamal, chief patient officer with the American Cancer Society. Smoking was the leading risk factor by far, the study found, contributing to nearly 1 in 5 cancer cases and nearly a third of cancer deaths. Other key risk factors included excess body weight, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, diet and infections such as HPV. Overall, researchers analyzed 18 modifiable risk factors across 30 types of cancer. In 2019, these lifestyle factors were linked to more than 700,000 new cancer cases and more than 262,000 deaths, the study found. Cancer grows because of DNA damage or because it has a fuel source, Kamal said. Other things \u2014 such as genetics or environmental factors \u2014 can also create these biological conditions, but modifiable risks explain a significantly larger share of cancer cases and deaths than any other known factors. Exposure to sunlight can damage DNA and lead to skin cancer, for example, while fat cells produce hormones that can feed certain cancers. \u201cWith cancer, it oftentimes feels like you have no control,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cPeople think about bad luck or bad genetics, but people need to feel a sense of control and agency.\u201d Certain cancers are more preventable than others, the new study suggests. But modifiable risk factors contributed to more than half of new cases for 19 of the 30 types of cancer evaluated. There were 10 types of cancer where modifiable risk factors could be attributed to at least 80% of new cases, including more than 90% of melanoma cases linked to ultraviolet radiation and nearly all cases of cervical cancer linked to HPV infection, which can be prevented with a vaccine. Lung cancer had the largest number of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors \u2014 more than 104,000 cases among men and 97,000 among women \u2014 and the vast majority were linked to smoking. After smoking, excess body weight was the second largest contributor to cancer cases, linked to about 5% of new cases in men and nearly 11% of cases in women. It was associated with more than\u00a0a third of deaths from cancer\u00a0of the endometrium, gallbladder, esophagus, liver and kidney, the new study found. Another recent study found that the risk for certain cancers was significantly reduced for people taking popular weight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy. \u201cObesity is emerging, in some ways, as just as potent of a risk for people as smoking is,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. He was not involved in the new study, but has prior experience working on cancer prevention initiatives. Intervening on a set of \u201ccore behavioral risk factors\u201d \u2014 quitting smoking, eating well and exercising, for example \u2014 can make a \u201cdramatic difference in the rates and outcomes of chronic diseases,\u201d Plescia said. And cancer is one of those chronic diseases, just like heart disease or diabetes. Policymakers and health officials should work to \u201ccreate environments where it\u2019s easier for people, where the healthy choice is the easy choice,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s particularly important for people who are living in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods, where it might not be safe to exercise or easy to get to a store with healthy food. As rates of early-onset cancer rise in the US, it\u2019s especially important to create healthy habits early, experts say. It\u2019s harder to quit smoking once you\u2019ve started or lose weight that you\u2019ve gained. But \u201cit\u2019s never too late to make these changes,\u201d Plescia said. \u201cTurning (health behaviors) around later in life can make a profound difference.\u201d And making lifestyle changes to minimize exposure to certain factors can reduce cancer risk relatively quickly, experts say. \u201cCancer is something your body fights every single day as your cells divide,\u201d Kamal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that you face every day, and that also means that the reduction of the risks can benefit you every day as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/health/cancer-cases-deaths-preventable-factors-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_health_deli-meat-listeria-outbreak", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning Friday about a deadly multistate listeria outbreak connected to deli meat. Two people have died, the agency said in an investigation notice, and at least 28 have had to be hospitalized. However, the CDC says the true number of people who are sick is probably higher than what\u2019s been reported because some may have had a milder form of the illness and not been tested for listeria. There\u2019s also a lag time between when an illness happens and when scientists can connect it with an ongoing investigation. Seven illnesses have been reported in New York; six in Maryland; two each in Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey and Virginia; and one each in Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The deaths were reported in Illinois and New Jersey. Of the 18 people whom state and local public health experts were able to interview, 16 reported eating meats sliced at a deli in the month before they got sick. There are no reports of people getting sick after eating packaged deli meat. It\u2019s not exactly clear what meat is to blame for the listeria in this outbreak, the CDC says. The CDC and the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service are investigating, but no recalls have been issued. Most people who were sick reported eating turkey or liverwurst, and some reported eating ham. The meat came from a variety of grocery store delis. Tests using DNA fingerprinting showed that the bacteria from sick people was genetically similar, suggesting that they probably caught the bacteria from the same food. The timeline of this outbreak stretches over several months, the CDC said. The first person got sick at the end of May, and the most recent case reported being sick on July 5. Listeria bacteria can cause listeriosis, the\u00a0third leading cause\u00a0of death from foodborne illness in the United States. Symptoms usually include fever, muscle aches and fatigue. Infection may also cause a headache, a stiff neck, confusion or seizures. Pregnant people may have pregnancy loss or premature birth. Listeria can spread easily at delis, the CDC says, transferring from equipment to surfaces to hands and food. Refrigeration does not kill the bacteria, but heat can. People who are pregnant, those who are 65 and older, and those with weakened immune systems are advised to avoid eating deli meat unless it\u2019s been heated until it steams or reaches an internal temperature of 165 F. If you\u2019ve had sliced deli meat at home, clean the refrigerator and any containers or surfaces that may have come into contact with it. Anyone who develops symptoms of listeriosis should get medical care right away. The CDC is also encouraging people who get sick with listeria to work with local public health officials, who may get in touch to find out what they ate in the past month and may ask for receipts or leftover food to help pinpoint the root of the outbreak.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/health/deli-meat-listeria-outbreak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_science_fireball-sighting-sonic-boom-nyc-nj", "text": "A meteor bright enough to be spotted in broad daylight streaked across the sky on Tuesday morning, catching the attention of several East Coasters who documented their sightings. The fireball, defined as a meteor\u00a0brighter than the planet Venus, is estimated to have soared over New York City before traversing a short path southwest and disintegrating about 31 miles (50 kilometers) above Mountainside, New Jersey, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA\u2019s Meteoroid Environment Office. The meteor was likely about 1 foot (0.3 meter) in diameter, which would have made the rock bright enough to see during the day, Cooke said. Spying a meteor of this size is a rarer occurrence than catching sight of the smaller particles a few millimeters (less than an inch) in size typically seen in the night sky. The American Meteor Society received over 40 reports of a fireball sighting at around 11:15 a.m. ET over New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and a few other states in the US Northeast. The society confirmed that two videos submitted to AMS included footage of the fireball. One clip came from a home security camera in Wayne, New Jersey, and the other from a dedicated meteor camera system positioned in Northford, Connecticut. During the same time eyewitnesses said they observed the fireball, several other spectators reported a loud sound as well as shaking in the area. A meteor can make an explosive sound when the rock breaks apart into smaller pieces, creating a \u201cpressure wave,\u201d Cooke said. This type of fracturing could also have caused the ground to shake. But NASA cannot confirm whether the meteor\u2019s appearance was linked to these two events, since infrasound detectors used to pick up low-frequency sound in the area were oversaturated by military activity simultaneously happening in the south, he added. Did the fireball leave behind meteorites? It\u2019s also possible for a meteor to travel fast enough to create a sonic boom if fragments survive entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and reach the lower layer, said Robert Lunsford, the fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society. \u201cWhen sounds are heard from a fireball, this indicates that some fragments survived down to the lower atmosphere and may have left small remnants of the original fireball on the ground. These remnants are traveling much faster than the speed of sound,\u201d Lunsford said in an email. However, this fireball likely did not create any meteorites, the term for a meteoroid that makes it to the ground, as it had disintegrated in the sky due to its size and speed, Cooke said. The last fireball reported in daylight over the area was about a year and a half ago, Cooke said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a maybe once a year\u2013type occurrence,\u201d but the timing of the fireball was ideal to spark a lot of attention, he added. \u201cPeople were out walking, doing their daily lunchtime thing, and all of a sudden this streak flashed across the sky \u2014 it was in the right place and the right time.\u201d If sky-gazers are looking to catch more glimpses of fireballs, there are several meteor showers set to peak within the next few weeks. The Southern Delta Aquariids could offer a sight of 20 meteors per hour at the end of July, and the Perseids could bring upward of 100 meteors per hour in mid-August, according to the\u00a0American Meteor Society.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/science/fireball-sighting-sonic-boom-nyc-nj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_long-covid-risk", "text": "With a summer wave of Covid-19 infections sweeping the country, a timely new study has looked at the risk of getting long Covid and whether those odds have changed over time. It found that the likelihood of developing long Covid has dropped since the start of the pandemic but remains substantial, especially for people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against the coronavirus. About 7% of American adults, roughly 18 million people, have ever had long Covid, according to an analysis by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that was published in June.\u00a0Harvard economist David Cutler estimated in 2022 that the total cost of long Covid to the nation was $3.7 trillion, or 17% of the country\u2019s pre-Covid gross domestic product. The new study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggests that the human and financial toll will only grow.\u00a0The investigation leaned on computers and advanced machine learning to sift through the data in millions of medical records maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis and the VA Health System set out to find people who caught Covid over different points in the pandemic \u2013 before vaccines were available, during the period when the Delta variant was dominating transmission and after the Omicron family of variants entered the picture \u2013 to see whether the risk of lingering symptoms related to long Covid had changed. They also considered vaccination status. People were considered vaccinated if they\u2019d had at least their initial series of shots and unvaccinated if they had not. The study included more than 441,000 people who caught Covid-19 between March 2020 and the end of January 2022 and who lived at least 30 days after infection. Their records were compared with those of more than 4.7 million people who didn\u2019t catch Covid but who were seen at the VA for other reasons over the same time period. The researchers found that in the first year, when the ancestral coronavirus strain was circulating and there was little immunity against the virus, 1 out of every 10 people who caught Covid went on to have symptoms consistent with long Covid. Symptoms were counted across 10 disease categories as part of long Covid if they were new and developed between 30 days and a year after an initial Covid infection. Vaccines were a game-changer, cutting the risk of long Covid by half during the Delta wave, which struck in the summer of 2021. The risk remained high during Delta for people who were not vaccinated, however. Roughly 10% continued to have symptoms that lingered after their initial infection. During Omicron, which started after Thanksgiving in 2021, 3.5% of people who were vaccinated went on to develop long Covid after the acute phase of infection, while 7.7% of people who were unvaccinated did. The study has some limitations.\u00a0People treated at the VA are mostly White men, so the study population isn\u2019t as diverse as the general population, and its findings may not apply to everyone. For example, a recent study found that nearly 1 in 10 people who get Covid-19 for the first time while pregnant will go on to develop long Covid, an incidence that may be higher than in the general population. The new study doesn\u2019t account for possible differences in people who stopped after their primary series of Covid-19 vaccines and those who went on to get recommended boosters to keep their immunity up to date as the virus mutated over time. It also doesn\u2019t consider the immunity that people might develop after infection and reinfection, although that\u2019s a question senior study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, who is chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, said he is looking into as a follow-up. Al-Aly estimates that nearly three-quarters of the drop in long Covid risk since the early days of the pandemic can be attributed to vaccines. Although the cause or causes of long Covid symptoms aren\u2019t completely understood, there\u2019s some evidence that people with long Covid continue to have active virus hiding out in their bodies long after their initial infections. \u201cVaccines actually help your immune system to get rid of the virus,\u201d Al-Aly said. \u201cThey help the immune system suppress the viral load and clear the virus faster.\u201d The importance of vaccination is a key takeaway from the study, said Dr. Hector Bonilla, who is co-director of Stanford\u2019s Post-Acute Covid-19 Syndrome Clinic. Bonilla said that when Covid vaccines first became available, most people were eager to get vaccinated, and doctors saw a large drop in the number of new patients coming to them with lingering symptoms. Now, instead of a flood, they have more of a steady influx of new patients at his clinic, some of whom develop long Covid after a second or third infection. \u201cLong Covid is a bad illness,\u201d Bonilla said. And many people are caught off-guard when they experience it. But at this point, most have made their minds up about whether to stay up-to-date with their shots. He says more people need to understand that vaccination is a critical way to lower long Covid risk. \u201cVaccination is still a very important piece to prevent long Covid symptoms,\u201d Bonilla said. After the impact of vaccination, the study says, the other 30% of the drop in risk over time is probably to due to changes in the virus itself. \u201cThe virus is changing, is evolving, and it has, even among unvaccinated people, led to less risk of long Covid-19 over time than the original or the very early era of the pandemic,\u201d Al-Aly said. So according to the latest data, about 3 people out of 100 who are vaccinated with at least their primary series and catch Covid-19 now will go on to have long Covid, Al-Aly said. That\u2019s important progress but still amounts to a large number of people living with disability and poor health. Experts who were not involved in the study agree that 3.5% means the risk of long Covid is still substantial and serious. \u201cLarge numbers of new infections and reinfections are still translating into a huge number of persons with long Covid,\u201d Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University who treats people with long Covid, said in an email. \u201cWhile numbers have dropped from the early days of the pandemic, we are still seeing new patients with long Covid that developed after a recent infection,\u201d he added. Al-Aly said this study and others underscore the need for more funding for coordinated and continuing care for long Covid patients as well as the need for more urgency in the search for treatments. \u201cI don\u2019t think the US is doing enough to address this problem,\u201d Al-Aly said. \u201cI understand the desire to move on and put it all behind us, but the fact is, there are literally millions of people who are suffering from long Covid, and then even with the decline in number, there will continue to be millions more. \u201cThere is really no plan to tackle this issue, and that cannot be.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/long-covid-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_fda-ftc-thc-snacks-letters", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission issued warnings to five companies Tuesday as part of a joint effort to crack down on illegal sales of copycat food products containing delta-8 THC. Delta-8 THC\u00a0is the psychoactive cannabinoid from the Cannabis sativa plant, of which marijuana and hemp plants are two varieties. The packaging for the THC edibles looks strikingly similar to that of popular foods such as Froot Loops cereal and Chips Ahoy! cookies. The FDA has said it is concerned that these products can be easily mistaken for traditional foods, leading to accidental ingestion or overconsumption. The agency specifically cited concerns about the easy availability of these products to young people and potential impurities or unpredictable effects from processes used to synthesize delta-8 THC. \u201cInadequate or confusing labeling can result in children or unsuspecting adults consuming products with strong resemblance to popular snacks and candies that contain delta-8 THC without realizing it,\u201d Dr. Namandj\u00e9 Bumpus, FDA principal deputy commissioner, said in a news release Tuesday. A spokesperson for Earthly Hemps, one of the companies that were issued letters, said it has not sold any Dr. Blaze THC Delta-8 Slushers, Doweedos Delta-8 Chips or Delta-8 Weedos this year. The other companies have not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The FDA says it has given the companies 15 working days to submit written responses detailing how they will address these violations and prevent future ones. If the violations are not promptly addressed, the agency may take legal action. The FDA and the FTC say they are continuing to collaborate to \u201cprotect consumers against companies illegally selling copycat delta-8 THC food products.\u201d The agencies have previously issued similar\u00a0warnings\u00a0to six other companies selling products containing THC, and those companies no longer have such products in stock, the agencies noted. From January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023, the FDA received over 300 adverse event reports involving children and adults who consumed delta-8 THC products, prompting the agency to issue a\u00a0warning\u00a0to customers in June 2022. These adverse effects have included hallucinations, vomiting, tremor, anxiety, dizziness, confusion and loss of consciousness, the agency said. Nearly half of the cases involved hospitalization or emergency department visits. Between January 1, 2021, and May 31, 2022, national poison control centers handled 10,448 single substance exposure cases involving edible products containing THC, 77% of them for people 19 or younger, the FDA said in the warning. Of those cases, 65% were due to unintentional exposure to edible THC-containing products, and 91% of those were children. One of these pediatric cases ended in death after the person consumed a suspected delta-8 THC edible, according to the FDA. \u201cCompanies that market and sell edible THC products that are easily mistaken for snacks and candy are not only acting illegally, but they are also putting the health of young children at risk,\u201d Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in Tuesday\u2019s release. \u201cThose that prioritize profits in front of children\u2019s safety are at serious risk of legal action.\u201d Consumers who notice a reaction or illness after using a product are advised to immediately stop using it and contact a health care provider. Adverse reactions associated with FDA-regulated products can be reported to the FDA using\u00a0MedWatch\u00a0or the\u00a0Safety Reporting Portal. \u201cAs accidental ingestion and/or overconsumption of delta-8 THC containing products could pose considerable health risks, the companies who sell these illegal products are demonstrating complete neglect for consumer safety,\u201d Bumpus said. \u201cThe FDA will continue to work to safeguard the health and safety of U.S. consumers by monitoring the marketplace and taking action when companies sell products that present a threat to public health.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/fda-ftc-thc-snacks-letters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_nip-and-tuck-eye-surgery-pets-wellness", "text": "Hamilton was in such pain he refused to open his eyes. When the 4-year-old English bulldog tried, his misshapen eyelids would roll inward, causing his eyelashes to scrape against his cornea. \u201cHave you ever had something scratch your cornea? It is profoundly painful,\u201d said Dr. Dana Varble, chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community, a nonprofit organization that provides learning opportunities for veterinarians. \u201cFor these poor animals, every blink is excruciating,\u201d Varble added. \u201cThey often squint in order to see, and that can make the eyelids turn in even more.\u201d After Hamilton had plastic surgery on his eyes \u2014 what humans would call a nip and tuck \u2014 he was able to see and interact with his owners with no pain. \u201cThese nip and tucks are not cosmetic; they are critical to the health of the animal,\u201d Varble said. \u201cWhen the eyelids roll in and the lashes rub the cornea, eventually the cornea gets scarred and (this) causes visual problems, or even blindness.\u201d Some canine breeds are genetically more likely to develop eyelid problems, such as dogs with shortened muzzles and flattened faces \u2014 think boxers, Boston terriers, French bulldogs, Pekingese, pugs and shih tzus, to name a few. In Hamilton\u2019s case, his vision worsened after he gained weight, with his beefy cheeks forcing the eyelids to fold inward. However, symptoms of the painful condition can show up in puppyhood, often disguised as behavioral problems, Varble said. \u201cWe see these 6-month-old puppies who are cranky, they\u2019re not training well, they\u2019re still not housebroken or getting over that puppy nipping stage,\u201d she said. \u201cYou take a closer look, and they are constantly in pain every time they blink their eyes \u2014 no wonder they\u2019re not paying attention to training.\u201d Cats can suffer, too Large cat breeds with flat faces, such as Persians and Himalayans, or round, puffy cheeks such as Siberians, Ragdolls and Maine coons, can also have issues with malformed eyelids, although it\u2019s not as common as in dogs. A 6-month-old Maine coon named Jinxy frequently kept his painful eyes shut until his owner took him to a specialist in Athens, Georgia, trained to perform complex eyelid surgery. \u201cThese eyelid diseases happen in people as well, and I like to tell my clients we practice them on humans first to make sure they are safe before we do the surgery on their dog or cat,\u201d said Dr. Kate Myrna, an associate professor of veterinary ophthalmology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia in Athens. After his surgery, Jinxy was able to open his eyes and purr at his owner without pain, Myrna said. \u201cThese are necessary surgeries. If a pet is born with too much eyelid, it\u2019s not going to get better on its own,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile surgery sounds serious, it creates almost instant pain relief, and the eye is one of the fastest healing organs in the body.\u201d However, cats can be a bit more difficult to treat \u201cbecause when you try to get in close with that bright light, they usually have big feelings about it,\u201d Myrna said. \u201cSo don\u2019t be surprised if your vet needs to wrap your cat into a \u2018kitty burrito\u2019 to conduct the exam,\u201d she said, referring to putting a towel around a cat for safe handling. A lack of trained specialists When Denali, a mastiff mix, was rescued at 4 months old by Varble, she had bulging red glands in the corner of each eye. \u201cWe call it cherry eye, because it looks like a small cherry in the corner of their eye, but it\u2019s actually the tear glands behind the third eyelid rolling outward, instead of being tucked in as they should,\u201d Varble said. While not always painful, the condition can be irritating for dogs and puts them at risk of injury or infection from pawing at the eye. Left untreated, the condition can lead to dry eye and the potential for blindness, experts say. While all breeds are susceptible to cherry eye, it\u2019s most common among basset hounds, beagles, cocker spaniels, Great Danes, rottweilers, and dogs with flat faces such as boxers, bulldogs and Pekingese. Surgery to correct cherry eye can be relatively simple for an experienced veterinary surgeon, but some circumstances can be more challenging and require the skill of a vet trained in ophthalmology. \u201cDenali had a very severe case,\u201d Varble said. \u201cThankfully, the specialist was able to save the gland in her eye. That\u2019s important because if we have to remove the gland it increases the incidence of dry eye in those dogs after surgery.\u201d Unfortunately, there are only 500 veterinary ophthalmologists in the United States, making it difficult at times for pet owners and general vets to get the quick treatment needed, according to Varble. To overcome that obstacle, the North American Veterinary Community holds periodic trainings so a general vet can become more comfortable treating simple injuries and eye abnormalities. \u201cIf our general practice veterinarians can handle more than just first aid for eyes, they can free up the specialists for serious cases and significant emergencies,\u201d Varble said. \u201cIt just makes everybody more efficient and is better for the pets and their owners as well.\u201d Droopy eyes and signs of injury There are other eye problems that require plastic surgery as well. Mastiffs and bloodhounds are often born with \u201cbig droopy eyelids\u201d that refuse to close completely, Varble said. \u201cTheir lower lids can be so far down that the eyelids literally don\u2019t shut all the way when the upper lid comes down,\u201d Varble said. \u201cThat can create dry spots, and the dogs are more prone to get dust and other things stuck in their eyes.\u201d Unfortunately, a healthy eye can turn into a vision-threatening emergency rapidly, making it important that pet owners act as soon as they notice any significant irritation, Myrna said. \u201cIf your pet has morning sleep or goo in the corner of their eyes, or a bit of a discharge that is common with some cat and dog breeds, that\u2019s probably not a reason to go rushing into your vet,\u201d Myrna said. Signs of significant injury include redness in one or both eyes, excessive squinting or twitching of an eyelid, or an eye that remains closed or is unable to open, Myrna said. Another sign is a blue haze over the entire eye that lasts more than two hours. \u201cIt\u2019s different than cataracts, which are a white or blue color in the pupil,\u201d Myrna said. \u201cWhen the whole surface of the eye looks hazy blue, that\u2019s usually because it\u2019s waterlogged, and that\u2019s a sign of a problem that we need to look at right away. \u201cRemember, a scratched eye can easily become infected and can go from a superficial, easy to treat injury to needing surgery or the pet will lose the eye and lose vision \u2014 and that can happen overnight.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/nip-and-tuck-eye-surgery-pets-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_psilocybin-brain-study-wellness", "text": "As he began the brain scan, neurologist Dr. Nico Dosenbach wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d been given a psychedelic or a placebo as part of a new clinical trial that would capture how the brain works on psilocybin, the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms. Suddenly he felt a faster heartbeat, a flush of energy and a change in vision. It wasn\u2019t until his brain morphed into a computer, however, that he knew for sure he was on a psychedelic trip. \u201cUntil it kicks in, nobody in the trial knew if they had taken psilocybin or Ritalin (the stimulant methylphenidate), which was picked to be a placebo because it\u2019s also arousing, like drinking a coffee or two,\u201d said Dosenbach, a professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cBut then I was like, no, this is not placebo,\u201d Dosenbach said. \u201cI was the computer tablet, and my thoughts were like computer thoughts, which of course makes no sense. I was aware this was not normal, but it wasn\u2019t frightening.\u201d Dosenbach is the co-senior author of a very small, pilot study that conducted up to 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of healthy participants\u2019 brains before, during and three weeks after a psychedelic trip on psilocybin. \u201cWe found that psilocybin desynchronizes the brain,\u201d said co-senior author Ginger Nicol of the study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. \u201cWhen psilocybin is on board, the brain is disconnecting from its typical pathways and reconnecting to different parts of the brain,\u201d said Nicol, an associate professor of psychiatry at\u00a0Washington University\u00a0School of Medicine in St. Louis. These new pathways may be responsible for the success of some psychedelics in treating mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Also known as shrooms, psilocybin is illegal according to federal law, although in 2020 Oregon became the first US state to legalize psilocybin\u00a0for personal use for those age 21 and older. However, the US Food and Drug Administration has allowed psilocybin to be treated as a breakthrough medicine, a process that fast-tracks the development and review of promising drugs. Greater access to the sense of self The new study\u2019s scans highlighted an increase in connections to the anterior hippocampus, responsible for emotional memory, perception and imagination, Nicol said. Parts of the default mode network, which impacts a person\u2019s sense of self, time and space, also lit up on the scans. Antidepressants also target the default mode network, trying to interrupt the \u201cnegative thought loop, or stuck thinking that can occur with depression,\u201d Nicol said. \u201cA lot of antidepressants do work on the default mode network connecting to other parts of the brain, just a lot more slowly than psychedelics do,\u201d she said. Small clinical trials\u00a0have shown that\u00a0one or two doses of psilocybin can make dramatic and long-lasting changes in people who have treatment-resistant\u00a0major depressive disorder, which typically does not respond to traditional antidepressants. Psilocybin is also showing promise in combating\u00a0cluster headaches,\u00a0anxiety,\u00a0anorexia nervosa,\u00a0obsessive-compulsive disorder\u00a0and various forms of\u00a0substance abuse. Typically, clinical trials use trained psychotherapists who sit with the person during the psychedelic trip. In many trials, the therapist meets with the person in the weeks before and after the event to help guide and integrate any insights from the experience. The new study uses multiple brain scans to illustrate how psilocybin may make connections in the brain more malleable, thus helping people overcome \u201crigid maladaptive patterns\u201d of thought and behavior, said Dr. Petros Petridis, a professor of psychiatry at the NYU Langone Center for Psychedelic Medicine in New York City. He was not connected to the study. \u201cPsilocybin could open the door to change, allowing the therapist to lead the patient through,\u201d Petridis wrote in a review published with the study. \u201cUltimately, however, large clinical trials with diverse patient populations and factorial study designs (which enable more than one intervention to be evaluated simultaneously) will be needed to examine the efficacy of psychedelics such as psilocybin and the role of talk therapy in treatment,\u201d he added. \u2018No words, just the feeling\u2019 The study was extremely small, with only seven volunteers. Each person ingested either 25 milligrams of pharmaceutical-grade psilocybin or a 40 milligram dose of methylphenidate, a stimulant often prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Some participants returned for a second dose of psilocybin 6 months to 12 months later. All of the participants in the study had prior experience with psychedelics or \u201cmystical experiences,\u201d loosely defined as an altered state of consciousness. At the peak of his trip, Dosenbach began to feel as though he was present in the minds of people he knew, experiencing their thoughts as his own. \u201cI was in the brain of famous neuroscientists, including my most senior colleague that I work with, and literally surfing the brain waves,\u201d he said. \u201cScience doesn\u2019t fully understand the brain yet, but I felt as if I suddenly knew exactly how the brain works. Yet if you were to ask me how it worked, I would have no words, just the feeling.\u201d Each of the participants had different experiences, with only one not entering a state of mysticism, Dosenbach said. \u201cMy sense of self stretched like I was the universe,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people reported they saw God, and if I was very religious, I could see that, but for me it was more like \u2018Oh, I\u2019m the universe.\u2019 \u201cAnd then it disappeared in what I think psychiatrists call ego death,\u201d he said. \u201cSimultaneously with that I lost my sense of place, and time stopped. It felt like I was literally there for days and then weeks figuring things out.\u201d One man was able to pinpoint the specific time during the fMRI scan that he had his most vivid mystical experience, Nicol said. \u201cHe felt the light of God was shining on him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were able to actually go to that spot on the scan and pinpoint when he felt that \u2014 it happened at the peak of desynchronization (from the brain\u2019s typical pathways).\u201d A window for change Scans showed that in the days after the psilocybin trip, most brain networks returned to normal. However, connections between the default mode network and the anterior hippocampus persisted for up to three weeks, Nicol said. It\u2019s possible that this lingering effect could explain part of the therapeutic impact of psilocybin, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive effect initially, and when it\u2019s gone, a pinpoint effect remains,\u201d Dosenbach said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d want to see for a potential medicine. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want people\u2019s brain networks to be obliterated for days, but you also wouldn\u2019t want everything to snap back to the way it was immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want an effect that lasts long enough to make a difference.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/psilocybin-brain-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_confidence-success-anxiety-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Everyone has encountered them: people who always appear to know what they are doing. They gladly take control of a situation, express their opinions as if they were established facts or plunge into a project believing they are going to succeed \u2014 with or without the required experience. What magic dust was sprinkled on their breakfast cereal to give them this superpower? \u201cConfidence \u2014 it is probably the most important resource in human well-being and human performance, I believe,\u201d neuroscientist and psychologist Ian Robertson told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast Chasing Life. Robertson is a professor emeritus of psychology and the codirector of the Global Brain Health Institute at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and the T. Boone Pickens Distinguished Chair\u00a0at the Center for BrainHealth at the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cConfidence is a belief with two strands to it,\u201d said Robertson, the author of \u201cHow Confidence Works: The New Science of Self-Belief.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the belief you can do something, and it\u2019s the belief that if you do that thing, you will get a reward or get an outcome you desire.\u201d When you feel confident, you are more likely to succeed because confidence activates brain circuits that produce an elevated mood, lower anxiety and sharper thinking \u2014 all of which raise the odds of success, Robertson said. These are the same brain circuits that get activated when you do succeed. So whether you have confidence or succeed, even at a small task, it leads to success and then even more confidence. \u201cThe greatest source of success is success,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd success, like confidence, acts like compound interest: It\u2019s exponential. A little bit grows steadily.\u201d You can listen to the full episode here. If confidence is on one end of the spectrum, anxiety is at the other, Robertson said. \u201cIf you lack confidence, if you don\u2019t think you can do that thing, then that will generate anxiety because of the prospect of failure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe greatest source of anxiety is the fear of the negative evaluation of other people, and almost all anxiety has to do with other people.\u201d Additionally, anxiety activates circuits that disrupt \u201cthe fluid synchronization of different brain regions that are critical for elite or top performance,\u201d he noted. Research shows\u00a0that people who are chronically anxious do less of everything, Robertson said. \u201cThey do less \u2026 socially, they do less in work, they do less in hobbies and interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because their brains are primed into a threat mindset, where they\u2019re anticipating and focusing their attention on potential negative outcomes and threat. And that inhibits those systems of the brain that do the opposite with confidence.\u201d For example, Robertson said, take two 5-year-old girls: They are equally intelligent and capable, but one has slightly more confidence than the other. \u201cThat slight difference in confidence will mean that that little girl is more likely to try something new. A tiny thing: Ask a question, (be) less frightened to make a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that will result more likely in a small success. That means she\u2019s then more likely to do the next step. And by the time these two girls are 25, there\u2019s a yawning gap in their achievement and their well-being because of the exponential nature of the mathematics of confidence.\u201d All is not lost if you were not born brimming with confidence. Robertson has five tips for building up confidence, even under daunting circumstances. Take action Taking steps to do something and then doing it (no matter how shaky you feel) will result in a burst of confidence. \u201cConfidence is linked to the action systems of the brain,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cThe great Persian poet Rumi said the road only appears with the first step. And people who lack confidence and have anxiety tend to hold back from taking action because they see \u2018threat.\u2019\u201d Taking action, in spite of feeling anxious, is very important for building confidence, Roberston said. \u00a0 Choose your focus carefully What you pay attention to determines your emotional state, so pick wisely, Robertson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re giving a talk to a group of people and there\u2019s a couple of people on their phones or frowning, your attention will lock on to them because \u2026 that\u2019s what we do when we feel under threat,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHowever, if you deliberately choose to pay attention to the majority of people, or to one person who is looking interested in the front row, who is smiling \u2026 you will feed your brain with positive thoughts and images that will help you remember past successes rather than past failures.\u201d He said that being intentional in this way will not only reduce your anxiety and decrease the effort you have to put into the task, it\u00a0will also build up your confidence. Adopt a growth mindset Your attitude toward yourself and your abilities can make a difference. \u201cYou have to believe that change is possible,\u201d Robertson said. People with a \u201cgrowth\u201d mindset believe that with effort you can learn abilities and cultivate talents; conversely, those with a \u201cfixed\u201d mindset believe talents and abilities are innate \u2014 you either have them or you don\u2019t. \u201cIf you have a fixed mindset \u2014 that is, you believe that your abilities or your emotions are determined by genetics or inheritance \u2014 then you\u2019re not going to engage in \u2026 the slow ups and downs that learning entails,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cYou can learn to be more confident \u2014 but not if you cripple yourself with a fixed mindset.\u201d Fixed theories about yourself are \u201calways wrong\u201d because the human brain is enormously plastic at all ages, he explained. Deal with your anxiety Anxiety is corrosive to confidence, so reframe anxiety as excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to control anxiety by not becoming frightened of it and not treating it as some alien force coming, but rather seeing it as a form of energy that you can harness,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIn fact, the bodily and brain symptoms of anxiety are identical to those of excitement.\u201d Robertson recommends that if faced with a situation that makes you feel anxious, such as a difficult conversation or an interview, adopt a \u201cchallenge\u201d mindset. \u201cYou can actually change your frame of mind to one of \u2018Oh, can I perform here?\u2019 versus \u2018Oh, terrible things are going to happen,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can help yourself do that by the words you say to yourself: \u2018I am excited.\u2019\u201d Robertson said that doing so doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to feel nervous, but by using language, you are harnessing a form of energy. Affirm your values Define yourself and what you stand for, he said. \u201cBecause who you are as a person is grounded in what you stand for and what\u2019s important to you, what your values are,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd if you can just take a few seconds to even write down what your values are and why they\u2019re important to you and what they mean to you, the evidence shows that your brain will be then more resilient and protected against the fear of criticism, of humiliation, of failure.\u201d In other words, Robertson said, you will be protected from the destructive anxiety that eats away at confidence. We hope these five tips help you build up confidence. Listen to the full episode here.
