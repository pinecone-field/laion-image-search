One study found that about 1 in 7 people who used semaglutide \u2013 which is approved for weight loss under the brand name Wegovy \u2013 for more than a year didn\u2019t lose at least 5% of their starting weight, indicating that the drug didn\u2019t work well for them. Now, research suggests that the answer may lie in a person\u2019s genes. The study shows that a new test that assigns a genetic risk score may be able to help people figure out whether they are likely to be successful on injected weight loss medications. \u201cWe think that the test will be able to explain who will be able to lose weight, and we can predict with 95% accuracy who will lose more than 5% with this genetic test,\u201d said Dr. Andres Acosta, a gastroenterologist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic who helped develop the test. Acosta points out that these medications aren\u2019t cheap.\u00a0They\u2019re not always covered by insurance, and if they are, they may come with a high copay. Being able to predict whether the drugs will work could save people a lot of frustration and money. The test, MyPhenome, was developed by researchers at the Mayo Clinic and was licensed last year by a company called Phenomic Sciences.\u00a0It costs $350 and must be ordered by a health care provider.  It looks for 6,000 changes in 22 genes that lie in the signaling pathway for the GLP-1 hormone, and it uses the results to assign each person a risk score that classifies them as either \u201chungry gut\u201d-positive or \u201chungry gut\u201d-negative. People who are hungry gut-positive have normal responses to hormone signaling in the brain, whereas people who are hungry gut-negative don\u2019t seem to respond as well to hormonal signals from the stomach that tell the brain to stop eating.\u00a0Acosta says the test classifies those people as having a hungry brain, and they may need different types of interventions to lose weight, such as bariatric surgery. In a recent small study of 84 people enrolled in a weight loss registry at the Mayo Clinic, researchers ran the test on stored blood or saliva samples. After nine months on semaglutide, people who were classified as hungry gut-positive had lost significantly more weight than those were hungry gut-negative. After a year, people classified as hungry gut-positive had lost an average of 19% of their starting weight, or nearly twice as much, on average, as the 10% of total body weight lost by people who were classified by the test as hungry-gut negative. The study is slated to be presented Monday at the Digestive Disease Week conference in Washington, DC.\u00a0It has not been scrutinized by outside experts or published in a medical journal, so its conclusions are considered preliminary. \u201cWe do need to test these in a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial that we have done for other medications. That\u2019s the highest gold standard,\u201d Acosta said.  \u201cBut at this point, we can say that these outcomes were in patients who were blinded to the results as well as the investigation,\u201d he added, meaning they didn\u2019t know whether they were hungry gut-positive or -negative while they were using the drug.

Florida enacted a new law\u00a0on May 1, 2024, that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, with\u00a0a few exceptions\u00a0\u2013 including documented rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Florida joins the majority of\u00a0Southern states\u00a0that now have complete bans or highly restrictive abortion laws, enacted since the Supreme Court overturned the\u00a0federal right to get an abortion\u00a0in June 2022. Many of the restrictive laws ban abortion after a set number of weeks. Florida Republicans supporting the bill have labeled it a\u00a0reasonable compromise between a full abortion ban and few abortion restrictions. READ MORE: Mexico is a destination for Americans seeking reproductive health services  Some OB-GYNs\u00a0have explained that\u00a0many women\u00a0do not even know they are pregnant at\u00a0six weeks.\u00a0Research shows that women\u00a0on average find out they are pregnant at five and a half weeks. About 23% do not know until seven weeks of pregnancy or later. So, do Americans, including those enacting six-week bans, actually understand how the timing or dating of pregnancy works? We are\u00a0scholars\u00a0of\u00a0political science,\u00a0gender and public opinion\u00a0and are writing a book about public opinion on abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the federal right to get an abortion in June 2022. How does pregnancy work? To gain insights into this issue, we developed a few pregnancy questions and included them in a research survey in late September 2023. The survey had 1,356 respondents, who were broadly representative of the U.S. population. The respondents\u2019 median age was 46. Approximately 49% of these people were men, while 70% were white and 29% were college graduates. Meanwhile, 43% of them were Democrats, and 38% were Republicans. READ MORE: Fetal personhood rulings could nullify a pregnant patient\u2019s wishes for\u00a0end-of-life\u00a0care The first question asked respondents how pregnancies are dated.\u00a0The correct answer\u00a0is that pregnancies are dated using the first day of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period, which is often two to three weeks before conception. The second question asked about trimesters. Many Americans are familiar with the term trimester, and\u00a0polling consistently shows\u00a0that Americans find abortion most acceptable during the first trimester. We asked Americans if they knew approximately how many weeks a trimester was. The correct answer is 13. Americans\u2019 pregnancy knowledge We found that only one-third of respondents knew how pregnancy is dated. A majority \u2013 approximately 60% \u2013 falsely thought that pregnancy is dated from conception or in the weeks since the woman last had sex. Less than one-fourth of the respondents answered both pregnancy knowledge questions correctly. In our survey, we also asked respondents whether they support a six-week abortion ban. Similar to other\u00a0national surveys, we find that most Americans oppose strict abortion restrictions \u2013 only 35% support six-week bans. Importantly, we find that those who support six-week abortion bans are significantly less likely than others to correctly understand the timing of pregnancy. The statistically significant relationship between having low levels of pregnancy timing knowledge and support for a six-week abortion ban holds in analyses controlling for potentially confounding variables. Some anti-abortion lawmakers\u00a0have demonstrated\u00a0their\u00a0ignorance\u00a0about pregnancy\u00a0before. There is, for example, a long history of some anti-abortion politicians saying, incorrectly, that it is\u00a0extremely rare\u00a0for a person who is raped to get pregnant. Our survey shows that a large swath of those opposing abortion lack knowledge about the basics of pregnancy. A gender disparity Perhaps not surprisingly, women in this survey knew more about pregnancy than men. The question about how pregnancies are dated, for example, was answered correctly by 43% of women compared with only 23% of men. As mentioned above, a majority of Americans incorrectly believe pregnancy is dated from conception, but significantly more men than women think this is true. This finding is particularly important when considering the gender breakdown of the Florida state lawmakers who approved the six-week ban. Although we do not have data on the pregnancy knowledge of those legislators, we do know that those who voted for the ban were\u00a0overwhelmingly men. Florida\u2019s six-week ban will make it much harder for anyone to get abortions there \u2013 and it will also affect people in\u00a0neighboring states\u00a0who want or need an abortion. In 2023, Florida was home to the closest abortion clinic for\u00a06.4 million women\u00a0living in the South. In 2023,\u00a0around 7,700 women\u00a0from other Southern states,\u00a0where abortion is now largely banned, traveled to Florida to get abortions. Overall, our findings raise serious questions about whether Americans without medical training \u2013 much like those in our state legislatures \u2013 have the necessary knowledge needed to regulate abortion access.

{"id": "alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta", "text": "I\u2019ve been reporting on Alzheimer\u2019s disease for more than two decades, and any progress in the field has seemed incremental at best, leaving most patients and their loved ones with few options. But in the process of filming a new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I met with people all across the country who had been diagnosed with or who are at high risk of the disease. With lifestyle changes alone, I saw levels of amyloid plaque decrease in their brains, their cognition improve and even signs of reversal of the disease. It was extraordinary and it also made me start to think about my own brain, because I have a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. So with some trepidation, I decided to learn more about my risk for dementia. It was one of the most personal and revealing\u00a0experiences I have ever gone through. To start, I underwent an intensive exploration of my brain, far deeper than I even thought possible. This wasn\u2019t a simple look at the anatomy or even the genetics that might predispose me to a particular type of dementia. The goal was to obtain a complete story of my brain, from my earliest days through my education and formative years to now: a man in his mid-50s. Most importantly, the in-depth testing could give me a clearer idea of where I was headed and how to steer my path in the most favorable direction. Even as a brain surgeon myself, I was surprised at how well the health of your brain can be measured. With the heart, it is pretty well-accepted that a battery of tests can help give us a clear idea of how to predict, prevent and treat heart disease. Until recently, however, we really could not say the same about the brain. Many brain doctors still struggle even to define the criteria for a healthy brain. The general consensus was that the \u201cblack box\u201d in your skull was pretty fixed and that there was little you could do to assess it, let alone optimize it. Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist, convinced me otherwise, and it led to one of the most fascinating \u2014 and somewhat frightening \u2014 days I have had in my life. I\u2019ve known Richard for a long time, and we are friends. We have had great conversations about our shared love for the brain, and I often turn to him to get his thoughts on neurological developments in the news. What has always struck me about Richard is that he is consistently unwilling to accept the status quo in medicine, almost more as a matter of justice rather than scientific pursuit, although he is that rare individual who is stellar at making a difference in both. So I immediately thought of him when considering the idea of a preventive neurology visit. To be clear, I wasn\u2019t going to Richard because I thought I had any sort of problem. But that is the point: When people refer to the US medical field as a \u201csick-care\u201d system instead of a health-care system, this is what I think they mean. Richard would certainly see me if I were sick, but he preferred to see me now, while I was healthy, fully believing he could help me maintain my brain, reduce my chance of dementia and even optimize my function, as he described in a 2018 study. I flew into Boca Raton, Florida, to see Richard at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases of Florida clinic on a beautiful day in March. He had advised me ahead of time to not exercise or eat that morning and to prepare for a day of intense mental gymnastics. Although this wasn\u2019t an IQ test, he said, in some ways, it would be far more personal. I must say that it felt very meta to get an assessment of my own brain and find out whether it was functioning as it should or if there were problems I had not yet noticed. Was I getting rusty? Maybe I was making errors that my family, friends and colleagues were too polite to tell me about. If there were gaps in processing speed or executive judgment, they might now be uncovered and unmasked. When I got to the clinic, I first underwent a battery of blood tests, checking my phosphorylated tau ratio, better known as the Alzheimer\u2019s blood test, and measures of my lipids, inflammation and glucose levels, to name just a few. I was also tested for my genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. If I was a carrier of the APOE4 gene, it could carry significant higher risk of the disease. I spit into a tube to check my oral health. After that, I stepped on a body composition scale to figure out where and how much bone, fat and muscle I had in my body. I was a little surprised to catch Richard in the corner, looking at the readout and saying, \u201cInteresting \u2026\u201d while stroking his chin. Nobody likes to see their doctors do that. Not even doctors like to see other doctors do that. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked across the room. \u201cOh,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably fine.\u201d He later told me that he saw evidence of an old left arm injury and accurately predicted that I had had an intense leg workout the day before. It was a real reminder of how clearly the body keeps score. Even though I hadn\u2019t thought about that injury in years, it had clearly left its mark on my body and still triggered a finding on this test. After that came the cognitive testing. This was perhaps the most surprising. At first, I was told to relax and listen to the detailed short story of an Atlanta football team captain, a quarterback who had injured his finger on a fishing trip before the big game. I thought I had been paying attention but suddenly realized I probably wasn\u2019t as engaged as I thought. \u201cWhat day did he injure himself, and how many stitches did he need? What was the player\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked 15 minutes later. Could I even be certain if it was his thumb or left ring finger? Quick: Recite as many words as you can starting with the letter \u201cG\u201d and then immediately rattle off as many animal names as possible, both in one-minute increments. The longer the words and the more unusual the animals, the better. There were lists of words to remember, three-dimensional cubes and clocks to be drawn, and dozens of faces to match with their names. I had to scratch and sniff 50 different smells and determine, in one instance, if something smelled more like gasoline, acetone or a forest fire. In another instance, it was lavender or lilac. I found myself suddenly being unsure and trying to summon up a memory of that smell to try to answer correctly. I felt like my brain was being cross-examined by a very skilled prosecutor. It wasn\u2019t just about the number of errors I made but the types of errors, how long I took to respond and whether I simply lost my attention. There are obvious red flags that pop up if someone draws a clock backward or if they have lost their ability to distinguish certain smells. The more subtle concerns were around visual-spatial construction or an ability to ignore incongruent stimuli in the Stroop Color and Word Test, such as identifying the color red, even if that word appears in purple on the screen. Although I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with dyslexia, Richard thinks it might be something I have. \u201cDo you count on your fingers?\u201d he asked me. I have always done that and never considered it to be notable or suggestive of something significant. Turns out I was less likely to remember words with lots of Bs and Ds in them because I may have always shied away from letters I more easily confused. These types of insights about my own brain, big and small, were all so fascinating (and a bit unsettling) to me. For Richard, however, they represented opportunities for early intervention, some of which are remarkably simple. \u201cMost doctors would look at your results and say you are doing fine,\u201d Richard explained before he showed me the results of my lab testing. \u201cBut what they are really saying is that you are probably fine \u2013 for the next few years. I am playing the long game here, and I think you are going to see a lot of areas we can start to address now, today.\u201d I am a pretty competitive guy, so I am used to having all \u201cgreens\u201d pop up when I review my lab testing results. After all, I take great pride in my health and approach it with the same rigor that I approached my grades in medical school. I wanted to do really well, certainly as well as I could possibly do. So when Richard flipped over my lab results and showed me a page that had not only a considerable amount of yellow but even a few reds, my heart dropped. My homocysteine level was elevated, but my B12 level was low. That wasn\u2019t surprising to Richard, because he had also found a mutation in my MTHFR gene, which meant that I probably didn\u2019t process homocysteine well. My omega-3 levels were all right, but not when you compared them with my omega-6 levels. My DHEA levels were a little low, which might partly explain why I have had more trouble putting on muscle than I did a decade ago. And I was surprised to learn that I was carrying more inflammation in my body than I expected, especially given that I felt fine. What was most revealing to me was how clearly these blood test abnormalities could be associated with neurological function. Richard told me that issues of metabolism, such as even slight insulin resistance, can accelerate amyloid deposition, which can lead to amyloid plaques, those telltale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, down the line. He also said that, in his experience, cholesterol and lipid abnormalities can be associated with problems with executive function and speed of processing. He added that he associates depression with lower attention and slower processing speeds. I\u2019ve been practicing neurosurgery for 30 years, and I had never heard of this. Richard was able to draw a link between very functional aspects of the brain to very specific problems in the body. And, more important, he has presented scientific evidence showing that optimizing those physical targets is associated with improved cognitive function. Richard also wanted to address an activity I did on a daily basis: my neighborhood walk with my three dogs. \u201cKeep doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now with a weighted vest.\u201d Why? Not having enough lean muscle mass is problematic. He told me people typically do a good job addressing their arms and legs, but loading the spine with additional weight helps activate core muscles, such as abdominals and obliques, as well as stimulating the growth of new bone cells. This could lead to a critical redistribution of the fat, muscle and bone in my body and help drive down any insulin resistance that I may be genetically predisposed to and eventually lower my risk of developing amyloid in the brain. On Richard\u2019s advice, I started to make a few changes to my nutrition and day-to-day routine. Over the years, I had gone back and forth on fish oil, not overly impressed with the data on heart health and finding it challenging to keep the pills refrigerated, especially when I was on the road. For Richard, though, it was clear. As healthy as my diet is, he had no doubt that I needed to take the extra steps to supplement with omega-3 fatty acids to help my omega-3/omega-6 ratio in the pursuit of better brain health. This would also help with the absorption of B vitamins, he added. Those needed to be supplemented as well, and Richard was very specific about this. \u201cMake sure to get the bottle with 1,000 micrograms of B12 and 400 micrograms of methylfolate along with 1.5 milligrams of B6.\u201d Those fairly straightforward recommendations to improve my fatty acids could probably make an impact with my executive function, he told me. In the recommendation about brain health, I did not expect an intervention involving my feet, but the nerves that run to the feet are the longest in our body. When you don\u2019t move your toes and feet regularly and freely, Richard says, you can lose sensory awareness, also known as proprioception, leading to a \u201csensory paralysis.\u201d Over time, the nerve connections that run from your feet to your brain start to disappear. Once your feet are weak, your weight will be unevenly distributed when walking and exercising. The better your feet can tolerate a load evenly, the more options they have for movement, the better and more cooperative things will be up the chain, including your knees, hips and lower back. Consider wearing toe spacers occasionally, he told me. Start with 10 minutes a day every few days, and increase the time as you get used to them. Some of the recommendations were more sophisticated. For example, Richard would ideally want even more testing. He\u2019d like to get a detailed DEXA scan of my entire body, not just for bone health but to get a clear look at how much visceral fat I am carrying. Visceral fat is not the subcutaneous fat that you can pinch between your thumb and your forefinger. Rather, it\u2019s the problematic stuff that chokes off the internal organs in your belly. Because visceral fat is so buried and woven into your internal organs, it\u2019s actually quite hard to assess how much someone has. A person could be skinny and still have a lot of visceral fat. Because I had some inflammatory elevations, he worried that I might be one of those people. He also suggested a brain MRI. He was worried that there might be cerebral blood vessel injury because of a slightly elevated fibrinogen level, a protein that can help the blood clot. The concern was that I might be making more frequent micro clots, which could put me at increased risk of vascular dementia later in life. And finally, a coronary calcium CT scan to detect coronary artery disease at its earliest stages, because as a general rule, what is bad for the heart is also bad for the brain. To be clear, most of these tests aren\u2019t part of routine care, and I struggle with the cost of it all. They can be expensive and probably wouldn\u2019t be covered by a person\u2019s insurance, especially if they aren\u2019t showing symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia or mild cognitive impairment. That is why Richard is also working to make much of it available for free at home. Nearly all the cognitive testing could be available in the future through a free app. Even the blood work could be done via finger-prick testing, if all goes as expected with Richard\u2019s research trial. Although a complete DEXA scan requires a facility, there are home scales that do a reasonably good job at measuring overall body composition, not just weight, and can help follow those trends over time. When I first visited with Richard after all my testing, I honestly expected to be told I was doing fine \u2013 even excellent. That is what every doctor had told me before. But the evidence is clear that when it comes to your brain, prevention and even optimization are possible. We know that in so many areas of medicine, there is a very large white space between being totally healthy and being sick. And it\u2019s an area that a sick-care system would not spend much time addressing, especially if the recommendations are as simple and wildly effective as a few vitamins, toe spacers and a rucksack. Going through this experience for \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient\u201d was more revealing and jarring than I could have imagined. After all, nobody wants bad news from a doctor, especially when it comes to your brain. But I can take comfort in knowing these tests aren\u2019t laying out a certain future or preparing me for inevitable catastrophe but rather giving me the personalized knowledge that I can use to take action toward a longer, healthier life and a sharper, healthier brain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}

The term itself hails from medieval Norse meaning \u201clazy fellow\u201d \u2014 and later the middle English word meaning \u201cwalking, sitting or standing with a loose attitude.\u201d In the last 150 years or so, posture has come to be associated with aspects of a person\u2019s value, dignity, respectability and morality.\u00a0Erect posture\u00a0has been deemed \u201chealthy,\u201d \u201cthe aesthetic utopia,\u201d \u201cdignified,\u201d \u201ca backbone against subjugation,\u201d \u201cattractive\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d by various cultures, political movements and even social media influencers. READ MORE: Why sitting with crossed legs could be bad for you So it\u2019s not difficult to see then how slouching came to be considered \u201cbad\u201d for us since it\u2019s long been considered to be a bodily representation of negativity. But while posture is heavily overlaid with psychological meaning, is it really that bad for our spines if we slouch? Are certain postures really \u201cgood\u201d and others \u201cbad\u201d? The great news is that in the past two decades, there\u2019s been a plethora of rigorous clinical studies conducted which have concluded that there\u2019s\u00a0no relationship\u00a0between slouching and spinal pain. There\u2019s also\u00a0no evidence\u00a0that people who slouch are more likely to suffer with back or neck pain compared to non-slouchers. There\u2019s also no clear evidence that slouching while sitting at your desk or while using your phone causes damage to the spine. Even the UK government\u2019s latest guidance on\u00a0working with screens\u00a0puts less emphasis on an idealised posture at the workstation. READ MORE: Understanding that chronic back pain originates from within the brain helps recovery Instead, they emphasise the importance of adopting comfortable positions, varying your positions, avoiding awkward positions (such as flexing or arching your back or neck) and including regular breaks from your static posture throughout the day. All of these tips will help reduce the risk of\u00a0developing pain\u00a0and muscle fatigue. So if you experience back or neck pain, you can rest assured that the posture you adopt when walking or sitting probably isn\u2019t to blame as much as you might have been led to believe. Instead, it\u2019s probably related more to other features of life \u2014 such as how\u00a0stressed\u00a0or\u00a0physically active\u00a0you are and if you have\u00a0previously had back pain. There\u2019s a pretty good reason why slouching doesn\u2019t damage our spines, and that is because our spines are designed to allow movements as diverse as Olympic weightlifting to limbo dancing. Our spines aren\u2019t going to be damaged by a bit of sitting down, even if we happen to be wiggling our fingers on a keyboard at the same time. And while standing desks are popular, prolonged standing is no more comfortable for the spine than prolonged sitting READ MORE: Why you get shorter as you age The best thing to do throughout your day, to both make your body feel more comfortable and to\u00a0increase your productivity\u00a0and positive sense of well-being is to break up prolonged periods at your desk with breaks to walk, stretch, stand or sit down. Positive posture But there is one area where slouching may have a negative effect. Slouching has been linked to poorer information and memory recall, as well as worse mood when compared to\u00a0sitting upright. These memory and mood problems are shown to be\u00a0rapidly improved\u00a0when moving from a slouched to\u00a0erect posture. So perhaps there is some truth to the notion that slouching may still be a bodily representation of negativity. But aside from that, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests there\u2019s\u00a0no single, ideal or good posture. Differences in spinal posture are not related to pain. And, in fact, posture naturally varies from person to person \u2014 and can even vary depending on\u00a0race, sex, and even mood. So if you\u2019re a sloucher, rest assured that it isn\u2019t really bad for you and is as good as any other posture you adopt. Comfortable postures are safe and sitting is not dangerous.

Nicholls reduced his risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle changes recommended by Isaacson, including diet, exercise, reducing stress and optimizing sleep, along with a few strategically chosen supplements and medications prescribed by his cardiologist. \u201cI was very worried,\u201d Nicholls told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in his new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d which is airing on \u201cThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.\u201d \u201cI have a 3-year-old son and an 8-year-old son. It\u2019s really important for me, as I get older, to try and be there for them in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many [changes] in lifestyle you can do to hopefully push the disease backwards and give yourself more time, which is all we need until we find a cure.\u201d Unlucky genes When it came to genetics and dementia, Nicholls had drawn the short straw. He carried two copies of the APOE4 gene, one from each parent, which may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s at least tenfold. \u201cSadly, my mum passed away from what we think is Alzheimer\u2019s in her 70s,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cFor the last 10 years of her life, she just sat in a chair, rocking, while on about 14 medications. I\u2019d much rather have a longer health span and then just go quickly.\u201d Not everyone with one or even two copies of APOE4 develops Alzheimer\u2019s, however, creating a tantalizing opportunity. Can a person diminish their genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle and various medical interventions, especially if started early, before too much damage is done? Isaacson, who also has a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, believes the answer is yes. He began the first US clinic devoted to Alzheimer\u2019s prevention in New York City in 2013 before moving his program to Florida in 2021. His research has shown that following a dozen or more lifestyle interventions, when practiced 60% or more of the time, can improve cognitive function, especially in women. Today, scientists around the world are also investigating the impact on cognition of such lifestyle changes as a healthy plant-based diet,\u00a0stress reduction,\u00a0strength training, aerobic exercise and quality sleep habits \u2014 behaviors that Isaacson and his team outlined in a recent review\u00a0published in Nature. \u201cI don\u2019t use the term \u2018reverse.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what reverse means when it comes to the field of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut the results we\u2019ve seen with Simon and some other patients in our research are extremely exciting.\u201d How the heart and the brain are intertwined Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t the only pathway to a life of dwindling memory and the inability to think, plan and interact with loved ones. Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can be caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks, stroke, blood clots and more, all of which can further damage the body and brain. Poor hearts and their consequences can run rampant in a family over generations, a fact Nicholls knew all too well. \u201cMy whole family had endless heart attacks, resulting in my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side dying around age 50,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother had three heart attacks, the first at age 50, then a triple bypass before she went on to develop dementia.\u201d Carrying an APOE4 gene further increases the risk for heart disease as well as dementia, experts say. \u201cMy sister had three heart attacks, and when I was 40, I was told that I had atherosclerosis, with a ridiculously massive coronary artery calcium score of like 1,500 and occlusions in about 96% of my arteries.\u201d A normal coronary artery calcium score is zero. For a man in the prime of his life, the news was crushing. Doctors tried to use lifestyle changes and statins to reverse the plaque buildup but finally resorted to surgery, opening three of Nicholls\u2019 arteries with stents. He also began using an injectable drug called evolocumab, designed to boost the liver\u2019s ability to remove \u201cbad\u201d \u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, from the body. \u2018It was time to turn to my brain\u2019 Slowly, Nicholls\u2019 heart condition began to improve, but the bad news didn\u2019t end there. A brain scan found telltale signs of vascular damage in Nicholls\u2019 brain, which occurs when the tiniest blood vessels are starved of oxygen. \u201cThe doctors said I had too many white matter lesions.\u00a0I told myself that since I now had my heart more or less under control, it was time to turn to my brain,\u201d Nicholls said. In January 2023, Nicholls became participant No. 34 in a novel clinical trial at Isaacson\u2019s Florida center. The trial is designed to uncover cognitive risk factors and counter them with a personalized plan of attack. (Full disclosure: I am participant No. 20 in the same trial; you can read about my experience here.) \u201cThe overall goal of the study is democratize access to preventive neurology care by eventually using at-home blood testing to cost-effectively reach the most people,\u201d Isaacson said. As part of the trial, Nicholls underwent a battery of tests, including a unique blood test that can track levels of amyloid, tau\u00a0and other\u00a0hallmark biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other degenerative conditions. Deposits of amyloid can begin accumulating in the brain decades before symptoms begin,\u00a0even in a person\u2019s 30s and 40s. \u201cSimon\u2019s first test came back with a score of 70. Anything over 58 was positive for amyloid in the brain,\u201d Isaacson said.\u00a0\u201cThe results backed up the amyloid PET scan Simon had taken in 2019, where I could see the plaque in his brain.\u201d 10,000 steps a day: \u2018I\u2019m very consistent\u2019 Nicholls needed to lose weight, so he began taking tirzepatide (the active ingredient in the medications Mounjaro and Zepbound), one of the newer injectable drugs that suppress appetite by stimulating hormones that control blood sugar levels. At the same time, Nicholls was encouraged to step up his physical activity by incorporating strength training three times a week while adding 45 to 60 minutes a day of zone 2 exercise, in which you briskly walk, ruck, jog or cycle at 60% to 70% of your heart rate. \u201cI love going for a walk every morning at sunrise for an hour and a half with a podcast. I get in 10,000 steps or more every day. I\u2019m very consistent,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cI also do a very slow full-body workout with weights three times a week for an hour\u2019s time.\u201d Avoiding sugar, artificial sweeteners, alcohol and ultraprocessed foods is a must, as is following a plant-based meal plan such as the Mediterranean diet. \u201cWhen I first saw Simon, he had a bit of a middle, like most guys in their 50s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen I saw him at nine weeks, I did a double take. He was totally buff, ripped even. \u201cWithin those nine weeks, he had lost 21 pounds, about 80% of that fat, and put on muscle, which was excellent,\u201d Isaacson added. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d The weight loss and increased muscle mass lowered Nicholls\u2019 fasting blood sugar levels, ending his march toward diabetes, while some tweaks to his cholesterol medications further optimized his good and bad cholesterol numbers. In August 2023, it was time to repeat the blood test for amyloid. By then, the company that administers the tests had added a measurement for tau, another key hallmark sign of Alzheimer\u2019s, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease. \u201cSimon\u2019s amyloid probability score on the new APS2 test had dropped to 53, which was phenomenal,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut he was still positive, as anything between 48 and 100 is considered to reflect a high probability of amyloid brain plaques on a brain scan.\u201d \u2018Turn on the screws\u2019 Now that the big concerns of cholesterol, insulin, diet, exercise and fat mass were addressed, it was time \u201cto turn on the screws,\u201d Isaacson said, with personalized recommendations based on Nicholls\u2019 biology. \u201cWe optimized Simon\u2019s omega-3 fatty acid levels, which is especially important for people with APOE \u03b54, as they need more omega-3. We also added B complex vitamins to control elevated homocysteine in his blood,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cHowever, we would not give B complex vitamins to anyone who did not have higher homocysteine levels.\u201d Elevated homocysteine, which is an amino acid used by the body to make protein, is a risk factor for brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. A September 2010 randomized controlled trial found that supplementation slowed brain atrophy in people with mild cognitive impairment. In the meantime, Nicholls, an avid researcher who loves to read medical journals, was adding some interventions of his own. \u201cI have steam and sauna rooms in my home, I do a lot of that. I love it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried cold water plunges, and I have lists of things to do I get from podcasts, from walking to sleeping to gratitude to yoga to sleep routines. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I do that Dr. Isaacson doesn\u2019t agree with: I get stem cell injections twice a year,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cSadly, I have arthritis in my hands, and that definitely feels better when I use stem cells, and I like to think they may be helping my brain, as well.\u201d There was one more big issue to tackle: Nicholls\u2019 sleep, or lack of it, which studies have shown can hasten cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s. With business around the world, Nicholls is a frequent flyer with \u201cterrible sleep\u201d due to jet lag and insomnia.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m also a worrier type of person,\u201d he confessed. Adding a sleep medication approved for insomnia helped, \u201cbut Simon really needs to tackle his sleep by improving his sleep hygiene with a more regular sleep schedule,\u201d Isaacson said. An unbelievable result On Halloween 2023, the next APS2 score arrived. Amazingly, Nicholls had reduced the amount of amyloid and tau in his blood to 40: He was testing negative in blood for signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. Shocked and amazed, Isaacson remained skeptical. \u201cI was very cautious. You know, promise not to overpromise. I needed to retest.\u201d A few days before Christmas, the repeat test results arrived. When it too was a negative finding of 40, Isaacson decided to tell Nicholls in person. \u201cDr. Isaacson drove all the way from Boca Raton to Miami excited, very happy,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cWe walked on a beach together, and we were ecstatic that we\u2019d actually been able go from positive to negative for amyloid.\u201d Although Nicholls is ecstatic about the improvements, he\u2019s also very humble about his efforts to improve his health. \u201cI\u2019m really not all that compliant. To comply is just horrendously difficult, right? Of course I want to have a beer or a hamburger or something stupid. I love gummy bears and eating crappy food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped that I have some great doctors to help me, but to be honest, my biggest motivator are my children,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cI\u2019d love to see my sons get married and have their own kids, and to do that, I have to put in the work to stay the way I am now.\u201d Even lower amyloid levels and a larger hippocampus It appears Nicholls is well on his way toward that goal. In March, his APS2 score had dropped to 25, an unbelievably low number. Not only was Nicholls blood negative for amyloid and tau, the test suggested that his brain amyloid might be normal, with no distinguishable signs of the disease. The only way to definitively prove this, however, would be to repeat his amyloid PET scan, Isaacson said. \u201cWhat really drove his score down was the amyloid value,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cIt normalized at .101, which is like crazy good. That\u2019s not matter for discussion; for amyloid, .1 or above is normal.\u201d Even more startling: Brain volume scans showed that the hippocampus, the tiny seahorse-shaped organ responsible for memory, had actually grown in volume in Nicholls\u2019 brain since he started the intervention. In early Alzheimer\u2019s stages, the hippocampus loses tissue rapidly and then atrophies as the disease progresses. Despite these amazing outcomes, Isaacson remains cautious. After all, this is one person, and similar findings have not been been replicated in a larger, more controlled sample and published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the term \u2018reverse\u2019 because I don\u2019t know what will happen if the person stops doing the intervention,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cI also don\u2019t know if the brain might normalize for a short period of time and then, five years later, catch up. Until I have more data, I don\u2019t think that reverse is the right word.\u201d That doesn\u2019t stop his wonder at the results and his gratitude to Nicholls for his continuing dedication to the study and the personalized interventions. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d seen this before, but only in people who are taking anti-amyloid medications,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen you work your entire career and are told by everyone, \u2018It\u2019s not possible to do this,\u2019 and then you see it \u2014 well, I\u2019m still humbled and amazed.\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s and brain health resources", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/health/alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_middleeast_egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn", "text": "Egypt\u2019s Great Pyramid and other ancient monuments at Giza exist on an isolated strip of land at the edge of the Sahara Desert. The inhospitable location has long puzzled archaeologists, some of whom had found evidence that the Nile River once flowed near these pyramids in some capacity, facilitating the landmarks\u2019 construction starting 4,700 years ago. Using satellite imaging and analysis of cores of sediment, a new study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment has mapped a 64-kilometer (40-mile) long, dried-up, branch of the Nile, long buried beneath farmland and desert. \u201cEven though many efforts to reconstruct the early Nile waterways have been conducted, they have largely been confined to soil sample collections from small sites, which has led to the mapping of only fragmented sections of the ancient Nile channel systems,\u201d said lead study author Eman Ghoneim, a professor and director of the Space and Drone Remote Sensing Lab at the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s department of Earth and ocean sciences. \u201cThis is the first study to provide the first map of the long-lost ancient branch of the Nile River.\u201d Ghoneim and her colleagues refer to this extinct branch of the Nile river as Ahramat, which is Arabic for pyramids. The ancient waterway would have been about 0.5 kilometers wide (about one-third of a mile) with a depth of at least 25 meters (82 feet) \u2014 similar to the contemporary Nile, Ghoneim said. \u201cThe large size and extended length of the Ahramat Branch and its proximity to the 31 pyramids in the study area strongly suggests a functional waterway of great importance,\u201d Ghoneim said. She said the river would have played a key role in ancient Egyptians\u2019 transportation of the enormous amount of building materials and laborers needed for the pyramids\u2019 construction. \u201cAlso, our research shows that many of the pyramids in the study area have (a) causeway, a ceremonial raised walkway, that runs perpendicular to the course of the Ahramat Branch and terminates directly on its riverbank.\u201d Hidden traces of a lost waterway Traces of the river aren\u2019t visible in aerial photos or in imagery from optical satellites, Ghoneim said. In fact, she only spotted something unexpected while studying radar satellite data of the wider area for ancient rivers and lakes that might reveal a new source of groundwater. \u201cI am a geomorphologist, a paleohydrologist\u00a0looking into landforms. I have this kind of trained eye,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile working with this data, I noticed this really obvious branch or a kind of riverbank, and it didn\u2019t make any sense because it is really far from the Nile,\u201d she added. Born and raised in Egypt, Ghoneim was familiar with the cluster of pyramids in this area and had always wondered why they were built there. She applied to the National Science Foundation to investigate further, and geophysical data taken at ground level with the use of ground-penetrating radar and electromagnetic tomography confirmed it was an ancient arm of the Nile. Two long cores of earth the team extracted using drilling equipment revealed sandy sediment consistent with a river channel at a depth of about 25 meters (82 feet). It\u2019s possible that \u201ccountless\u201d temples might still be buried beneath the agricultural fields and desert sands along the riverbank of the Ahramat Branch, according to the study. Why this branch of the river dried up or disappeared is still unclear. Most likely, a period of drought and desertification swept sand into the region, silting up the river, Ghoneim said. The study demonstrated that when the pyramids were built, the geography and riverscapes of the Nile differed significantly from those of today, said Nick Marriner, a geographer at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. He was not involved in the study but has conducted research on the fluvial history of Giza. \u201cThe study completes an important part of the past landscape puzzle,\u201d Marriner said. \u201cBy putting together these pieces we can gain a clearer picture of what the Nile floodplain looked like at the time of the pyramid builders and how the ancient Egyptians harnessed their environments to transport building materials for their monumental construction endeavors.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_health_genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Even if your genetics put you at greater risk for early death, a healthy lifestyle could help you significantly combat it, according to a new study. That risk could be mitigated by about 62% in people with a genetic predisposition, said lead author Dr. Xifeng Wu, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejiang Univeristy School of Medicine in China. Many studies have shown the connection between a healthy lifestyle and longevity and others have underscored the genetic component in lifespan, but the report published Monday in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine explored how the two come together. With data from more than 350,000 people and information on their genetics, education, socioeconomic status and disease history, this study had strong methodology, said Dr. Aladdin Shadyab, associate professor of public health and medicine at University of California San Diego. He was not involved in the research. The sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added. The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan. Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed. And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Wu, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University. Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed. \u201cAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,\u201d Wu said. The factors that made a difference The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan. But researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death. \u201cThe study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors \u2014 no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet \u2014 that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,\u201d Wu said. Adequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults. Moderate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Making lifestyle changes Building a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there. There are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking. A CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Committing to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of \u201cMindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,\u201d said in a previous CNN article. For a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly. When it comes to catching enough z\u2019s, if you can\u2019t seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you can\u2019t sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics. And if you\u2019ve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_08_27_health_sarin-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s some background information about sarin, a man-made nerve agent developed for chemical warfare.  Facts Sarin is a liquid that is clear, colorless, tasteless and odorless.  Sarin is an extremely volatile nerve agent because of its ability to change from liquid to gas.  If it evaporates into a gas, it can spread into the environment. Sarin\u2019s designation by NATO is GB. People are exposed to sarin through skin contact, eye contact or by breathing it in. Sarin can also be mixed with water or food. Sarin dissipates quickly, presenting an immediate but short-lived threat. Sarin\u2019s main ingredient is methyl phosphonyl difluoride. Effects Mild or moderately exposed people usually recover completely. Severely exposed people are not likely to survive. Symptoms of mild to moderate exposure include (from the CDC) Runny noseWatery eyesSmall, pinpoint pupilsEye painBlurred visionDrooling and excessive sweatingCoughChest tightnessRapid breathingDiarrheaIncreased urinationConfusionDrowsinessWeaknessHeadacheNausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal painSlow or fast heart rate Symptoms of severe exposure include Loss of ConsciousnessConvulsionsParalysisRespiratory failure possibly leading to death Treatment Leave the area of contamination as quickly as possible. Seek fresh air if exposure occurs indoors. If exposure is outdoors, head to higher ground as sarin is heavier than air and sinks. Remove contaminated clothing, flush eyes with water, and wash skin with soap and water.  If ingested, do not induce vomiting or flush with fluids.  Medical care should be sought immediately. Antidotes are available in many hospitals.  Timeline 1938 - Sarin is developed in Germany as a pesticide. April-May 1967 - The US military secretly tests sarin in the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve on the island of Hawaii. The testers detonate sarin-filled 155mm artillery shells to study how the nerve agent disperses in a tropical jungle. The Pentagon confirms the \u201cRed Oak\u201d program in November 2002. March 16, 1988 - The Iraqi air force attacks the northern Iraq town of Halabja with poison gases that were thought to include sarin, VX and other deadly compounds. Reports indicate that 5,000 people died in the attack. Countless others suffer eyesight loss, respiratory ailments and cancers.  June 27, 1994 - In Japan, seven people die and more than 500 are hospitalized when the Aum Supreme Truth (or Aum Shinri Kyo) cult releases sarin from a truck by driving slowly around an apartment complex in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture. Another victim dies in 2008.  March 20, 1995 - The Aum Supreme Truth cult, now known as Aleph, places plastic bags of sarin on trains that converge in the Tokyo government district during rush hour. Thirteen people die and more than 5,000 become ill. May 17, 2004 - A coalition convoy in Baghdad finds sarin gas in an artillery round that had been rigged as an improvised explosive device. The IED detonates as officials attempt to defuse it. Two members of the explosive ordinance team suffer minor exposure. June 23, 2006 - The US Army releases a report to Congress stating that allied forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions containing degraded mustard or sarin gas since the start of the Iraq War in 2003. The weapons were produced before the 1991 Gulf War. However, according to October 2014 reporting by the New York Times, even at the time of the report\u2019s publication the information was \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cunderstated.\u201d  June 15, 2012 - Katsuya Takahashi, 54, the last fugitive suspect in the 1995 sarin attacks on the Tokyo subway, is captured by Japanese police, ending a 17-year manhunt. April 25, 2013 - US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announces that Syria has used sarin on a small scale, killing 150 people in the country.   August 21, 2013 - A new alleged chemical weapons attack kills more than 1,000 people in the Syrian countryside outside its capital, Damascus. Hundreds of those killed are children. September 1, 2013 - US Secretary of State John Kerry announces that samples of blood and hair taken from eastern Damascus have \u201ctested positive for signatures of sarin.\u201d September 16, 2013 - UN weapons inspectors return \u201coverwhelming and indisputable\u201d evidence of the use of sarin in Syria, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says. January 4, 2016 - The UN releases a report that indicates Syrians may have been exposed to a sarin-type gas in 11 instances. The UN based its report on a publication by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Source of the gas and those responsible for its use are being investigated. April 4, 2017 - An airstrike on a rebel-held town in northwestern Syria leaves 89 civilians dead, including children, from a suspected chemical attack, using sarin gas. The US, Turkey and other Western states blame the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who vehemently denies the accusation. The following week, UK scientists claim to have evidence that sarin gas, or a similar substance, was used based on samples from victims. Investigations continue to confirm the gas used and those responsible. April 26, 2017 - French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault announces that samples taken from the attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun matched those from a previous incident, and that the evidence provides proof that the Syrian regime is responsible for carrying out the attack on April 4. July 2018 - Cult leader Shoko Asahara and twelve other members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult are executed for their roles in the 1995 Tokyo sarin attack. May 11, 2022 - In a study, researchers find that exposure to the nerve gas sarin may be the cause of Gulf War illness, a condition affecting US veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War.  July 7, 2023 \u2013 US president Joe Biden announces that the US military has destroyed the last of its stockpile of chemical weapons. The weapons, containing sarin, had been stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky since the 1940s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2013/08/27/health/sarin-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness", "text": "One may think young people are the main group enjoying the freedom of legalized weed, but in Canada, the greatest increase in users after legalization was among older adults \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s sending them to the hospital, according to new research. The rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults during the period of legalization of dried cannabis flower and edibles \u2014 October 2018 through December 2022 \u2014 in Canada was significantly higher than that of the pre-legalization period, according to a research letter published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Edibles, which include baked goods, candies and beverages, are increasingly popular, said lead research author Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician and clinician scientist at Sinai Health in Ontario. But some older adults may be unaware of the strength of today\u2019s weed, and little is known about the health effects of legalizing edible cannabis on older adults \u2014 the age group with the largest growth in overall cannabis use a year after dried cannabis flower was legalized in Canada, Stall said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an age-related bias that many health care practitioners, and frankly society, hold that older adults are not using drugs. And that\u2019s not true,\u201d Stall said. \u201cWe found that the largest increases in emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning among seniors occurred after edible cannabis became legal for retail sale in January 2020.\u201d The authors used the Ontario Ministry of Health\u2019s administrative data to examine the rates of emergency room visits for cannabis poisoning among older adults during the pre-legalization period \u2014 January 2015 to September 2018 \u2014 and the two legalization periods: October 2018 through December 2019, which permitted the sale of dried cannabis flower only, and January 2020 through December 2022, which marked the legalization of cannabis edibles. When people have cannabis poisoning, according to Stall, they may experience confusion; psychosis, including hallucinations; anxiety or panic attacks; rapid heartbeat; chest pain; nausea; and vomiting.\u00a0 During the eight-year study period, there were 2,322 emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults who were age 69 on average. Nearly 17% of those adults were simultaneously intoxicated with alcohol, about 38% had cancer and 6.5% had dementia. Compared with pre-legalization, legalization period No. 1 saw a twice higher rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning. The rate during the second legalization period tripled that of pre-legalization. \u201cThis study provides a cautionary tale of legalization of substances without adequate research, education, and counseling of users regarding adverse effects and safe usage, particularly in older adults,\u201d said Dr. Lona Mody and Dr. Sharon K. Inouye, who weren\u2019t involved in the research, in a commentary on the research. Mody is the Amanda Sanford Hickey Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Inouye is director of the Aging Brain Center at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research in Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The sneaky effects of edibles When it comes to explaining the higher rates, both unintentional and intentional use of edible cannabis are worth discussing, experts said. \u201cEdible cannabis products may be particularly dangerous because they are often indistinguishable from non-cannabis containing foods and may contain high amounts of THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), the major active ingredient in both medical and recreational cannabis,\u201d Mody and Inouye said. In his own practice, Stall has seen a common scenario resulting from the lack of distinction, he said: An emergency department doctor is not able to figure out why an older adult patient is neurologically impaired via any typical tests \u2014 only for a toxicology screen to come back positive for cannabis, much to the patient\u2019s surprise. \u201cThe other thing is that cannabis today is very different than cannabis was as recently as the early \u201990s and mid \u201980s,\u201d Stall explained. \u201cToday\u2019s cannabis extracts contain as much as 30 times more THC. \u2026 Older adults who may not have used cannabis in decades and are now trying again in this post-legalization era may not be aware.\u201d Additionally, age-related changes in organ function and how the drug is distributed throughout the body \u2014 as well as having health conditions or being on prescription drugs, especially psychoactive ones \u2014 can make it easier for an older adult to experience cannabis poisoning, Stall added. Some people who intentionally consume cannabis edibles may not be aware that this form has a more delayed effect than an inhalant, which goes straight to the bloodstream, he said. Thinking the edible isn\u2019t working, they take another one too soon and end up getting more than they bargained for. There are also people whose prescription medications for pain management, insomnia or dementia symptoms aren\u2019t effective, so they consume edibles for therapeutic purposes but without consulting a doctor first, Stall said. Reducing harm from cannabis use Abstaining from cannabis use may be \u201cappropriate\u201d for some individuals, but \u201cI would be hesitant to give a blanket recommendation (that) no other adults should be using this because there are people who are going to use it even if that recommendation is given,\u201d Stall said. Therefore, preventing cannabis-related harms in older adults requires a multipronged approach, he added, including storing cannabis edibles in locked locations and in clearly identified packaging. Products older adults intentionally use should have dosing information with specific guidance for older adults, \u201crecognizing that the amount of drug they may need is a lot less than younger populations,\u201d Stall said. \u201cIn geriatric medicine, we have a mantra: Start low and go slow. That same mantra applies here.\u201d The amount at which cannabis can become poisonous can depend on multiple personal factors, but some studies have indicated people should wait at least three hours before taking a second dose, Stall said. Health care providers should also have open and judgment-free conversations with older adults about cannabis use and its benefits and risks, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_world_stonehenge-moon-lunar-standstill-scn", "text": "To those gathering over the centuries at Stonehenge \u2014 the imposing prehistoric monument that has dominated Salisbury plain in southwest England for some 4,500 years \u2014 it was likely clear how the sun could have informed its design. The central axis of the stone circle was, and still is, aligned with the sunrise at midsummer and sunset at midwinter, the stones dramatically framing the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. But do Stonehenge and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge was linked in some way to the moon gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored, said Clive Ruggles, professor emeritus of archaeoastronomy in the school of archaeology and ancient history at the University of Leicester. This summer, archaeologists are using a little-known lunar phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years to investigate as part of their work in understanding why Stonehenge was built. Lunar standstill Like the sun, the moon rises in the east and set in the west. However, moonrise and moonset move from north to south and back again in the space of a month.\u00a0The northern and southern extremes also change over a period of about 18 and a half years. The lunar standstill is when the northernmost and southernmost moonrise and moonset are farthest apart. \u201cThe moon rise changes every day and if you track this for a month you\u2019d notice there is a northern and a southern limit beyond which the moon never rises (or sets),\u201d said Fabio Silva, senior lecturer in archaeological modeling at Bournemouth University via email. \u201cIf you were to look at these limits over 19 years you\u2019d notice them change like an accordion: they expand up to a maximum limit (the major lunar standstill) and then start contracting up to a minimum limit (the minor lunar standstill).\u201d This major lunar standstill is due to happen in January 2025, but from now until mid-2025, the moon may appear, to a casual observer, to be unusually low and high in the night sky during the lunar month. \u201cIf you\u2019re in one of those 19 years, then from time to time, you will see the moon rising or setting much further north or south than it does most times. In the years in between you never see it there,\u201d Ruggles said. Despite the phenomenon\u2019s name, the moon isn\u2019t actually standing still during this period, he said. \u201cWhat is standing still is these limits, and the moment of that happening is in January next year,\u201d Ruggles added. \u201cBut for about a year either side, if you happen to catch the moon rise at the right time, you\u2019re going to see the moon rising exceptionally low (in the sky).\u201d Stonehenge is made of two types of stone: larger sarsen stones and smaller bluestones that form two concentric circles. Ruggles said that Stonehenge\u2019s station stones, which form a rectangle around the circle, roughly align with the moon\u2019s extreme positions during the lunar standstill. How this lunar alignment was achieved, whether it was by design and its potential purpose are topics of debate that the team wants to investigate. Probing Stonehenge\u2019s celestial connections While there are no written documents that shed light on Stonehenge\u2019s meaning and significance, archaeologists have long believed its solar alignments were intentional. Such alignments have been identified in many places around the world and would have been relatively easy for ancient builders to identify, given that knowledge of the sun\u2019s yearly cycle and its connection to the seasons would have been essential to livelihood. However, it\u2019s much more difficult to say whether Stonehenge really has a connection to the lunar standstill. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say definitively, but for me, there are some bits of evidence that made me think that it was deliberate,\u201d Ruggles said. One clue was the fact that archaeologists have found cremated human remains clustered in the southeast, near where the southernmost moonrise will take place. \u201cI think there there\u2019s a possibility that they were aware of that direction of the moon and then that became some sort of sacred direction,\u201d Ruggles said. Since April, Ruggles and Silva, along with colleagues from Bournemouth University, the University of Oxford and English Heritage, the organization that manages the site, have been documenting the moonrise and moonset at key moments when the moon is in alignment with the station stones. The moon was expected to align with the station stone rectangle twice a month from about February 2024 to November 2025, Silva said. \u201cThis will happen at different times of day and night around the year, with the moon being at the right place on different phases each month,\u201d Silva said in a news release in April. The team wants to understand what patterns of light and shadow the moon creates at Stonehenge and whether they might have held meaning to the people who built and used the monument. Other monuments with possible lunar link Stonehenge isn\u2019t the only megalithic monument potentially linked to the lunar standstill. In the United States, Erica Ellingson, emeritus professor of astrophysics at the University of Colorado Boulder, is investigating lunar alignments at Chimney Rock, a rocky ridge about 1,000 feet above a valley floor in Colorado. The landmark features two large pillar-like rocks that frame the horizon. Between the years 900 and 1150, ancestors of the Pueblo people built multi-storied buildings and ritual spaces on this difficult-to-access high place, with its dramatic view, Ellington said, and it remains an important site to the 26 Native American groups that have traditional or cultural ties to the area. \u201cThe extraordinary view of the sky between the twin pinnacles suggests an astronomical connection, but the gap is slightly too far north for the Sun to ever shine through it. The Moon, however, can be seen to rise there when it is close to its most extreme northern position, during the major lunar standstill season,\u201d she said via email. Further evidence of moon-watching comes from tree-ring dating of wooden beams in the nearby ancient buildings, which indicates their construction is linked with the dates of lunar standstills nearly 1,000 years ago, she added. The Calanais Standing Stones, situated on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland and erected before Stonehenge, may also have a link with the lunar standstill, Ruggles said. Bradley Schaefer, professor emeritus in the department of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University, said he was deeply skeptical that ancient people were aware of the lunar standstill and built monuments aligned with it. More likely, he suggested, it was a coincidence. \u201cEvery ancient site has dozens-to-hundreds of potential sightlines, and one-or-more will always point somewhere near to one of the 8 standstill directions,\u201d he said via email. The lunar standstill is hard for a casual observer of the moon to recognize, he added, and is only really visible in detailed data on observations of the moonrise and moonset. While the shift in the moon\u2019s position is subtle and historical records documenting the lunar standstill are rare and difficult to interpret, Ellington said she thinks the link is plausible because many ancient people watched the sky very closely. \u201cA moon-watcher would have seen the moon start to rise or set outside of these limits, moving farther and farther out of bounds as the major lunar standstill approached,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/world/stonehenge-moon-lunar-standstill-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness", "text": "Eating a vegan, vegetarian or lacto-ovo vegetarian diet significantly reduces the overall risk of developing cancer, heart disease and dying early from cardiovascular disease, according to a new \u201cumbrella\u201d analysis of more than 20 years of research. An umbrella review looks at existing metanalyses of large numbers of studies, providing a high-level view of existing research on a topic. In addition to lowering cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, the umbrella analysis found a \u201cprotective effect\u201d for specific cancers, including \u201cliver, colon, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, melanoma, kidney and non-Hodgkin lymphoma,\u201d said lead author Dr. Angelo Capodici, a graduate student in health science, technology and management at Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna in Pisa, Italy. Vegetarians don\u2019t eat any animal flesh, while the lacto-ovo version of vegetarianism allows dairy products and eggs while excluding all meat, poultry and fish. Veganism, the stricter form of vegetarianism, bans any food products made from meat, poultry and seafood as well as any animal by-products such as gelatin. However, the protective nature of the diets could be sabotaged if poor dietary choices were made, the study authors said via email. \u201cDiets that emphasize consumption of unhealthy plant foods, such as fruit juices, refined grains, potato chips, and even sodas\u201d might counter the positives of a plant-based diet for health, said study coauthor Dr. Federica Guaraldi, medical director of the pituitary unit at the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna in Italy. Fruit juices, which are \u201cfull of sugars or sweetener,\u201d Guaraldi said, \u201c(were) recently demonstrated to have detrimental impact on metabolism as much as or even more than white sugar.\u201d Results may be affected by other lifestyle factors Researchers have long known that people who follow plant-based diets often live healthier lives full of exercise and an avoidance of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains, snacks, alcohol and tobacco, the study said. \u201cWhat is attributed to diet here may be in part due to other lifestyle practices,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThat is a minor concern, however,\u201d Katz said in an email. \u201cThe net effect of plant-predominant dietary patterns is clearly favorable to crucial health outcomes even if some of the observed benefit is attributable to other lifestyle practices.\u201d In fact, adopting a plant-based diet, even without additional exercise, could still yield health benefits, according to a November study on twins by Christopher Gardner, one of the coauthors of the umbrella analysis published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. In the 2023 study, healthy twins who ate a vegan diet for eight weeks had lower \u201cbad\u201d\u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, better\u00a0blood sugar levels and\u00a0greater weight loss\u00a0than siblings who ate a diet of meat and vegetables, according to Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in Palo Alto, California. \u201cThere was a 10% to 15% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 25% drop in insulin, and a 3% drop in body weight in just eight weeks, all by eating real food without animal products,\u201d Gardner told CNN at the time. One reason for that may be the nutritional boost that plants provide, including high levels of vitamins, minerals and other substances with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, while also reducing the inflammatory impact of meat and processed food, the authors said. \u201cPlants have more fiber (animal foods have zero), less saturated fat and zero cholesterol (all animal foods have cholesterol),\u201d Gardner said in an email. \u201cAn entirely separate category is phytochemicals (literally, \u2018plant chemicals\u2019) such as antioxidants. By definition there are no phytochemicals in animal foods.\u201d No meat, poultry or seafood, but dairy and eggs are OK The new review analyzed 48 metanalyses that had investigated the impact of eating a vegetarian or vegan diet on the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease and early death. \u201cWe analyzed reviews considering\u00a0vegan and vegetarian diets that completely exclude(ed) meat, poultry and seafood,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Davide Gori, an associate professor of biomedical and neuromotor sciences at the University of Bologna in Italy. \u201cTo be more precise regarding vegetarian diets, lacto-vegetarian (allowing certain dairy products such as yogurt, cheese and milk), ovo-vegetarian (allowing whole eggs, egg whites and egg-containing foods such as mayonnaise, egg noodles and certain baked goods), (and) lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets were included,\u201d Gori said in an email. However, vegetarian diets limiting but not completely excluding certain types of meat and fish, such as pesco- or pollo-vegetarian diets, were excluded, he said. The review found eating these plant-based diets reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and inflammation by affecting risk factors such as body mass index, fasting glucose and other measures of blood sugar control, and the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) measurements of blood pressure. The diets also significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and \u201cC-reactive protein \u2014 an index of inflammation that is typically higher in cardiovascular and metabolic disease,\u201d Gori said. Metabolic disease is a constellation of symptoms such as obesity, high blood pressure and poor control of cholesterol and blood sugars that can all lead to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. However, there was no benefit in eating plants for pregnant women, an \u201cintriguing finding\u201d that needs further research, said Guaraldi of the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences. It\u2019s also possible that the hormones of pregnancy might affect findings, and \u201cwe cannot rule out that participants have taken supplements during the study period that could have altered the impact of diet on the considered parameters.\u201d Special considerations of plant-based diets Because certain vitamin and minerals are more easily found and absorbed from meat, dairy or fish, vegetarians and vegans must take extra precautions to add those into their diets, experts say. Unless the diet is carefully optimized, additional sources of B12, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin D may be needed to avoid a deficiency, according to the Mayo Clinic. \u201cStrictly vegan diets can be deficient in vitamin B12,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThis is easily resolved by consuming foods fortified with (vitamin) B12 \u2014 easy to do because the recommended daily allowance for B12 is lower than any other vitamin or mineral. \u201cIron is another nutrient that is harder to get from a fully vegan diet,\u201d Gardner added. \u201cMany plant foods are relatively high in iron (beans/legumes). Again, supplements can be helpful.\u201d Protein is also a challenge, but good sources in plants include legumes such as lentils, chickpeas and beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains and soy products such as edamame, tempeh and tofu. Processed meat substitutes are options as well, experts say, but due to the processing can be packed with sodium, so read labels carefully.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_01_11_health_short-attention-span-wellness", "text": "I\u2019ve been working steadily for hours but feel as if I haven\u2019t even started. My attention is being pulled from my assigned task \u2014 writing this story \u2014 by a myriad of what I believe are necessary work interruptions. (OK, a couple were from my cat, who also firmly believes in their necessity.)   My kids and I call days like this \u201csquirrel days\u201d in honor of Dug, the talking dog in (squirrel !!) the 2009 Pixar movie \u201cUp,\u201d who (squirrel !!) was constantly distracted by well, just about (squirrel !!) \u2026 Unfortunately, all too many of us are having \u201csquirrel\u201d days, according to Dr. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who studies how digital media affects our lives. In her book \u201cAttention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity,\u201d Mark explains how decades of research have tracked the decline of the ability to focus. \u201cIn 2004, we measured the average attention on a screen to be 2\u00bd minutes,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSome years later, we found attention spans to be about 75 seconds. Now we find people can only pay attention to one screen for an average of 47 seconds.\u201d Not only do people concentrate for less than a minute on any one screen, Mark said, but when attention is diverted from an active work project, they take about 25 minutes to refocus on that task. (Wait, what??) \u201cIn fact, our research shows it takes 25 minutes, 26 seconds, before we go back to the original working sphere or project,\u201d Mark said. Why you have a short attention span How can that be? \u201cIf we look at work in terms of switching projects, as opposed to the micro view of switching screens, we find people spend about 10\u00bd  minutes in any work project before being interrupted \u2014 internally or by someone else \u2014 and then switch to another work project,\u201d Mark said. Yes, but then we go back to the original work, right? Wrong, Mark said. Instead, when we are interrupted on project two, we switch yet again to a different task \u2014 call it project three. Unbelievably, her research has shown we are also interrupted on project three and move on to project four.   \u201cAnd then you go back and pick up the original interrupted project,\u201d Mark said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019re interrupted and you do nothing. For over 25 minutes, you\u2019re actually working on other things.\u201d  (At least I can tell my boss that when I miss my deadline.) \u201cHowever, there\u2019s also a switch cost,\u201d Mark added. \u201cA switch cost is the time it takes you to reorient back to your work: \u2018Where was I? What was I thinking of?\u2019 That additional effort can also lead to errors and stress.\u201d How to focus Why is all of this a problem? After all, it\u2019s called multitasking, thought by many to be a highly prized skill for coping with the demands of the information age.  \u201cWith the exception of a few rare individuals, there is no such thing as multitasking,\u201d Mark said. \u201cUnless one of the tasks is automatic, like chewing gum or walking, you cannot do two effortful things at the same time.\u201d For example, she said, you can\u2019t read email and be in a video meeting. When you focus on one thing, you lose the other. \u201cYou\u2019re actually switching your attention very quickly between the two,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd when you switch your attention fast, it\u2019s correlated with stress.\u201d  Blood pressure rises. Heart rate speeds up. Psychological measures of stress also show negative outcomes, she said, such as more fatigue and mistakes and less productivity: \u201cThe more people multitask, the more errors they make.\u201d  Who did this to us? We did, of course, with the help of tech culprits such as social media, tablets and television. But Mark blames email the most.    \u201cTo me, email is probably the worst because it\u2019s become a symbol of work,\u201d she said, adding that her research has found a direct correlation between email and more stress. \u201cWe cut off email for some workers in an organization for one workweek,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing heart rate monitors, we found that they became significantly less stressed and were able to focus significantly longer.\u201d  (I find myself pausing to look up flights to Bora Bora. Oh, right. They have email there, too.) \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a person can just completely cut off from technology and work in today\u2019s world,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSo let\u2019s learn how to live with it in a way that maintains our positive well-being.\u201d How to increase your attention span Regaining your focus requires you to be mindful of how you are using technology, Mark said, a daunting task if you consider the average American spends at least 10 hours a day on screens. Paradoxically, you can use technology to help, she said. Schedule rote work for the first part of the day when you\u2019re not fully alert, then use technology to block distractions when you\u2019re at your mental best. At night, offload tasks from your brain by writing them down and then put the list away. Distracted by social media sites? Hide them, Mark said: \u201cTake the icons off your desktop and bury the apps on your phone inside folders, where it takes an extra effort to find them. Leave your phone in another room or put it in a drawer and lock it.\u201d    It\u2019s also important to learn when to take a break. \u201cIf you have to read something more than once or if the words are just not registering, it\u2019s time to stop and replenish,\u201d she said. The best break is a walk in nature: \u201cJust a 20-minute walk in nature can help significantly relax people,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd we found it can help people produce significantly more ideas \u2014 it\u2019s called divergent thinking.\u201d Too cold to walk outside? Do something engaging that takes no mental effort. \u201cI have a friend who is an MIT professor, and his favorite activity is matching socks,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnother friend likes to iron. Ideas can incubate and then we come back to the hard work, and we see it with fresh eyes.\u201d  ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/01/11/health/short-attention-span-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}

The acronym\u00a0BORG stands for\u00a0\u201cblackout rage gallon,\u201d according to the\u00a0National Capital Poison Center in Washington, DC.\u00a0The term\u00a0refers to a concoction\u00a0often prepared in a gallon-size plastic jug that typically contains\u00a0vodka\u00a0or other distilled alcohol, water, a flavor enhancer and an electrolyte powder or drink.\u00a0BORGs are often drunk at outside day parties, otherwise known as darties.

The large-batch drink is the new version of jungle juice, according to Sabrina Grimaldi, the creator\u00a0and editor-in-chief\u00a0of online lifestyle magazine\u00a0The Zillennial\u00a0Zine. The publication targets the\u00a0micro-generation\u00a0between millennials and Gen Z. \u201cInstead of making a party-sized mixed drink in a huge 5-gallon drink dispenser, a giant storage tub, or even the grossest trend, which was making jungle juice in a sink or bathtub, everyone has their own personal drink,\u201d Grimaldi wrote CNN in an email.\u00a0As the drink\u2019s name\u00a0suggests,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s intended to get you extremely drunk.\u201d What Lembke calls the BORG\u2019s \u201csocial contagion factor\u201d makes it even more dangerous. \u201cKids see other kids doing it and want to try it themselves,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s another real danger here \u2014 to take a dangerous deviant behavior and normalize it by spreading it on social media.\u201d Gen Z binge drinking Grimaldi, who is 24, first heard about BORGs earlier this year when her editorial intern, Kelly Xiong, 21, pitched her a\u00a0story\u00a0on the topic of why they are so popular among Gen\u00a0Zers. \u201cI graduated college in 2020 so it\u2019s safe to say I haven\u2019t been a part of the college party scene in almost 5 years (especially because of the pandemic),\u201d Grimaldi said.\u00a0\u201cEven though Kelly and I are so close in age, it\u2019s crazy how these microtrends pop up.\u201d Xiong, who\u00a0just graduated from\u00a0the University of Pittsburgh, first learned about BORGs during her sophomore year at college. \u201cIt was during a St. Patrick\u2019s Day block darty,\u00a0and almost everyone had their own BORG,\u201d she told CNN\u00a0via email, adding that the drink is particularly popular at big outdoor day parties or\u00a0\u201cspecial occasion darties.\u201d While the origins of the term are difficult to trace, BORGs have made headlines, including in March 2023 when\u00a0more than two dozen University of Massachusetts Amherst\u00a0students, many of whom were believed to be carrying BORGS, were carried away by ambulance following an off-campus event. High school students are drinking BORGs The trend is not limited to the college demographic. At the high school senior\u00a0class pool party\u00a0last year and this year, \u201ceveryone made their own\u00a0BORG,\u201d said Virginia, 18, a senior at a private high school in Tampa, Florida, who didn\u2019t want her real name used to protect her privacy. Virginia said one of the reasons BORGs appeal to her is the social aspect. \u201cYou have to name your BORG and get creative by writing the name on it with a Sharpie,\u201d she said. BORG posts starring gallon jugs with punny names such as Captain Borgan, Our Borg and Savior, Borgan Donor and Borgan Wallen proliferate on TikTok. Thinking along those lines is part of what makes BORGs potentially dangerous to the people turning to them as a party drink, Lembke said. Virginia said she recognizes the dangers of drinking BORGs. \u201cA lot of people just pour vodka in and don\u2019t measure it, so it can actually be kind of dangerous as opposed to knowing you drank three cans of beer,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cNobody is really rationing how much they\u2019re going to drink.\u201d That\u2019s true even if the person is 21, the legal age to drink in the United States, or older. A\u00a0standard drink\u00a0in the US\u00a0contains\u00a01 to 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer, according to the National Institutes of Health.\u00a0For females, drinking more than four standard drinks (and for males, more than five) over a two-hour time frame is considered a binge,\u00a0according to the NIH. \u201cA BORG often contains a fifth (25.6 fluid ounces or 3.2 cups)\u00a0of vodka or other hard alcohol, which is about 17 standard drinks, which is a massive amount of alcohol,\u201d Lembke said. No amount of alcohol is good for you It\u2019s actually best not to drink alcohol at all, as\u00a0a number of recent studies have found that\u00a0no amount of drinking is healthy. The\u00a0World Heart Federation published a policy brief in 2022 saying there is \u201cno level of\u00a0alcohol consumption that is safe for health.\u201d If you do drink, health experts encourage moderation.\u00a0That\u2019s no more than 3 ounces of alcohol for women or 4 ounces for men over the course of a day, according to the\u00a02020-2025\u00a0Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Lembke also recommended not making a regular habit of it. The liver processes about 1 ounce of alcohol per hour, or roughly one standard drink per hour, Lembke said. Depending on the alcohol quantity in the mix, drinking a BORG\u00a0\u201ctotally overwhelms the capacity of the liver to metabolize it,\u201d especially for somebody who\u2019s not already tolerant to alcohol, Lembke said. The fact that BORGS are usually sweetened with a diluting agent such as electrolyte drinks or water flavor enhancers only makes them more dangerous, she said. \u201cIt makes it more palatable, and people generally can drink more than they could of something like straight vodka,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t increase the liver\u2019s ability to metabolize alcohol better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/borg-blackout-rage-gallon-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_medical-residents-abortion-restrictions-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "Isabella Rosario Blum was wrapping up medical school and considering residency programs to become a family practice physician when she got some frank advice: If she wanted to be trained to provide abortions, she shouldn\u2019t stay in Arizona. Blum turned to programs mostly in states where abortion access \u2014 and, by extension, abortion training \u2014 is likely to remain protected, like California, Colorado, and New Mexico. Arizona has enacted a law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. \u201cI would really like to have all the training possible,\u201d she said, \u201cso of course that would have still been a limitation.\u201d In June, she will start her residency at Swedish Cherry Hill hospital in Seattle. According to new statistics from the Association of American Medical Colleges, for the second year in a row, students graduating from U.S. medical schools were less likely to apply this year for residency positions in states with abortion bans and other significant abortion restrictions. Since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, state fights over abortion access have created plenty of uncertainty for pregnant patients and their doctors. But that uncertainty has also bled into the world of medical education, forcing some new doctors to factor state abortion laws into their decisions about where to begin their careers. Fourteen states, primarily in the Midwest and South, have banned nearly all abortions.\u00a0The new analysis by the AAMC\u00a0\u2014 a preliminary copy of which was exclusively reviewed by KFF Health News before its public release \u2014 found that the number of applicants to residency programs in states with near-total abortion bans declined by 4.2%, compared with a 0.6% drop in states where abortion remains legal. Notably, the AAMC\u2019s findings illuminate the broader problems abortion bans can create for a state\u2019s medical community, particularly in an era of provider shortages: The organization tracked a larger decrease in interest in residencies in states with abortion restrictions not only among those in specialties most likely to treat pregnant patients, like OB-GYNs and emergency room doctors, but also among aspiring doctors in other specialties. \u201cIt should be concerning for states with severe restrictions on reproductive rights that so many new physicians \u2014 across specialties \u2014 are choosing to apply to other states for training instead,\u201d wrote Atul Grover, executive director of the AAMC\u2019s Research and Action Institute. The AAMC analysis found the number of applicants to OB-GYN residency programs in abortion ban states dropped by 6.7%, compared with a 0.4% increase in states where abortion remains legal. For internal medicine, the drop observed in abortion ban states was over five times as much as in states where abortion is legal. In its analysis, the AAMC said an ongoing decline in interest in ban states among new doctors ultimately \u201cmay negatively affect access to care in those states.\u201d Jack Resneck Jr., immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said the data demonstrates yet another consequence of the post-Roe v. Wade\u00a0era. The AAMC analysis notes that even in states with abortion bans, residency programs are filling their positions \u2014 mostly because there are more graduating medical students in the U.S. and abroad than there are residency slots. Still, Resneck said, \u201cwe\u2019re extraordinarily worried.\u201d For example, physicians without adequate abortion training may not be able to manage miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, or potential complications such as infection or hemorrhaging that could stem from pregnancy loss. Those who work with students and residents say their observations support the AAMC\u2019s findings. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to go to a place where evidence-based practice and human rights in general are curtailed,\u201d said Beverly Gray, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine. Abortion in North Carolina is banned in nearly all cases after 12 weeks. Women who experience unexpected complications or discover their baby has potentially fatal birth defects later in pregnancy may not be able to receive care there. Gray said she worries that even though Duke is a highly sought training destination for medical residents, the abortion ban \u201cimpacts whether we have the best and brightest coming to North Carolina.\u201d Rohini Kousalya Siva will start her obstetrics and gynecology residency at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., this year. She said she did not consider programs in states that have banned or severely restricted abortion, applying instead to programs in Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, and Washington, D.C. \u201cWe\u2019re physicians,\u201d said Kousalya Siva, who attended medical school in Virginia and was previously president of the American Medical Student Association. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be giving the best evidence-based care to our patients, and we can\u2019t do that if we haven\u2019t been given abortion training.\u201d Another consideration: Most graduating medical students are in their 20s, \u201cthe age when people are starting to think about putting down roots and starting families,\u201d said Gray, who added that she is noticing many more students ask about politics during their residency interviews. And because most young doctors make their careers in the state where they do their residencies, \u201cpeople don\u2019t feel safe potentially having their own pregnancies living in those states\u201d with severe restrictions, said Debra Stulberg, chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Chicago. Stulberg and others worry that this self-selection away from states with abortion restrictions will exacerbate the shortages of physicians in rural and underserved areas. \u201cThe geographic misalignment between where the needs are and where people are choosing to go is really problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people further concentrating in urban areas where there\u2019s already good access.\u201d After attending medical school in Tennessee, which has adopted one of the most sweeping abortion bans in the nation, Hannah Light-Olson will start her OB-GYN residency at the University of California-San Francisco this summer. It was not an easy decision, she said. \u201cI feel some guilt and sadness leaving a situation where I feel like I could be of some help,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel deeply indebted to the program that trained me, and to the patients of Tennessee.\u201d Light-Olson said some of her fellow students applied to programs in abortion ban states \u201cbecause they think we need pro-choice providers in restrictive states now more than ever.\u201d In fact, she said, she also applied to programs in ban states when she was confident the program had a way to provide abortion training. \u201cI felt like there was no perfect, 100% guarantee; we\u2019ve seen how fast things can change,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel particularly confident that California and New York aren\u2019t going to be under threat, too.\u201d As a condition of a scholarship she received for medical school, Blum said, she will have to return to Arizona to practice, and it is unclear what abortion access will look like then. But she is worried about long-term impacts. \u201cResidents, if they can\u2019t get the training in the state, then they\u2019re probably less likely to settle down and work in the state as well,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_05_15_health_internet-greater-well-being-study-wellness", "text": "The internet is ruining our lives, right? Not necessarily, according to a new study. \u201cNearly everyone seems to think that internet-powered technologies are driving an epidemic of ill-being and mental health problems,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Matti Vuorre, assistant professor of social psychology at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, in an email. \u201cOur study of over two million individuals from 160+ countries runs contrary to this idea.\u201d People with access to home internet and/or mobile internet and actively use internet report greater well-being across eight different categories \u2014 including life satisfaction and social life, according to a study published Monday in the journal Technology, Mind, and Behavior. Researchers analyzed data from nearly 2.5 million people across 168 countries using the annual Gallup World Poll, trying to answer the following question: Do individuals who have access and actively use the internet report greater or lower levels of well-being than those who do not? \u201cBecause even such a simple question can be statistically answered in many different ways, we analyzed the data in tens of thousands of different ways,\u201d he added. Across all those ways of crunching the numbers, about 85% showed that those who have and use the internet report greater well-being that those who do not, according to the research. The global perspective is useful, and the data analysis of the research is strong, said Dr. Markus Appel, professor of the psychology of communication and new media at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany. He was not involved in the research. Other research has shown that the connection between mobile internet use and well-being is complex and varies among individuals, he added. \u201cThe internet is neither a curse (nor) a blessing for people\u2019s well-being,\u201d Appel said. \u201cIt depends on what people do with it.\u201d Online users report greater well-being This study was observational, meaning that the data doesn\u2019t show that the internet access necessarily caused the better well-being \u2014 there might be other factors responsible for the association. \u201cOur results might then simply indicate that individuals with more money, access to healthcare, etc, report greater well-being,\u201d Vuorre said in an email. The researchers accounted for that in their data and tried to adjust for factors such as income levels and still found that internet users reported greater well-being than those non-internet users, Vuorre said. Cut the internet or keep scrolling? The internet is used for a wide variety of things \u2014 including online banking, shopping, finding services, reading the news and cyberbullying \u2014 and those different uses will have different effects on well-being, Vuorre said. Much of life has moved online very quickly, and it hasn\u2019t left much time to investigate all the impacts of the internet, he added. \u201cWe as a society and/or academic scientists don\u2019t have time to sufficiently learn and develop methodology to address each panic carefully and therefore do not learn sufficiently to be able to inform policy and make conclusions with confidence,\u201d Vuorre said. \u201cCaution is warranted on all sides.\u201d Many studies have shown concerning connections between social media use and mental health, particularly among younger people. Scrolling through images of other people\u2019s lives and comparing them with your own has been associated with a poor effect on mood, for example. Before institutions advise harsh limitations on computers and mobile phones, more research is needed on both the potential harms and benefits, Vuorre said. \u201cAlthough prominent narratives and the cautionary principle might suggest draconian limitations to technology use, ours and many other findings provide a much more nuanced and mixed view,\u201d he added. To get the best out of your internet use, Appel recommends being mindful of your own experience. \u201cIf you sense that some activity on the internet makes you feel sad or envious \u2014 stop it. Look out for something else,\u201d Appel added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/internet-greater-well-being-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness", "text": "Eating enough healthy fats is great for brain and heart health, but new research has possibly provided even more evidence for adding them \u2014 particularly omega-3s \u2014 to your diet. \u201cWe found that a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is associated with a greater risk of dying,\u201d said Yuchen Zhang, lead author of the April study published in the journal eLife, in a news release. Zhang is a doctoral student in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia\u2019s College of Public Health. Omega-3 fatty acids are naturally found in foods including fish \u2014 especially fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines \u2014 as well as flaxseed, walnuts, chia seeds and in dietary supplements such as fish oil. The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA; eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA; and docosahexaenoic acid, known as DHA, according to the National Institutes of Health. The body must obtain all three from foods, and omega-3s contribute to the health of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system and endocrine system. Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, on the other hand, include nuts, seeds, corn and soy \u2014 and the oils and preservatives produced from these foods, the authors said. Linoleic acid is the most common omega-6 fatty acid.\u00a0 \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that the high omega-6 to omega-3 fats ratio typical of Western diets \u2014 20:1 or even higher, compared to an estimated 1:1 during most of human evolution \u2014 contributes to many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and autoimmune disorders,\u201d Zhang said. But the results of past studies have been mixed, she added, and few have investigated the role of an imbalance in mortality. Also, accurately measuring fatty acid intake is difficult, partly due to reliance on participants\u2019 own recollections of their dietary intake. Zhang and the other researchers looked into the associations between the omega-3/omega-6 ratio in blood plasma \u2014 a more objective measure \u2014 and death from any cause and specifically from cancer or cardiovascular disease, the top two leading causes of death worldwide. They used data from 85,425 people who had participated in the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than half a million people between ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom for at least a decade. Participants, whose plasma samples were collected between 2007 and 2010, had answered questionnaires about their diet, including whether they took fish oil supplements. After nearly 13 years of follow-up, the authors found participants with the highest ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 were 26% more likely to die early from any cause, 14% more likely to die from cancer and 31% more likely to die from heart disease than those with the lowest ratios. Considered individually, both high levels of omega-6 and omega-3 were linked with a lower risk of premature death. But the protective effects of omega-3 were greater, likely explaining \u201cwhy having a high ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s was linked to harm,\u201d the authors said. Despite the findings, the study is \u201conly one \u2018snapshot\u2019 in time of biomarkers and dietary intake of omega 3s and 6s. This is correlation, not causation,\u201d said Dr. Lauren R. Sastre, director of the Farm to Clinic Program and assistant professor in the department of nutrition science at East Carolina University, via email. Sastre wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cAnd even that relationship cannot be strongly supported due to methodological flaws in not considering other dietary components to the overall health/clinical outcomes,\u201d Sastre added. \u201cThere are many anti-inflammatory food components (nutrients, phytochemicals, etc.) that are associated with reducing all-cause, cancer and (cardiovascular disease) mortality, and to only evaluate omega 3s and 6s \u2014 strong confounders may be present that would bias the results.\u201d Managing healthy fat intake If the omega-6/omega-3 balance actually does have more to do with premature death risk than the study has the capacity to prove, it could be due to the possible function of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of \u201cRegenerative Health: Discover Your Metabolic Type and Renew Your Liver for Life.\u201d Arachidonic acid is what the body converts from linoleic acid. It\u2019s a \u201cbuilding block for molecules that can promote inflammation, blood clotting, and the constriction of blood vessels,\u201d according to Harvard Health. But this fatty acid can also be converted into molecules that fight inflammation and blood clots. Omega-6s aren\u2019t inherently bad, but having too many may offset the anti-inflammatory factors associated with omega-3, Kirkpatrick said, so \u201ca more balanced approach \u2026 may be favorable.\u201d \u201cThe source of the omega 6s may also be a factor in offsetting the balance as well,\u201d she added via email. \u201cProcessed seed oils may also contain high amounts of omega 6s for example.\u201d Focusing on this balance and increasing your intake of foods rich in omega-3s can be more important than simply limiting those high in omega-6s, Kirkpatrick said. \u201cI would also look at the quality of the omega 6 foods in the diet,\u201d she added, \u201caiming for whole foods \u2026 rather than more processed products that may contain large amounts via the addition of seed oils.\u201d If you\u2019re curious what your blood plasma ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is, ask your physician about testing for it. In Kirkpatrick\u2019s practice, she often works with her patients\u2019 doctors for this purpose. Some patients request it with the goal of improving their mental health, heart health or risk of dementia, she said. Overall, \u201cit\u2019s important to note that an unbalanced ratio is only one chapter in our story of better or worse health span,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cGetting a variety of fiber-rich foods (beneficial to the microbiome) and other nutrient-dense foods, as well as adequate, good-quality sleep, stress management and physical activity play a large role in how long we will enjoy good health within our lifetime.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_microplastics-testicles-study-wellness", "text": "Human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas, a new small study found. \u201cThese plastics are often nano-scale, typically less than half a micron in length and maybe like 20 to 200 nanometers in width,\u201d said toxicologist Matthew Campen, coauthor of the study that published May 15 in the journal Toxicological Sciences. \u201cThey look like little shards, tiny broken bits from very, very old plastics,\u201d said Campen, a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Such minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, interrupting cellular processes and potentially depositing\u00a0endocrine-disrupting chemicals\u00a0such as\u00a0bisphenols,\u00a0phthalates,\u00a0flame retardants,\u00a0per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and\u00a0heavy metals. Endocrine disruptors interfere with the human reproductive system, leading to genital and reproductive malformations as well as female infertility and a decline in sperm count, according to the Endocrine Society. In fact, sperm counts in parts of the world, including the United States, have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, the society stated on its website. \u201cThis is an eyes wide open situation right now,\u201d Campen said. \u201cWe\u2019re just now realizing how much plastic is in our bodies. We need a surge of research around this topic to confirm or deny a role for microplastics in driving infertility, testicular cancer and other cancers.\u201d \u2018Action is desperately needed now\u2019 The new study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d Polyethylene, one of the most widely used plastics in the world, was the predominant type of polymer in both species, followed by PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, another commonly used chemical that can contain chemical additives and heavy metals including phthalates, cadmium and lead. Phthalates, called\u00a0 \u201ceverywhere chemicals\u201d because they are so common, are added to consumer products to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break. Researchers expected to find more plastic shards in the testicles of older men in the study, but that wasn\u2019t the case, Campen said. \u201cIt seems that in peak reproductive years for men, which is from 20 to 45, there are higher levels of plastics, which then begin to decline after the age of 55,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests the human body can eliminate these plastics.\u201d But there is a downside. The finding also suggests that the increased energy needs of a younger testicle may \u201calso pull more plastic into that organ,\u201d Campen said. \u201cAdd to that the fact that the number of plastics we\u2019re exposed to is doubling at a rate of every 10 to 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen in 15 years when we are exposed to twice the amount or 30 years when we are exposed to four times the amount? That is why action is desperately needed now.\u201d The American Chemistry Council, an industry association, told CNN in a previous interview that plastics \u201chelp protect us, improve healthcare outcomes, and contribute to a more sustainable world.\u201d \u201cPlastic makers have a\u00a0goal\u00a0for all US plastic packaging to be reused, recycled, or recovered by 2040,\u201d said Dr. Kimberly Wise White, the council\u2019s vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs. More plastics than placentas Researchers also compared the testes results with microplastic levels found in an earlier study on 62 human placentas, the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to a developing fetus in the womb. In that February study, led by Campen, researchers found microplastics at levels of 6.5 to 790 micrograms per gram of tissue in all the placenta samples studied. \u201cIn testes, the levels of plastic was three times as much as we saw in placentas,\u201d Campen said. \u201cBut you have to consider that the placenta only has a life of about eight months.\u201d The latest study isn\u2019t the first report to find plastics in reproductive tissue. A team of Beijing-based researchers found microplastics in six human testes and 30 semen samples in a June 2023 study, while animal studies have shown tiny plastics can impact sperm count and contribute to hormone and other disruptions in male sexual organs. In studies of pregnant mice, researchers have found plastic chemicals in the brain, heart, liver, kidney and lungs of the developing fetus 24 hours after the pregnant mother ingested or breathed in plastic particles. Other\u00a0research\u00a0has shown that micro- and nanoplastics may cause oxidative stress, tissue damage and inflammation in cells, while animal studies have shown such particles may alter heart rate and impede cardiac function. How to limit plastic in your life There are steps one can take to reduce exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in food and food packaging products, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cLook at the recycling code on the bottom of products to find the plastic type, and avoid plastics with recycling codes 3, which typically contain phthalates,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_05_20_health_meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging doctors to be on the lookout for potentially deadly meningococcal disease linked to travel to Saudi Arabia. Since April, there have been 12 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease associated with travel for Umrah, an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad in Saudi Arabia. Believers in the Muslim faith make Umrah trips to Mecca throughout the year to receive blessings. Muslims also make a longer, more ritualized pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime during a set time of year called Hajj. This year\u2019s Hajj is June 14 to 19. Five of the pilgrims who got sick this year live in the United States. France has had four cases, and the United Kingdom has had three. Ten of the people who got sick had been to Mecca, and two had a close association with someone who did. Meningococcal disease is highly contagious among unvaccinated people. Of the patients whose vaccination status is known, nine were unvaccinated. Meningococcal disease, including meningitis, is an uncommon illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. It can cause infection in the lining of the brain and spinal cord that can cause a lifetime of medical problems such as memory and concentration issues, seizures, balance problems, hearing loss and blindness. The disease can also lead to a serious blood infection called septicemia or blood poisoning. Research shows that\u00a0an estimated\u00a010% to 15% of cases end in death, even with appropriate treatment. The number of cases in the US has been on the rise, according to the CDC. This year, 143 cases were reported as of the end of March, compared with 81 for the same period last year. There were 422 cases in all of 2023, the most since 2014, according to the CDC. Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics if it\u2019s caught early enough. However, diagnosis is often delayed because the symptoms can mimic those of other infectious diseases like Covid-19 or the flu. Symptoms include fever, a headache, nausea or vomiting, trouble walking, a stiff neck, a skin rash, sensitivity to light and brain fog. Tests of the bacteria in the newly confirmed cases showed that in one case in the US and one in France, it was resistant to ciprofloxacin, one of the first-line antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease. Eight cases responded to treatment with penicillin or ciprofloxacin. Vaccines and boosters available Saudi Arabia requires all Umrah or Hajj pilgrims age 1 and older to have gotten the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine, also known as the meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccine.\u00a0It protects against four variations of the bacteria that are in wide circulation:\u00a0A, C, W, and Y. Overall, most cases in the US are related to serogroup Y. In the US, doctors may also recommend the MenB vaccine to protect against the B-variation of the bacteria. A shot made by Pfizer that was approved in the US last year, Penbraya, protects against all five of these most common serogroups that cause meningococcal disease. Most of the pilgrims who got sick tested positive for the W variation. One case in the United States was caused by serogroup C. In the US, the vaccine is routinely recommended for all preteens and teens\u00a0and for some younger children and adults under specific circumstances. One such instance is before travel to countries where meningococcal disease is more common. This includes a recommendation for a booster if the last time a traveler got the shot was three to five or more years before their trip. The CDC said Monday that health care providers should work with patients who are considering travel for Hajj or Umrah to make sure they have received the MenACWY vaccine within the past five years or get the shot at least 10 days before they leave for their trip. In the new notice, which was issued through the CDC\u2019s Health Alert Network, the agency also reminded providers to suspect meningococcal disease in anyone who has symptoms after recent travel for Hajj or Umrah. The CDC told health departments and providers to consider using several of the preferred antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease in people associated with travel to Mecca. People who come into close contact with someone with meningococcal disease should get an antibiotic as soon as possible after exposure, regardless of their vaccination status, the CDC said, and ideally within a day after the initial patient has been identified. The most recent outbreak connected to a mass gathering was in 2000-01, the CDC said, and it was primarily caused by the W variation of the bacteria. It\u2019s only since 2002 that Saudi Arabia has required all pilgrims to provide proof of vaccination against meningococcal disease, but vaccination coverage among these travelers is \u201cknown to be incomplete,\u201d the CDC said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_breastfeeding-mom-public-shame-sinf-cec", "text": "It\u2019s spring, and the air is filled with the melodies of mating songbirds. But when I walk down a tidy street near my suburban Virginia home, the jarring memory of another sound echoes in my mind: my daughter\u2019s piercing screams. Those desperate cries jolted me out of a daydream as I pushed her stroller down this very sidewalk back in December 2022. My daughter was home sick from daycare, and I\u2019d taken her on a walk hoping the cooler air would calm her cough. It seemed to be working, until suddenly, it clearly wasn\u2019t. There are so many moments as a parent when you find yourself doing something you vowed you\u2019d never do \u2014 especially when your child is having a meltdown in public. This was one of those moments for me, but that alone is not why it\u2019s seared in my mind. I will never forget that day, not because of what my child did, or even how I handled it, but because of the surprising way a stranger responded. On that December afternoon, my usually sweet 17-month-old was erupting into a full-blown meltdown. As her face reddened with rage, I tried handing her the bottle I\u2019d brought. She swatted it to the ground and kicked her feet so hard one of her shoes flew off. Even though she was still learning her first words, she had no trouble expressing herself. She didn\u2019t want milk from a bottle. She wanted it direct from the source: me. The way I saw it, that was simply impossible here \u2014 and the idea of it was mortifying. I hadn\u2019t brought my nursing cover, the tasteful shawl I made a point of wearing while feeding her in public.\u00a0Whenever she needed to nurse, I tried to cover up politely or slip away out of view. On this street, we were exposed. There was nowhere to hide. It\u2019s only as I describe it now that I realize how bizarre that sounds. There are so many parts of the world where women and children truly need to take cover to survive. I was lucky to be somewhere safe. And besides, I was proud to be a mom and loved feeding my daughter, so why was I acting so ashamed? Long before I ever had a child of my own, I\u2019d heard comments from TV personalities who\u2019d slammed breastfeeding in public, I\u2019d read news stories about women who were told to cover up, and I\u2019d even heard some snide remarks from members of my own family about the way moms nursed their kids. Of course, I\u2019d also read about celebrities and seen friends who defied these antiquated expectations. And once I started breastfeeding in public myself, most people didn\u2019t really notice \u2014 or at least, they acted like they didn\u2019t. But still, whenever I fed my daughter outside our home, part of me felt anxious about whether anyone was going to be offended. The years of comments I\u2019d heard sent a message so clear that I\u2019d developed a sense of shame around my body, and around feeding my child, without even realizing it. So even as my daughter\u2019s cries grew louder on that December afternoon, breastfeeding her seemed out of the question. In every direction I looked, there were blocks of houses and nicely manicured lawns, with no benches or parks in sight.\u00a0Plopping down in the middle of the sidewalk and lifting up my shirt was something I\u2019d NEVER do. Returning home was the only escape route I could see. I did a quick calculation. If I walked fast, we could probably get home in 10 minutes. Imagining the large number of houses we\u2019d have to pass with her screaming at the top of her lungs, I plowed ahead. But the meltdown only intensified with each step. And as I saw my daughter gasping to catch her breath with tears streaming down her face, and as I thought about how hard the past few nights had been, with coughing fits keeping her up for hours, I realized that giving her what she needed was the only thing that mattered. So suddenly, there I was \u2014 after months of trying to be discreet so I wouldn\u2019t make anyone else uncomfortable while I fed my child \u2014 sitting cross-legged in the middle of a sidewalk, lifting up my shirt and praying no one would notice us. I was relieved to see how quickly she relaxed, but I braced myself every time I heard a car engine rumbling or the jangle of a dog\u2019s leash. Someone was going to see us and say something. I wished I could sink into the ground and hide. In the distance, I saw a woman walking brusquely in our direction. I steeled myself for the criticism I knew had to be coming. Why was I blocking the sidewalk? Why was I flashing the neighbors rather than feeding my daughter at home? Why couldn\u2019t I get it together and control my child? But once she reached our stretch of the sidewalk, this stranger didn\u2019t ask any of those questions. Her words were kind and compassionate. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d she asked. I was stunned. I\u2019d been so certain she would judge me. \u201cYes,\u201d I said a bit sheepishly. \u201cShe just melted down, and I had to feed her.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t glare. She smiled. Then she told me how beautiful my daughter and I looked sitting there together, paired with the classical music piping through her headphones. She was standing a few feet away, but her words were an embrace I hadn\u2019t even realized I needed. In a matter of moments, I started to see the same beauty she did. I let go of the pressure and shame that had been weighing on me and found myself opening up. It\u2019s been more than a year since our paths crossed, and I can no longer remember this woman\u2019s face, but I can still feel her warmth. That day, I told her that we\u2019d been on a peaceful walk when suddenly the situation turned. My daughter had been home sick all week, I explained, and she was simply exhausted. The stranger nodded knowingly. She could see I was exhausted, too. She asked me how I was holding up. Tears welled up in my eyes. I told her I was OK, because thanks to her, I was. Do you have a story about a kind stranger who impacted your life?\u00a0Drop us a line here!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/breastfeeding-mom-public-shame-sinf-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness", "text": "A new report details the role social media plays in the lives of young people, and how they manage the various pros and cons \u2014 including in the context of being a person of color or LGBTQ+, or having depression. Those benefits and drawbacks include valuing online platforms for social connection, self-expression and information, while also feeling the brunt of social media\u2019s effects on their attention span, confidence and contentedness, according to the report released Tuesday by Common Sense Media and Hopelab, a social innovation lab and impact investor aiming to support the well-being of young people. READ MORE: How to know if you have \u2018phone addiction\u2019 \u2014 and 12 ways to address it \u201cMost conversations and headlines surrounding social media and youth mental (health) focus solely on the harms, portraying young people as passive consumers. This research shows that it\u2019s much more complex,\u201d said Amy Green, head of research at Hopelab, in a news release. \u201cIf we truly want to improve the well-being of young people, we need to listen to their experiences and ensure that we do not inadvertently remove access to crucial positive benefits.\u201d Also driving the research is the national youth mental health crisis, the authors said, marked by increasing rates of mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and antidepressant medications prescribed to youth. In conversations about these phenomena, social media has consistently been at the center, though mental health issues can have multiple contributing factors.\u00a0 Conducted by the NORC \u2014 previously called the National Opinion Research Center \u2014 at the University of Chicago, the research includes 1,274 teens (ages 14 to 17) and young adults (ages 18 to 22) recruited online between October and November 2023. The young people \u201cprovided direction and input regarding survey content\u201d and participated in focus groups and interviews to help the research team prioritize and interpret results, according to a news release. The report is the third in a series tracking the influence of social media on well-being among youth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The researchers found the rate of depressive symptoms among youth is about 10% down from pandemic highs but is still high and comparable to the elevated levels of 2018. Nearly half of young people reported experiencing any severity of depression, and nearly a third (28%) said they had moderate to severe symptoms. Additionally, about half of LGBTQ+ youth reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, compared to nearly one-quarter of their non-LGBTQ+ peers. Those with depression were more susceptible to social comparison and pressure to show their best selves on social media. But they were also more likely to find resources to support their well-being and curate their feeds for this purpose \u2014 done by selecting a \u201cnot interested\u201d button on content they don\u2019t like, flagging inappropriate or offensive content, or blocking someone whose content bothered them. These youth also positively curated feeds by \u201cliking\u201d and spending more time on content they did enjoy, since many social media algorithms work by giving you more content based on your level of engagement with certain topics. This was especially important for LGBTQ+ youth who, along with Black and Latinx young people, faced more exposure to harassment and stress online. \u201cIn focus groups, Black youth told us their experiences with in-person harassment lowered their tolerance for similar behavior on social media, and meant they were more willing to give up the benefits to protect themselves from hateful comments,\u201d said lead researcher Amanda Lenhart, head of research at Common Sense Media, via email. The findings confirm what many researchers have seen scientifically and anecdotally, said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association, via email. Prinstein wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Social media and mental health Many participants also revealed the positives they gain from social media, citing online platforms as a place to seek support and advice; decompress; connect with loved ones and others who share their experiences, interests or identities; stay informed; and keep up with their favorite influencers or content creators. \u201cAnother important finding is the importance of social media as a space of connection, creativity and professional opportunities for Black youth,\u201d Lenhart said. Dr. Douglas Gentile, distinguished professor of psychology at Iowa State University, encouraged being \u201ccareful about interpreting (self-reported) data like these,\u201d he said via email. \u201cPeople are surprisingly bad at actually knowing what the effects of media use are on themselves,\u201d Gentile, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, added. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that anyone is lying. Just that we only see little pieces of how the media influence us.\u201d Nearly one-fourth of participants reported using social media almost constantly throughout the day, up 7% from the rate the authors found in their 2018 report, the authors found. Many young people reported an inability to control their use, social media distracting from other activities and unconsciously reaching for social media when bored. To counteract these behaviors, on top of customizing their feeds, many have also taken breaks from social media to avoid the temptation or deleted their accounts permanently. \u201cSocial media could offer (more) benefits to youth if it was designed with a primary focus on youth well-being rather than a focus on keeping kids engaged for as long as possible to make a profit from their data,\u201d Prinstein said. While, or after, using social media, try doing an emotional check-in, Lenhart said. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018How am I feeling right now? Did I see anything that made me feel sad?\u2019\u201d Taking a temporary or permanent break from the content causing the most distress could be helpful, Lenhart added, especially if you already struggle with depression. If you\u2019re a parent or guardian wondering how to best manage your teen\u2019s social media use, one of the most important things you can do is \u201ckeep communication channels open,\u201d Lenhart said. Parental involvement is important, as young adults have expressed regret that their parents allowed them to use social media so young, wishing they could go back and tell their parents to not give in to their demands, Prinstein said. Ask the teens in your life what they like about these platforms and what types of connections or activities support their mental health, Lenhart said. Let them know you\u2019re there to help figure out a solution if social media is upsetting them or interfering with other responsibilities. Respect \u201cthat each young person is an expert in their own lived experience,\u201d Lenhart said. \u201cYoung people are valuable teachers in their own right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_world_iron-age-fire-spain-earring-hannibal-scn", "text": "A\u00a0two-story building burned to the ground more than 2,000 years ago in the Pyrenees mountains of northeastern Iberia in Spain. The inferno consumed the wooden structure,\u00a0situated in an Iron Age settlement, killing six animals penned in the stable. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but details of their lives\u00a0remain preserved in handfuls of scorched clues, including bits of pottery, tools for textile work\u00a0and a metal pickax, archaeologists recently discovered. They also found one precious object: a gold earring measuring 0.8 inches (2 centimeters) long and 0.8 inches wide. It had been hidden inside a small jar concealed in a wall, perhaps to keep it safe from the hypothesized marauders\u00a0who set the fire, according to the study published Friday in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Archaeology. The site of the settlement is called Tossal de Baltarga, and thousands of years ago, a community of Iberian people known as the Cerretani occupied the village. This group predated the Roman occupation of Iberia and left their mark on the region in carvings on mountain rock. However, researchers are still piecing together clues about Cerretani life, including the meanings of these carvings, said lead study author Dr. Oriol Olesti Vila, an associate professor\u00a0at the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain. Scientists have uncovered several burned buildings at Tossal de Baltarga since 2011, all dating to the third century BC. Archaeologists recently excavated\u00a0a nonresidential, multipurpose structure dubbed Building G, the best-preserved building at the site. It measured about 26 feet (8 meters) long by about 7 feet (2 meters) wide, and its contents offer an unprecedented glimpse of Cerretani life in Iron Age Iberia. But the blackened ruins also preserve a darker story. The destruction of the entire settlement by fire hints that the blaze was set deliberately. And the chronology of the fire suggests that the arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic and crossed the Pyrenees around this time, during the Second Punic War (218 BC\u00a0to 201 BC), the researchers wrote in the study. Lifestyle clues Though the upper floor of Building G collapsed when the supporting beams burned, it still retained traces of its former structure, with mud bricks in the eastern part of the floor and stones in the western section. One explanation is that the upper floor was divided into two distinct spaces used for different tasks, the scientists said. More than 1,000 pottery fragments from the upper floor represented a variety of vessels, used for cooking, eating, drinking and storage. Eight cooking vessels were\u00a0near-complete when found, and chemical analysis revealed that they contained organic residues: animal fats, dairy products and plants. Designs of some vessels indicated that they were acquired from another Iberian region through trade. More than a dozen weights for a loom and spindles told the researchers that the building\u2019s occupants were spinning and weaving with wool. In the stable,\u00a0scientists found the remains of a horse, four sheep and a goat. The horse was kept in a separate stall, and charred particles represented a variety of local grasses and plants as well as cultivated grains, stored there as feed for the livestock. The presence of a horse in the stable suggested that these people were wealthier than some of their neighbors, Olesti Vila said. \u201cIn antiquity, horses were not the typical animal that a normal peasant family would have,\u201d as they were expensive to feed and weren\u2019t kept for their meat or milk, Olesti Vila said.\u201cIn general, horses are connected with the elite.\u201d This finding provided archaeologists with another important clue about social structure in ancient Iberia, introducing the possibility of an \u201caristocrat\u201d class, the study authors wrote. A \u2018moment in time\u2019 Their discoveries illuminate the lifestyles of the Cerretani, indicating textile work and the use of agriculture and of natural resources. Analysis of the hidden earring revealed traces of silver mixed with local gold, showing that the Cerretani were also familiar with metalworking. Uncovering a \u201cmoment in time\u201d such as this is exceptional in the archaeological record, said Dr. Bettina Arnold, a professor in the department of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who was not involved in the research. The site provides important insights into the daily lives of Iberian Iron Age populations in the Pyrenees at this pivotal time in history, Arnold said in an email. \u201cThe most impressive aspect of the excavation of Building G is the range of the scientific analyses carried out on the finds recovered there, which reveals a community that was self-sufficient with regard to some production activities, such as spinning and weaving wool,\u201d Arnold said. However, the analysis also showed that this community was part of a larger regional exchange network \u201cthrough trade and presumably bonds of obligation,\u201d linking them to Iberian tribal leadership, she added. Deadly attack The fact that the animals died inside the stable offered the researchers another clue about the terrible circumstances of the fire. During the Iron Age, when people lived in wooden homes heated by fires, buildings often accidentally burned. But had this been such a fire, the animals\u2019 owners would likely have opened the stable doors to save their livestock, Olesti Vila said. They would probably also have returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden treasure \u2014 the gold earring that they concealed in a jar. \u201cThis is also an indication of some kind of conflict or some kind of violent aggression,\u201d Olesti Vila said. The scientists suspected that the community may have been caught up in the Second Punic War and the crossing of Hannibal, \u201cbecause of the chronology and the context,\u201d but because the precise date of the fire is unknown, this connection is just a hypothesis, he said. Indeed, the existence of violent raids between Iron Age populations in Europe, with bands of invaders making\u00a0off with valuables, livestock and even people, \u201cis well attested archaeologically,\u201d Arnold added, \u201cand need not be associated with a specific historic event like Hannibal\u2019s campaigns.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/world/iron-age-fire-spain-earring-hannibal-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_california-phys-ed-heat-rules-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "Yahushua Robinson was an energetic boy who jumped and danced his way through life. Then, a physical education teacher instructed the 12-year-old to run outside on a day when the temperature climbed to\u00a0107 degrees. \u201cWe lose loved ones all the time, but he was taken in a horrific way,\u201d his mother, Janee Robinson, said from the family\u2019s Inland Empire home, about 80 miles southeast of Los Angeles. \u201cI would never want nobody to go through what I\u2019m going through.\u201d The day her son died, Robinson, who teaches phys ed, kept her elementary school students inside, and she had hoped her children\u2019s teachers would do the same. The Riverside County Coroner\u2019s Bureau ruled that Yahushua died on Aug. 29 of a heart defect, with heat and physical exertion as contributing factors. His death at Canyon Lake Middle School came on the second day of an excessive heat warning, when people were\u00a0advised to avoid strenuous activities\u00a0and limit their time outdoors. Yahushua\u2019s family is supporting\u00a0a bill\u00a0in California that would require the state Department of Education to create guidelines that govern physical activity at public schools during extreme weather, including setting threshold temperatures for when it\u2019s too hot or too cold for students to exercise or play sports outside. If the measure becomes law, the guidelines will have to be in place by Jan. 1, 2026. Many states have adopted protocols to protect student athletes from extreme heat during practices. But the California bill is broader and would require educators to consider all students throughout the school day and in any extreme weather, whether they\u2019re doing jumping jacks in fourth period or playing tag during recess. It\u2019s unclear if the bill will clear a critical committee vote scheduled for May 16. \u201cYahushua\u2019s story, it\u2019s very touching. It\u2019s very moving. I think it could have been prevented had we had the right safeguards in place,\u201d said state Sen. Melissa Hurtado (D-Bakersfield), one of the bill\u2019s authors. \u201cClimate change is impacting everyone, but it\u2019s especially impacting vulnerable communities, especially our children.\u201d Last year marked the planet\u2019s warmest on record, and extreme weather is becoming more frequent and severe, according to the\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Even though most heat deaths and illnesses are preventable, about\u00a01,220 people in the United States are killed by extreme heatevery year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Young children are especially\u00a0susceptible to heat illness\u00a0because their bodies have more trouble regulating temperature, and they rely on adults to protect them from overheating. A person can go from feeling dizzy or experiencing a headache to passing out, having a seizure, or going into a coma, said\u00a0Chad Vercio, a physician and the division chief of general pediatrics at Loma Linda University Health. \u201cIt can be a really dangerous thing,\u201d Vercio said of heat illness. \u201cIt is something that we should take seriously and figure out what we can do to avoid that.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many children have died at school from heat exposure. Eric Robinson, 15, had been sitting in his sports medicine class learning about heatstroke when his sister arrived at his high school unexpectedly the day their brother died. \u201cThey said, \u2018OK, go home, Eric. Go home early.\u2019 I walked to the car and my sister\u2019s crying. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that my little brother\u2019s gone. That I won\u2019t be able to see him again. And he\u2019d always bugged me, and I would say, \u2018Leave me alone.\u2019\u201d That morning, Eric had done Yahushua\u2019s hair and loaned him his hat and chain necklace to wear to school. As temperatures climbed into the 90s that morning, a physical education teacher instructed Yahushua to run on the blacktop. His friends told the family that the sixth grader had repeatedly asked the teacher for water but was denied, his parents said. The school district has refused to release video footage to the family showing the moment Yahushua collapsed on the blacktop. He died later that day at the hospital. Melissa Valdez, a Lake Elsinore Unified School District spokesperson, did not respond to calls seeking comment. Schoolyards can reach\u00a0dangerously high temperatures\u00a0on hot days, with asphalt sizzling up to 145 degrees, according to findings by researchers at the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. Some school districts, such as\u00a0San Diego Unified and\u00a0Santa Ana Unified, have hot weather plans or guidelines that call for limiting physical activity and providing water to kids. But there are no statewide standards that K-12 schools must implement to protect students from heat illness. Under the bill, the California Department of Education must set temperature thresholds requiring schools to modify students\u2019 physical activities during extreme weather, such as heat waves, wildfires, excessive rain, and flooding. Schools would also be required to come up with plans for alternative indoor activities, and staff must be trained to recognize and respond to weather-related distress. California has had heat rules on the books for outdoor workers since 2005, but it was a latecomer to\u00a0protecting student athletes, according to the\u00a0Korey Stringer Institute\u00a0at the University of Connecticut, which is named after a Minnesota Vikings football player who died from heatstroke in 2001. By comparison, Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, this spring\u00a0signed a law\u00a0preventing cities and counties from creating their own heat protections for outdoor workers, has the best protections for student athletes, according to the institute. Douglas Casa, a professor of kinesiology and the chief executive officer of the institute, said state regulations can establish consistency about how to respond to heat distress and save lives. \u201cThe problem is that each high school doesn\u2019t have a cardiologist and doesn\u2019t have a thermal physiologist and doesn\u2019t have a sickling expert,\u201d Casa said of the medical specialties for heat illness. In 2022, California released an\u00a0Extreme Action Heat Plan\u00a0that recommended state agencies \u201cexplore implementation of indoor and outdoor heat exposure rules for schools,\u201d but neither the administration of Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, nor lawmakers have adopted standards. Lawmakers last year failed to pass legislation that would have required schools to implement a heat plan and replace hot surfaces, such as cement and rubber, with lower-heat surfaces, such as grass and cool pavement.\u00a0That bill, which drew opposition from school administrators, stalled in committee, in part over cost concerns. Naj Alikhan, a spokesperson for the Association of California School Administrators, said the new bill takes a different approach and would not require structural and physical changes to schools. The association has not taken a position on the measure, and no other organization has registered opposition. The Robinson family said children\u2019s lives ought to outweigh any costs that might come with preparing schools to deal with the growing threat of extreme weather. Yahushua\u2018s death, they say, could save others. \u201cI really miss him. I cry every day,\u201d said Yahushua\u2019s father, Eric Robinson. \u201cThere\u2019s no one day that go by that I don\u2019t cry about my boy.\u201d KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/california-phys-ed-heat-rules-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_hiv-breastfeeding-recommendations-aap", "text": "Each time LaTonya looks at framed photos of herself breastfeeding her baby son for the first time, she swells with emotion. As a mother living with HIV in Colorado, it was a moment she wanted to commemorate. \u201cThat\u2019s how important it was to me to be able to breastfeed,\u201d LaTonya said about the photos. \u201cSo, I wanted to make sure we had that forever.\u201d For the first time, the American Academy of Pediatrics has changed its position to say people with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, can breastfeed their infants with \u201cvery low\u201d risk if they follow certain guidelines with support from their medical care team. Avoiding breastfeeding is the only option with zero risk for HIV transmission, but going forward, pediatricians should offer support and counseling for women who wish to breastfeed, who are receiving antiretroviral treatment, known as ART, as prescribed and who are maintaining an undetectable amount of virus in the body, according to a new clinical report from AAP that was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. Previously, the academy recommended that mothers with HIV in the United States not breastfeed their infants, regardless of their viral load and antiretroviral therapy use. Recommendations against breastfeeding for people with HIV date to about 1985, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that women with HIV infection avoid breastfeeding. \u201cThe AAP recommends that for people with HIV in the United States, replacement feeding (with formula or certified, banked donor human milk) is the only option that is 100% certain to prevent postnatal transmission of HIV,\u201d the new report says. \u201cHowever, pediatric health care professionals should be prepared to provide infant feeding counseling and a family-centered, culturally sensitive, harm reduction approach for people with HIV on ART with sustained viral suppression who desire to breastfeed.\u201d HIV is a virus that attacks the body\u2019s immune system, and if not treated, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. LaTonya has been living with HIV for about 20 years, she said, but as soon as she gave birth to her son, she knew that she wanted to breastfeed because of the health benefits breastfeeding has for infants, including being associated with a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes and sudden infant death syndrome. \u201cBeing a mom is absolutely amazing. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world,\u201d LaTonya said, adding that every parent desires to give their child \u201cthe best shot\u201d at being the best person that they can be. \u201cI feel like breastfeeding was a step towards me being able to provide that for him,\u201d she said of her son. After she talked talking about her decision with her doctors, they developed a plan for her to breastfeed since her viral load is undetectable and she is taking antiretroviral medications. They discussed \u201cconstant monitoring of viral loads\u201d to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a spike\u00a0in her viral load and that \u201ccomplete adherence to medication was essential,\u201d LaTonya said. CNN is not publishing her full name to protect her medical privacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s essential for people to understand the science behind it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re undetectable, you cannot transmit it to your partner. It\u2019s essential for people to understand that, as well as, if you\u2019re adhering to your medication, that it\u2019s not going to transfer through the breast milk to your child. And so therefore, why deprive your child of \u2026 having that benefit?\u201d \u2018This has been a long evolution\u2019 Although HIV can be passed to infants through breastfeeding, research has shown that the use of antiretroviral drugs can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission, and these medicines are found to be safe during breastfeeding. In the absence of the mother taking ART or the infant taking preventive antiretrovirals, the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk appears to be highest in the baby\u2019s first four to six weeks of life, ranging between 5% and 6%, according to the AAP report. But the risk is \u201cestimated to be less than 1%\u201d if the mother is taking antiretroviral medications and the virus is suppressed in her body, meaning there is no detectable viral load, the report said. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is that the AAP for the first time is explicitly saying that pregnant people with HIV who are on treatment and undetectable can be supported to breastfeed,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Abuogi, lead author of the report and a pediatrician in Colorado who works with people with HIV during their pregnancies. \u201cThis has been a long evolution, and people living with HIV have been a part of advocating for this change,\u201d Abuogi said. \u201cSome women feel shame or distress or feel like they\u2019re not fulfilling their role as a mother if they can\u2019t breastfeed, and some are really worried that that discloses their HIV status in their community \u2014 if breastfeeding is the norm and you have to explain why you\u2019re not doing it.\u201d It\u2019s estimated that about 5,000 people with HIV give birth in the United States each year. \u201cSo having the opportunity to offer women the choice, as all women have, and to support their decision is really empowering,\u201d Abuogi said. \u201cPeople living with HIV should have all of the same infant-feeding options as anyone else, and we\u2019re really working to make that a safe decision for women.\u201d Last year, an advisory panel to the US Department of Health and Human Services made similar updates to its recommendations around infant-feeding, saying that \u201cindividuals with HIV who are on ART with a sustained undetectable viral load and who choose to breastfeed should be supported in this decision.\u201d The new AAP position now aligns with those updated recommendations from the HHS panel, said Dr. Rana\u00a0Chakraborty,\u00a0a pediatric infectious disease specialist and researcher\u00a0at\u00a0Mayo Clinic\u00a0in Minnesota, who is a\u00a0member of HHS\u2019  Panel on Treatment of\u00a0HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s been under discussion for a few years now. It began with the Department of Health and Human Services panel, and I think the authors of this report from the AAP have really summarized very nicely the current\u00a0national guidelines\u00a0in the US,\u201d said Chakraborty, who was not involved in the new AAP report. \u201cA number of investigators, including many from the US working in relatively resource-limited settings, were\u00a0previously\u00a0able to demonstrate that\u00a0breastfeeding\u00a0could be\u00a0undertaken\u00a0safely if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and maintains undetectable HIV viral loads \u2014 in other words, the amount of virus in one drop of blood needs to be less than 50 copies per milliliter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the US, this is\u00a0also doable. But\u00a0breastfeeding during\u00a0maternal HIV infection\u00a0does need a\u00a0supporting\u00a0multidisciplinary team of providers to make sure that this can be done safely for\u00a0both\u00a0mom and baby.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re seeing a consensus\u2019 The AAP recommendations signal that there is now a consensus among leading medical groups that mothers living with HIV can be supported and counseled in safely breastfeeding their babies, said Dr. Elaine Abrams, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, who has treated people living with HIV during their pregnancies and postpartum but was not involved in the new AAP report. \u201cAll of the bodies that provide guidelines to clinicians are now saying the same thing. We\u2019re seeing a consensus, and the consensus also puts the mother right up-front central in the conversation and decision-making,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s moved away from telling her what to do, to rather understanding what she wants to do, providing her with evidence and information and then supporting her in her decision,\u201d Abrams added. \u201cIn the old days, that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case.\u201d In the early 2000s, studies emerged showing that infants born to women with HIV in low-income countries had increased risks of illness and death when they were given formula \u2014 and that was found to be associated with the mothers not having safe drinking water to mix with the formula, according to the new AAP report. That prompted the World Health Organization to recommend that people with HIV should breastfeed their babies in places without safe drinking water and accessible formula. As more mothers with HIV breastfed, more studies then found that when the mother took ART or the infant was given antiretrovirals preventively, that effectively reduced the risk of HIV transmission. The new AAP report noted that there is no consensus on the optimal regimen of preventive antiretrovirals for infants during breastfeeding. Also, people who breastfeed are recommended to do so exclusively, because mixing breastfeeding and formula or solid foods\u00a0has been associated with increased HIV transmission. \u201cThis increased rate may be a result of disrupted infant gut integrity associated with consuming substances other than human milk, decreases in the amount of antiviral or anti-inflammatory substances typically consumed in human milk, or other mechanisms,\u201d according to the AAP report. LaTonya said that among the guidance that her medical team discussed with her for breastfeeding was to not incorporate formula but to breastfeed exclusively. \u201cOne of the guidelines that we went over is, if we were going to breastfeed, that was the only thing that we could do,\u201d LaTonya said. \u201cWe could not mix formula and breastfeeding.\u201d Along with supporting and counseling patients with HIV who wish to breastfeed, the AAP also recommended in the new report that pregnant people be routinely tested for HIV and those living with HIV or newly diagnosed should be linked to treatment. LaTonya said that she hopes the new AAP recommendations encourage health-care providers to educate the public more about what an undetectable level of HIV means, how infections can be treated and how the virus can be suppressed. \u201cIt\u2019s something people live with, and it\u2019s not something to be afraid of,\u201d LaTonya said. The time for doctors to have those types of educational discussions with their patients would be when someone has a routine HIV test, she said. \u201cThey will talk to you about gonorrhea and chlamydia, but the HIV portion is missing. And so therefore, a lot of people are still stuck in the \u201880s with their mentality of HIV and AIDS,\u201d LaTonya said. \u201cI believe that is mostly due to lack of education.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/hiv-breastfeeding-recommendations-aap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_how-to-move-better-wellness", "text": "Countless people seek emergency care for back pain, muscle strains and similar injuries resulting from \u201cmoving wrong\u201d during mundane, everyday tasks such as bending over to tie shoes, lifting objects or doing household chores. Even the most basic of human movement patterns \u2014 walking \u2014 can land you in the emergency room due to tripping or losing balance. Falls are one of the leading causes of emergency room visits, with more than 9 million logged annually. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 older adults report falling every year. These incidents highlight the importance of understanding proper movement mechanics to prevent avoidable harm. Read on for five essential strategies to correct improper movement patterns, enhance movement quality and minimize your risk of injury. What are \u2018wrong moves\u2019? The most significant way you can move wrong is by not moving enough.The clich\u00e9d saying \u201cmove it or lose it\u201d is sage wisdom. Human bodies are inherently designed for movement. Yet in our modern, sedentary lifestyles, we often neglect the importance of moving both regularly and well. The less we move, the less we can, and the more susceptible we are to hurting ourselves by moving in a way our body is not accustomed or intended. Understanding what constitutes right and wrong movement is crucial in preventing injury. The unique blueprint of the human body ensures the ability to move in all directions based on using the joints as they were designed. For example, certain joints, such as the hips and shoulders are ball and socket, enabling 360 degrees of rotation, while knees are hinge joints that have more limited mobility. Likewise, the middle of your spine, known as the thoracic spine, is designed for rotating, while the lower back or lumbar spine is not. Core muscles need to support and stabilize any carrying or lifting to avoid low-back stress. If you attempt to twist from your lumbar spine to get out of your car or ask your knees to compensate for a lack of hip mobility in your golf swing, you are moving wrong. Bending over to pet your cat without hinging from your hips and bending your knees or carrying heavy grocery bags without engaging your core to stabilize your spine are also examples of wrong moves. All these actions put unnecessary stress on your muscles, ligaments and joints. As you continue to adopt improper movement patterns, you not only increase your risk of injury but also compromise your body\u2019s functional performance long term. Editor\u2019s\u00a0note:\u00a0Consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Stop immediately if you experience pain. How to make the right moves Developing and maintaining proper movement patterns and training to enhance your movement quality are essential to enhance functional mobility so you can navigate your life pain- and injury-free. Here are five key strategies to make the right moves: 1. Master primary movement patterns Consider the movements required to function during daily life. To get to anything on the floor, you need to squat down and hinge from your hips. When you reach for something, you push your arm or arms forward. To open a door, you grasp the handle and pull back. You rotate to grab and latch your seat belt in the car, and you must stabilize through your core to sit, stand and walk. As such, the six generally accepted primary functional movements are squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling and rotating, as well as core stabilization. By mastering these patterns of bodyweight movements and regularly performing them with good form, you develop a strong foundation for safe and efficient movement in all aspects of life. 2. Practice moving in all planes of motion As you go through daily life, performing different variations of the primary movement patterns noted above, you are also moving your body forward, backward, side to side and twisting around. These directions cover what are known as the three planes of movement: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). It\u2019s important to incorporate intentional exercises within each of these planes into your training regimen. This comprehensive approach ensures that your body is prepared for the demands of all your daily activities and sports. 3. Train for better balance Adding balance training to your workouts will improve stability and proprioception (the ability to perceive the position of your limbs). This type of training helps you to better navigate uneven terrain and sudden changes in direction to reduce the risk of falls and injury. Unilateral exercises that focus on one side of the body at a time, such as single-leg Romanian dead lifts and lunging variations, challenge your neuromuscular system, enhancing coordination and spatial awareness. Because good balance is an essential part of moving well, you should incorporate some form of unilateral balance exercises into all your workouts. 4. Include strength training in your workouts Regular strength training builds more than muscle; it also increases bone density, joint stability, endurance, metabolism and overall durability. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends adults strength train two or more days per week. Aim to incorporate resistance exercises targeting different muscle groups through all the primary movement patterns using good form to ensure safe and effective strength development. Strong muscles support the joints in functional movement to reduce the risk of injury. 5. Cultivate your mind-body connection Another key to moving better and avoiding injury is to move with intention. While exercising, focus on your breath and what you\u2019re feeling to stay connected to your body\u2019s experience. By maintaining awareness of your body\u2019s movements and associated sensations, you can set a safe and effective foundation of mindfulness and focus on proper form during exercise. This mind-body connection enhances movement efficiency and reduces incidences of injury through unintentional \u201cwrong moves.\u201d Progressive muscle relaxation is a great exercise for cultivating your mind-body connection. I recommend practicing it several times per week. Are you ready to start moving better and safeguarding your physical fitness? Try the 10-minute single dumbbell workout featured at the top of this article, which incorporates all five strategies. Remember, injury prevention begins with understanding proper movement mechanics and consistently practicing functional movement patterns. Incorporating the five keys outlined above into your fitness routine and daily life can significantly improve your movement quality and reduce the risk of avoidable injuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/how-to-move-better-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers", "text": "Laboratory tests by the US Department of Agriculture haven\u2019t found any H5N1 bird flu virus in raw beef, but they are a good reminder why eating rare hamburgers can be risky. As part of a suite of tests conducted to check safe food handling advice after the detection of H5N1 bird flu virus in dairy cattle, the USDA recently mixed a substitute virus into ground beef and then cooked patties at varying times and temperatures. Researchers found none of the virus in hamburgers cooked to 145 degrees, roughly the temperature of a medium burger, or well-done burgers cooked to 160 degrees. They did, however, find some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, although the virus was present \u201cat much, much reduced levels,\u201d said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA. Whether that small amount of virus could make someone sick is still an unknown. The USDA already advises consumers to cook ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, as measured with a food thermometer, to avoid infections from bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli, he noted. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody needs to change any of the safe food handling or safe cooking practices that are already recommended,\u201d Deeble said. The USDA also announced $22 million in new government investments to protect animal health. The bulk of the funding will go to the Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and to a network of state laboratories called the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. \u201cThere are some labs that have equipment that needs to be updated or upgraded and additional folks that are interested in adding capacity to the laboratories that they operate. And so this funding is going to help support those types of projects,\u201d Deeble said Thursday. Between May 6 and May 12, the national lab network processed 1,100 tests for H5N1 bird flu in cattle, and 278 of those were presumed positive, Deeble said.\u00a0He cautioned that because multiple samples can be taken from the same animal or tests may be pooled, the number of tests doesn\u2019t reflect the number of animals tested or the number that are positive.\u00a0Approximately 600 of the tests were performed in accordance with the USDA\u2019s new order, which requires testing of dairy cattle moving between states.\u00a0Another 450 tests were performed on animals showing symptoms. USDA said that it had gotten a positive response to its offer last week to financially compensate producers who take steps to protect their herds and workers against further spread of the virus. However, it doesn\u2019t have the forms ready for farmers to fill out, so nobody has been signed up for the program.\u00a0It hopes to have the paperwork ready by the middle of next week, Deeble said. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency had not been able to find farmworkers willing to participate in studies looking at how bird flu transmits on dairy farms in return for $75. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up hope. We are in\u00a0constant conversation with a number of states. We\u2019re getting closer, but as of yet, nothing across the finish line,\u201d Shah said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_world_black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn", "text": "Albert Einstein was right: There is an area at the edge of black holes where matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead falls in, as predicted by his theory of gravity. Using telescopes capable of detecting X-rays, a team of astronomers has for the first time observed this area \u2014 called the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 in a black hole about 10,000 light-years from Earth. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ignoring this region, because we didn\u2019t have the data,\u201d said research scientist Andrew Mummery, lead author of the study published Thursday in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \u201cBut now that we do, we couldn\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time that black holes have helped confirm Einstein\u2019s grand theory, which is also known as general relativity. The first photo of a black hole, captured in 2019, had previously strengthened the revolutionary physicist\u2019s core assumption that gravity is just matter bending the space-time fabric. Many of Einstein\u2019s other predictions have turned out to be correct over the years, among them gravitational waves and the universal speed limit. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough man to bet against at this point,\u201d said Mummery, a Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow in the department of physics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. \u201cWe went out searching for this one specifically \u2014 that was always the plan. We\u2019ve argued about whether we\u2019d ever be able to find it for a really long time,\u201d Mummery said. \u201cPeople said it would be impossible, so confirming it\u2019s there is really exciting.\u201d \u2018Like the edge of a waterfall\u2019 The observed black hole is in a system called MAXI J1820 + 070, which is made up of a star smaller than the sun and the black hole itself, estimated at 7 to 8 solar masses. The astronomers used NASA\u2019s space-based NuSTAR and NICER telescopes to collect data and understand how hot gas, called plasma, from the star gets sucked into the black hole. NuSTAR is short for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, which orbits Earth, and NICER, formally known as the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, is located on the International Space Station. \u201cAround these black holes there are big discs of orbiting material (from nearby stars),\u201d Mummery said. \u201cMost of it is stable, which means it can happily flow. It\u2019s like a river, whereas the plunging region is like the edge of a waterfall \u2014 all of your support is gone and you\u2019re just crashing headfirst. Most of what you can see is the river, but there\u2019s this tiny region at the very end, which is basically what we found,\u201d he added, noting that while the \u201criver\u201d had been widely observed, this is the first evidence of the \u201cwaterfall.\u201d Unlike the event horizon, which is closer to the center of the black hole and doesn\u2019t let anything escape, including light and radiation, in the \u201cplunging region\u201d light can still escape, but matter is doomed by the powerful gravitational pull, Mummery explained. The study\u2019s findings could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes. \u201cWe can really learn about them by studying this region, because it\u2019s right at the edge, so it gives us the most information,\u201d Mummery said. One thing that\u2019s missing from the study is an actual image of the black hole, because it is too small and far away. But another team of Oxford researchers is working on something even better than a picture: the first movie of a black hole. To achieve that, the team will first need to build a new observatory, the Africa Millimetre Telescope in Namibia, which Mummery expects to be online within a decade. The telescope, which will join the international Event Horizon Telescope collaboration that captured the groundbreaking 2019 image of the black hole, will enable scientists to observe and film large black holes at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. A link to the past According to Christopher Reynolds, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, finding actual evidence for the \u201cplunging region\u201d is an important step that will let scientists significantly refine models for how matter behaves around a black hole. \u201cFor example, it can be used to measure the rotation rate of the black hole,\u201d said Reynolds, who was not involved in the study. Dan Wilkins, a research scientist at Stanford University in California, calls it an exciting development, and points out that in 2018 there was an enormously bright outburst of light from one of the black holes within our galaxy, paired with an excess of high-energy X-rays. \u201cWe had hypothesized at the time that this excess was from the hot material in the \u2018plunging region,\u2019 but we did not have a full theoretical prediction of what that emission would look like,\u201d said Wilkins, who also was not involved with the new study. This study actually performs that calculation, he added, using Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity to predict what the X-rays emitted by material in the \u201cplunging region\u201d would look like around a black hole, and compares it with the data from that bright outburst in 2018. \u201cThis will be prime discovery space over the next decade or so,\u201d Wilkins said, \u201cas we look towards the next generation of X-ray telescopes that will give us more detailed measurements of the innermost regions just outside the event horizons of black holes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_cervical-cancer-self-collection", "text": "Instead of a traditional speculum-involved pelvic exam to screen for cervical cancer, the US Food and Drug Administration has given the go-ahead for patients to have the option to collect their own vaginal samples for screening in a health care setting, such as at their doctor\u2019s office, an urgent care or even a mobile clinic. Two health care businesses \u2013 biotechnology company Roche and medical technology firm Becton, Dickson and Company or BD \u2013 announced Wednesday that the FDA approved the use of self-collected samples with their respective HPV tests. Most\u00a0cervical cancers\u00a0are caused by human papillomavirus or HPV, and screening for HPV can help identify women who may be at risk of developing cervical cancer. \u201cAlmost all cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with certain types of HPV,\u201d Dr. Karen E. Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cSelf-collection can expand access to screening and reduces barriers, which will give more people the opportunity to detect, treat, and ultimately survive cancer.\u201d Typically, gynecologists collect samples for HPV testing, a cervical cytology or both. Cervical cytology, also known as a Pap test or Pap smear, involves examining cervical cells for changes to find precancerous or cancerous cells. The\u00a0US Preventive Services Task Force recommends\u00a0screening for cervical cancer with cervical cytology every three years for women ages 21 to 29. For women ages 30 to 65, the USPSTF recommends screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV testing alone, or every five years with high-risk HPV testing in combination with cytology. But for some patients, having a provider collect a sample for those tests can be painful or awkward. \u201cMany patients are uncomfortable with the intimate nature of a pelvic exam,\u201d Dr.\u00a0Jeff Andrews, a board-certified gynecologist and vice president of global medical affairs for diagnostic solutions at BD, said in the company\u2019s announcement Wednesday. \u201cAlso, many people live in areas without a local doctor or clinician trained to obtain a sample with a speculum,\u201d he said. \u201cThe option to self-collect in a clinical setting can help women overcome some of these barriers.\u201d The BD Onclarity HPV Assay is now FDA-approved for HPV testing on self-collected samples without the need for a traditional Pap test, according to the company\u2019s announcement Wednesday. A trial on self-collection for HPV testing, which BD is participating in with the National Cancer Institute, is expected to begin enrolling this summer, the company said, to evaluate accuracy of self-collection for HPV testing in health care and other settings, including at home. Roche announced that HPV self-collection is approved for use with the company\u2019s cobas HPV test, and the company has also collaborated with the National Cancer Institute. Each year in the United States, more than 11,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and about 4,000 women die of the disease, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s estimated that about half of invasive cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in people who have never been screened and about 10% of diagnoses are in people who have not had a Pap test in the five years prior. \u201cDespite the benefits of cervical cancer screening, not all women and people with a cervix get screened regularly,\u201d Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cMost cervical cancers are found in people who have never had a cervical cancer screening test or who have not had one recently. That\u2019s why adding self-collection in a health-care center as a screening method for this potentially deadly disease can make a huge impact,\u201d he added. \u201cWe anticipate self-collection in a health-care setting will play an increasingly prominent role in cervical cancer screening once regulatory and clinical prerequisites are in place and as supporting evidence continues to accumulate.\u201d Next, the FDA could consider greenlighting the self-collection method at home instead of just in a health care setting. Teal Health has developed a home cervical cancer screening device called the Teal Wand that was granted \u201cbreakthrough device\u201d status this month by the FDA, which would allow the agency to review the device on a faster timeline. \u201cFDA\u2019s recognition of the Teal Wand as a Breakthrough device acknowledges the important public health benefit that self-collection for cervical cancer screening can have on those who are rarely screened or who do not participate in clinician-based screening for cervical cancer,\u201d Trena Depel, vice president of clinical and regulatory at Teal Health, said in a news release at the time. Screening for cervical cancer remains important because early cases often may not have signs or symptoms. Advanced cases may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge. Cervical cancer is treated in many ways, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Some of the most important steps women can take to help\u00a0prevent cervical cancer, according to the CDC, are to get vaccinated against HPV, not smoke, use condoms during sex, have regular screening tests and go back to see the doctor if their screening test results are not normal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/cervical-cancer-self-collection/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-treatment-real-world-effectiveness", "text": "Demand for Wegovy and other GLP-1 drugs used to treat obesity and diabetes has skyrocketed, but a new report suggests that many people may not be sticking with their weight-loss treatment long enough. An analysis of health insurance claims released Tuesday found that most people using GLP-1 medications \u2013 about 58% \u2013 were on their treatment plan for less than 12 weeks, falling short of a key benchmark in the weight-loss treatment timeline. Professional organizations have set this as a guideline for when to reassess whether a treatment is providing clinically meaningful weight loss. Users start with a low dose of these medications and gradually increase it over time until they reach a targeted dose. But the analysis shows that nearly a third of people \u2013 more than 30% \u2013 dropped out after the first four weeks of treatment, before reaching the targeted dose. The findings are based on pharmacy and medical claims data for about 170,000 people with insurance coverage under Blue Cross Blue Shield plans who were prescribed GLP-1 medications that were approved to treat weight management between 2014 and 2023. \u201cThese are long-term medications to treat a chronic disease,\u201d said Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist and director of obesity medicine at Endeavor Health in Chicago, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cThis is absolutely a marathon, not a sprint. And when we do treat this as a sprint, I think patients are likely to get off of medication much faster.\u201d Experts say that impatience with results is one of many reasons patients might stop treatment. Only about two-thirds of adults who have used injectable weight-loss drugs say they feel that they were effective, according to a new KFF poll. And people who stopped using the medications were significantly less optimistic about their benefits: Only about half of those who had used injectable weight-loss drugs in the past said they were effective, compared with nearly three-quarters of those who were actively using the treatments. Side effects \u2013 such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation that are common early on \u2013 may also drive people away. Data from the longest clinical trial of Wegovy showed that 17% of people using the drug decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects. But experts say that many deterrents can be managed with appropriate counseling from a provider. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have frequent touchpoints, frequent interactions, then it\u2019s really it\u2019s hard to manage side effects. It\u2019s hard to manage expectations. It\u2019s hard to see if there\u2019s improvement in some of these other metabolic comorbidities,\u201d said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new research.  Each person will respond to treatment differently and assess the balance of costs and benefits to their heath differently. \u201cThere\u2019s not a line in the sand for every single person. Physicians and patients have to just look at all the data and make a decision about treatment together,\u201d she said. Findings from the Blue Cross Blue Shield data emphasize the important role that providers can play in helping patients stick with their treatment with GLP-1s. People who met with their providers less frequently \u2013 and those living in underserved regions with broader health inequities \u2013 were more likely to discontinue GLP-1 treatment sooner. Each additional follow-up visit increased a patient\u2019s chances of staying on the treatment by 60%, said Dr. Razia Hashmi, vice president of clinical affairs for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. And although most prescriptions came from primary care physicians, those who were prescribed GLP-1s by endocrinologists or others with expertise in weight management were more likely to reach at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment. \u201cWraparound support services really make a difference \u2013 whether a person has lifestyle support management, nutrition, diet and side effect management,\u201d Hashmi said, and \u201chealth equity matters. Social drivers of health \u2013 transportation, access to food, socioeconomic status \u2013 all of that also makes a difference.\u201d Cost can often be a prohibitive factor for these medications \u2013 a month\u2019s supply of GLP-1 medications can often cost about $1,000 \u2013 but the analysis included only people who had insurance plans that covered weight-loss medication prescriptions. Insurance plan copays may have affected cost considerations, but the individuals in this analysis were not paying out-of-pocket for their treatment. But using GLP-1 treatments are still an investment in many ways. \u201cWhether it\u2019s an employer trying to make a decision or an individual patient trying to make a decision, it\u2019s really important to understand the success factors,\u201d Hashmi said. \u201cWe want the investment to pay off.\u201d Another new report supports the claim that the benefits of GLP-1s are extended with long-term, consistent treatment. One of the first reports offering real-world data on GLP-1 efficacy found that people using the medicines had lost an average of about 1.4% of their starting body weight after three months, which steadily increased to an average of about 3% weight loss after a full year on the treatment. The analysis from Dandelion Health, a health care analytics firm, is based on the electronic health records of nearly 17,000 people who were prescribed a GLP-1 from 2019 through 2023. Compared with a group of people with a similar set of clinical characteristics \u2013 matched closely on demographic factors such as age and ethnicity, treatment indicators such as average body mass index and diabetes prevalence, history of treatments such as bariatric surgery and prevalence of related comorbidities \u2013 the analysis found that those on GLP-1s lost about twice as much weight. These injected medications, called GLP-1 agonists, are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss.\u00a0In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose\u00a0at least 10% of their starting weight.\u00a0But the new report suggests that the real-world efficacy is not as promising as clinical trial data would suggest. And experts warn that the GLP-1 treatment process can be different for everyone. \u201cThere are some people who are under-responders, there are some people who are over-responders, and there\u2019s some that respond as expected to the medication,\u201d Narang said. \u201cStudies are still happening to understand why.\u201d The data from Dandelion Health showed that the 10% of people with the best response to GLP-1s had results that mirrored what clinical trials found, but the 10% with the least success with the treatments had no weight change, or even an increase in weight, over time. Still, GLP-1 medications may have benefits far beyond weight loss \u2013 for heart and liver health, for example \u2013 which may extend even to people who don\u2019t lose as many pounds as they might have expected, experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to not use the scale as the only outcome of whether you should stay on this medication. People might be making slow but steady progress, which could warrant ongoing treatment,\u201d Dushay said. \u201cThere may be some direct benefits of the medication in the absence of significant weight loss, which is also why you should be talking to your doctor at length about why you\u2019re using this medication.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-treatment-real-world-effectiveness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_glp-1-drugs-stomach-paralysis", "text": "Injected medications that treat diabetes and obesity increase the risk of a rare but serious side effect: stomach paralysis, according to new data on the real-world use of the drugs. At least three new studies based on large collections of patient records show that the risk of being diagnosed with stomach paralysis, or gastroparesis, is higher for people who take GLP-1 agonists than for those who don\u2019t. The studies have not been scrutinized by outside experts or published in medical journals, so the data is considered preliminary. Two were presented Saturday at the medical conference Digestive Disease Week 2024 in Washington; the third is slated to be presented Monday. Injected medications called GLP-1 agonists are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss.\u00a0In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose at least 10% of their starting weight.\u00a0Studies have also concluded that they have benefits for the heart as well as the waistline. Drugmaker Novo Nordisk said 25,000 people are starting Wegovy every week in the US alone. The drugs curb hunger by slowing passage of food through the stomach. They also help the body release more insulin and help send signals to the brain that turn down cravings. In some people, however, these medications can also cause unpleasant-to-severe bouts of vomiting, which may require medical attention.\u00a0They can also slow the stomach so much that medical tests show a condition called gastroparesis. Most of the time, doctors say, gastroparesis will improve after stopping the medication.\u00a0But some people say that their condition did not get better even months after coming off the drug, with life-altering consequences. Measuring the risk of gastroparesis In the new studies, the risk of gastroparesis appears to be rare, but it is consistent.\u00a0Compared with similar people who didn\u2019t take GLP-1 medications, those who did had about a 50% higher risk of being diagnosed with the condition. One study led by researchers at University Hospitals in Cleveland used records collected by the TriNetX database, which includes millions of patient records from 80 contributing heath care organizations.\u00a0The analysis focused on adults who were obese, with a body mass index higher than 30, but who did not have a diagnosis of diabetes and had not been diagnosed with gastroparesis or pancreatitis at least six months before starting a GLP-1 medication.\u00a0Records from more than 286,000 patients were included in the study. Diabetes by itself can also increase the risk of gastroparesis, especially if a person\u2019s blood sugar hasn\u2019t been well-controlled for a long period of time. Among people who were prescribed a GLP-1 medication for weight loss \u2013 such as semaglutide (branded as Ozempic and Wegovy), exenatide (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza) \u2013 10 out of every 10,000, or 0.1%, were diagnosed with gastroparesis at least six months later.\u00a0By comparison, 4 out of 10,000 people, or 0.04%, who were matched in the database based on their age, sex, ethnicity and other factors, but who were not taking a GLP-1 medication, developed the condition. The difference, which was statistically significant, amounted to a 52% increased risk of being diagnosed with stomach paralysis while on a GLP-1 medication. A second study, led by researchers at the University of Kansas, also used records from the TriNetX research network database.\u00a0It included patients who were prescribed GLP-1 medications for diabetes or obesity between December 2021 and November 2022, and it compared them with people who had diabetes or obesity and had been seen by a doctor during the same time frame but had not been prescribed a GLP-1 medication. Records from nearly 300,000 patients were included in the study. Compared with those who were not taking a GLP-1 medication, those who did were about 66% more likely to be diagnosed with gastroparesis.\u00a0This study found that 0.53% of patients on GLP-1 medications were diagnosed with stomach paralysis, or about 1 case of gastroparesis for every 200 people taking the drugs. People taking GLP-1 medications were also more likely to have nausea and vomiting or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to be prescribed a proton pump inhibitor.\u00a0They were more likely to have their gallbladders removed and experience drug-induced pancreatitis. \u201cAlthough these drugs do work and should be used for the right reason, we just want to caution everyone that if you do decide to start this, be prepared that you have a 30 percent chance that you may have GI side effects, and then the drug may have to be discontinued,\u201d said study author Dr. Prateek Sharma, a professor of medicine at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. Some side effects with the medications may also diminish over time as people get used to their doses. This is one reason doctors start with a low dose of the drug and work up to higher amounts over time. Sharma noted that the study included people who had diabetes in both the group taking the GLP-1 medications and in the comparison group, and they still found a higher incidence of stomach paralysis in those taking the medications, suggesting that diabetes alone wasn\u2019t driving the increased risk. \u201cThe drug was the only thing which was different between these two groups,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we do show that all GI side effects or symptoms, nausea, vomiting and gastroparesis, were significantly higher in the GLP-1 takers as compared to the controls,\u201d said Sharma, who is also president-elect of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Was an adverse event missed in clinical trials? Even though these drugs have been extensively studied, Sharma thinks it is possible that gastroparesis is rare enough that it didn\u2019t show up in the drugs\u2019 clinical trials because they didn\u2019t include enough patients. \u201cYou need hundreds of thousands of patients to come up with these conclusions, but that\u2019s why I think these database studies are much more important there,\u201d Sharma said. Another reason it may have been missed in clinical trials was the way researchers often test for it, according to Dr. Michael Camilleri, a gastroenterologist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic who has studied gastroparesis with the GLP-1 drug liraglutide. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, if you\u2019re going to study the problem with gastric emptying, you have to look at the gastric emptying of solids, not of liquids,\u201d from the stomach, Camilleri said. Liquids pass through the stomach more rapidly than solids. \u201cWhen the pharmaceutical companies did the appraisal of the effects of this class of medications on gastric emptying, they usually use a method that assesses the emptying of liquids from the stomach,\u201d he said. It\u2019s called the acetaminophen absorption test, and it\u2019s often used because it\u2019s faster and less expensive than a gastric emptying study with scintigraphy, which uses a radioactive tracer to see how much solid food is left in the stomach hours after a meal. Acetaminophen is absorbed through the stomach and carried into the bloodstream by liquids. Measuring how quickly acetaminophen shows up in the blood can give an idea how fast liquids are passing through the stomach, but not solids. Camilleri and other experts say acetaminophen absorption is not an adequate test for gastroparesis on GLP-1 medications. Camilleri was a co-author on a third study being presented Monday at Digestive Disease Week that looked at gastroparesis with GLP-1 medications. That study combed through records of nearly 80,000 patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication by doctors in the Mayo Clinic\u2019s health system.\u00a0The researchers focused on a subset of 839 people who\u2019d had symptoms of gastroparesis and who had gotten a gold-standard test for the condition: a procedure called gastric emptying scintigraphy. About one-third of that group, 241 people, had food in their stomach four hours after eating a test meal, which means they qualified as having gastroparesis. However, the study didn\u2019t calculate the difference in the risk of gastroparesis between people using the drugs and those who were not. Camilleri said it\u2019s likely that the gastroparesis risk is be underestimated in these studies because not everyone who had symptoms would have ultimately gotten the test needed to diagnose it. In the Mayo Clinic study, women and people who also reported having constipation on the GLP-1 medications were more likely to receive a diagnosis of gastroparesis. Camilleri said that constipation may be one clue that people will have trouble with gastroparesis on a GLP-1 medication but that there are still many questions to answer. \u201cFor the people who get this complication, it is extremely serious,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/glp-1-drugs-stomach-paralysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial", "text": "When Cheri Ferguson started taking Ozempic last year, she said, she hoped to lose about 50 pounds she\u2019d gained during the Covid-19 pandemic. Over about three months, she told CNN in June, the medicine \u2013 which is approved for type 2 diabetes and used off-label for weight loss \u2013 helped reduce the constant chatter in her brain urging her to eat, just what she\u2019d hoped it would do. But it had another unexpected effect: Ferguson said her desire to drink alcohol and use her vape pen also drained away. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone\u2019s just come along and switched the light on, and you can see the room for what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of these vapes and cigarettes that you\u2019ve had over the years, they don\u2019t look attractive anymore. It\u2019s very, very strange. Very strange.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling described by thousands of people taking these medicines, which are in a class known as GLP-1 receptor agonists and used by an estimated 15 million Americans, according to a recent poll. And now, Ozempic\u2019s maker, Novo Nordisk, said it intends to study the phenomenon. The company plans to start assessing the effects of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and other medicines on alcohol consumption this month in a newly announced clinical trial in alcohol-related liver disease \u2013 although cutting drinking isn\u2019t the study\u2019s main goal. A focus on liver disease, not addiction The Danish drug giant has been saying since at least last year that it doesn\u2019t plan to study semaglutide \u2013 which is also approved for weight loss as Wegovy \u2013 in areas like alcohol addiction, despite so many anecdotal reports like Ferguson\u2019s, and academic studies that are already underway. Novo Nordisk reiterated that stance Wednesday, noting that the main purpose of its new trial is to assess whether the medicines can improve liver health. Its primary measure is the medicines\u2019 effects on enhanced liver fibrosis, or scarring, over 28 weeks. \u201cSecondary endpoints include safety and tolerability and changes in alcohol consumption,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThere is a significant unmet medical need in alcohol-related liver disease, and the first line of treatment for the condition is lifestyle intervention to refrain from drinking alcohol.\u201d The trial, first reported by Bloomberg News, aims to enroll about 240 participants and is slated to begin May 20, according to a government database. \u201cEven though not all patients in the trial will have alcohol use disorder, it is natural to include alcohol consumption as a secondary endpoint,\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s spokesperson said, noting that the trial is part of the company\u2019s plans to address liver diseases more broadly. Nonetheless, researchers in addiction science cheered the news. A need for more treatments \u201cThose of us doing work in this area see this as a step in the right direction,\u201d Christian Hendershot, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Bowles Center of Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who is running one of the few studies in this area, said by email Wednesday. \u201cAdditional treatment options for this group are really needed.\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s CEO told CNN in August that the company had heard many similar anecdotal reports. \u201cWe\u00a0know\u00a0that\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0benefits\u00a0in\u00a0obesity\u00a0is\u00a0that\u00a0it\u00a0addresses\u00a0this\u00a0craving,\u00a0the\u00a0desire,\u00a0to\u00a0snack\u00a0and eat,\u201d Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. \u201cThat function in the brain, in this craving center, is perhaps also what is benefitting some of the other addictions.\u201d Studies in animals suggest the same thing, National Institutes of Health researcher Dr. Lorenzo Leggio told CNN last year. He published a study in May 2023 showing that semaglutide reduces alcohol drinking in rodents, noting that \u201cat least one of the mechanisms of how these drugs reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol,\u201d like those related to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Jorgensen said Novo Nordisk hadn\u2019t studied that effect and had no plans to do so at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0the\u00a0easiest\u00a0to\u00a0study,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t expect that we would go in and study these addictions widely.\u201d Jorgensen did say there could be \u201can opportunity to collect data when we do large studies,\u201d as well as to use artificial intelligence to mine large databases of experiences with the medicines in the real world for signals of effects on things like alcohol use. A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes tirzepatide-based competitors to Ozempic and Wegovy called Mounjaro and Zepbound, said Wednesday that it too had seen \u201canecdotal commentary in publications about the potential use of GLP-1s for additional indications like addiction.\u201d But while the Indianapolis-based drugmaker continues \u201cto evaluate future development options for tirzepatide,\u201d the spokesperson said the company hadn\u2019t announced any plans to develop its medicines for those uses. An unattractive market for drugmakers Medicines for addiction, and particularly for alcohol use, haven\u2019t been successful financially for the drug industry, leading to less interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing drugs in the space. Research from financial firm TD Cowen found that less than 5% of the 29 million Americans estimated to have alcohol-use disorder receive drug therapy. The firm pointed to issues like doctors not being familiar with medicines to treat alcohol use and compliance with the drugs. \u201cAlcohol is now the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver transplantation in the US,\u201d Leggio told CNN by email Thursday. \u201cWe do need to develop novel treatments for alcohol-associated liver disease itself, plus novel treatments for the underlying medical problem that leads to ALD; that is, alcohol use disorder.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very promising and exciting that a company like Novo Nordisk is taking the lead in conducting such an important clinical trial,\u201d Leggio said. Novo Nordisk is looking at multiple medicines in its newly announced trial in alcohol-related liver disease; in addition to semaglutide, the company said it will investigate experimental drugs cagrilintide and zalfermin \u2013 listed on the trial posting as NNC0194-0499 \u2013 alone and in combination. Cagrilintide is a medicine that mimics a hormone called amylin that Novo Nordisk is testing in combination with semaglutide \u2013 which mimics another hormone, called GLP-1 \u2013 in large trials in both diabetes and weight loss, calling the combination CagriSema. Zalfermin, the company said, acts like yet another metabolic hormone, FGF21, which is produced mainly in the liver. Though trials in use of semaglutide and similar medicines have been slow to start, so many reports of the drugs\u2019 effects on alcohol use have emerged that Leggio, Hendershot and other researchers warned in a commentary in the journal Nature Medicine that the drugs shouldn\u2019t be prescribed for alcohol-use disorder until their safety and efficacy has been proven in clinical trials. \u201cClinical decisions should follow from controlled studies, triangulated with other clinical and preclinical evidence,\u201d the researchers wrote in the December commentary. \u201cWell-controlled [trials] with scientific rigor are needed before any claim of efficacy for alcohol-use disorder and other substance use disorders can be made.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/ozempic-alcohol-consumption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_skin-cancer-screening-wellness", "text": "Skin cancer is by far the most common form of cancer in the United States, according to the\u00a0American Cancer Society. With summer coming in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s time to check in with CNN wellness expert and emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen about the dangers of skin cancer and the need for safe sun exposure. As we head into summer, what do we need to know about the chance of developing skin cancer? And how can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration needs to be checked out? Which health care provider should be contacted if there is a concern? Should people get full-body skin cancer screening exams? Are self-exams useful? Wen has some answers for us, as well as steps everyone can take to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.\u00a0An emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University, she previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: I was surprised to learn that skin cancer is so common. What are the major forms of skin cancer? Dr. Leana Wen: There are\u00a0three main forms\u00a0of skin cancer. The most common type is called basal cell carcinoma. These cancers can look like an elevated transparent bump on the skin and most frequently occur on the head, neck and other areas most exposed to the sun. Although these cancers generally develop slowly, they can grow deep and damage nerves and bones. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer. These often resemble a red bump and may manifest as a sore or wound that heals and then opens up again. These, too, tend to appear in areas with frequent sun exposure\u00a0and can also appear on the lip and ear. They can grow deep and spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is the third type that is critical to know. That\u2019s because while it only accounts for 1% of total cancers, it is the\u00a0cause of the majority of deaths\u00a0from skin cancer. In the United States in 2024, more than 8,000 people will die annually from this cancer. Melanoma can develop within a mole that already exists or as a new dark spot on the skin. There is also an association with sun exposure and melanoma. According to the American Cancer Society, though melanoma risk increases with age, it is\u00a0one of the most common cancers\u00a0in young adults. CNN: How can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration should be checked out by a medical professional? Wen:\u00a0There is an\u00a0\u201cABCDE\u201d rule\u00a0that describes warning features that could signify a melanoma. A is for asymmetry, if the shape of\u00a0one half\u00a0of the mole does not match the other. B is for border. A mole with blurred, irregular edges could be concerning. C is for color, meaning a mole that has multiple colors and shades. D is for diameter. Some melanomas can be very small, but most are over 6 millimeters, about \u00bc inch, wide. E is for evolving, meaning that the mole has changed over the past weeks or months. Anyone who notices these features of a mole should get it checked out. In addition, people who notice a new growth, a spot or bump that is increasing in size over time, a skin discoloration that is causing discomfort\u00a0or a sore that doesn\u2019t\u00a0get better\u00a0should also seek medical attention. CNN: Should people make an appointment with a dermatologist? What if they don\u2019t have one? Wen:\u00a0Those who have a dermatologist should contact that person first. Sometimes, a referral from a primary care provider may be necessary. People who have concerning signs that could point to melanoma should clearly state this as a reason \u2014 that they have a change in size or color of a mole, for example, and they are concerned about skin cancer. CNN: Is it recommended for everyone to receive regular skin cancer screening tests? Wen: The influential\u00a0US\u00a0Preventive Services Task Force issued a\u00a0recommendation\u00a0in 2023 that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus risks\u00a0of regular visual skin examination as a method to screen for skin cancer. It\u2019s important to note that this is the general recommendation for people at average risk for skin cancer\u00a0who\u00a0have\u00a0no suspicious moles or spots. People who do see concerning new skin changes should be sure to contact their physician right away. In addition, those who are at increased risk for skin cancer should ask a dermatologist if they should receive regular skin exams. These are done via visual inspection by the physician, meaning that the doctor looks over the entire body. Certain moles may be removed for biopsy to see if they are cancerous. CNN: What are factors that put someone at higher risk for skin cancer? Wen:\u00a0One main factor is ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. People who have extensive sun exposure, history of sunburns and tanning bed use are at elevated risk. Age is also a risk factor; the longer someone has UV exposure, the higher their risk. Those with 50 or more moles are also at higher risk, as are people with fair complexions. There are also specific risk factors related to personal and family medical history. These include personal or family history of skin cancer, history of precancerous lesions such as actinic keratoses, certain genetic disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum and history of immunosuppression. Individuals with risk factors, or who are not certain about them, should contact their physician to come up with a plan for screening. CNN: What about self-exams? Can these be helpful? Wen: Yes. It is a good idea for everyone to check their skin for moles. Look for the ABCDE warning signs as well as any new spots or sores that are itchy, tender\u00a0or painful. People should also remember to check everywhere on their bodies. While skin cancer is most likely in sun-exposed areas, other places are possible, too, including the palms of your hands, soles of your feet and genital areas. A good time to check is when you shower,\u00a0bathe, change clothes\u00a0or apply lotion. You could also ask for help from a family member or friend, especially in hard-to-see areas like the scalp. CNN: What are steps to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer? Wen:\ufeff Reducing UV exposure is a crucial step that everyone can take. That means, when possible, staying in the shade; wearing clothing that covers arms and legs; wearing a hat that covers the face, head, ears\u00a0and neck; and\u00a0regularly\u00a0using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. You can turn to the\u00a0excellent Environmental Working Group\u2019s resource on choosing sunscreens\u00a0that I use and that I recommend to everyone to find an effective sunscreen that works for your lifestyle, budget\u00a0and personal preferences. People should keep in mind that UV rays penetrate and can cause harm not just during the summer but year-round. Also, UV is not just present when it\u2019s sunny but also on cloudy days, and\u00a0the rays\u00a0can reflect off surfaces like snow, sand and water. And it\u2019s not only people who are fair-skinned who can have skin cancer;\u00a0individuals of all colors, including those with brown and Black skin, can develop skin cancer. Finally, I strongly urge people not to use indoor tanning beds. These expose users to high levels of UV rays and increase the risk of developing skin cancer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/skin-cancer-screening-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "health"}}
