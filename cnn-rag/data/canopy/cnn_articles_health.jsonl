Exposure to those toxins during pregnancy can create serious health issues in elementary school children that can affect their lives for years to come, a new study found. Children born to European mothers exposed to four families of chemicals that disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine (hormone) system had elevated levels of metabolic syndrome at ages 6 to 11. Metabolic syndrome can include obesity, elevated blood pressure, and abnormally high cholesterol and insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Within the group of children exposed to the highest levels of chemicals, 62% were overweight or obese, compared with 16% of children within the low-risk group, said first author Nuria Gu\u0308il-Oumrait, a Fulbright scholar at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cMoreover, the levels of blood insulin and triglycerides, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group,\u201d G\u00fcil-Oumrait said in an email. \u201cIn contrast, HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group.\u201d HDL cholesterol is considered a \u201cgood\u201d blood fat as it helps clear ateries. Metabolic syndrome is typically associated with adult cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, but the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has seen symptoms appearing in kids at younger and younger ages. Having metabolic syndrome as a child is highly predictive of chronic disease as an adult, experts say. \u201cThis research stands out as one of the most comprehensive endeavors delving into early-life environmental origins of metabolic risk, further bolstering prior toxicological and epidemiological evidence in this area,\u201d said Vicente Mustieles, Mariana Ferna\u0301ndez and Carmen Messerlian in an editorial published with the study that appeared Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Mustieles and Fern\u00e1ndez are investigators at the Biomedical Research Center at the University of Granada, Spain. Messerlian is an assistant professor of environmental reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. CNN reached out to the International Council for Chemical Associations for comment but did not hear back before publication. A spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, however, provided the following statement. \u201cWe will review the details of this study once it\u2019s released. ACC\u2019s members are serious about their responsibility to produce chemistries that offer important safety, product performance and durability benefits and that can be used safely. Our members undertake extensive scientific analyses to evaluate potential risk of their chemicals, from development through use and safe disposal.\u201d Dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals The research team behind the new study performed blood and urine tests on 1,134 mothers during their pregnancies and later repeated those tests on their children between the ages of 6 and 11. The tests were looking for mixtures of nine chemical classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly found in the environment. Endrocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants with the \u201cability to cross the blood-placenta barrier and interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance,\u201d the study said. These and other chemicals \u201cend up in the blood, tissue, and organs of fetuses and infants through maternal transplacental and breastfeeding pathways in a never-ending cycle,\u201d Mustieles, Fern\u00e1ndez and Messerlian wrote. The study tested for pesticides; heavy metals; flame retardants; plasticizers such as phthalates and phenols; and PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are found in surface and groundwaters around the world at levels much higher than many international regulators allow. Called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because\u00a0they fail to break down fully in the environment, PFAS have been used since the 1950s to make consumer products nonstick, oil- and water-repellent, and resistant to temperature change. Some of the most studied PFAS, such as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone disruption,\u00a0according to the EPA. Toxic heavy metals in the soil and water include lead and arsenic  \u2014 studies have found alarming levels in manufactured baby food. There is no safe level of lead, while arsenic, mercury and other heavy metals can harm the body and brain at relatively low doses, experts say. A December 2014 meta-analysis of studies on arsenic\u00a0found that a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15. Flame retardants have been linked to a 300% higher risk of cancer. These chemical toxins are the greatest contributor to intellectual disability in children worldwide, resulting in a total loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability, according to an\u00a0August 2020 study. Phthalates, found in hundreds of consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys, have been connected to premature death among people ages 55 to 64\u00a0in the United States. Prior research has connected phthalates with\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and\u00a0undescended testicles in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and testosterone levels in adult males. Phthalates are also linked in studies to\u00a0childhood obesity,\u00a0asthma,\u00a0cardiovascular issues\u00a0and\u00a0cancer. In the study, phthalates were the only group of chemicals that were associated with a lower level of metabolic syndrome. All of the other chemical families increased risk. People are exposed to a mixture of chemicals daily Chemicals may vary in their impact on the body. For example, certain PFAS compounds tend to accumulate in the liver, contributing to fatty liver disease and high cholesterol. And flame retardants and other chemicals may be stored in body fat, contributing to obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, according to the editorial. Since people are exposed to numerous types of potentially toxic substances each day, designing a study that could capture the cumulative impact on different parts of the body would provide a more realistic picture of any potential health impact. By focusing on metabolic syndrome, which combines measurements of blood sugars, lipids such as cholesterol, the existence of fat tissue and the impact on the heart, the current study was one of the first to accomplish this goal, the editorial said. \u201cWe almost always consider health risks from single chemicals, one at a time, as if we are exposed to just one chemical at a time,\u201d said Jane Houlihan, the national director of science and health for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies\u2019 exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. \u201cHere the research team shows that children\u2019s risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life can be driven by the complex mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the body at any moment and it highlights the particular risk of chemical exposures during pregnancy,\u201d she said. Healthy Babies Bright Futures\u00a0published a report in 2019\u00a0that found toxic metals in 95% of the baby foods randomly pulled off supermarket shelves, which led to the introduction of The Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, a bill that would allow the US Food and Drug Administration to set stricter standards and allow the FDA to monitor these standards through access to the records of food suppliers and manufacturers. \u201cGiven the steep rise in metabolic syndrome in the US, health officials and companies should be doing all they can to tighten safety standards and to get these chemicals out of commerce and out of our everyday products,\u201d Houlihan said. How to limit exposure There are ways to minimize exposure to plastics and other toxins, which is especially critical during pregnancy and childhood as developing fetuses and small bodies are more easily damaged, Houlihan said. Reduce rice intake for infants and children, and be sure to rinse grains well before using as this removes up to 60% of the arsenic, she said. Limit juice and be sure to carefully wash and peel vegetables and fruits, and if possible, buy organic. Stay away from stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and don\u2019t use waterproofing sprays. Check your local area for levels of PFAS and other chemicals in your drinking water. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy nonprofit, has created a national tap water database\u00a0searchable by zip code\u00a0that lists PFAS and other concerning chemicals, as well as a\u00a0national map\u00a0that illustrates where PFAS has been detected in the US. If your drinking water is of concern, consider purchasing a reverse osmosis filter, the most effective kind, EWG said. NSF, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, has\u00a0a list of recommended filters. Tap water is often a better choice than bottled water, however, which is packed with nanoplastics that can invade cells and tissues and leach toxic chemicals into the body. At home, one easy change is to use glass or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones when heating food. If possible, try to cook with ceramic, cast iron, or stainless-steel pans and avoid cookware treated with chemicals to avoid food sticking. Another good choice is to use stainless steel or glass bottles instead of plastic ones. \u201cChoose cosmetics that are free from endocrine disruptors such as parabens, benzophenone, triclosan, and phthalates,\u201d Gu\u0308il-Oumrait suggested. Consider the same for food, sunscreens, household cleaners and other everyday products encased in plastic. The EWG has several consumer databases that provides links to consumer products with fewer chemicals, including food scores, personal care products, sunscreen recommendations and a healthy living app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_health_summer-health-safety-memorial-day-wellness", "text": "Memorial Day is here, and soon summer will arrive. The threat of some diseases, such as Covid-19 is receding, though there are\u00a0new coronavirus variants to keep an eye on, and a second\u00a0human case of the bird flu has just been detected in the United States. With Memorial Day gatherings getting underway in the US, how worried should people be about the coronavirus and bird flu? Knowing that there are outbreaks of bird flu among poultry and cows, is it safe to keep drinking milk and eating eggs? Are there any special precautions to take while preparing hamburgers? What are other major health issues to consider over the holidays and leading into the summer, such as keeping cool to avoid heatstroke? To help us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University, and she previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: Given the spread of avian flu and new coronavirus variants, is there anything we should do?\u00a0 Dr. Leana Wen:\u00a0Though there are\u00a0new coronavirus variants, the level of coronavirus activity in the United States is quite low. People should\u00a0assess their risk\u00a0of severe illness if they were to contract Covid-19. Those at high risk, such as those who are elderly or with chronic medical conditions, should be sure that they are up to date with vaccines and have a plan for accessing antiviral treatment. They should test if they experience symptoms, and so should others with whom they have close contact. Those who want to reduce their risk of contracting the coronavirus and other respiratory viruses further should try to attend outdoor rather than indoor gatherings when possible. When traveling in crowded airports and train stations, they could consider wearing well-fitting N95 or equivalent masks. Regarding bird flu, the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0continues to advise that the risk to Americans is low at this time. That\u2019s because there have only been\u00a0two human cases\u00a0this year, and both have been in farmworkers with direct exposure to infected cattle. Both individuals had mild symptoms, and there have been no cases of human-to-human transmission during this outbreak. People who work in the poultry and dairy industry and who otherwise come into regular contact with wild birds, backyard flocks and cows should heed the\u00a0CDC\u2019s guidance\u00a0and wear personal protective equipment when working with animals. Health care providers should be on the lookout for farmworkers with possible flulike symptoms. Other people do not need to change their behaviors at this time, and they certainly should not worry about infection with avian flu during Memorial Day or early summer gatherings. CNN: Does that mean it\u2019s still safe to keep drinking milk and eating eggs and meat? Wen:\u00a0Yes. The US Food and Drug Administration has\u00a0issued guidance\u00a0that pasteurized milk is safe to drink.\u00a0Viral fragments have been in found in the commercial milk supply; however, these were not live viruses that could cause infections. Pasteurization kills viruses, including the influenza virus. Similarly, testing by the US Department of Agriculture found\u00a0no live virus\u00a0in hamburgers cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit. The agency advises that\u00a0cooked eggs and poultry\u00a0are also safe to eat. This, of course, does not mean that people should consume raw or undercooked meat. These meats harbor a whole variety of pathogens, including bacteria like E. coli and salmonella. In addition, raw milk is not safe to drink. This, too, can harbor bacteria. Moreover, one hypothesis for how avian flu is being transmitted is through raw milk. People should not consume unpasteurized milk or products made from raw milk. CNN: How does this translate to gatherings? Is it OK to eat hamburgers and hot dogs, and enjoy barbecues and buffets? Wen:\u00a0Yes! Make sure to follow\u00a0general precautions\u00a0around preventing foodborne illnesses. Cook meat to the\u00a0recommended internal temperatures. Be aware of what containers or utensils come into contact with raw meat and keep clean utensils separate from dirty ones. Refrigerate meat until ready to cook. If you use a cooler, make sure to have an insulated one with lots of ice. And wash your hands often and well. CNN: We\u2019ve talked a lot about infections. What\u00a0are other major health issues to consider over the holidays and leading into the summer, such as keeping cool to prevent heatstroke? Wen:\u00a0When the weather gets hot outside, we have to watch out for the\u00a0effects of high temperatures on health. Heatstroke occurs when someone has a body temperature above 103 degrees Fahrenheit and can no longer effectively cool themselves. This is a medical emergency and can quickly become fatal. People should be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion, which can progress to heatstroke. They should watch out for those most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses. That includes children and the elderly and other individuals with medical conditions that reduce their ability to regulate their body temperatures. When high temperatures are forecast, everyone \u2014 especially the most vulnerable \u2014 should try to stay inside in air-conditioned spaces or under the shade if they are outdoors. They should keep hydrated and immediately seek shelter in a cool place if they develop symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, muscle aches and tiredness. CNN: And we can\u2019t forget skin protection, right? Wen:\u00a0Absolutely.\u00a0Skin cancer\u00a0is the most common cancer in the United States. One of the key risk factors is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Everyone should take steps to reduce their UV exposure. These include staying in the shade, wearing a hat and using\u00a0broad-spectrum sunscreen\u00a0with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Speaking of prevention, summers are often a period of the year when people have more time on their hands. I advise everyone to take this chance and follow up with their physician on all their health concerns. Now is the time to make sure they are up to date on\u00a0cancer screenings and to get chronic medical concerns, like high blood pressure and diabetes, under good control.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/summer-health-safety-memorial-day-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_world_boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn", "text": "A Saturday launch for the highly anticipated crewed maiden voyage of Boeing\u2019s Starliner is off the table \u2014 and NASA has announced a new target date. Starliner\u2019s first flight carrying astronauts is now expected to lift off no earlier than June 1 at 12:25 p.m. ET, with several backup opportunities in the days following, according to a statement from NASA late Wednesday. \u201cMission managers from NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) continue to evaluate a path forward toward launching the agency\u2019s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station,\u201d the space agency said in the statement. The update comes after several previous delays this month, and a week after Starliner mission teams\u00a0reported a small helium leak\u00a0in the service module of the spacecraft. They traced the leak to a part called a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. Last week, NASA announced that teams were aiming to launch no earlier than May 25, saying the additional time before launch would give specialists more time to evaluate the issue. The agency said tests have found that the leak doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the mission. However, while studying the leak, mission teams also spotted a \u201cdesign vulnerability\u201d in the propulsion system \u2014 essentially identifying a remote scenario in which certain thrusters might fail as the vehicle was leaving Earth\u2019s orbit, without a backup method of getting home safely. NASA and Boeing have since worked with the vendor of the thruster to come up with a backup way to perform the deorbit burn, should that situation arise, said Steve Stich, manager of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, in a Friday news conference. \u201cWe have restored that redundancy for the backup capability in a very remote set of failures for the direct burn,\u201d Stich said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a (Delta-Agency\u00a0Flight\u00a0Test\u00a0Readiness Review) on May 29 to review both the leak and the changes to the way we would execute a deorbit burn in a remote set of failures.\u201d This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The historic crewed flight was about two hours from liftoff on May 6 when it was scrubbed due to\u00a0an issue with the a valve\u00a0on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families, Boeing said last week. They remain in pre-flight quarantine and continue to practice in Starliner simulators, the space agency said.  Boeing\u2019s historic goals The Crew Flight Test is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand US options for ferrying astronauts to the space station. A rocky start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. Williams and Wilmore were already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule May 6 when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the latest issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket caused\u00a0further delay. \u201cThere has been a great deal of exceptional analysis and testing over the last two weeks by the joint NASA, Boeing, and ULA teams to replace the Centaur Self Regulating Valve and troubleshoot the Starliner Service Module helium manifold leak,\u201d\u00a0Stich said. \u201cIt has been important that we take our time to understand all the complexities of each issue including the redundant capabilities of the Starliner propulsion system and any implications to our Interim Human Rating Certification,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will launch Butch and Suni on this test mission after the entire community has reviewed the teams progress and flight rationale at the upcoming Delta Agency Flight Test Readiness Review.\u201d If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit, as Starliner begins firing its own engines. The vehicle will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The history-making crew will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_bird-flu-wastewater-monitoring-texas", "text": "In early March, Dr. Blake Hanson and his colleagues at the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute were preparing for a fire drill of sorts. What if a virus with the potential to spark the next pandemic turned up in the wastewater they monitor?\u00a0And what if that virus was the bird flu, H5N1, which has killed millions of animals and about half the nearly 900 people it has infected worldwide over the past two decades? They gamed out this what-if exercise on a Monday.\u00a0By Thursday of that same week, Hanson\u2019s colleague, Dr. Michael Tisza, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was ringing the alarm. This time, it was not a drill. \u201cMike had called me and said, \u2018Hey, I think I found it,\u2019\u201d said Hanson, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston who uses big data methods and genomics to investigate infectious diseases. That was March 7, about three weeks before the US Department of Agriculture announced that H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas for the first time. A different kind of wastewater monitoring Over the past two years, as the idea of sampling sewer systems for the virus that causes Covid-19 and other pathogens has caught on across the country, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute \u2014 or TEPHI \u2014 took a different approach. Rather than looking only for specific viruses, researchers there decided to use advanced techniques and computers to help sift through the vast soup of genetic material in their wastewater samples.\u00a0By doing this, they\u2019re able to find viruses they expect to see as well as ones they don\u2019t know to look for. \u201cWe can capture every known virus that that\u2019s in the sample, and then the computational team will analyze the data comprehensively and see signals for many viruses, and that\u2019s the benefit, I think, of what we\u2019re doing relative to other sites,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Maresso, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who envisioned the system. At least two other organizations have also been looking for signs of H5N1 in wastewater. The WastewaterSCAN network, which is directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory Universities and Verily, recently posted a preprint study showing that it could detect the H5N1 virus in wastewater by looking for one specific part of the virus. In addition to that early data, the team has since tested three additional sewer systems: one in North Carolina near a known H5N1 cattle outbreak, one in a California city that was having an unseasonably high number of human influenza A cases and one in a city in Hawaii where there are no dairy processing plants and no known cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In each case, the test correctly ruled in or out H5N1 infections. It was so successful that WastewaterSCAN plans to start using the test at all 190 wastewater sites it monitors. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently launched a dashboard showing sites where influenza A viruses are being detected at unusually high levels. H5N1 is an A strain of the flu virus, like some types of seasonal flu.\u00a0Detecting A strains now, in the offseason, is a reasonable proxy for H5N1, Maresso said, but it will be a less useful approach when seasonal influenza picks up again in the winter. TEPHI\u2019s system, on the other hand, could serve as a first alert for new viruses, the holy grail of pandemic prevention.\u00a0Since the team started monitoring in 2022, they have found over 400 viruses in Texas wastewater. Data at the flush of a toilet Unlike taking a swab of a person\u2019s \u2014 or a cow\u2019s \u2013\u2014bodily secretions, wastewater monitoring is passive and doesn\u2019t depend on getting permission to test or having a person come into a clinic or emergency room, care that may be out of reach for farmworkers.\u00a0Researchers get data every time someone flushes a toilet or perhaps when wastewater systems treat agricultural waste, such as the permitted disposal of discarded milk.  The biggest drawback of wastewater monitoring is that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the pathogen. Since March 4, the date of the sample in which H5N1 was first detected by the TEPHI group, the researchers have found it all over the state, in the wastewater of nine cities in Texas and in 19 of the 23 sites they monitor.\u00a0They did not name the cities they tested in the study but said they did notify local public health authorities and the CDC about their results. Their findings were published recently as a preprint study, ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. Source of the signal is still a mystery \u201cWe don\u2019t really know where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d said Dr. Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHouston School of Public Health and director of TEPHI. \u201cWe can all guess, and some people have their favorite ideas,\u201d he said, noting that Texas is in the path of two major flyways for migratory birds and has a large agricultural industry that includes farmed birds and cows. But H5N1 has been tearing through wild and commercially farmed bird flocks in the US since 2022, when the team started monitoring wastewater, and they haven\u2019t seen it in any of their samples until now. \u201cCertainly, something that\u2019s different now,\u201d Tisza said, \u201cis that it\u2019s commonly infecting dairy cows.\u201d Only one person has tested positive for H5N1 in connection with the cattle outbreak.\u00a0That person, a farm worker who had close contact with infected cows and developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or redness and swelling of the eyes, but no breathing problems or congestion.\u00a0He was treated with antiviral medications and has recovered, public health officials said. The CDC says the current risk to public health is low, but it\u2019s keeping a close eye on the situation. The FDA recently tested 297 samples of dairy products purchased at grocery stores across the country. In expanded test results released Monday, the agency said, it found samples that were positive for dead fragments of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 15 of the 38 states where products were processed. About 1 out of every 5 samples had some traces of the virus, indicating that the outbreak might be more widespread than previously known. TEPHI\u2019s Maresso says they can\u2019t rule out that what they are seeing is virus from milk that\u2019s been poured down the drain or even asymptomatic human infections.\u00a0He notes that they are not seeing an increase in flu cases in hospitals, which would alert them to severe infections. \u201cIt would be maybe a more easily solvable puzzle if it was just one or two sites and we had some dairy or other processing plants right near that that plant where we\u2019re sampling from. It would explain things. but we have essentially detected the signal on in nearly every site and certainly every city to this point,\u201d Maresso said \u2013 even big cities in the state that aren\u2019t near dairy farms. As far as the direction of the Texas outbreak, whether it\u2019s getting worse or going away, Tisza says, it\u2019s hard to say.\u00a0At first, he said, some cities his group monitors had a signal from H5N1 that was as strong as the one they see from seasonal influenza over the winter. \u201cBut overall, it\u2019s been only maybe about 25 percent of that signal,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as the overall trajectory, it\u2019s really kind of at a plateau right now. Not spiking up, not going away. So that in and of itself is interesting,\u201d said Tisza, who notes that they\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear from us again if there\u2019s a big spike.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/bird-flu-wastewater-monitoring-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness", "text": "Eating more ultraprocessed foods is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline and stroke, even if a person is trying to adhere to a Mediterranean diet, the\u00a0DASH diet or the\u00a0MIND diet, a new study found. All three diets are plant-based, focused on consuming more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds while limiting sugar, red meat and ultraprocessed foods. \u201cIf you increased your ultraprocessed food intake by 10% in the study, it increased your risk of cognitive impairment by 16%,\u201d said cardiologist\u00a0Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the study. \u201cYou can always extrapolate and say, \u2018Well, if someone increases their ultraprocessed food consumption by 100%, then they have 160% chance of cognitive impairment,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, this study can only show an association, not a direct cause and effect.\u201d On the flip side, eating more unprocessed or minimally processed foods was linked with a 12% lower risk of cognitive impairment, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology. Unprocessed foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs and milk. Minimally processed foods include culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils and foods such as canned goods and frozen vegetables that combine culinary ingredients with unprocessed foods. Ultraprocessed foods include prepackaged soups, sauces, frozen pizza, ready-to-eat meals and pleasure foods such as hot dogs, sausages, French fries, sodas, store-bought cookies, cakes, candies, doughnuts, ice cream and many more. Such foods are typically high in calories, added sugar and salt and low in fiber, all of which can contribute to cardiometabolic health problems, weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, experts say. An increased risk of stroke The study analyzed data on 30,000 people participating in the REGARD, or REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study, made up of 50% Whites and 50% Blacks in a nationally diverse group of people who have been followed for up to 20 years. The risk of stroke was 8% higher for people who added the most ultraprocessed foods to their diet as compared with those who ate minimally processed foods, said study author and neurologist Dr. W. Taylor Kimberly, chief\u00a0of the division of neurocritical care at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. That risk rose to 15% for Black participants, likely due to the impact of ultraprocessed foods on high blood pressure in that population, Kimberly said. However, if a person ate more unprocessed or minimally processed foods, the risk of stroke dropped by 9%, the study found. What is it about ultraprocessed foods that may allow them to sabotage efforts to follow a healthy diet? It could be their poor nutrient composition and tendency to spike blood sugars, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, obesity, elevated blood pressure and high cholesterol, said Peipei Gao and Zhendong Mei in an editorial published with the study. Mei is a research fellow in medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s\u00a0Hospital in Boston, while Gao is a graduate student in nutrition visiting Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also in Boston. Neither was involved in the study. Type 2 diabetes, obesity, elevated blood pressure and high cholesterol are all key risk factors for vascular disease in the heart and brain, they wrote. The impact on blood vessels that leads to stroke and cognitive decline may also be due \u201cto the presence of additives including emulsifiers, colorants, sweeteners, and nitrates/nitrites, which have been associated with disruptions in the gut microbial ecosystem and inflammation,\u201d they added. Growing dangers of ultraprocessed foods Studies on the dangers of eating ultraprocessed foods are piling up. According to a February review of 45 meta-analyses\u00a0on almost 10 million people, eating 10% more\u00a0ultraprocessed foods\u00a0raised the risk of developing or dying from dozens of adverse health conditions. That 10% increase was considered \u201cbaseline,\u201d and adding even more ultraprocessed foods might increase the risk, experts say. There was strong evidence that a higher intake of ultraprocessed foods was associated with about a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders, according to the review. Researchers also found highly suggestive evidence that eating more ultraprocessed foods raised the risk of obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression by 20%. \u201cWe really need to put a sign in the ultraprocessed food section, or on the packaging like they do on cigarettes, saying, \u2018Warning, this food may be detrimental to your health,\u2019\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWhat we think of as \u2018convenient food\u2019 really needs to change from a package of chips to an apple or carrot that is also shelf-stable and can travel in your purse or backpack,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to make that kind of stuff more readily available, especially to our kids and in food deserts where often all the available food is ultraprocessed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

{"id": "2024_05_28_health_empathy-contagious-wellness", "text": "People love to categorize teens as self-centered, but in my office, they are anything but that. \u201cHow should I help my friend?\u201d I hear that question at least three times a week from teens who recognize that their friends and classmates need support. They see a friend struggling, and they want to help. That\u2019s empathy. During adolescence, the main goal of teens is to build independence to prepare to fly the nest, and they do this by building connections with their peers. Close friendships provide stability, mutual support and stress relief for teens. Though it\u2019s common for teens to hang out in packs, both in person and online, it\u2019s not always obvious that some are learning to empathize with their peers. It\u2019s worth it to help our teens learn this consideration for others. A new study that tracked 184 people (99 females and 85 males) for two decades starting at age 13 found that empathy is catching. Researchers found that empathy spans three generations and has ripple effects that transmit from mother to teen to children, according to the study, which published May 22 in the journal Child Development. The best part about the study? Modeling empathy and engaging in empathic communication were the only strategies used. Researching empathy across generations Beginning in 1998, the teens, their mothers and their closest friend were all invited into the research lab at the University of Virginia to engage in problem-solving or advice-seeking first with their mom and then with their friend. All interactions were recorded to code for maternal warmth and emotional support from mother to teen, followed by coding for similar behaviors in how teens supported their friends when the friend asked for advice. When the teens were in their 30s and had kids of their own, they were surveyed to ask about their parenting behavior and their children\u2019s empathy. Results of this long-term study showed that mothers\u2019 empathy for their teens at 13 predicted teens\u2019 empathy for their friends during the adolescent years (ages 13-19), and that the ability to show empathic support to friends in the teen years predicted more supportive parenting in adulthood and greater empathy in the next generation of kids. When we practice empathy with our teens, we literally pay it forward for the next generation. Dr. Michele Borba, educational psychologist and author of \u201cThrivers: The Surprising Reasons Why Some Kids Struggle and Others Shine,\u201d was not surprised by the results. She was not involved in the study. \u201cThe best way to show empathy is with warm relationships,\u201d she explained. \u201cThese mothers showed parental warmth with their teens, and these teens learned empathy in the moment. They brought that empathy to their peers, and it all adds up as they grow until they become more emotionally secure parents themselves.\u201d  That can be hard to do with moody teens, so I asked Borba to share her top three tips for building empathy during the teen years. Look and listen more It\u2019s OK if you\u2019re not sure how to meet your teen in these emotional moments. \u201cParents often tell me they\u2019re worried about what to say when teens come to them,\u201d Borba said. \u201cI tell parents the best thing they can do is sit with their teens, focus on them, and listen to understand where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d Are you worried about handling intense teen emotions? I encourage parents to follow the 80/20 rule: listen 80% of the time; talk 20%. Teens want to feel seen and understood, and that\u2019s best achieved by listening and watching for their cues. Handle your own stress Stress can be contagious in families, and you can\u2019t help your teens if you are feeling compromised. \u201cYour empathy goes down when you\u2019re stressed, so take a breath and do what you need to do before you tune in and try to figure out what your teen needs,\u201d Borba said. \u201cWe all have our own coping strategies, but consider taking a brisk walk, phoning a friend or drinking some ice water to cool your own stress before you deal with your teen.\u201d Talk feelings more often There are clear benefits to being open and honest about all kinds of emotions. Parents should be mindful not to dump their own stressors on their teens, but it is healthy to identify and talk about feelings. \u201cResearch shows that teens often misinterpret how parents feel,\u201d Borba said. \u201cTalk about feelings more often to help confirm emotions and move on.\u201d Using \u201cI feel\u201d statements around the house gets the whole family into the habit of talking about feelings. Borba also pointed out that literary fiction is one of the simplest ways to get families engaged in talking about feelings. Read the same books so you can talk about the characters and storylines. Watching TV together is another way to discuss experiences with a little bit of distance. Above all, what your teens need from you is uninterrupted time together to feel heard and understood. Empathy development doesn\u2019t occur within the context of a single monologue, rather a series of chats over time. When your teens come to you for help or advice, drop everything (especially your devices) and listen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/health/empathy-contagious-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_health_black-bear-kabobs-trichinellosis", "text": "It was supposed to be a celebration, but one family\u2019s unique meal of black bear meat sent several members to the hospital instead. The celebration happened in summer 2022, according to the account in the latest edition of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. An extended family \u2013 unnamed in the report \u2013 came from across the country for a reunion in South Dakota. One family member, a hunter, brought some black bear meat that he had harvested in northern Saskatchewan in May 2022. The hunter said that the hunting outfitter had recommended freezing the meat to kill any potential parasites. The meat had been frozen for 45 days before it was thawed, and the family grilled it with some vegetables and served it as kebabs. Freezing can kill some parasites commonly found in black bears, but according to the World Organisation for Animal Health, some species of parasites are freeze-tolerant. Bears and other wildlife including wild boar, wolves and squirrels can often get sick with trichinellosis, a serious disease caused by parasitic roundworms of the genus Trichinella, but they will often appear perfectly healthy. When butchering the meat, it would be difficult to tell if it was contaminated because there are few signs of the parasite. Many wildlife experts tell bear hunters to consider all bear meat infected, and the CDC recommends cooking the meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill the parasites. Smoking, salting, drying and microwaving do not always kill them, experts say. The meat at the family reunion was initially served rare, but that was not the chef\u2019s intention, the CDC said. Rather, it was \u201cdifficult for the family members to visually ascertain the level of doneness\u201d because the meat was dark in color. After some of the family noticed that it was undercooked, they put it back on the grill before it was served again. It wasn\u2019t until after people had gone home that some started to get sick. The first illness was in a 29-year-old man who had to be hospitalized twice over a\u00a0three-week period. He reported symptoms of severe muscle pain and a fever, and his eyes became swollen. Blood tests showed that he had eosinophilia, a condition involving too many eosinophils in the body, a signal to doctors that someone could have allergies, cancer or parasites. It wasn\u2019t until his second trip to the hospital that doctors learned the man had eaten bear meat and suspected that he may have trichinellosis. Tests soon confirmed that that was the case, and tests were recommended for the other family members. Trichinellosis can be a light or severe infection, and the symptoms can depend on where the larvae migrate to in the body. Light infections may not have noticeable symptoms, according to the CDC. If the parasite moves into the gastrointestinal tract, it can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea or vomiting. In muscle, it can cause a fever, rashes, conjunctivitis and facial puffiness. Occasionally, there may be life-threatening symptoms including heart problems, trouble with the central nervous symptom and breathing issues. Among the eight family members whom investigators interviewed, six had symptoms that were consistent with trichinellosis. Four had eaten bear meat and vegetables, but the other two had eaten only vegetables cooked with the meat. Three family members had to be hospitalized. The hospitalized people got trichinellosis-directed treatment with albendazole, an antiparasitic drug. Those who were not hospitalized received only supportive care since their symptoms had resolved before it was determined they had the infection. Everyone has since recovered. In the course of the investigation, CDC labs received samples of the frozen bear meat and found Trichinella larvae, and the hunter was advised to discard any remaining meat. The CDC also informed the Public Health Agency of Canada about the outbreak since the bear had come from that country. The CDC says it\u2019s important that game meat \u2013 particularly wild game harvested in northern latitudes \u2013 be cooked thoroughly. Since meat that is contaminated with Trichinella can cross-contaminate other foods, raw meat should be stored and prepared separately from other foods.\u00a0The CDC also recommends that government agencies and private groups that organize or oversee hunting should educate hunters about these risks and how to protect themselves.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/black-bear-kabobs-trichinellosis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_health_happiness-rewire-brain-gupta-podcast-wellness", "text": "Happiness is an idea that has been woven into the fabric of humanity, going back to ancient civilizations. Roughly 250 years ago, it made its way into this country\u2019s Declaration of Independence as an unalienable right: \u201cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Although we\u2019ve grappled with it for millennia, the concept of happiness and how to attain it remains pretty elusive. Some might see it as having a sense of general well-being. For others, it might be feeling a spark of unadulterated joy. Yet others might find happiness chasing a dream and reaching it. It might be some combination of these \u2013 or something else entirely. I like to think of myself as a pretty happy guy. I have three wonderful teenage daughters and a wife, Rebecca, with whom I just celebrated a 20th anniversary; I\u2019m close to my parents, my \u201cbaby\u201d brother and his family. I have moments of complete contentment and a career that feels meaningful to me as a practicing neurosurgeon and CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent. But I also realize it\u2019s not that simple. There are other layers to happiness and a lot of nuance within those layers. The pursuit of happiness A challenging question is, what are the best ways to pursue happiness? Are we born with a stable, set level, or is it something we can cultivate, increase and strengthen? If it\u2019s the latter, how can we successfully go about it? Even though \u201cthe pursuit of Happiness\u201d is built into the country\u2019s founding, it seems that many Americans are just not that good at it. In the most recent World Happiness Report, the United States dropped to No. 23 (from No. 15 the previous year), marking the first time in the report\u2019s 12-year history that the US was not in the top 20 happiest countries. A separate Gallup poll, also from 2024, found that less than half (47%) of Americans are \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their personal lives. It\u2019s not just Americans. As it turns out, humans as a species may not excel at happiness. This may surprise you, but happiness is not necessarily something that we are genetically primed to attain. We have to really work at it. \u201cIf anything, natural selection kind of doesn\u2019t really care about our happiness that much. I mean, natural selection\u2019s job is just to keep us alive and keep us around to reproduce. And I think it does that not by making us feel these moments of contentment but maybe just the opposite,\u201d cognitive scientist Dr. Laurie Santos told me recently. \u201cIt does that by building in a negativity bias. So we\u2019re just a little bit worried that there could be a tiger around the corner, that we could get shunned at work. And we\u2019re kind of constantly on the alert for that,\u201d she said. Santos, who has a doctorate in psychology, is at Yale University, where she teaches Psychology and the Good Life, the most popular course in the university\u2019s history, and is the host of \u201cThe Happiness Lab\u201d podcast. She is also the first guest on the 10th season of my podcast, \u201cChasing Life,\u201d which kicked off this week. During this season, I talk to experts across a variety of disciplines about the scientific underpinnings of happiness \u2014 defining it, attaining it, maintaining it and increasing it \u2014 and its effects on our minds and bodies. Listen to more of my conversation with Santos here. I\u2019m happy but \u2018constructively dissatisfied\u2019 The fact that we haven\u2019t evolved to prioritize happiness may be why, despite being a generally happy person, I am also \u201cconstructively dissatisfied.\u201d It\u2019s a term I came up with on the fly while talking to Santos. And here, I\u2019m making a distinction between happiness and satisfaction. I\u2019m still happy overall, but I think if I ever became satisfied, that might erode my happiness. That\u2019s because, in my mind, satisfaction leads to complacency, which leads to stagnation. So, I seemingly have one of those personalities that needs \u2013 maybe even thrives on \u2013 dissatisfaction; being satisfied or complacent dampens my energy and enthusiasm. The times when I feel happiest are when my constructive dissatisfaction propels me into motion, contributing to the betterment of a situation, whether it\u2019s removing a brain tumor, finishing a documentary, working in my garden or even making dinner with my family. Another guest this season of the podcast, health psychologist and author Kelly McGonigal, said the term made perfect sense to her. \u201cBecause dissatisfaction often is the soil in which growth and positive change happens,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd dissatisfaction doesn\u2019t actually have to be a lack of appreciation or gratitude. If you can envision a better future for yourself or others, it requires feeling a gap between how things are and how things could be.\u201d The \u201cconstructive\u201d modifier before \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d is really important to me because I don\u2019t want to just wallow in dissatisfaction; I want it to be useful. And as long as I don\u2019t let the dissatisfaction grow too much, where it overpowers my emotional well-being, it works for me. But I have to admit, it can sometimes be a source of tension and a regular struggle. \u201cIt strikes me that you\u2019ve kind of gotten something out of the journey, gotten something out of that struggle,\u201d Santos told me. But she also warned about going overboard. \u201cWe can push ourselves and engage in challenges; those can be some of the happiest, most flow-inducing moments of our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need to make sure we\u2019re doing that in balance.\u201d She said that if we lose sleep, ignore friendships and make ourselves miserable, \u201cmaybe think about pushing yourself in a different way.\u201d Or find a way to mitigate the negative feelings. \u201cThe antidote to that would be to think what are ways that I could be on that important, purposeful journey but also bring a few more moments of true happiness into my life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, maybe I need a little bit more laughter or some breaks, or I need to engage in that purposeful pursuit with a bit more social connection, or something like that.\u201d Tried and true strategies It is true, according to Santos, that most of us have a set point of happiness. Mine is probably a little lower than my brother\u2019s, for example; he is more outgoing and outwardly cheerful, even though we have very similar nature and nurture. Winning the lottery may raise your level of happiness for a while, and a tragedy may lower it, but most people will eventually settle back to their baseline after some time. Santos believes, however, that with some diligent and intentional practice, you can start to turn up your thermostat of happiness. It is what she teaches her students, as well. For example, she not only lectures her students about the behavior and mindset shifts that are known to nudge up happiness, she makes her students practice them as homework. Instead of course requirements, she calls them course rewirements, because performing them on a regular basis actually can rewire you. Among the low-hanging fruit, Santos recommends making sure you\u2019re paying attention to healthy practices, like getting enough sleep and exercise and eating right. Also on the list: become a bit more \u201cother\u201d-oriented and try to develop an attitude of both gratitude and compassion outside yourself and internally, as well. But my favorite bit of advice is to cultivate and nurture your social connections. \u201cEvery available study of happy people suggests that happy people are more social,\u201d Santos said. And I would gather the opposite is also true: Social people are happier. \u201cSo we just need to make time for our friends and family members and loved ones.\u201d She\u2019s not the only one to preach this. Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist who runs the Harvard Study of Adult Development \u2014 the longest study of adult life, running 85-plus years and counting \u2014 said the secret of both happiness and health boils down to good relationships. How could that be? According to Waldinger, warm relationships (even just one) generally keep people\u2019s bodies stronger and brains sharper, most likely because they help buffer us against the vicissitudes of life. This reduces our exposure to circulating stress hormones (which, when they are constantly high, wreak havoc on the body and mind) as well as dials down resulting inflammation, thought to be at the root of many chronic modern diseases. So \u2014 again, for most of us \u2014 the diseases of aging are mitigated, in part, by our happiness. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to become an extrovert or the life of a party, and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend hour upon hour enduring superficial banter. But, Waldinger said, you should put some effort into consistently nurturing your relationships. To do that, he recommends a few things: Be proactive and reach out to friends; establish routines like a weekly phone call; liven up longstanding relationships by doing new things; make new friends by connecting around shared interests; and get more comfortable striking up conversations with strangers. The recipe is going to vary from person to person and depend on what amount of social interaction feels right for you. Having meaningful relationships really resonates with me. I know from my own life too that good, strong connections to family and friends are really important. And they are what ultimately make me happiest of all. Listen to the full episode with happiness professor Laurie Santos here, and join us next week on the podcast when we explore the surprising link between happiness and anxiety. Find out why it\u2019s a misunderstood emotion.

{"id": "2024_05_14_health_drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness", "text": "After decades of decline, accidental drowning rates are rising in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. With Americans getting ready to hit swimming pools and beaches on Memorial Day weekend, a new study shows that many lack the skills they need to stay safe in the water. Roughly 15% of US adults \u2013 40 million people \u2013 say they don\u2019t know how to swim.\u00a0More than half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to a new national survey by the CDC. The new data on swimming skills in the US population is included in a Vital Signs report released Tuesday by the CDC. It comes on the heels of an increase in drowning deaths in the US in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Each year, on average, about 4,000 Americans died from accidental drowning, a number that changed little from 2011 to 2020. But that number has been about 10% higher the past few years, adding 500 to 600 more deaths each year to the annual tally.\u00a0It\u2019s the first uptick in drowning rates in the US for at least\u00a0two decades. \u201cWhen I just look at the overall numbers, with over 4,000 people dying \u2013 that\u2019s over 12 people a day \u2013 that\u2019s really one person every two hours. And those are lives, not numbers,\u201d said Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC. The increases in drownings were even more dramatic for certain ages and racial groups. Drowning has long been the leading cause of death for preschool-age children. Drowning rates increased almost 30% in this age group in 2021 and 2022. Although the number of drowning deaths in children ages 4 and younger increased among young children in 2020, the rate increase was not statistically significant that year. Black people also saw drowning rates increase faster than the general population; compared with 2019, they were nearly 30% higher in 2021.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that Black Americans reported spending less recreational time in the water than White and Hispanic people.\u00a0If drowning rates were calculated based on exposure rather than population, the study authors noted, it\u2019s likely that the disparities for Black people would be even more pronounced. Additionally, the CDC\u2019s swimming skills survey found that 1 in 3 Black adults said they couldn\u2019t swim, compared with 1 in 7 adults in the general population, a legacy of segregation and discrimination in access to swimming pools in the US, according to the CDC. Hispanic Americans, a group that doesn\u2019t traditionally have disproportionately higher drowning rates compared with White non-Hispanics, also saw drowning rates increase by nearly 25% in 2022, compared with 2019. American Indian and Alaska Natives continued to have the highest rates of drownings of any racial or ethnic group overall. In 2019, there were about 3 drowning deaths for every 100,000 people among American Indian and Alaska Natives, a rate that has seen little change over the course of the pandemic.\u00a0By comparison, there were 1.2 accidental drowning deaths for every 100,000 among White people in 2019. Houry says it\u2019s hard to say exactly how the pandemic may have played a role in the increases.\u00a0The study can only make associations \u2013 it can\u2019t untangle the causes \u2013 but she notes that it was harder to get into public pools, with many closing or implementing policies that limited access.\u00a0Staffing was also problematic for many swim venues. \u201cThere would have been people, if swimming pools were closed for that year, who didn\u2019t get swim lessons and so might have been behind in getting swim lessons,\u201d Houry said. Berkeley Champlin didn\u2019t know the statistics around drowning deaths in young children until her son, Gordie, tragically became one of them. In July 2020, 3-year-old Gordie slipped unnoticed out of the sliding glass doors in Champlin\u2019s home in Livonia, Michigan, while Champlin was at work. Normally, he would have been in day care, but like many schools, it was shut down at the time. His father, who was home with him, later found him in the family\u2019s pool. He couldn\u2019t be revived. Gordie loved animals and couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night without special stuffed animals: an elephant and a bunny. \u201cI put his elephant and his bunny in his casket with him so that he has them always, because he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Champlin said.\u00a0She has drawings of the stuffies tattooed on her forearm. \u201cI wish he would have had swim lessons,\u201d she said. Every year since Gordie died, Champlin has channeled her grief into raising money for swim lessons for other children. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive.\u00a0It costs $120 a month in some places for a child to take lessons,\u201d said Champlin, who knows that may put them out of reach for some families. Champlin set a goal of paying for three kids to learn to swim each year.\u00a0This year, 42 families reached out to her for help, and she set up a\u00a0GoFundMe account\u00a0to raise money to cover them all. \u201cIf anyone else is ever in that situation, or if you go on vacation, or you\u2019re on the lake or a new pool or something that you don\u2019t have your standard parameters around, swim lessons is the way to prevent accidents from happening,\u201d she said. Houry, from the CDC, agrees. \u201cI think we forget drowning is still a really big problem for our young kids and that we can do something about it by making sure kids know how to swim,\u201d she said. Houry said the CDC is funding programs at the Red Cross and YMCA to help lower the cost of lessons and make sure everyone who needs them can get them \u201cbecause it\u2019s so important to have that equitable access,\u201d she added. Houry said kids should start getting swim lessons between the ages of 1 and 4. \u201cIf you are an adult and you don\u2019t know how to swim, it\u2019s never too late to get that swim lesson. It\u2019s really important,\u201d she said. But Houry\u00a0said that even if kids can swim, adults shouldn\u2019t leave them unattended, drink alcohol or get distracted while watching kids in the pool. In settings like a party, where it\u2019s easy for conversations or phones to divert attention, the CDC says it can be useful to assign an adult specifically to watch kids in the pool.\u00a0When swim time is over, the\u00a0CDC recommends\u00a0shutting and locking doors that give access to water.\u00a0In the event that something does happen, learning CPR can help you save a life before paramedics arrive. Houry says fencing that completely encloses a pool can help make backyard and community pools safer.\u00a0In open water, like lakes, life jackets are important for safety, too.\u00a0 When visiting a lake or ocean beach, it\u2019s a good idea to take stock of the hazards, such as rip currents, before going into the water. As Gordie\u2019s birthday approaches on July 12, Champlin said, she finds herself wondering what kind of a party he\u2019d want at age 6. Would he still love animals and superheroes as much, or would it be some kind of gaming thing like Roblox? Just as in past years, they\u2019ll spend his birthday at the zoo, a place that still holds vivid memories of her son. \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/drowning-deaths-increased-cdc-report-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness", "text": "A new report details the role social media plays in the lives of young people, and how they manage the various pros and cons \u2014 including in the context of being a person of color or LGBTQ+, or having depression. Those benefits and drawbacks include valuing online platforms for social connection, self-expression and information, while also feeling the brunt of social media\u2019s effects on their attention span, confidence and contentedness, according to the report released Tuesday by Common Sense Media and Hopelab, a social innovation lab and impact investor aiming to support the well-being of young people. READ MORE: How to know if you have \u2018phone addiction\u2019 \u2014 and 12 ways to address it \u201cMost conversations and headlines surrounding social media and youth mental (health) focus solely on the harms, portraying young people as passive consumers. This research shows that it\u2019s much more complex,\u201d said Amy Green, head of research at Hopelab, in a news release. \u201cIf we truly want to improve the well-being of young people, we need to listen to their experiences and ensure that we do not inadvertently remove access to crucial positive benefits.\u201d Also driving the research is the national youth mental health crisis, the authors said, marked by increasing rates of mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and antidepressant medications prescribed to youth. In conversations about these phenomena, social media has consistently been at the center, though mental health issues can have multiple contributing factors.\u00a0 Conducted by the NORC \u2014 previously called the National Opinion Research Center \u2014 at the University of Chicago, the research includes 1,274 teens (ages 14 to 17) and young adults (ages 18 to 22) recruited online between October and November 2023. The young people \u201cprovided direction and input regarding survey content\u201d and participated in focus groups and interviews to help the research team prioritize and interpret results, according to a news release. The report is the third in a series tracking the influence of social media on well-being among youth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The researchers found the rate of depressive symptoms among youth is about 10% down from pandemic highs but is still high and comparable to the elevated levels of 2018. Nearly half of young people reported experiencing any severity of depression, and nearly a third (28%) said they had moderate to severe symptoms. Additionally, about half of LGBTQ+ youth reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, compared to nearly one-quarter of their non-LGBTQ+ peers. Those with depression were more susceptible to social comparison and pressure to show their best selves on social media. But they were also more likely to find resources to support their well-being and curate their feeds for this purpose \u2014 done by selecting a \u201cnot interested\u201d button on content they don\u2019t like, flagging inappropriate or offensive content, or blocking someone whose content bothered them. These youth also positively curated feeds by \u201cliking\u201d and spending more time on content they did enjoy, since many social media algorithms work by giving you more content based on your level of engagement with certain topics. This was especially important for LGBTQ+ youth who, along with Black and Latinx young people, faced more exposure to harassment and stress online. \u201cIn focus groups, Black youth told us their experiences with in-person harassment lowered their tolerance for similar behavior on social media, and meant they were more willing to give up the benefits to protect themselves from hateful comments,\u201d said lead researcher Amanda Lenhart, head of research at Common Sense Media, via email. The findings confirm what many researchers have seen scientifically and anecdotally, said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association, via email. Prinstein wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Social media and mental health Many participants also revealed the positives they gain from social media, citing online platforms as a place to seek support and advice; decompress; connect with loved ones and others who share their experiences, interests or identities; stay informed; and keep up with their favorite influencers or content creators. \u201cAnother important finding is the importance of social media as a space of connection, creativity and professional opportunities for Black youth,\u201d Lenhart said. Dr. Douglas Gentile, distinguished professor of psychology at Iowa State University, encouraged being \u201ccareful about interpreting (self-reported) data like these,\u201d he said via email. \u201cPeople are surprisingly bad at actually knowing what the effects of media use are on themselves,\u201d Gentile, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, added. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that anyone is lying. Just that we only see little pieces of how the media influence us.\u201d Nearly one-fourth of participants reported using social media almost constantly throughout the day, up 7% from the rate the authors found in their 2018 report, the authors found. Many young people reported an inability to control their use, social media distracting from other activities and unconsciously reaching for social media when bored. To counteract these behaviors, on top of customizing their feeds, many have also taken breaks from social media to avoid the temptation or deleted their accounts permanently. \u201cSocial media could offer (more) benefits to youth if it was designed with a primary focus on youth well-being rather than a focus on keeping kids engaged for as long as possible to make a profit from their data,\u201d Prinstein said. While, or after, using social media, try doing an emotional check-in, Lenhart said. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018How am I feeling right now? Did I see anything that made me feel sad?\u2019\u201d Taking a temporary or permanent break from the content causing the most distress could be helpful, Lenhart added, especially if you already struggle with depression. If you\u2019re a parent or guardian wondering how to best manage your teen\u2019s social media use, one of the most important things you can do is \u201ckeep communication channels open,\u201d Lenhart said. Parental involvement is important, as young adults have expressed regret that their parents allowed them to use social media so young, wishing they could go back and tell their parents to not give in to their demands, Prinstein said. Ask the teens in your life what they like about these platforms and what types of connections or activities support their mental health, Lenhart said. Let them know you\u2019re there to help figure out a solution if social media is upsetting them or interfering with other responsibilities. Respect \u201cthat each young person is an expert in their own lived experience,\u201d Lenhart said. \u201cYoung people are valuable teachers in their own right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-treatment-real-world-effectiveness", "text": "Demand for Wegovy and other GLP-1 drugs used to treat obesity and diabetes has skyrocketed, but a new report suggests that many people may not be sticking with their weight-loss treatment long enough. An analysis of health insurance claims released Tuesday found that most people using GLP-1 medications \u2013 about 58% \u2013 were on their treatment plan for less than 12 weeks, falling short of a key benchmark in the weight-loss treatment timeline. Professional organizations have set this as a guideline for when to reassess whether a treatment is providing clinically meaningful weight loss. Users start with a low dose of these medications and gradually increase it over time until they reach a targeted dose. But the analysis shows that nearly a third of people \u2013 more than 30% \u2013 dropped out after the first four weeks of treatment, before reaching the targeted dose. The findings are based on pharmacy and medical claims data for about 170,000 people with insurance coverage under Blue Cross Blue Shield plans who were prescribed GLP-1 medications that were approved to treat weight management between 2014 and 2023. \u201cThese are long-term medications to treat a chronic disease,\u201d said Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist and director of obesity medicine at Endeavor Health in Chicago, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cThis is absolutely a marathon, not a sprint. And when we do treat this as a sprint, I think patients are likely to get off of medication much faster.\u201d Experts say that impatience with results is one of many reasons patients might stop treatment. Only about two-thirds of adults who have used injectable weight-loss drugs say they feel that they were effective, according to a new KFF poll. And people who stopped using the medications were significantly less optimistic about their benefits: Only about half of those who had used injectable weight-loss drugs in the past said they were effective, compared with nearly three-quarters of those who were actively using the treatments. Side effects \u2013 such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation that are common early on \u2013 may also drive people away. Data from the longest clinical trial of Wegovy showed that 17% of people using the drug decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects. But experts say that many deterrents can be managed with appropriate counseling from a provider. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have frequent touchpoints, frequent interactions, then it\u2019s really it\u2019s hard to manage side effects. It\u2019s hard to manage expectations. It\u2019s hard to see if there\u2019s improvement in some of these other metabolic comorbidities,\u201d said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new research.  Each person will respond to treatment differently and assess the balance of costs and benefits to their heath differently. \u201cThere\u2019s not a line in the sand for every single person. Physicians and patients have to just look at all the data and make a decision about treatment together,\u201d she said. Findings from the Blue Cross Blue Shield data emphasize the important role that providers can play in helping patients stick with their treatment with GLP-1s. People who met with their providers less frequently \u2013 and those living in underserved regions with broader health inequities \u2013 were more likely to discontinue GLP-1 treatment sooner. Each additional follow-up visit increased a patient\u2019s chances of staying on the treatment by 60%, said Dr. Razia Hashmi, vice president of clinical affairs for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. And although most prescriptions came from primary care physicians, those who were prescribed GLP-1s by endocrinologists or others with expertise in weight management were more likely to reach at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment. \u201cWraparound support services really make a difference \u2013 whether a person has lifestyle support management, nutrition, diet and side effect management,\u201d Hashmi said, and \u201chealth equity matters. Social drivers of health \u2013 transportation, access to food, socioeconomic status \u2013 all of that also makes a difference.\u201d Cost can often be a prohibitive factor for these medications \u2013 a month\u2019s supply of GLP-1 medications can often cost about $1,000 \u2013 but the analysis included only people who had insurance plans that covered weight-loss medication prescriptions. Insurance plan copays may have affected cost considerations, but the individuals in this analysis were not paying out-of-pocket for their treatment. But using GLP-1 treatments are still an investment in many ways. \u201cWhether it\u2019s an employer trying to make a decision or an individual patient trying to make a decision, it\u2019s really important to understand the success factors,\u201d Hashmi said. \u201cWe want the investment to pay off.\u201d Another new report supports the claim that the benefits of GLP-1s are extended with long-term, consistent treatment. One of the first reports offering real-world data on GLP-1 efficacy found that people using the medicines had lost an average of about 1.4% of their starting body weight after three months, which steadily increased to an average of about 3% weight loss after a full year on the treatment. The analysis from Dandelion Health, a health care analytics firm, is based on the electronic health records of nearly 17,000 people who were prescribed a GLP-1 from 2019 through 2023. Compared with a group of people with a similar set of clinical characteristics \u2013 matched closely on demographic factors such as age and ethnicity, treatment indicators such as average body mass index and diabetes prevalence, history of treatments such as bariatric surgery and prevalence of related comorbidities \u2013 the analysis found that those on GLP-1s lost about twice as much weight. These injected medications, called GLP-1 agonists, are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss.\u00a0In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose\u00a0at least 10% of their starting weight.\u00a0But the new report suggests that the real-world efficacy is not as promising as clinical trial data would suggest. And experts warn that the GLP-1 treatment process can be different for everyone. \u201cThere are some people who are under-responders, there are some people who are over-responders, and there\u2019s some that respond as expected to the medication,\u201d Narang said. \u201cStudies are still happening to understand why.\u201d The data from Dandelion Health showed that the 10% of people with the best response to GLP-1s had results that mirrored what clinical trials found, but the 10% with the least success with the treatments had no weight change, or even an increase in weight, over time. Still, GLP-1 medications may have benefits far beyond weight loss \u2013 for heart and liver health, for example \u2013 which may extend even to people who don\u2019t lose as many pounds as they might have expected, experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to not use the scale as the only outcome of whether you should stay on this medication. People might be making slow but steady progress, which could warrant ongoing treatment,\u201d Dushay said. \u201cThere may be some direct benefits of the medication in the absence of significant weight loss, which is also why you should be talking to your doctor at length about why you\u2019re using this medication.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-treatment-real-world-effectiveness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2022_07_18_health_how-to-stay-cool-without-air-conditioning-wellness", "text": "Whether you\u2019re without power, enduring extreme heat or trying to save money, there are ways to feel comfortable without artificial cooling.  Heat can foster fun summer activities, but the body shouldn\u2019t be too hot for too long, as too much heat can harm your brain and other organs, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Sweating is the body\u2019s natural cooling system, but when that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s increased risk for developing the heat-related illness hyperthermia \u2014 signs of which include heat cramps, heat edema and heat stroke. Heat combined with high humidity exacerbates this risk, since the air\u2019s saturation level makes sweat accumulate on the skin, preventing the body from cooling naturally.     Staying cool can be done by using some basic supplies and knowing how to manipulate your home to control its temperatures. Here are 14 methods for doing so.   Stay hydrated When you\u2019re hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer emeritus in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.  The temperature of the water doesn\u2019t matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can\u2019t do that without enough moisture, since the body cools itself by sweating.  Take a cold shower or bath Taking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature, Porter said. For an extra cool blast, try peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that tell your body something you\u2019re eating or feeling is cold.  Use cold washrags on your neck or wrists  Place a cold washrag or ice bags (packs) on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you\u2019ll cool down more quickly.  Use box fans  Place box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you\u2019re spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.  If the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, opening the windows on both sides of the house during those times can facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. If you do this, you can opt to use or not use the fans, but the fans would help cool the house faster, Porter said. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again. Just resting near a fan would reduce your body temperature as well.  Close your curtains or blinds If you have windows that face the sun\u2019s direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to \u201ckeep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up (the) inside,\u201d Porter said.  You could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.  If you do turn the air conditioning on, don\u2019t set it below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, founder of Spaces Alive, an Australia-based design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.  \u201cIt just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,\u201d she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.  Sleep in breathable linens Cotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.  The lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That\u2019s because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.  Sleep in the basement  If you can\u2019t sleep through the night because you\u2019re too hot, try sleeping somewhere besides your bedroom, if that\u2019s an option. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.  Don\u2019t refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing  Common advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out to wear while you sleep. But this isn\u2019t a good idea, Porter said.  Because of \u201cthe amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019d have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d  Close the doors of unused rooms  If no one\u2019s using a room that doesn\u2019t have vents or registers, close the door to that area to keep the cool air confined to only occupied areas of the house.  Use the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom  Flip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.  Install energy-efficient light bulbs Incandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs, then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.  Switching light bulbs can save money but won\u2019t reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. However, if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you\u2019re sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.  Cook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside Oven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.  Enjoy frozen treats Eating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don\u2019t go overboard on the sugar if you\u2019re overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.  \u201cSugar would run your metabolism up and you\u2019d start feeling internally hot,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.\u201d  Research what your state offers If you\u2019ve tried everything and still can\u2019t beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.  Depending on your state, some cooling centers \u2014 air-conditioned public facilities where people might go for relief during extremely hot weather \u2014 may be open and taking precautions to ensure they\u2019re as safe as possible. You could start by checking with your local utility offices, as they would know who is offering certain programs, Porter recommended.

{"id": "2024_05_28_health_peanut-allergy-infants-adolescents-wellness", "text": "Reassuring new evidence suggests that feeding children smooth peanut butter during infancy and early childhood can help reduce their risk of developing a peanut allergy even years later. Compared with avoiding peanuts, starting peanut consumption in infancy \u2013 as early as around 4 months of age, as a soft pureed paste, for instance \u2013 and continuing regularly to around 5 years old was associated with a 71% reduced rate of peanut allergy among adolescents in the United Kingdom, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal NEJM Evidence. \u201cI was not entirely surprised because infants in Israel are exposed to peanuts very early and allergy does not appear to emerge in adolescence or adults. This suggests the protection is long-term,\u201d Gideon Lack, professor of pediatric allergy at King\u2019s College London and an author of the study, said in an email. \u201cPeanut allergy develops very early in most children between six and 12 months of life. If you want to prevent a disease this needs to be done before the disease develops,\u201d Lack said of exposing children to peanuts. \u201cThis biological\u00a0phenomenon is based on an immunological principle known as oral tolerance induction. We have known for many decades that young mice or other experimental animals who are fed foods such as egg or milk or peanut cannot develop these allergies later.\u201d Starting in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended delaying the introduction of peanuts until 3 years, but it ended that recommendation in 2008. About a decade later, in 2019, the AAP updated its guidance to say that delaying the introduction of allergenic foods doesn\u2019t prevent disease and that \u201cthere is now evidence that early introduction of peanuts may prevent peanut allergy.\u201d Food allergies have become a growing public health concern in the United States, and peanut allergy is estimated to affect about 2% of children in the United States, or nearly 1.5 million people younger than 18. Peanuts are among the food types that can cause the most serious allergic reactions, including the risk of the life-threatening reaction anaphylaxis. \u201cToday\u2019s findings should reinforce parents\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 confidence that feeding their young children peanut products beginning in infancy according to established guidelines can provide lasting protection from peanut allergy,\u201d Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a news release Tuesday. \u201cIf widely implemented, this safe, simple strategy could prevent tens of thousands of cases of peanut allergy among the 3.6 million children born in the United States each year.\u201d The new study, called the LEAP-Trio trial, included data on children in the United Kingdom who participated as babies in a peanut allergy study called the LEAP trial. That previous study included infants with eczema and egg allergy who were followed through age 5, and it found that at that age, the prevalence of peanut allergy was about 17% in the group of children who avoided peanuts, compared with about 3% in the group that ate peanut products, representing an 81% relative reduction in peanut allergy. The LEAP-Trio trial set out to examine whether that reduced risk of peanut allergy would last into adolescence. About 500 children were assessed again for the LEAP-Trio trial, which looked at the rate of peanut allergy at around age 12. At that age, peanut allergy remained \u201csignificantly more prevalent\u201d among the children who originally avoided peanuts, with about 15% having a peanut allergy. Among those who originally consumed peanuts, about 4% had a peanut allergy, the researchers found. They wrote that represents \u201ca 71% reduction in the prevalence of peanut allergy at the LEAP-Trio time point.\u201d But overall, when children started to consume peanuts in infancy and continued to around age 5, this appeared to provide \u201clasting tolerance\u201d to peanuts into adolescence, according to the researchers, based in the United Kingdom and the United States. The new findings are \u201ca great reassurance\u201d that not only did early introduction of peanuts reduce peanut allergies from developing, but the protection lasted until adolescence even when children stopped eating peanuts consistently after age 5, Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist and immunologist at NYU Langone in New York and a spokesperson for the\u00a0Allergy & Asthma Network, who was not involved in the new research, said in an email Tuesday. \u201cSo ideally if there\u2019s no other risk factors we should continue to introduce these allergens early\u00a0at 4-6\u00a0months and continue them consistently until age 5 but after that we don\u2019t need to be as consistent,\u201d Parikh said. She added that introducing peanuts for children at low risk for allergies can be done around 4 to 6 months old under the guidance of a pediatrician, but children with severe eczema and egg allergy should see an allergist before early introduction. \u201cSince babies cannot have solids yet it is recommended for it to be a thin consistency similar to breast milk or formula and can be mixed into it to avoid any choking and can start with a small amount and slowly increase as tolerated every 3-4 days,\u201d Parikh said. When introducing peanuts into an infant\u2019s diet, it\u2019s recommended to use smooth peanut butter mixed into a puree and avoid chunks of peanuts that could pose choking hazards. \u201cIt can generally be said \u2018the sooner the better\u2019 for parents, especially in babies with eczema,\u201d Lack said, adding that babies with eczema are at much higher risk of developing food allergies and develop these allergies much earlier in the first year of life. \u201cHowever, the child needs to be developmentally and neurologically ready to eat solid foods and be able to coordinate chewing and swallowing without a risk of choking. Most babies will be able to start weaning between four and six months of age but each baby is an individual and needs to be assessed individually,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the foods\u00a0should be given as a soft puree to facilitate swallowing and reduce the risk of choking.\u00a0We do not recommend introducing solids before three months of age.\u201d The finding that early peanut introduction induces tolerance has been supported by previous studies too, but introducing your child to peanuts should be a shared decision with your pediatrician, according to Dr. Daniel DiGiacomo, a pediatric immunologist at K. Hovnanian Children\u2019s Hospital at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cThe current expert opinion is to utilize a shared-decision making approach for food introduction once the infant is developmentally ready, and has tolerated a couple of other complementary foods without issue,\u201d DiGiacomo said in an email Tuesday. \u201cI usually start off slowly introducing a pea sized amount, doubling the amount every day until you get to an age appropriate serving size (or at least 2 teaspoons). Then continue this in the diet several times per week,\u201d he said. \u201cI typically have the family mix the nut butter in a tolerated puree to the correct consistency, they can also dissolve peanut puffs (if doing peanut) in water, or make a peanut sauce out of powdered peanut butter or peanut flour. Again, we review the proper consistency and start slow with instructions to stop and contact your allergist if there are any concerns.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/health/peanut-allergy-infants-adolescents-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}

The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors.

{"id": "2024_05_24_health_new-experiments-milk-h5n1-infected-cows-raise-questions-flash-pasteurization", "text": "New lab experiments with milk from cows infected by H5N1 influenza,\u00a0known as\u00a0bird flu, confirm that it is infectious, especially when left raw, or untreated, and\u00a0potentially even when\u00a0flash pasteurized. The researchers, from the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, are part of a federally funded program called the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response, or CEIRR.\u00a0This network has been conducting rapid research to answer pressing questions in the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle. In a research letter posted online on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers describe the results of experiments using milk from four infected cows \u2014 two from New Mexico and two from Kansas. Because H5N1 virus is considered a select agent, it was handled in a high-security Biosafety Level 3 lab at the University of Wisconsin, using strict safety protocols. First, they confirmed the raw milk was chock-full of H5N1 virus.\u00a0 Then, they stored some of the raw milk at refrigerator temperature to see if levels of the virus in milk would drop off over time.\u00a0 Over 5 weeks, viral levels in raw milk dropped a bit, but not much. \u201cThat it wasn\u2019t decaying over time is concerning,\u201d said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Emory University who is also part of the CEIRR network but was not involved in the study. In another series of tests, the researchers checked to see what types of pasteurization might work best for inactivating the virus. They heated small samples of the milk at times and temperatures used in two types of pasteurization: low-temperature, long-time, or vat pasteurization; and high-temperature short-time, or flash pasteurization, which is the most common method used in the US today,\u00a0according to\u00a0the International Dairy Foods Association. Heating the milk to 63 degrees Celsius, or 145 degrees Fahrenheit, for intervals between 5 and 30 minutes \u2014 the vat pasteurization method \u2014 reduced the virus to undetectable levels. Heating the milk to 72 degrees Celsius, or 181 degrees Fahrenheit, for 15 or 20 seconds \u2014 conditions that approximated flash pasteurization \u2014 greatly reduced levels of the virus in the milk, but it didn\u2019t inactivate it completely. Milk samples heated for 15 or 20 seconds were still able to infect incubated chicken eggs, a test the US Food and Drug Administration has called the gold-standard for determining whether viruses remain infectious in milk. \u201cBut, we emphasize that the conditions used in our laboratory study are not identical to the large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,\u201d senior study author Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist who specializes in the study of flu and Ebola, said in an email. That\u2019s a good reason not to panic over the study findings, said Lakdawala. Lakdawala said that commercial flash pasteurization involves a preheating step, which wasn\u2019t done here.\u00a0It also involves homogenization, a process that emulsifies the fat globules in milk so the cream won\u2019t separate.\u00a0Both of those steps would probably make it harder for the virus to survive, but she adds that the results of this study suggest full process of commercial flash pasteurization should be done \u201cwith all the steps in place.\u201d Recent tests of\u00a0297 dairy products\u00a0purchased at retail stores by the FDA found traces\u00a0of\u00a0genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 of 5 milk samples, and further testing confirmed the viral fragments were inert and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to the general public is low, but people\u00a0should not eat or drink\u00a0raw milk or products made from it. To date, H5N1 influenza has been found in\u00a058 dairy herds in nine states.\u00a0 Michigan has now surpassed Texas as the state with the greatest number of infected herds. To test whether the raw milk could infect other animals, researchers also squirted\u00a0some of the milk\u00a0into the mouths of mice.\u00a0 The animals showed signs of illness the next day. On day four, the mice hadn\u2019t died of their infections, but they were euthanized so that researchers could see what parts of their bodies had become infected. Scientists found the virus all over their bodies, with high viral loads in the lungs and respiratory tract.\u00a0 They also found virus in the mammary glands of the mice, even though they weren\u2019t producing milk at the time. Taken together, their findings confirm that raw milk can infect susceptible animals, the researchers said\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and that could also indicate a risk to humans. In a recent news briefing, officials with the US Department of Agriculture said that to their knowledge, none of the raw milk from farms known to have H5N1 infections was being sold to consumers. Not all dairy farms are testing their cows, however, and some of the infected cows in the current outbreak have not shown any symptoms. \u201cRaw milk is unsafe at any speed, and the notion that you could protect yourself against H5 infection by consuming it is erroneous. There are there are much safer ways to protect oneself namely avoiding raw milk,\u201d CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah said in a briefing. Asked if the\u00a0raw\u00a0milk\u00a0in the new experiments\u00a0looked different than normal, Kawaoka said the researchers only got a small number of samples but some had more debris than milk from healthy cows. That would get filtered out prior to sale, he said.\u00a0Some of the milk looked yellow-ish, but he points out that milk from healthy and infected cows would likely be mixed together in a big vat, making it look normal \u2014 and\u00a0impossible to tell whether milk is safe to drink just by looking at it. \u201cThis is good quality research with conclusions backed up by solid data,\u201d said Dr. Ruth Harvey, deputy director of the Worldwide Influenza Center at the Francis Crick Institute in London, in a comment on the study given to the nonprofit Science Media Centre. \u201cThe limitations of the experimental set-up for the heat inactivation part of the research are clearly stated: that the conditions used are not identical to large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThe findings that viable virus was found in the milk samples after 5 weeks of storage at (4 degrees Celsius), and that mice could be infected through drinking milk containing the virus, back up the conclusions that drinking raw milk could pose a risk,\u201d Harvey added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/new-experiments-milk-h5n1-infected-cows-raise-questions-flash-pasteurization/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_06_08_health_pets-air-quality-wildfire-smoke-safety-wellness-climate", "text": "More than 100 fires are burning across Canada, with some wildfires forcing evacuations and affecting air quality in Canada and the northern tier of the United States \u2014 and experts have noted that pets could be at risk, too. Dr. Gabrielle Fadl of the Bond Vet Clinic in New York City told CNN last year that her practice has had a \u201csignificant influx of calls\u201d from concerned clients seeking guidance on how to protect their animals from the poor air quality outside. It also received a few calls from patients, particularly pregnant and older people, requesting to reschedule appointments. \u201cExposure to polluted air can have a profound impact on our pets\u2019 health, leading to respiratory issues, allergies, and even exacerbating existing conditions such as asthma,\u201d Fadl said. To ensure pets\u2019 well-being, Fadl advised considering the following precautions. Limit outdoor activities Reduce the time your pets spend outdoors as much as possible, especially during periods of unhealthy air quality. Doing so can help minimize their exposure to harmful pollutants and allergens, Fadl said. You also shouldn\u2019t run with your dog outdoors, said Dr. Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the department of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIf you can, just walk a little bit more slowly so you\u2019re not breathing as deeply,\u201d he added. \u201cThat can help.\u201d Avoiding strenuous activity is important for pets as well since they can\u2019t breathe as deeply as humans, said Dr. Jessica Bell, an assistant professor in the college of veterinary medicine at Washington State University. Animals also can experience difficulty breathing, asthma-like symptoms and bronchitis. If you must take pets outside, do so when air quality is best, Bell said. \u201cThat might be early in the morning before the air quality changes with settling of moisture.\u201d New York City\u2019s Emergency Management advised wiping your pet\u2019s muzzle, feet and coat with a damp cloth after being outside. Create a safe environment indoors Even pets kept indoors can be affected by the air quality outside, Bell said, so make sure you have proper ventilation in your home. Keep the windows closed to prevent outdoor pollutants, such as fine particulate matter, from entering. These particles are the tiniest, yet most dangerous, of pollutants, and have been linked to health problems such as heart disease, asthma and other respiratory illnesses. \u201cA major difference between wildfires and, for example, a fire that you might burn in a backyard bonfire is that often there are synthetic materials being burned that produce compounds that can be dangerous like hydrogen cyanide,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Kornreich, director of the Cornell Feline Health Center in Ithaca, New York. \u201cCarbon monoxide can also get into the bloodstream, and those two interfere with the delivery of oxygen to organs,\u201d Kornreich added. \u201cIn some cases, these fires can also produce chemical irritants. So the chemicals can actually trigger inflammation in the airways.\u201d Additionally, use air purifiers or filters to improve air quality inside. When keeping pets indoors, activities for them can be important, Bell said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of puzzle games that dogs and cats can do,\u201d she said. \u201cFill the puzzles (with) their treats or their dog food and hide it in the house. They have to hunt for them or have to roll them around or they knock all the kibbles out.\u201d Also ensure pets have access to clean water both indoors and outdoors so it\u2019s not tainted with smoke, Bell added. Monitor animals\u2019 symptoms Be on the lookout for any signs of respiratory distress or discomfort in your pets such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing or trouble breathing. Pay attention to any changes to their normal behavior, such as wanting to play fetch for 10 minutes instead of an hour as usual, Bell said. \u201cThat decrease in activity \u2014 we just have to pay attention to (it) and not force them to be active when their body says not to be.\u201d Indoor cats should be monitored for these same symptoms, she added. \u201cIf you notice any concerning symptoms, seek prompt veterinary care,\u201d Fadl said. Consult with a veterinarian Reach out to a trusted veterinarian for expert guidance catered to your pet\u2019s needs.

{"id": "2024_05_20_health_cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness", "text": "One may think young people are the main group enjoying the freedom of legalized weed, but in Canada, the greatest increase in users after legalization was among older adults \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s sending them to the hospital, according to new research. The rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults during the period of legalization of dried cannabis flower and edibles \u2014 October 2018 through December 2022 \u2014 in Canada was significantly higher than that of the pre-legalization period, according to a research letter published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Edibles, which include baked goods, candies and beverages, are increasingly popular, said lead research author Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician and clinician scientist at Sinai Health in Ontario. But some older adults may be unaware of the strength of today\u2019s weed, and little is known about the health effects of legalizing edible cannabis on older adults \u2014 the age group with the largest growth in overall cannabis use a year after dried cannabis flower was legalized in Canada, Stall said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an age-related bias that many health care practitioners, and frankly society, hold that older adults are not using drugs. And that\u2019s not true,\u201d Stall said. \u201cWe found that the largest increases in emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning among seniors occurred after edible cannabis became legal for retail sale in January 2020.\u201d The authors used the Ontario Ministry of Health\u2019s administrative data to examine the rates of emergency room visits for cannabis poisoning among older adults during the pre-legalization period \u2014 January 2015 to September 2018 \u2014 and the two legalization periods: October 2018 through December 2019, which permitted the sale of dried cannabis flower only, and January 2020 through December 2022, which marked the legalization of cannabis edibles. When people have cannabis poisoning, according to Stall, they may experience confusion; psychosis, including hallucinations; anxiety or panic attacks; rapid heartbeat; chest pain; nausea; and vomiting.\u00a0 During the eight-year study period, there were 2,322 emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults who were age 69 on average. Nearly 17% of those adults were simultaneously intoxicated with alcohol, about 38% had cancer and 6.5% had dementia. Compared with pre-legalization, legalization period No. 1 saw a twice higher rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning. The rate during the second legalization period tripled that of pre-legalization. \u201cThis study provides a cautionary tale of legalization of substances without adequate research, education, and counseling of users regarding adverse effects and safe usage, particularly in older adults,\u201d said Dr. Lona Mody and Dr. Sharon K. Inouye, who weren\u2019t involved in the research, in a commentary on the research. Mody is the Amanda Sanford Hickey Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Inouye is director of the Aging Brain Center at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research in Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The sneaky effects of edibles When it comes to explaining the higher rates, both unintentional and intentional use of edible cannabis are worth discussing, experts said. \u201cEdible cannabis products may be particularly dangerous because they are often indistinguishable from non-cannabis containing foods and may contain high amounts of THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), the major active ingredient in both medical and recreational cannabis,\u201d Mody and Inouye said. In his own practice, Stall has seen a common scenario resulting from the lack of distinction, he said: An emergency department doctor is not able to figure out why an older adult patient is neurologically impaired via any typical tests \u2014 only for a toxicology screen to come back positive for cannabis, much to the patient\u2019s surprise. \u201cThe other thing is that cannabis today is very different than cannabis was as recently as the early \u201990s and mid \u201980s,\u201d Stall explained. \u201cToday\u2019s cannabis extracts contain as much as 30 times more THC. \u2026 Older adults who may not have used cannabis in decades and are now trying again in this post-legalization era may not be aware.\u201d Additionally, age-related changes in organ function and how the drug is distributed throughout the body \u2014 as well as having health conditions or being on prescription drugs, especially psychoactive ones \u2014 can make it easier for an older adult to experience cannabis poisoning, Stall added. Some people who intentionally consume cannabis edibles may not be aware that this form has a more delayed effect than an inhalant, which goes straight to the bloodstream, he said. Thinking the edible isn\u2019t working, they take another one too soon and end up getting more than they bargained for. There are also people whose prescription medications for pain management, insomnia or dementia symptoms aren\u2019t effective, so they consume edibles for therapeutic purposes but without consulting a doctor first, Stall said. Reducing harm from cannabis use Abstaining from cannabis use may be \u201cappropriate\u201d for some individuals, but \u201cI would be hesitant to give a blanket recommendation (that) no other adults should be using this because there are people who are going to use it even if that recommendation is given,\u201d Stall said. Therefore, preventing cannabis-related harms in older adults requires a multipronged approach, he added, including storing cannabis edibles in locked locations and in clearly identified packaging. Products older adults intentionally use should have dosing information with specific guidance for older adults, \u201crecognizing that the amount of drug they may need is a lot less than younger populations,\u201d Stall said. \u201cIn geriatric medicine, we have a mantra: Start low and go slow. That same mantra applies here.\u201d The amount at which cannabis can become poisonous can depend on multiple personal factors, but some studies have indicated people should wait at least three hours before taking a second dose, Stall said. Health care providers should also have open and judgment-free conversations with older adults about cannabis use and its benefits and risks, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_michigan-bird-flu-human-case", "text": "A case of H5 influenza, also known as avian influenza or bird flu, has been reported in a farm worker in Michigan who had regular exposure to infected livestock, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s the second case reported as part of an ongoing outbreak of the virus in birds and cattle across the country and the third bird flu case ever reported in a person in the US. However, health officials emphasized Wednesday that the risk to the general public remains low. The person was being monitored for the virus because of their exposure to infected cattle, the CDC said in a news release Wednesday. A nasal swab tested negative for influenza at the state health department and later at the CDC, but an eye swab tested positive. The person reported only eye symptoms, and they have recovered. Eye symptoms such as redness, swelling and watering were also the only ones reported in the previous\u00a0human case\u00a0in this outbreak, in a dairy farm worker in Texas. That man took antiviral medications and recovered with no lasting problems. \u201cIt is not unexpected that comprehensive testing identified a human infection,\u201d the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cInformation to date suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person.\u201d The Michigan farm worker was one of about 170 people enrolled in an active monitoring program in which they received a text message from the state health department each day that asks about potential symptoms. When the person indicated the presence of symptoms, public health workers took samples, offered antiviral medications to them and their close contacts, and urged them to isolate. The CDC received the samples on Tuesday and reported the test results to Michigan health officials that night, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC. \u201cThis case was not unexpected,\u201d Shah said Wednesday, emphasizing the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to help farms prepare for the spread of the virus. \u201cIt does not change our assessment of the risk overall. What it does do, however, is it reinforces the message that CDC has been putting out since late March, which is that entities involved with this \u2013 be they local health departments, farms, farm workers and farm worker organizations \u2013 ought to be alert but not alarmed by these developments. \u201cWe have not seen evidence of other cases in this area or elsewhere in any of our monitoring systems, let alone any evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is reassuring, but the work of public health is not done. In the coming days, we\u2019ll have additional information on the genomic sequence or the DNA fingerprint of this particular virus. And we\u2019ll be able to compare it to the virus from infected cows in Michigan, as well as to compare it to the virus from the earlier human case in Texas.\u201d The fact that the nasal specimen tested negative while the eye swab was positive is also, \u201cin a sense, reassuring,\u201d Shah said, as it indicates a reduced likelihood that the virus is spreading through respiration. Although remnants of the virus have been found in samples of dairy products purchased from grocery stores, the US Food and Drug Administration \u201ccontinues to affirm our assessment of the safety of the commercial milk supply,\u201d Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the agency\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said Wednesday. \u201cTo date, the totality of the evidence \u2013 including studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization against multiple pathogens, recent studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] and eggs at lower temperatures than generally used in dairy products, and negative retail sample results to date \u2013 continue to indicate the commercial milk supply is safe. We also continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk\u201d or milk that has not been pasteurized. Testing with a substitute virus in ground beef found some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, but it was present at \u201cmuch, much reduced levels,\u201d according to Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the US Department of Agriculture, and it\u2019s not clear whether it would be enough to make someone sick.

Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, chicken nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. \u201cAmericans eat ultraprocessed foods every day,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. A group of Americans in a study published on May 8 ate at least three servings of ultraprocessed food a day, with one group eating an average of seven daily servings, the study showed. Many studies have shown the negative health effects of ultraprocessed foods in adults, but Friday\u2019s study is among the first to show the impact they can have on the cardiometabolic health of young children, said Berger, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago. \u201cThis particular topic, ultraprocessed food consumptions and risk, is a very important topic in kids,\u201d he said. Starting young The study is observational, meaning that while researchers can identify an association between how much ultraprocessed foods children eat and their health, they cannot say that one causes the other, Berger said. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be mindful of ultraprocessed foods for young children, because how they eat for the rest of their lives is greatly impact by their early nutrition, he said. \u201cWhat we know is people who eat a certain way, even moms who eat in utero, set up baby\u2019s preferences,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere are a ton of publications that have shown that what we eat early in life \u2026 actually sets the stage for what happens in the future.\u201d Shifting your child\u2019s diet away from ultraprocessed foods and toward more fresh options is easier to do when they are very young, Berger said. Ultra-convenient The problem is that avoiding ultraprocessed foods is not equally easy for everyone. The study found that the children with the highest amount of ultraprocessed foods in their diet had mothers who were younger, had a higher BMI and had lower levels of education and employment. In places where fresh food might be harder to obtain, ultraprocessed foods are more accessible and inexpensive, Freeman said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are also ultra-convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, people reach for them when they feed their kids, and their kids aren\u2019t hungry, but they\u2019re filled with all these different chemicals and substances and seasonings and salts of sugars and whatever that they become very addicted to.\u201d Freeman stressed that giving kids ultraprocessed foods without also providing fresh fruits and vegetables sets them up for problems down the road. Adding in more nutritious foods and encouraging physical activity as much as possible is critical, Berger added. \u201cIf you can do something to create a healthy lifestyle early, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that you can you can eliminate metabolic syndromes later in life like diabetes, obesity, and all the complications associated with diabetes and obesity,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_fish-oil-supplement-dangers-study-wellness", "text": "As an excellent source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, daily fish oil supplements are a popular way to keep the risk of cardiovascular disease at bay. About 20% of adults older than age 60 in the United States frequently use these products with the aim of supporting heart health. However, a new study finds regular use of fish oil supplements may increase, not reduce, the risk of first-time stroke and atrial fibrillation among people in good cardiovascular health. Atrial fibrillation, also called AFib or AF, is a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat,\u00a0that people often describe as a flutter or pounding in their chests. \u201cI can see the headline for this study as \u2018Fish oil supplements: Is it time to dump them or not?\u2019\u201d said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cI say that because over-the-counter fish oil is very seldom recommended, is in none of the guidelines from professional medical societies, and yet that\u2019s what most people take,\u201d said Freeman, who was not involved in the study. Fish oil only helped people with existing heart disease The study analyzed data on over 415,000 people ages 40 to 69 participating in the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study of the health of people in the United Kingdom. Nearly one-third of those people, who were followed for an average of 12 years, said they regularly used fish oil supplements. For people without heart issues, regular use of fish oil supplements was associated with a 13% higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation and a 5% heightened risk of having a stroke, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Medicine. Over-the-counter fish oil suffers from a lack of purity and consistency, as well as the potential contaminants and heavy metals such as mercury that come with fish, Freeman said. \u201cIn addition, studies over the last 10 years have not been very positive for over-the-counter fish oil,\u201d he added. \u201cFish oil was either having no benefit or in some cases it may harm, such as with stroke and AFib. So that\u2019s not new.\u201d In fact, the new study found that people with existing heart disease at the beginning of the research had a 15% lower risk of progressing from atrial fibrillation to a heart attack and a 9% lower risk of progressing from heart failure to death when they regularly used fish oil. Instead, prescription versions of fish oil, such as Vascepa and Lovaza, are used to counter such risk factors such as high triglycerides, a type of blood fat, in people with cardiovascular disease risk, Freeman said. \u201cBut even in the prescription strength, highly purified versions of fish oil, the risk for AFib and sometimes stroke has also been present and doctors are cautious about that,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cOverall, I would say that the days where people just go to the store and buy buckets of fish oil pills to keep them well should be over, but fish oil may still have a role in people who are already sick.\u201d Try to use food sources for omega-3s When it comes to fish oil, \u201cthe devil is in the details,\u201d said Alzheimer\u2019s preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. He was not involved in the study. \u201cFirst, we recommend testing for omega-3 fatty acid levels \u2014 there are finger-prick tests you can buy online which are accurate \u2014 and then you should continue to test. You don\u2019t want to take fish oil if you don\u2019t need it,\u201d he said. Isaacson recommends trying to get your omega-3 fatty acids from food sources and says sardines and wild-caught salmon are the best sources, as they are high in these healthy unsaturated fats and lower in mercury. Farm-raised salmon is not the best choice, he said, due to impurities in the water in which they are raised. Lake trout, mackerel, herring and albacore tuna are also good sources, he said. However, due to the mercury levels in large fish such as tuna, he recommends consumption of albacore tuna should be kept to twice a week. Algae and seaweed are decent nonfish sources of omega 3s as well. Chia seeds, edamame (soy beans), flaxseed, hempseeds and walnuts are other plant-based options that are high in omega-3s. But the fatty acids are a different form than those found in fish.  Studies have found plant-based omega-3s may be harder to metabolize in people with higher levels of omega-6s, another kind of unsaturated fats that\u2019s found primarily in vegetable oils. If supplements are needed Prescription omega-3 fatty acids are superior to over-the counter options, experts say, due to their pureness and quality. But prescribed supplements can be expensive. For people who decide they want to purchase over-the-counter omega-3s, Isaacson provides these tips to his patients. First, freshness of the fish oil is key, he said, adding that \u201cbuying from an online or retail superstore, such as Amazon or Costco, isn\u2019t the best idea.\u201d \u201cWe recommend buying it from only a handful of reputable companies, and from their specific website,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cThe difference in quality between fish oil stored in a hot warehouse that\u2019s close to expiration and fish oil that\u2019s recently been produced, sent directly from the company, and kept in the home refrigerator is night and day.\u201d The US Food and Drug Administration doesn\u2019t monitor the supplement industry to assure each vitamin or mineral actually contains what it says on the label, nor does the federal agency test to see whether the ingredients are contaminated with bacteria, heavy metals, pesticides, plastic residues and other impurities. However, there are some companies that have stepped into that role by testing various supplements and even some pharmaceuticals, so look for their labels on the supplements before purchase. The nonprofit organization US Pharmacopeia, or USP, sets the most widely accepted standards for supplements, experts say, but ConsumerLab.com and NSF International also do third-party testing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/fish-oil-supplement-dangers-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn", "text": "Maybe you spotted one crawling up your leg after a hike through tall grass or felt one on your dog\u2019s back as you ran your hand through its fur. If you\u2019re unlucky, maybe you found one already burrowing into your skin, engorged with your blood. Ticks are parasitic bloodsuckers, capable of spreading deadly disease, and they\u2019re becoming increasingly common. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. Ticks 101 Ticks are arachnids, close cousins of mites and more distant cousins of spiders. There are\u00a0more than 800 species of ticks found around the world, and 84 that have been documented in the United States. However, only a handful in the US bite and transmit diseases to humans. The most common ones are blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks, but they feed on lots of animals besides deer), lone star ticks, American dog ticks and brown dog ticks. After a tick egg hatches, it goes through three life stages: larva, nymph and adult. Both male and female ticks feed on blood by inserting their barbed, straw-like mouthparts into the skin of their host (unlike mosquitoes, which only bite if they\u2019re females preparing to lay eggs). However, only female ticks drink to the point that they become engorged. \u201cWhen you see a super big and engorged female, that means she\u2019s going to be laying eggs and starting that life cycle process over again,\u201d said Kait Chapman, an extension educator and urban entomologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These arachnids change dramatically in size and appearance based on how old they are and how much blood they\u2019ve drunk. \u201cThe nymph blacklegged tick, if you put these unfed ones on a poppy seed bagel, they blend in quite nicely,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island and director of that school\u2019s Center for Vector-Borne Disease and its TickEncounter Resource Center. Meanwhile, an engorged adult female of the same species can swell to the size of a pea. Tick bites and diseases While there are some months when different species and life stages are more active, it\u2019s possible to get bitten by a tick any time of year. If you find a tick attached to you (or your pet), you should remove it carefully. \u201cThe recommendation is that you use a pair of tweezers, get the tick by its head as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to twist, because we could leave part of that mouthpart embedded in the skin. And we don\u2019t want to grab the body because if you squeeze the body the tick could regurgitate more, which means that you\u2019re increasing your chance of getting tick-borne illness.\u201d Your impulse might be to squash the freshly removed tick, but it\u2019s better if you drown it with hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol and keep it to show to an expert or at least take a photo. That way, you can identify what kind of tick it is and how long it\u2019s been feeding; the University of Rhode Island\u2019s\u00a0TickEncounter website has tools\u00a0based on coloration, size and geographic location. It\u2019s important to identify the tick because certain species carry different diseases. They pick up bacteria, viruses and other microbes from the blood of infected hosts, and when they bite a new victim, they can pass those pathogens along. Blacklegged tick larvae and nymphs, for instance, often feed on white-footed mice,\u00a0which can carry a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. When a tick that\u2019s fed on one of these infected mice then feeds on a human, it can pass along that bacterium, which causes Lyme disease. Lone star ticks, on the other hand, don\u2019t feed on white-footed mice and consequently aren\u2019t carriers of Lyme. (They do carry other disease-causing microbes, though, and their bites can introduce a sugar molecule into the bloodstream that\u00a0makes people allergic to red meat.) In\u00a0a September 2023 study, researchers identified a protein that appears to play a big part in how some ticks \u2014 including the deer tick and the Western blacklegged tick \u2014 get infected by the harmful bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum before spreading it to human hosts and causing anaplasmosis, which is different from Lyme disease. Anaplasmosis can cause severe headaches, fever and chills, vomiting, and fatigue,\u00a0according to Cedars-Sinai. Understanding this protein may give scientists a better sense of how to stop the spread of the disease through ticks, the study said. But there is still a lot of research ahead before they get there. Preventing tick bites The diseases carried by ticks can be debilitating or even life-threatening, and the risk of infection increases the longer a tick has been on you. While there are some treatments available, it\u2019s best to avoid getting bitten in the first place. Various studies have suggested factors that could play a role in tick attraction, including a recent paper showing a\u00a0connection between tick attraction and static electricity\u00a0in a laboratory setting. And while ticks are attracted to cues such as the carbon dioxide exhaled by animals, they tend to lie in wait rather than actively seeking out their prey. \u201cContrary to popular belief, they don\u2019t fall from trees. They simply sit at the edge of a tall blade of grass, for example, that\u2019s maybe hanging over someplace, and they\u2019ll put their front leg out. We call that questing,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey will wait for that host to brush right by them, and so that\u2019s primarily how people get ticks: They brush by it; it attaches to their leg or their clothes.\u201d Insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus have been\u00a0approved by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0to protect against ticks. However, these chemicals work differently against ticks than they do against mosquitoes. For instance, DEET \u201cburns the feet of ticks, and they fall off because their feet are burning,\u201d as opposed to interfering with the tick\u2019s ability to find its prey the way DEET affects mosquitoes, Mather said. What\u2019s more, \u201cas soon as the product is dried, it doesn\u2019t burn as much, so it really doesn\u2019t last very long for ticks.\u201d Instead, Chapman recommends preventing tick bites by covering your skin and tucking the bottoms of your pants into your socks. Ticks also are killed by half an hour in the dryer, so toss your clothes in as soon as you get home, even before you wash them. What\u2019s more, \u201cwe favor\u00a0wearing treated clothes with permethrin\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s far, far more effective\u201d than bug spray, Mather said. \u201cIt blocks nerve conduction in ticks, and it makes them hyper-excited and then they just lose function pretty quickly, and it actually ends up killing them.\u201d Depending on where you live, he said, it might also make sense to investigate exterminating ticks living in your yard. These precautions might seem extreme, but to Mather, they\u2019re the way of the future, because \u201cwe live in a \u2018more ticks in more places\u2019 world, and more people are being exposed.\u201d Climate change may play some role\u00a0in the spread of ticks, but Mather said he believes that the influx of the parasites has more to do with white-tailed deer becoming more common in areas where higher densities of people live. As a result, he said, \u201cMore people are being exposed to the ticks that are reproducing on white-tailed deer.\u201d Despite the spread of ticks and the severity of illnesses that they can cause, Chapman stressed that with proper precautions (for you and your pets \u2014 ask your vet for tick preventatives), they shouldn\u2019t hold you hostage inside your home. \u201cYes, ticks exist. Yes, they can be a public health concern, but we don\u2019t want you to let ticks keep you indoors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should still be able to go outside and enjoy nature, but you just have to, once again, perform those tick checks.

{"id": "2024_05_27_health_pregnancy-energetic-cost-wellness-scn", "text": "Having a baby is energetically much more expensive than commonly thought, according to new research. In fact, over the course of a pregnancy, creating and carrying a little one takes 49,753 dietary\u00a0calories \u2014 the equivalent of 199 Snickers candy bars each containing 250 calories, said Dr. Dustin Marshall, a coauthor of the study published May 16 in the journal Science. For the meta-analysis, Marshall, a professor of evolutionary biology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and a team of researchers used data from thousands of existing scientific articles to look at the energy cost of several species. \u201cWhile most folks probably intuit, or have actually experienced the high energy demands that come from gestating a baby, our work assigns explicit values to these costs across a wide range of species \u2014 from insects to lizards to humans,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Samuel Ginther, a postdoctoral researcher of biological sciences at Monash University, in an email. \u201cWe found that the total energy it takes to reproduce is much more substantial than previously considered.\u201d The bulk of the additional energy a pregnant person needs goes toward developing and carrying the fetus, Ginther added. \u201cMost of (the) energy that mammals put into reproduction is \u2018boiled off\u2019 as metabolic heat, only 10% ends up in the actual baby,\u201d Marshall said in an email. \u201cWhen both lactation and metabolic loads are accounted for, the baby itself represents less than 1/20th of the total reproductive investment.\u201d The research could make a big difference in perceptions of pregnancy needs, said Dr. Eve Feinberg, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the research. \u201cI think this study is groundbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cAny working pregnant woman could tell you the sheer level of exhaustion when you are pregnant \u2026 and how it consumes your life.\u201d How to break down what you need The extra calorie needs were not equal across the term of the pregnancy \u2014 you need less early on and much more as time goes on, Marshall said. A person would need about 182.48 extra calories daily over the approximately 272.65 days of their pregnancy, the researchers found. The current recommendations break down differently by trimester of the pregnancy, said dietitian Natalie Mokari. In the beginning, you may not need many more daily calories, she said. Once you get to the second trimester, you need about 350 extra calories a day, while you need 450 more calories daily in the third trimester, said Mokari, who lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. The calories recommended by dietitians add up to even more than the almost 50,000 the researchers mentioned, Mokari said. If you breastfeed after the baby is born, you will need to add 450 to 500 more calories to your prepregnancy diet, she added. You can think of it as an additional substantial snack or mini meal in your day around the second trimester, Mokari said. And by the third trimester and breastfeeding, the additional calories amount to a meal. \u201cYour body is in overdrive. Your metabolism is working hard to build another human,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty monumental.\u201d What to eat How you eat will depend on your pregnancy, Mokari said. She recommends trying to eat every three to four hours or add smaller snacks every two hours throughout the day if that works better for your pregnancy symptoms, she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be three standard meals with a few snacks in between, because sometimes you can\u2019t handle that in pregnancy if you\u2019ve got nausea or anything like that,\u201d Mokari said. Mokari stressed the importance of carbs for energy, protein and healthy fat \u2014 \u201cthose high-quality fats that are going to promote good brain health for the baby.\u201d What constitutes a healthy fat? Fatty fish such as salmon, olive oil, avocados, avocado oil, peanut butter and almond butter are all great examples, Mokari said. Milk and dairy can also provide that fat along with other vitamins, and eggs can be a good source of both protein and fat, she added. \u201cYou really want your energy to come from good, whole foods,\u201d Feinberg added. Get some sleep This study also suggests that sleep is probably especially important during pregnancy, Feinberg said. \u201cIf you feel tired, go to sleep, and really understand that you\u2019re not being a wimp, that you\u2019re exhausted in pregnancy,\u201d Feinberg said. Unfortunately, there can be a stigma around pregnant people having higher sleep needs, but the study\u2019s findings should work against that, she said. \u201cThese data really give some solid numbers to say that the exhaustion women feel is very real and probably needs to be paid more attention to,\u201d Feinberg said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/pregnancy-energetic-cost-wellness-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_ozempic-benefits-diabetic-kidney-disease", "text": "Weekly injections of semaglutide medications like Ozempic significantly reduce the risk of serious kidney outcomes, major cardiovascular events and death among people who have type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, according to a new study. Diabetes is a key risk factor for kidney disease, which is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide; about 1 in 3 people with diabetes also has chronic kidney disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But new research shows that weekly injections of semaglutide cut the risk of severe outcomes from diabetic kidney disease by about 24%. These severe outcomes \u2013 including significant loss of kidney function, kidney failure and death from kidney or cardiovascular causes \u2013 occurred 331 times among trial participants who were treated with semaglutide, compared with 410 events among those who received the placebo. When scaled by the number of years each person was in the trial, there were 5.8 events for every 100 years of follow-up among those taking semaglutide, compared with 7.5 events for every 100 years of follow-up among those who received the placebo. High sugar levels in the blood of people with diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the kidneys, and this can also cause strain on the heart. The new study found even broader related benefits of semaglutide treatment among people with diabetic kidney disease. Kidney function declined more slowly overall, the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack was 18% lower and the risk of death from any cause was 20% lower among people who were treated with semaglutide compared with those who received the placebo, the research found. The study, published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Renal Association Congress, is based on the results of a drug trial conducted among about 3,500 people across 28 countries who were living with both type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. About half of the participants received weekly 1-milligram injections of semaglutide \u2013 the dose approved to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic in the US \u2013 and the others got a placebo treatment. Overall, the study participants were followed for an average of about 3\u00bd years. The trial was initially expected to last about four or five years, but findings at the midpoint check-in were so promising that an independent monitoring committee recommended that it end early. \u201cIn this trial, we\u2019re able to show benefits that highlight how transforming semaglutide can be for people with diabetes and kidney disease,\u201d said Dr. Vlado Perkovic, a nephrologist and provost at the the University of New South Wales Sydney. He chairs the trial\u2019s steering committee and was lead author of the new study. \u201cThe effect size was a bit larger than we had expected, and therefore, the results were highly statistically significant. So the likelihood of this being a chance finding is infinitesimally small, and I think we can be highly confident that the results are robust and real.\u201d Three other drug treatments have been shown to provide benefits for people with diabetic kidney disease, and the researchers note in the new study that \u201cclinicians and patients will need to consider the order and priority of use for semaglutide.\u201d A combination of therapies could be important, and many of the trial participants were also receiving some other type of treatment for their diabetes. \u201cSemaglutide showed some benefits on top of what is currently considered standard of care,\u201d said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development for Novo Nordisk. The Danish company is the only drug manufacturer with semaglutide products that are approved for use in the US \u2013 Ozempic for treatment of diabetes and Wegovy for treatment of obesity \u2013 and it funded the new study. Similar benefits were found across all levels of starting kidney function, but there was a particular focus on those at highest risk. More than two-thirds of trial participants were considered to be at very high risk of severe outcomes including kidney failure, cardiovascular events or death, according to risk calculators outlined in global clinical practice guidelines. In part, focusing on this high-risk group offers clearer insight into the benefits of treatment. But, experts say, many people also don\u2019t realize they have kidney disease until it has reached later stages \u2013 and many don\u2019t realize just how dangerous it can be. During each year of this trial, about 8% of the participants had a major kidney event, and almost 5% of people died. \u201cKidney disease attributed to diabetes, or diabetic kidney disease, is one of the most common and deadly complications of diabetes. Yet, unfortunately, there\u2019s very low awareness around it,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Tuttle, chair of the Diabetic Kidney Disease Collaborative for the American Society of Nephrology. She is also the executive director for research at Providence Inland Northwest Health, an investigator with the Institute of Translational Health Sciences and professor of medicine at the University of Washington. \u201cPart of the problem is that the condition is asymptomatic until late stages, so physicians and patients have to be very intentional about identifying kidney disease.\u201d It\u2019s recommended that people with diabetes get tested for kidney disease every six months with blood or urine tests. But this doesn\u2019t always happen, and some people wait until they have symptoms such as fatigue, swelling or changes in urination frequency. Diabetes treatments are in high demand because it\u2019s such a common disease, said Tuttle, who was also part of the new research. But semaglutide is so promising because it seems to have benefits that apply to multiple complications that can arise because of it. In addition to lowering blood sugar, semaglutide products have been shown to help with weight loss, heart failure and potentially curbing addictive behaviors. \u201cI think these drugs that affect multiple final common pathways are really highly effective because when we try to just treat one risk factor, it\u2019s almost like putting your finger in the dike. You can\u2019t plug all the holes. To me, what semaglutide really does is, it addresses a broad spectrum of risk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does reduce weight, it does lower glucose in does lower blood pressure a little bit, and then we think on top of that, it has the direct effects on the kidney. It\u2019s really the whole package.\u201d There are significant disparities in diabetes prevalence and kidney disease in the US. Black, Hispanic and American Indian adults are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes than White adults, according to CDC data. And Black people in the US are about three times more likely to have kidney failure than White adults. However, most of the participants in the semaglutide trial were White, and the findings could not be assessed among important subgroups. \u201cWhen we have something that\u2019s effective, we also have to turn our sights to getting treatments to patients,\u201d Tuttle said. But many of the highest-risk people who could benefit most from treatment don\u2019t have access to it. \u201cNow, we have a highly effective therapy that reduces things that really matter to patients, families and communities: keeping their kidney function, preserving life and reducing the rates of cardiovascular events. But that\u2019s all great only if people get the treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cSo now, really, the challenge before all of us is to move much more expeditiously from evidence generation to implementation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/ozempic-benefits-diabetic-kidney-disease/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}

Believers in the Muslim faith make Umrah trips to Mecca throughout the year to receive blessings. Muslims also make a longer, more ritualized pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime during a set time of year called Hajj. This year\u2019s Hajj is June 14 to 19. Five of the pilgrims who got sick this year live in the United States. France has had four cases, and the United Kingdom has had three. Ten of the people who got sick had been to Mecca, and two had a close association with someone who did. Meningococcal disease is highly contagious among unvaccinated people. Of the patients whose vaccination status is known, nine were unvaccinated. Meningococcal disease, including meningitis, is an uncommon illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. It can cause infection in the lining of the brain and spinal cord that can cause a lifetime of medical problems such as memory and concentration issues, seizures, balance problems, hearing loss and blindness. The disease can also lead to a serious blood infection called septicemia or blood poisoning. Research shows that\u00a0an estimated\u00a010% to 15% of cases end in death, even with appropriate treatment. The number of cases in the US has been on the rise, according to the CDC. This year, 143 cases were reported as of the end of March, compared with 81 for the same period last year. There were 422 cases in all of 2023, the most since 2014, according to the CDC. Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics if it\u2019s caught early enough. However, diagnosis is often delayed because the symptoms can mimic those of other infectious diseases like Covid-19 or the flu. Symptoms include fever, a headache, nausea or vomiting, trouble walking, a stiff neck, a skin rash, sensitivity to light and brain fog. Tests of the bacteria in the newly confirmed cases showed that in one case in the US and one in France, it was resistant to ciprofloxacin, one of the first-line antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease. Eight cases responded to treatment with penicillin or ciprofloxacin. Vaccines and boosters available Saudi Arabia requires all Umrah or Hajj pilgrims age 1 and older to have gotten the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine, also known as the meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccine.\u00a0It protects against four variations of the bacteria that are in wide circulation:\u00a0A, C, W, and Y. Overall, most cases in the US are related to serogroup Y. In the US, doctors may also recommend the MenB vaccine to protect against the B-variation of the bacteria. A shot made by Pfizer that was approved in the US last year, Penbraya, protects against all five of these most common serogroups that cause meningococcal disease. Most of the pilgrims who got sick tested positive for the W variation. One case in the United States was caused by serogroup C. In the US, the vaccine is routinely recommended for all preteens and teens\u00a0and for some younger children and adults under specific circumstances. One such instance is before travel to countries where meningococcal disease is more common. This includes a recommendation for a booster if the last time a traveler got the shot was three to five or more years before their trip. The CDC said Monday that health care providers should work with patients who are considering travel for Hajj or Umrah to make sure they have received the MenACWY vaccine within the past five years or get the shot at least 10 days before they leave for their trip. In the new notice, which was issued through the CDC\u2019s Health Alert Network, the agency also reminded providers to suspect meningococcal disease in anyone who has symptoms after recent travel for Hajj or Umrah. The CDC told health departments and providers to consider using several of the preferred antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease in people associated with travel to Mecca. People who come into close contact with someone with meningococcal disease should get an antibiotic as soon as possible after exposure, regardless of their vaccination status, the CDC said, and ideally within a day after the initial patient has been identified. The most recent outbreak connected to a mass gathering was in 2000-01, the CDC said, and it was primarily caused by the W variation of the bacteria. It\u2019s only since 2002 that Saudi Arabia has required all pilgrims to provide proof of vaccination against meningococcal disease, but vaccination coverage among these travelers is \u201cknown to be incomplete,\u201d the CDC said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_dairy-cow-meat-bird-flu", "text": "Meat from a dairy cow that was culled from its herd and sent to slaughter has tested positive for traces of the H5N1 bird flu virus, the US Department of Agriculture announced Friday, but no meat from the cow entered the food supply. The USDA said viral particles of H5N1 were detected during testing of various tissues, including samples from the diaphragm muscle, which sits below the lungs. The testing was done as a standard part of the food inspection process, the USDA said. Infectious disease experts around the world have been on alert since the USDA announced March 25 that a dairy cow tested positive for H5N1 influenza. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic form of bird flu that scientists have watched closely since it was detected in 1996. It has decimated wild bird populations and poultry flocks but only sporadically infects humans. When it does, it can be fatal: About half of the roughly 900 people known to be infected around the world over the past two decades have died. In the past two years, the virus has changed and begun to infect a growing assortment of mammals. Experts never expected the virus to show up in cows, as it was thought that they didn\u2019t have the right receptors on their cells to catch A-strain flu viruses \u2013 but it turns out they do. In this outbreak, the virus has mostly been showing up in the milk of dairy cows and causing mastitis, or an infection of the mammary gland. Cows stop producing as much milk, but they generally recover after a few weeks. Two US farmworkers are known to have tested positive in conjunction with the ongoing dairy cow outbreak. In both cases, the virus infected their eyes, causing redness and swelling, but they recovered. Finding a cow that tested positive for H5N1 postmortem, after systemic disease, suggests that some sick animals are going undetected.\u00a0It also suggests that the owners may not have tested the animal before its slaughter and that other cows in the herd may be infected. The USDA said the dead cow tested positive for H5N1 on May 22.\u00a0It has notified the owners and is tracing the animal to the herd it came from to get more information, the agency said. The USDA says samples taken from\u00a095 other cows\u00a0that were culled and condemned for illness tested negative for the virus\u00a0as of May 22,\u00a0and testing is underway on about a dozen more samples.\u00a0The test the USDA used, which is called polymerase chain reaction testing or PCR, identified genetic material from H5N1 virus, but it could not determine whether that material was infectious and could have made someone sick. Earlier tests on samples of ground beef using a different virus as a stand-in for H5N1 found that the virus was killed when the burgers were cooked to at least\u00a0145 degrees Fahrenheit,\u00a0or medium.\u00a0Cooking burgers\u00a0to rare, a temperature of 120 degrees,\u00a0substantially reduced levels of active virus but did not kill it all.\u00a0The USDA already recommends that burgers be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees to kill dangerous pathogens such as salmonella and E. coli.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/dairy-cow-meat-bird-flu/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}

Can you picture the scene? The ability to remember things that happened to you in the past, especially to go back and recall little incidental details, is a hallmark of what psychologists call episodic memory \u2014 and new research indicates that it\u2019s an ability humans may share with birds called Eurasian jays. With episodic memory, \u201cyou\u2019re remembering an event or an episode, hence the name,\u201d said James Davies, first author of the study that appeared May 15 in the journal PLOS One. \u201cYou kind of mentally relive it. It also involves other kinds of details that make up that experience, so sounds, sights, even your thoughts or your mood at the time.\u201d Episodic memory differs from semantic memory, which is the recall of factual information, added Davies, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Comparative Cognition Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s often helpful to think about episodic memory as remembering, whereas semantic memory is just knowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really a conscious recall involved.\u201d While episodic memory is integral to how most people experience the world, it can be difficult for scientists to prove whether nonhuman animals share this ability \u2014 after all, they can\u2019t tell us what they\u2019re thinking. However, for several decades, scientists have been devising experiments to delve into animals\u2019 ability to remember previous events, and they have found evidence of episodic-like memory in creatures as varied as pigeons, dogs and cuttlefish. Corvids \u2014 the group of birds that includes crows, ravens and jays \u2014 are famously smart, and previous studies have suggested that they are capable of episodic-like memory, which may help them find bits of food that they\u2019ve hidden for later. In 1998, Dr. Nicola Clayton devised an experiment with scrub jays in which the birds appeared to remember what kinds of foods they\u2019d hidden in different spots and how long ago. This means of finding evidence of episodic-like recall \u2014 called a \u201cwhat, when, where\u201d protocol \u2014 has become standard among scientists studying animal memory. But Davies, who is Clayton\u2019s advisee, wanted to find other ways to test for this cognitive capability. \u201cIf you\u2019re only using one methodology, then potentially there\u2019s some error in that method,\u201d Davies said. \u201cIf you use multiple different methodologies that test the same thing in quite different ways, then that leads to much more conclusive evidence.\u201d The researchers devised a fresh approach involving Eurasian jays,\u00a0and what they found could have implications for the study of human memory. Testing incidental memory Davies and Clayton\u2019s new experimental design drew upon the concept of incidental memory. \u201cThe idea is that with human episodic memory, we remember details of events that, at the time, weren\u2019t necessarily relevant to anything. We weren\u2019t actively trying to remember this,\u201d Davies said. \u201cBut then if you were to be asked about it a few days later, you might remember those details.\u201d It\u2019s a seemingly unimportant bit of information that you didn\u2019t consciously commit to memory \u2014 for instance, remembering what you had for lunch yesterday. This aspect of episodic memory is sometimes referred to as \u201cmental time travel.\u201d To find out whether Eurasian jays are capable of mental time travel, the researchers worked with birds that had been trained to find food hidden under cups. Davies set out a row of four identical red plastic cups and allowed the birds to observe him putting a piece of food under one of the cups. The jays then had to recall which cup the food had been hidden under. Easy enough. For the next step of the experiment, Davies made little changes to the cups\u2019 appearances, such as adding stickers or colorful strings, but once again hid the food under the same cup in the lineup. For a bird looking for a treat, those strings and stickers were seemingly unimportant incidental info \u2014 at this point, they only needed to worry about the position of the cup to find the food. But in the final stage of the experiment, those little details of cup decoration became unexpectedly important. Davies changed the position of the cups so that the birds could no longer rely on the once-crucial information of which cup in the row contained food. (The treats had since been removed from the cups, to rule out the possibility that the birds were just finding the food by scent.) However, after a 10-minute break, the jays were still able to find the cups with the treats. Davies suggested that the birds\u2019 mental process might have involved asking themselves, \u201c\u2018Where\u2019s the food? I remember going to the one with the black square on it. I\u2019ll go to that one,\u2019\u201d Davies said. The jays appeared to be going back in their memories to retrieve details about the cup decorations, and they were highly successful in using that information to find the hidden food. \u201cThis study provides strong evidence for episodic memory in Eurasian jays,\u201d said Dr. Jonathon Crystal, a provost professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Indiana Bloomington who was not involved with the project. \u201cIf you can answer that unexpected question after incidental encoding, that becomes a strong argument that you can remember back in time to the earlier episode, which is at the heart of documenting episodic memory.\u201d Crystal said that studies such as this one, which aim to identify animals\u2019 abilities to form episodic memories, are important in part because of their potential role in the field of human memory research. \u201cThe big disease of memory is Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and of course, the most debilitating aspect of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a profound loss of episodic memory,\u201d Crystal said. Since Alzheimer\u2019s drugs for humans invariably undergo animal testing before they reach human trials, he noted that it\u2019s important for scientists to be able to drill down into whether these drugs actually affect the kind of memories that Alzheimer\u2019s patients lose. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just improve memory, we need to improve episodic memory,\u201d he said, and a better understanding of how to test for episodic-like memory in animals could help make that possible.

{"id": "2024_05_24_health_weekly-insulin-fda-committee", "text": "Most types of insulin therapy, an important part of diabetes treatment for many people, are given as daily injections to help manage blood sugar levels. Now, the maker of a once-weekly insulin injection is seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but a committee of agency advisers is divided on whether the benefits of the product may outweigh the risks. In a meeting Friday, the FDA\u2019s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee weighed whether the benefits of Novo Nordisk\u2019s weekly product, called insulin icodec, outweigh its risks. If the agency signs off, the treatment will be the first weekly insulin available in the United States. The committee\u2019s discussions focused on the safety and efficacy of insulin icodec, specifically in people with type 1 diabetes. The advisers were asked to answer a question of, based on the available data, whether Novo Nordisk has demonstrated that the benefits of insulin icodec outweigh its risks for improving glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Four voted yes. Seven voted no. The advisory committee\u2019s discussions and voting outcomes will be shared with the FDA, which takes into consideration but does not have to follow the committee\u2019s advice when deciding whether to approve the treatment. An analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials found that once-weekly insulin icodec was better at reducing high blood glucose levels in comparison with the once-daily therapy insulin degludec, but insulin icodec was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia, also known as low blood glucose, which can lead to a loss of consciousness or seizures. \u201cInsulin icodec was associated with 50 to 80% more clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia compared to insulin degludec at Week 52, depending on the method of analysis,\u201d the committee\u2019s meeting materials say. If the product is approved by the FDA, some panel members said, there should be guidance on ways to mitigate and treat the risk of hypoglycemia. Committee member Dr. Barbara Onumah, a endocrinology in Largo, Maryland, voted yes on the benefits of insulin icodec outweighing its risks. \u201cThis would add a tool to the toolbox for clinicians,\u201d Onumah said. \u201cIt will not be beneficial for every person, but it might be useful for some persons,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a few risk mitigation things that need to be ironed out clearly so that for the general provider or practitioner who would be writing this prescription, should it be approved, will be doing it correctly and safely \u2013 because safety would be very important.\u201d Committee member Dr. Matthew Drake, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, voted no. Drake said his rationale was based on comparing insulin icodec with the current gold standard of insulin degludec, \u201cwhich has a good safety profile in my experience,\u201d he said. Committee member Erica Brittain also voted no but called it a hard decision. \u201cI agree that there\u2019s theoretical benefits, and anyone could understand wanting to have fewer injections, and that\u2019s very important,\u201d said Brittain, a biostatistician at the National Institutes of Health. \u201cUnfortunately, within the trial data, we don\u2019t see the benefit of better glycemic control, which I think was promised in terms of adherence. I understand that that would be hard to show in this clinical trial population, but things kind of go the other way,\u201d she said. The committee also discussed how a weekly insulin injection might be an easier treatment regimen to follow than daily injections. Studies suggest that about 53% of adults with type 1 diabetes adhere to existing insulin therapy schedules, \u201cwith approximately 22% of patients missing at least one basal insulin dose over any 14-day period,\u201d according to the FDA advisory committee\u2019s meeting materials. \u201cNonadherence to insulin therapy is a precipitating factor for diabetic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.\u201d Novo Nordisk isn\u2019t the only company developing a weekly insulin therapy for diabetes patients. Last week, Eli Lilly announced that its once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa was \u201cequally safe and effective\u201d in Phase 3 trials involving adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin for the first time and those who require multiple daily insulin injections.

{"id": "2024_05_21_health_microplastics-testicles-study-wellness", "text": "Human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas, a new small study found. \u201cThese plastics are often nano-scale, typically less than half a micron in length and maybe like 20 to 200 nanometers in width,\u201d said toxicologist Matthew Campen, coauthor of the study that published May 15 in the journal Toxicological Sciences. \u201cThey look like little shards, tiny broken bits from very, very old plastics,\u201d said Campen, a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Such minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, interrupting cellular processes and potentially depositing\u00a0endocrine-disrupting chemicals\u00a0such as\u00a0bisphenols,\u00a0phthalates,\u00a0flame retardants,\u00a0per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and\u00a0heavy metals. Endocrine disruptors interfere with the human reproductive system, leading to genital and reproductive malformations as well as female infertility and a decline in sperm count, according to the Endocrine Society. In fact, sperm counts in parts of the world, including the United States, have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, the society stated on its website. \u201cThis is an eyes wide open situation right now,\u201d Campen said. \u201cWe\u2019re just now realizing how much plastic is in our bodies. We need a surge of research around this topic to confirm or deny a role for microplastics in driving infertility, testicular cancer and other cancers.\u201d \u2018Action is desperately needed now\u2019 The new study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d Polyethylene, one of the most widely used plastics in the world, was the predominant type of polymer in both species, followed by PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, another commonly used chemical that can contain chemical additives and heavy metals including phthalates, cadmium and lead. Phthalates, called\u00a0 \u201ceverywhere chemicals\u201d because they are so common, are added to consumer products to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break. Researchers expected to find more plastic shards in the testicles of older men in the study, but that wasn\u2019t the case, Campen said. \u201cIt seems that in peak reproductive years for men, which is from 20 to 45, there are higher levels of plastics, which then begin to decline after the age of 55,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests the human body can eliminate these plastics.\u201d But there is a downside. The finding also suggests that the increased energy needs of a younger testicle may \u201calso pull more plastic into that organ,\u201d Campen said. \u201cAdd to that the fact that the number of plastics we\u2019re exposed to is doubling at a rate of every 10 to 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen in 15 years when we are exposed to twice the amount or 30 years when we are exposed to four times the amount? That is why action is desperately needed now.\u201d The American Chemistry Council, an industry association, told CNN in a previous interview that plastics \u201chelp protect us, improve healthcare outcomes, and contribute to a more sustainable world.\u201d \u201cPlastic makers have a\u00a0goal\u00a0for all US plastic packaging to be reused, recycled, or recovered by 2040,\u201d said Dr. Kimberly Wise White, the council\u2019s vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs. More plastics than placentas Researchers also compared the testes results with microplastic levels found in an earlier study on 62 human placentas, the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to a developing fetus in the womb. In that February study, led by Campen, researchers found microplastics at levels of 6.5 to 790 micrograms per gram of tissue in all the placenta samples studied. \u201cIn testes, the levels of plastic was three times as much as we saw in placentas,\u201d Campen said. \u201cBut you have to consider that the placenta only has a life of about eight months.\u201d The latest study isn\u2019t the first report to find plastics in reproductive tissue. A team of Beijing-based researchers found microplastics in six human testes and 30 semen samples in a June 2023 study, while animal studies have shown tiny plastics can impact sperm count and contribute to hormone and other disruptions in male sexual organs. In studies of pregnant mice, researchers have found plastic chemicals in the brain, heart, liver, kidney and lungs of the developing fetus 24 hours after the pregnant mother ingested or breathed in plastic particles. Other\u00a0research\u00a0has shown that micro- and nanoplastics may cause oxidative stress, tissue damage and inflammation in cells, while animal studies have shown such particles may alter heart rate and impede cardiac function. How to limit plastic in your life There are steps one can take to reduce exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in food and food packaging products, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cLook at the recycling code on the bottom of products to find the plastic type, and avoid plastics with recycling codes 3, which typically contain phthalates,\u201d he added. Cut down on the use of disposable plastics, suggests the\u00a0Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Other suggestions include bringing reusable bags to the grocery store. Invest in a zippered fabric bag and ask the dry cleaner to return your clothes in that instead of those thin sheets of plastic. Bring a travel mug to the local coffee store for takeout and silverware to the office and cut back on plastic cups and utensils.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/microplastics-testicles-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}

Such unusual symptoms may also be a signal that an established disease may be about to intensely worsen or \u201cflare\u201d and require medical treatment, said lead study author Melanie Sloan, a researcher in the department of public health and primary care at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. \u201cThis is particularly the case in a disease like lupus, which is well known for affecting multiple organs including the brain, but we also found these patterns of symptoms in the other rheumatological diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and systemic sclerosis,\u201d Sloan said in an email. Lupus is a long-term disease in which the body\u2019s immune system goes haywire, attacking healthy tissue and causing inflammation and pain in any part of the body, including blood cells, the brain, heart, joints and muscles, kidneys, liver, and lungs. \u201cCognitive problems and many of these other neuropsychiatric symptoms we studied can have a huge influence on people\u2019s lives, ability to work, to socialize, and just to have as much of a normal life as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThese symptoms are often invisible and (currently) untestable but that shouldn\u2019t make them any less important to be considered for treatment and support.\u201d Jennifer Mundt, an assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who was not involved in the study, said in an email she was pleased the study focused on nightmares. \u201cAlthough nightmares are a very distressing problem in many medical and psychiatric conditions, they rarely get focused on except in the context of PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome),\u201d Mundt said. \u201cA\u00a0recent study\u00a0showed that 18% of people with long-COVID have (frequent) nightmares, and this compares to a general population prevalence of about 5%,\u201d she said. \u201cHearing the patient perspective is critical so that research and clinical care can be guided by what is most important to patients themselves.\u201d Doctors and patients need to know While research in the field is rather new, a March 2019 study found patients with inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases also experienced nightmares and other REM sleep disorders such as sleep paralysis. REM is short for rapid eye movement, the stage of sleep in which people dream and information and information and experiences are consolidated and stored in memory. In that study, one 57-year-old man recalled being \u201cthreatened by feral birds of prey\u201d in his nightmares, while a 70-year-old woman dreamed her nephew was in grave danger but she could do nothing to help him. The new study surveyed 400 doctors and 676 people living with lupus and also conducted detailed interviews with 50 clinicians and 69 people living with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including lupus. Researchers found 3 in 5 lupus patients, and 1 in 3 patients with other rheumatology-related diseases, had increasingly vivid and distressing nightmares just before their hallucinations. These nightmares often involved falling or being attacked, trapped, or crushed or committing murder. \u201cI\u2019d be riding a horse, going around cutting people out with my sword. One of them was somebody attacking me and I ended up slitting their throat,\u201d the English patient said. \u201cI\u2019m not a violent person at all. I don\u2019t even kill an insect,\u201d the patient continued. \u201cAnd I came to the conclusion that\u2019s probably me fighting my own (autoimmune) system. \u2026 I\u2019m probably attacking myself, that\u2019s the only thing I can logically make sense out of it. Systemic autoimmune diseases often have a range of symptoms, called prodromes, that appear as signs of a sudden and possibly dangerous worsening of the condition. In lupus, for example, headaches, an increase in fatigue, painful, swollen joints, rashes, dizziness and a fever without an infection are well-known signs of an upcoming flare. Recognizing these warning signs are important, Sloan said, because they allow \u201cearlier detection and therefore treatment of flares, some of which can be organ damaging and even fatal in lupus patients.\u201d However, unique warning symptoms such as nightmares and daymares are not in the diagnostic criteria for lupus or other diseases, Sloan said. The study found doctors infrequently ask about such experiences, and patients often avoid talking about them to their physicians. \u201cWe are strongly encouraging more doctors to ask about nightmares and other neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 thought to be unusual, but actually very common in systemic autoimmunity \u2014 to help us detect disease flares earlier,\u201d said senior study author David D\u2019Cruz, a consultant rheumatologist at Guy\u2019s Hospital and Kings College London. Connect the dots to autoimmune disease On first glance, it would make sense that such neurological manifestations as nightmares would occur if the autoimmune disease impacts the brain, which lupus often does, Sloan said. But that\u2019s not what the study uncovered. \u201cInterestingly, we found that lupus patients who were classified as having organ involvement other than the brain, such as kidneys or lungs, often also reported a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the lead up to their kidney/lung flare,\u201d Sloan said via email. \u201cThis suggests that monitoring these symptoms \u2014 such as nightmares and changing mood \u2014 as well as the usual rashes and protein in the urine (due to inflammation in the kidneys), etc., may help with earlier flare detection in many patients, not just those who go on to develop major brain involvement,\u201d she said. However, there is no reason for people with occasional nightmares or daytime dreams to be worried they may have an inflammatory autoimmune disease, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. \u201cThis study could alarm the general public into believing or worrying\u00a0about whether they have lupus or a related autoimmune disorder if they have nightmares or hallucinations, which are what doctors call \u2018nonspecific symptoms,\u2019 meaning that a variety of conditions (medical and psychiatric) can manifest with these symptoms,\u201d Schenck said in an email. It is indeed \u201cperfectly normal\u201d to have occasional nightmares and even daymares, or hallucinations, which \u201care also more common than we think,\u201d Sloan said. However, if those are intense, upsetting and occur around other symptoms such as extreme fatigue, headaches and other signs of autoimmune disorders, they \u201cshould be discussed with a doctor,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be afraid or embarrassed to talk about these symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases, reporting these symptoms earlier, even if they seem strange and unconnected, may lead to the doctor being able to \u2018join the dot\u2019s\u2019 to diagnose an autoimmune disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "health"}}
