{"id": "2024_05_21_health_microplastics-testicles-study-wellness", "text": "Human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas, a new small study found. \u201cThese plastics are often nano-scale, typically less than half a micron in length and maybe like 20 to 200 nanometers in width,\u201d said toxicologist Matthew Campen, coauthor of the study that published May 15 in the journal Toxicological Sciences. \u201cThey look like little shards, tiny broken bits from very, very old plastics,\u201d said Campen, a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Such minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, interrupting cellular processes and potentially depositing\u00a0endocrine-disrupting chemicals\u00a0such as\u00a0bisphenols,\u00a0phthalates,\u00a0flame retardants,\u00a0per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, and\u00a0heavy metals. Endocrine disruptors interfere with the human reproductive system, leading to genital and reproductive malformations as well as female infertility and a decline in sperm count, according to the Endocrine Society. In fact, sperm counts in parts of the world, including the United States, have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, the society stated on its website. \u201cThis is an eyes wide open situation right now,\u201d Campen said. \u201cWe\u2019re just now realizing how much plastic is in our bodies. We need a surge of research around this topic to confirm or deny a role for microplastics in driving infertility, testicular cancer and other cancers.\u201d \u2018Action is desperately needed now\u2019 The new study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d Polyethylene, one of the most widely used plastics in the world, was the predominant type of polymer in both species, followed by PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, another commonly used chemical that can contain chemical additives and heavy metals including phthalates, cadmium and lead. Phthalates, called\u00a0 \u201ceverywhere chemicals\u201d because they are so common, are added to consumer products to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break. Researchers expected to find more plastic shards in the testicles of older men in the study, but that wasn\u2019t the case, Campen said. \u201cIt seems that in peak reproductive years for men, which is from 20 to 45, there are higher levels of plastics, which then begin to decline after the age of 55,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests the human body can eliminate these plastics.\u201d But there is a downside. The finding also suggests that the increased energy needs of a younger testicle may \u201calso pull more plastic into that organ,\u201d Campen said. \u201cAdd to that the fact that the number of plastics we\u2019re exposed to is doubling at a rate of every 10 to 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen in 15 years when we are exposed to twice the amount or 30 years when we are exposed to four times the amount? That is why action is desperately needed now.\u201d The American Chemistry Council, an industry association, told CNN in a previous interview that plastics \u201chelp protect us, improve healthcare outcomes, and contribute to a more sustainable world.\u201d \u201cPlastic makers have a\u00a0goal\u00a0for all US plastic packaging to be reused, recycled, or recovered by 2040,\u201d said Dr. Kimberly Wise White, the council\u2019s vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs. More plastics than placentas Researchers also compared the testes results with microplastic levels found in an earlier study on 62 human placentas, the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to a developing fetus in the womb. In that February study, led by Campen, researchers found microplastics at levels of 6.5 to 790 micrograms per gram of tissue in all the placenta samples studied. \u201cIn testes, the levels of plastic was three times as much as we saw in placentas,\u201d Campen said. \u201cBut you have to consider that the placenta only has a life of about eight months.\u201d The latest study isn\u2019t the first report to find plastics in reproductive tissue. A team of Beijing-based researchers found microplastics in six human testes and 30 semen samples in a June 2023 study, while animal studies have shown tiny plastics can impact sperm count and contribute to hormone and other disruptions in male sexual organs. In studies of pregnant mice, researchers have found plastic chemicals in the brain, heart, liver, kidney and lungs of the developing fetus 24 hours after the pregnant mother ingested or breathed in plastic particles. Other\u00a0research\u00a0has shown that micro- and nanoplastics may cause oxidative stress, tissue damage and inflammation in cells, while animal studies have shown such particles may alter heart rate and impede cardiac function. How to limit plastic in your life There are steps one can take to reduce exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in food and food packaging products, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health. \u201cLook at the recycling code on the bottom of products to find the plastic type, and avoid plastics with recycling codes 3, which typically contain phthalates,\u201d he added. Cut down on the use of disposable plastics, suggests the\u00a0Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Other suggestions include bringing reusable bags to the grocery store. Invest in a zippered fabric bag and ask the dry cleaner to return your clothes in that instead of those thin sheets of plastic. Bring a travel mug to the local coffee store for takeout and silverware to the office and cut back on plastic cups and utensils.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/microplastics-testicles-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_europe_mammoth-bones-austria-wine-cellar-scli-intl-scn", "text": "Hundreds of mammoth bones have been uncovered in an Austrian wine cellar, in a discovery labelled an \u201carchaeological sensation.\u201d The remains are thought to be between 30,000 and 40,000 years old, according to experts. Andreas Pernerstorfer made the incredible discovery while renovating his wine cellar in the village of Gobelsburg, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) northwest of Vienna, in March. The find has been described as the most significant of its kind in more than a century, with researchers from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OeAW), who are now recovering the bones, describing it as an \u201carchaeological sensation,\u201d according to a Wednesday press release. Pernerstorfer had decided to carry out some work to level the floor in the cellar, archaeologist Hannah Parow\u2013 Souchon, a researcher at the OeAW, told CNN in a video call Thursday. \u201cHe wanted to level the floor of his wine cellar because it was sloping and he removed some concrete in the center,\u201d she said. \u201cMore or less immediately he found the bones, which he initially thought were wood. Then he looked more closely and remembered a tale from his grandfather who in the sixties extended the cellar and found some mammoth molars.\u201d Pernerstorfer reported the find to the Federal Monuments Office, which referred him to the OeAW because, as Parow-Souchon told CNN, \u201cwe are experts on the Stone Age.\u201d She and her team of fellow archaeologists embarked on an excavation at the start of May. \u201cIt quickly became apparent that it wasn\u2019t just a few mammoth bones but very many mammoth bones,\u201d she said. Parow-Souchon said they have \u201cat least 300 bones,\u201d which were found densely packed together. \u201cWe think we have mostly the complete animals. They\u2019re not in anatomical connection but we do have probably all parts,\u201d she said, adding that the recovered haul includes some rare finds, including a lingual (tongue) bone.\u201d The archaeologists believe the bones are from three separate mammoths. The site they excavated was just 12 square meters (129 square feet) big, but they are hoping to return in August to continue with their search. \u201cI love being an archaeologist. I\u2019ve excavated lots of exciting things but I always wanted to excavate a mammoth,\u201d said Parow-Souchon, adding that the mammoth bone discovery was a first for her. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled, I can\u2019t deny it,\u201d she said. Comparable sites elsewhere in Austria and in neighboring countries were mostly excavated more than 100 years ago, which means they are not available for modern research. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve been able to investigate something like this in Austria using modern methods. It is a unique opportunity for research,\u201d said Parow-Souchon in the press release. The excavations, funded by the Federal Monuments Office and the province of Lower Austria, raise many questions, including whether these animals were killed by Stone Age hunters. \u201cWe know that humans hunted mammoths, but we still know very little about how they did it,\u201d said Parow-Souchon, adding that a trap for the animals may have been set at this site. Once the researchers complete their work, the bones will be passed to the Natural History Museum Vienna for restoration.

{"id": "2024_05_23_health_prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness", "text": "Chemical toxins are everywhere \u2014 in our water, food, air and soil. Exposure to those toxins during pregnancy can create serious health issues in elementary school children that can affect their lives for years to come, a new study found. Children born to European mothers exposed to four families of chemicals that disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine (hormone) system had elevated levels of metabolic syndrome at ages 6 to 11. Metabolic syndrome can include obesity, elevated blood pressure, and abnormally high cholesterol and insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Within the group of children exposed to the highest levels of chemicals, 62% were overweight or obese, compared with 16% of children within the low-risk group, said first author Nuria Gu\u0308il-Oumrait, a Fulbright scholar at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cMoreover, the levels of blood insulin and triglycerides, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group,\u201d G\u00fcil-Oumrait said in an email. \u201cIn contrast, HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group.\u201d HDL cholesterol is considered a \u201cgood\u201d blood fat as it helps clear ateries. Metabolic syndrome is typically associated with adult cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, but the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has seen symptoms appearing in kids at younger and younger ages. Having metabolic syndrome as a child is highly predictive of chronic disease as an adult, experts say. \u201cThis research stands out as one of the most comprehensive endeavors delving into early-life environmental origins of metabolic risk, further bolstering prior toxicological and epidemiological evidence in this area,\u201d said Vicente Mustieles, Mariana Ferna\u0301ndez and Carmen Messerlian in an editorial published with the study that appeared Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Mustieles and Fern\u00e1ndez are investigators at the Biomedical Research Center at the University of Granada, Spain. Messerlian is an assistant professor of environmental reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. CNN reached out to the International Council for Chemical Associations for comment but did not hear back before publication. A spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, however, provided the following statement. \u201cWe will review the details of this study once it\u2019s released. ACC\u2019s members are serious about their responsibility to produce chemistries that offer important safety, product performance and durability benefits and that can be used safely. Our members undertake extensive scientific analyses to evaluate potential risk of their chemicals, from development through use and safe disposal.\u201d Dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals The research team behind the new study performed blood and urine tests on 1,134 mothers during their pregnancies and later repeated those tests on their children between the ages of 6 and 11. The tests were looking for mixtures of nine chemical classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly found in the environment. Endrocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants with the \u201cability to cross the blood-placenta barrier and interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance,\u201d the study said. These and other chemicals \u201cend up in the blood, tissue, and organs of fetuses and infants through maternal transplacental and breastfeeding pathways in a never-ending cycle,\u201d Mustieles, Fern\u00e1ndez and Messerlian wrote. The study tested for pesticides; heavy metals; flame retardants; plasticizers such as phthalates and phenols; and PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are found in surface and groundwaters around the world at levels much higher than many international regulators allow. Called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because\u00a0they fail to break down fully in the environment, PFAS have been used since the 1950s to make consumer products nonstick, oil- and water-repellent, and resistant to temperature change. Some of the most studied PFAS, such as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone disruption,\u00a0according to the EPA. Toxic heavy metals in the soil and water include lead and arsenic  \u2014 studies have found alarming levels in manufactured baby food. There is no safe level of lead, while arsenic, mercury and other heavy metals can harm the body and brain at relatively low doses, experts say. A December 2014 meta-analysis of studies on arsenic\u00a0found that a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15. Flame retardants have been linked to a 300% higher risk of cancer. These chemical toxins are the greatest contributor to intellectual disability in children worldwide, resulting in a total loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability, according to an\u00a0August 2020 study. Phthalates, found in hundreds of consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys, have been connected to premature death among people ages 55 to 64\u00a0in the United States. Prior research has connected phthalates with\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and\u00a0undescended testicles in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and testosterone levels in adult males. Phthalates are also linked in studies to\u00a0childhood obesity,\u00a0asthma,\u00a0cardiovascular issues\u00a0and\u00a0cancer. In the study, phthalates were the only group of chemicals that were associated with a lower level of metabolic syndrome. All of the other chemical families increased risk. People are exposed to a mixture of chemicals daily Chemicals may vary in their impact on the body. For example, certain PFAS compounds tend to accumulate in the liver, contributing to fatty liver disease and high cholesterol. And flame retardants and other chemicals may be stored in body fat, contributing to obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, according to the editorial. Since people are exposed to numerous types of potentially toxic substances each day, designing a study that could capture the cumulative impact on different parts of the body would provide a more realistic picture of any potential health impact. By focusing on metabolic syndrome, which combines measurements of blood sugars, lipids such as cholesterol, the existence of fat tissue and the impact on the heart, the current study was one of the first to accomplish this goal, the editorial said. \u201cWe almost always consider health risks from single chemicals, one at a time, as if we are exposed to just one chemical at a time,\u201d said Jane Houlihan, the national director of science and health for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies\u2019 exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. \u201cHere the research team shows that children\u2019s risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life can be driven by the complex mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the body at any moment and it highlights the particular risk of chemical exposures during pregnancy,\u201d she said. Healthy Babies Bright Futures\u00a0published a report in 2019\u00a0that found toxic metals in 95% of the baby foods randomly pulled off supermarket shelves, which led to the introduction of The Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, a bill that would allow the US Food and Drug Administration to set stricter standards and allow the FDA to monitor these standards through access to the records of food suppliers and manufacturers. \u201cGiven the steep rise in metabolic syndrome in the US, health officials and companies should be doing all they can to tighten safety standards and to get these chemicals out of commerce and out of our everyday products,\u201d Houlihan said. How to limit exposure There are ways to minimize exposure to plastics and other toxins, which is especially critical during pregnancy and childhood as developing fetuses and small bodies are more easily damaged, Houlihan said. Reduce rice intake for infants and children, and be sure to rinse grains well before using as this removes up to 60% of the arsenic, she said. Limit juice and be sure to carefully wash and peel vegetables and fruits, and if possible, buy organic. Stay away from stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and don\u2019t use waterproofing sprays. Check your local area for levels of PFAS and other chemicals in your drinking water. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy nonprofit, has created a national tap water database\u00a0searchable by zip code\u00a0that lists PFAS and other concerning chemicals, as well as a\u00a0national map\u00a0that illustrates where PFAS has been detected in the US. If your drinking water is of concern, consider purchasing a reverse osmosis filter, the most effective kind, EWG said. NSF, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, has\u00a0a list of recommended filters. Tap water is often a better choice than bottled water, however, which is packed with nanoplastics that can invade cells and tissues and leach toxic chemicals into the body. At home, one easy change is to use glass or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones when heating food. If possible, try to cook with ceramic, cast iron, or stainless-steel pans and avoid cookware treated with chemicals to avoid food sticking. Another good choice is to use stainless steel or glass bottles instead of plastic ones. \u201cChoose cosmetics that are free from endocrine disruptors such as parabens, benzophenone, triclosan, and phthalates,\u201d Gu\u0308il-Oumrait suggested. Consider the same for food, sunscreens, household cleaners and other everyday products encased in plastic. The EWG has several consumer databases that provides links to consumer products with fewer chemicals, including food scores, personal care products, sunscreen recommendations and a healthy living app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_how-to-move-better-wellness", "text": "Countless people seek emergency care for back pain, muscle strains and similar injuries resulting from \u201cmoving wrong\u201d during mundane, everyday tasks such as bending over to tie shoes, lifting objects or doing household chores. Even the most basic of human movement patterns \u2014 walking \u2014 can land you in the emergency room due to tripping or losing balance. Falls are one of the leading causes of emergency room visits, with more than 9 million logged annually. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 older adults report falling every year. These incidents highlight the importance of understanding proper movement mechanics to prevent avoidable harm. Read on for five essential strategies to correct improper movement patterns, enhance movement quality and minimize your risk of injury. What are \u2018wrong moves\u2019? The most significant way you can move wrong is by not moving enough.The clich\u00e9d saying \u201cmove it or lose it\u201d is sage wisdom. Human bodies are inherently designed for movement. Yet in our modern, sedentary lifestyles, we often neglect the importance of moving both regularly and well. The less we move, the less we can, and the more susceptible we are to hurting ourselves by moving in a way our body is not accustomed or intended. Understanding what constitutes right and wrong movement is crucial in preventing injury. The unique blueprint of the human body ensures the ability to move in all directions based on using the joints as they were designed. For example, certain joints, such as the hips and shoulders are ball and socket, enabling 360 degrees of rotation, while knees are hinge joints that have more limited mobility. Likewise, the middle of your spine, known as the thoracic spine, is designed for rotating, while the lower back or lumbar spine is not. Core muscles need to support and stabilize any carrying or lifting to avoid low-back stress. If you attempt to twist from your lumbar spine to get out of your car or ask your knees to compensate for a lack of hip mobility in your golf swing, you are moving wrong. Bending over to pet your cat without hinging from your hips and bending your knees or carrying heavy grocery bags without engaging your core to stabilize your spine are also examples of wrong moves. All these actions put unnecessary stress on your muscles, ligaments and joints. As you continue to adopt improper movement patterns, you not only increase your risk of injury but also compromise your body\u2019s functional performance long term. Editor\u2019s\u00a0note:\u00a0Consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Stop immediately if you experience pain. How to make the right moves Developing and maintaining proper movement patterns and training to enhance your movement quality are essential to enhance functional mobility so you can navigate your life pain- and injury-free. Here are five key strategies to make the right moves: 1. Master primary movement patterns Consider the movements required to function during daily life. To get to anything on the floor, you need to squat down and hinge from your hips. When you reach for something, you push your arm or arms forward. To open a door, you grasp the handle and pull back. You rotate to grab and latch your seat belt in the car, and you must stabilize through your core to sit, stand and walk. As such, the six generally accepted primary functional movements are squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling and rotating, as well as core stabilization. By mastering these patterns of bodyweight movements and regularly performing them with good form, you develop a strong foundation for safe and efficient movement in all aspects of life. 2. Practice moving in all planes of motion As you go through daily life, performing different variations of the primary movement patterns noted above, you are also moving your body forward, backward, side to side and twisting around. These directions cover what are known as the three planes of movement: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). It\u2019s important to incorporate intentional exercises within each of these planes into your training regimen. This comprehensive approach ensures that your body is prepared for the demands of all your daily activities and sports. 3. Train for better balance Adding balance training to your workouts will improve stability and proprioception (the ability to perceive the position of your limbs). This type of training helps you to better navigate uneven terrain and sudden changes in direction to reduce the risk of falls and injury. Unilateral exercises that focus on one side of the body at a time, such as single-leg Romanian dead lifts and lunging variations, challenge your neuromuscular system, enhancing coordination and spatial awareness. Because good balance is an essential part of moving well, you should incorporate some form of unilateral balance exercises into all your workouts. 4. Include strength training in your workouts Regular strength training builds more than muscle; it also increases bone density, joint stability, endurance, metabolism and overall durability. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends adults strength train two or more days per week. Aim to incorporate resistance exercises targeting different muscle groups through all the primary movement patterns using good form to ensure safe and effective strength development. Strong muscles support the joints in functional movement to reduce the risk of injury. 5. Cultivate your mind-body connection Another key to moving better and avoiding injury is to move with intention. While exercising, focus on your breath and what you\u2019re feeling to stay connected to your body\u2019s experience. By maintaining awareness of your body\u2019s movements and associated sensations, you can set a safe and effective foundation of mindfulness and focus on proper form during exercise. This mind-body connection enhances movement efficiency and reduces incidences of injury through unintentional \u201cwrong moves.\u201d Progressive muscle relaxation is a great exercise for cultivating your mind-body connection. I recommend practicing it several times per week. Are you ready to start moving better and safeguarding your physical fitness? Try the 10-minute single dumbbell workout featured at the top of this article, which incorporates all five strategies. Remember, injury prevention begins with understanding proper movement mechanics and consistently practicing functional movement patterns. Incorporating the five keys outlined above into your fitness routine and daily life can significantly improve your movement quality and reduce the risk of avoidable injuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/how-to-move-better-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness", "text": "Knee pain is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Whether it\u2019s due to past or current injury, arthritis or simply the wear and tear of aging, the discomfort can be debilitating. In most cases, proactive ways can help you soothe and strengthen your knees. As a mobility coach, I teach people how to use movement as medicine. In the case of knee pain, there\u2019s one simple yet effective exercise I favor to help alleviate pain and strengthen the muscles around your knees: the reverse lunge. Unlike traditional lunges, the reverse lunge is gentler on your joints. This lunge variation not only has the power to strengthen your knee function but also enhances overall lower body strength and stability. Read on to learn how incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness regimen can help you move past the pain and build a stronger foundation for knee health. Understanding your knee pain Knee pain is hard to ignore as it affects your ability to perform everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs and even sitting and standing. The knee joint is a complex structure made up of bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons, all working together to provide stability and movement. When any of these components are compromised, pain can ensue. It may be experienced as a constant or intermittent ache, throbbing or even stabbing pain that may or may not come with swelling. Common causes of knee pain include: \u2022\u00a0 Osteoarthritis: a degenerative joint disease that results in the breakdown of cartilage. \u2022\u00a0 Patellar tendinitis: inflammation of the tendons connecting the kneecap to the shinbone. \u2022\u00a0 Meniscus tears: injuries to the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee. \u2022\u00a0 Ligament injuries: tears or strains to any of the four main knee ligaments (ACL, MCL, PCL and LCL). \u2022\u00a0 Bursitis: Inflammation of the bursae, small sacs of fluid that cushion the knee joint. It\u2019s important to determine the cause of your knee pain before attempting any specific rehab plan. Addressing knee pain often requires a multifaceted approach that may include physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, medication and targeted exercises such as the reverse lunge. Before adding reverse lunges to your fitness regimen or beginning any new exercises or therapies, check with your doctor or other health care professionals you are seeing for help with your knees. Benefits of the reverse lunge The reverse lunge is a basic yet powerful exercise that strengthens the muscles around your knees, improves your core strength and enhances overall lower body strength, mobility and stability. Here are some key benefits: \u2022\u00a0 Reverse lunging strengthens muscles that support your knees. Building stabilizing muscles around the knee joints improves movement quality and reduces pain and injury risk. \u2022\u00a0 The dynamic movement of reverse lunging increases joint lubrication by stimulating the production of synovial fluid. Lubricating the knee joint reduces friction and promotes smoother, pain-free motion. \u2022\u00a0 Unlike forward lunging and other forward stepping exercises, the backward motion of reverse lunges puts less strain on the knees and emphasizes more stability, making them an ideal choice for individuals with knee pain. \u2022\u00a0 Practicing reverse lunges improves balance and stability. Because reverse lunges are unilateral, they are a balance training exercise that strengthens your core and stabilizing\u00a0 muscles to reduce the risk of injury by \u201cmoving wrong.\u201d \u2022\u00a0 They enhance mobility. Regularly practicing reverse lunges improves hip, knee and ankle mobility. \u2022\u00a0 They aid in functional activities. The movement mimics everyday activities, such as kneeling down to tie your shoes or picking something up off the floor. How to perform a reverse lunge Performing a reverse lunge correctly is crucial to reaping its benefits and avoiding injury. Follow these steps for proper form: 1.\u00a0 Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, shoulders relaxed, and arms at your sides or on your hips. Engage your core to maintain balance. 2.\u00a0 Take a step backward with your right foot, landing on the ball of your foot. Your left foot should remain in place, fully connected with the floor. 3.\u00a0 Bend both knees to lower your body until your left thigh is parallel to the ground and your right knee is either lightly touching or nearly touching the floor. 4.\u00a0 Keep most of your weight in your front foot and leg and ensure that your left knee is aligned over your left ankle, not pushed too far forward beyond your toes. 5.\u00a0 Maintain good upper-body posture with your shoulders back and chest open. Avoid leaning forward. 6.\u00a0You do not need to hold the lunge position for any specified length. Go at your own pace, returning to the starting position by pushing through your left heel to lift your body back to standing. Repeat the movement with the opposite leg. Aim for two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions on each leg, depending on your fitness level. Need to modify or want to progress? The intensity of reverse lunging can be varied to accommodate different fitness levels. Beginners or anyone struggling with balance should place one hand on a stable support, such as a chair or wall. For those wanting an advanced variation, hold dumbbells at your sides or a kettlebell at your chest or in one hand at your side or overhead to add resistance and increase the intensity. Use an appropriate weight for your fitness level and goals. To get the most out of practicing reverse lunges, keep these tips in mind: Consistency is key. Regular practice yields the best results. Aim to include reverse lunges in your routine at least two to three times per week. Focus on form. Quality over quantity. Proper form maximizes effectiveness while preventing injury. Listen to your body. If you experience any painful sensation beyond normal muscle fatigue, stop and reassess your form. Consult a health care professional if necessary. Knee pain doesn\u2019t have to sideline you from staying active and enjoying life. By incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness routine, you can take proactive steps toward healthier, pain-free knees. So, step back, lunge and move forward with stronger, more resilient knees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_dairy-cow-meat-bird-flu", "text": "Meat from a dairy cow that was culled from its herd and sent to slaughter has tested positive for traces of the H5N1 bird flu virus, the US Department of Agriculture announced Friday, but no meat from the cow entered the food supply. The USDA said viral particles of H5N1 were detected during testing of various tissues, including samples from the diaphragm muscle, which sits below the lungs. The testing was done as a standard part of the food inspection process, the USDA said. Infectious disease experts around the world have been on alert since the USDA announced March 25 that a dairy cow tested positive for H5N1 influenza. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic form of bird flu that scientists have watched closely since it was detected in 1996. It has decimated wild bird populations and poultry flocks but only sporadically infects humans. When it does, it can be fatal: About half of the roughly 900 people known to be infected around the world over the past two decades have died. In the past two years, the virus has changed and begun to infect a growing assortment of mammals. Experts never expected the virus to show up in cows, as it was thought that they didn\u2019t have the right receptors on their cells to catch A-strain flu viruses \u2013 but it turns out they do. In this outbreak, the virus has mostly been showing up in the milk of dairy cows and causing mastitis, or an infection of the mammary gland. Cows stop producing as much milk, but they generally recover after a few weeks. Two US farmworkers are known to have tested positive in conjunction with the ongoing dairy cow outbreak. In both cases, the virus infected their eyes, causing redness and swelling, but they recovered. Finding a cow that tested positive for H5N1 postmortem, after systemic disease, suggests that some sick animals are going undetected.\u00a0It also suggests that the owners may not have tested the animal before its slaughter and that other cows in the herd may be infected. The USDA said the dead cow tested positive for H5N1 on May 22.\u00a0It has notified the owners and is tracing the animal to the herd it came from to get more information, the agency said. The USDA says samples taken from\u00a095 other cows\u00a0that were culled and condemned for illness tested negative for the virus\u00a0as of May 22,\u00a0and testing is underway on about a dozen more samples.\u00a0The test the USDA used, which is called polymerase chain reaction testing or PCR, identified genetic material from H5N1 virus, but it could not determine whether that material was infectious and could have made someone sick. Earlier tests on samples of ground beef using a different virus as a stand-in for H5N1 found that the virus was killed when the burgers were cooked to at least\u00a0145 degrees Fahrenheit,\u00a0or medium.\u00a0Cooking burgers\u00a0to rare, a temperature of 120 degrees,\u00a0substantially reduced levels of active virus but did not kill it all.\u00a0The USDA already recommends that burgers be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees to kill dangerous pathogens such as salmonella and E. coli.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/dairy-cow-meat-bird-flu/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_bird-flu-wastewater-monitoring-texas", "text": "In early March, Dr. Blake Hanson and his colleagues at the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute were preparing for a fire drill of sorts. What if a virus with the potential to spark the next pandemic turned up in the wastewater they monitor?\u00a0And what if that virus was the bird flu, H5N1, which has killed millions of animals and about half the nearly 900 people it has infected worldwide over the past two decades? They gamed out this what-if exercise on a Monday.\u00a0By Thursday of that same week, Hanson\u2019s colleague, Dr. Michael Tisza, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was ringing the alarm. This time, it was not a drill. \u201cMike had called me and said, \u2018Hey, I think I found it,\u2019\u201d said Hanson, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston who uses big data methods and genomics to investigate infectious diseases. That was March 7, about three weeks before the US Department of Agriculture announced that H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas for the first time. A different kind of wastewater monitoring Over the past two years, as the idea of sampling sewer systems for the virus that causes Covid-19 and other pathogens has caught on across the country, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute \u2014 or TEPHI \u2014 took a different approach. Rather than looking only for specific viruses, researchers there decided to use advanced techniques and computers to help sift through the vast soup of genetic material in their wastewater samples.\u00a0By doing this, they\u2019re able to find viruses they expect to see as well as ones they don\u2019t know to look for. \u201cWe can capture every known virus that that\u2019s in the sample, and then the computational team will analyze the data comprehensively and see signals for many viruses, and that\u2019s the benefit, I think, of what we\u2019re doing relative to other sites,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Maresso, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who envisioned the system. At least two other organizations have also been looking for signs of H5N1 in wastewater. The WastewaterSCAN network, which is directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory Universities and Verily, recently posted a preprint study showing that it could detect the H5N1 virus in wastewater by looking for one specific part of the virus. In addition to that early data, the team has since tested three additional sewer systems: one in North Carolina near a known H5N1 cattle outbreak, one in a California city that was having an unseasonably high number of human influenza A cases and one in a city in Hawaii where there are no dairy processing plants and no known cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In each case, the test correctly ruled in or out H5N1 infections. It was so successful that WastewaterSCAN plans to start using the test at all 190 wastewater sites it monitors. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently launched a dashboard showing sites where influenza A viruses are being detected at unusually high levels. H5N1 is an A strain of the flu virus, like some types of seasonal flu.\u00a0Detecting A strains now, in the offseason, is a reasonable proxy for H5N1, Maresso said, but it will be a less useful approach when seasonal influenza picks up again in the winter. TEPHI\u2019s system, on the other hand, could serve as a first alert for new viruses, the holy grail of pandemic prevention.\u00a0Since the team started monitoring in 2022, they have found over 400 viruses in Texas wastewater. Data at the flush of a toilet Unlike taking a swab of a person\u2019s \u2014 or a cow\u2019s \u2013\u2014bodily secretions, wastewater monitoring is passive and doesn\u2019t depend on getting permission to test or having a person come into a clinic or emergency room, care that may be out of reach for farmworkers.\u00a0Researchers get data every time someone flushes a toilet or perhaps when wastewater systems treat agricultural waste, such as the permitted disposal of discarded milk.  The biggest drawback of wastewater monitoring is that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the pathogen. Since March 4, the date of the sample in which H5N1 was first detected by the TEPHI group, the researchers have found it all over the state, in the wastewater of nine cities in Texas and in 19 of the 23 sites they monitor.\u00a0They did not name the cities they tested in the study but said they did notify local public health authorities and the CDC about their results. Their findings were published recently as a preprint study, ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. Source of the signal is still a mystery \u201cWe don\u2019t really know where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d said Dr. Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHouston School of Public Health and director of TEPHI. \u201cWe can all guess, and some people have their favorite ideas,\u201d he said, noting that Texas is in the path of two major flyways for migratory birds and has a large agricultural industry that includes farmed birds and cows. But H5N1 has been tearing through wild and commercially farmed bird flocks in the US since 2022, when the team started monitoring wastewater, and they haven\u2019t seen it in any of their samples until now. \u201cCertainly, something that\u2019s different now,\u201d Tisza said, \u201cis that it\u2019s commonly infecting dairy cows.\u201d Only one person has tested positive for H5N1 in connection with the cattle outbreak.\u00a0That person, a farm worker who had close contact with infected cows and developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or redness and swelling of the eyes, but no breathing problems or congestion.\u00a0He was treated with antiviral medications and has recovered, public health officials said. The CDC says the current risk to public health is low, but it\u2019s keeping a close eye on the situation. The FDA recently tested 297 samples of dairy products purchased at grocery stores across the country. In expanded test results released Monday, the agency said, it found samples that were positive for dead fragments of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 15 of the 38 states where products were processed. About 1 out of every 5 samples had some traces of the virus, indicating that the outbreak might be more widespread than previously known. TEPHI\u2019s Maresso says they can\u2019t rule out that what they are seeing is virus from milk that\u2019s been poured down the drain or even asymptomatic human infections.\u00a0He notes that they are not seeing an increase in flu cases in hospitals, which would alert them to severe infections. \u201cIt would be maybe a more easily solvable puzzle if it was just one or two sites and we had some dairy or other processing plants right near that that plant where we\u2019re sampling from. It would explain things. but we have essentially detected the signal on in nearly every site and certainly every city to this point,\u201d Maresso said \u2013 even big cities in the state that aren\u2019t near dairy farms. As far as the direction of the Texas outbreak, whether it\u2019s getting worse or going away, Tisza says, it\u2019s hard to say.\u00a0At first, he said, some cities his group monitors had a signal from H5N1 that was as strong as the one they see from seasonal influenza over the winter. \u201cBut overall, it\u2019s been only maybe about 25 percent of that signal,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as the overall trajectory, it\u2019s really kind of at a plateau right now. Not spiking up, not going away. So that in and of itself is interesting,\u201d said Tisza, who notes that they\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear from us again if there\u2019s a big spike.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/bird-flu-wastewater-monitoring-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_thomas-midgley-jr-leaded-gas-freon-scn", "text": "Facing a crowd of journalists, inventor Thomas Midgley Jr. poured a lead additive over his hands and then proceeded to inhale its fumes for about a minute. Unfazed, he said, \u201cI could do this every day without getting any health problems whatsoever.\u201d Soon afterward, Midgley needed medical treatment. But the act would have dire consequences beyond his own well-being. The year was 1924, and Midgley, then a chemical engineer for General Motors, had pulled the stunt to support his most recent, lucrative finding: a lead compound called tetraethyl lead. Added to gasoline, it solved one of the biggest problems the automotive industry faced at the time \u2014 engine knocking, or tiny explosions in car engines due to the low quality of gasoline that resulted in an annoying sound and potential damage. Lead helped, but at great expense, because the substance is highly toxic to humans, especially children. Midgley would go on to leave his mark in history with another destructive invention, also a solution to a problem: the need to replace the noxious and flammable gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning. He found that CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, were an ideal substitute and harmless to humans. However, they turned out to be deadly to the ozone in the atmosphere, which blocks dangerous ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancers and other health problems, as well as harming plants and animals. One hundred years after that stunt before the press in 1924, the planet is still recovering from the ill effects of both of Midgley\u2019s inventions. The ozone layer will need another four decades to heal fully, and because leaded gasoline was still sold in parts of the world until 2021, many continue to live with the long-term effects of lead poisoning. Yet Midgley \u2014 whose story will be told in an upcoming movie developed by the writer of the 2013 film \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d \u2014 was hailed as a hero for decades. An inventor from his early days Born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, in 1889, Midgley had a penchant for finding useful applications for known substances early on.\u00a0In high school, he used the chewed bark of the slippery elm trees to give baseballs a more curved trajectory, a practice professional players would later pick up. He was known to carry with him at all times a copy of the periodic table, his main tool in the search for the substance that would mark his breakthrough invention. The task of addressing the issue of engine knocking fell to Midgley while he was working at General Motors in 1916. \u201cIt was the dawn of the automobile era in the United States, and Ford had developed the Model T, which was not very powerful,\u201d said Gerald Markowitz, a history professor at the City University of New York. \u201cGM joined with Standard Oil and DuPont to try to develop more powerful engines, and in order to do that they needed to solve the problem of the engines knocking with the fuel that they had at the time.\u201d Under the direction of Charles Kettering, another influential American inventor and head of research at GM, Midgley worked his way through thousands of substances \u2014 including arsenic, sulfur and silicon \u2014 in a quest to find one that reduced knocking when added to gasoline. He eventually landed on tetraethyl lead, a lead derivative that was marketed simply as Ethyl. Leaded gasoline first went on sale in Dayton, Ohio, in 1923 and eventually spread throughout the world. Lead is highly poisonous, with no safe level of exposure, and can impair development in children, causing decreased intelligence and behavioral disorders, according to UNICEF. An estimated 1 million people a year still die from lead poisoning, according to the World Health Organization. The toxicity of lead was already well-known when Midgley added it to gas, but that didn\u2019t stop Ethyl from becoming a commercial success. \u201cThere were alarms that were raised, because lead was known as a toxin,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cBut the position of the industry was that there was no proof that lead coming out of the tailpipes of cars was going to injure people. And it was that lack of proof that ultimately led the surgeon general not to take action after a public health conference in 1925.\u201d However, workers in Ethyl manufacturing quickly experienced ill effects. \u201cIt was really the fact that the people working in the labs producing tetraethyl lead were getting sick that created a crisis,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cThey would literally go insane as a result of their exposure to lead.\u201d Midgley went as far as pouring Ethyl over his hands and inhaling it during that 1924 news conference in an attempt to quench fears. But in reality, he was also getting poisoned. \u201cHe definitely wrote in a letter in January of 1923 that he had a touch of lead poisoning, and he did have lead poisoning for the rest of his life,\u201d said Bill Kovarik, a professor of communication at Radford University in Virginia. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really go away when you get that much lead in your body. It is a serious, long-term disability.\u201d Punching a hole Just years after the invention of Ethyl, Midgley \u2014 again spurred by Kettering \u2014 turned his attention to developing a nontoxic, nonflammable alternative to refrigerant gases such as ammonia, which were used in appliances and air conditioners at the time, leading to a series of fatal accidents in the 1920s. He came up with Freon \u2014 a derivative of methane, composed of carbon, chlorine and fluorine atoms \u2014 the first CFC. In another public demonstration, in 1930, Midgley inhaled the gas and blew out a candle with it, a move designed to show its safety. Freon, as well as subsequent CFCs, became commercial successes, and made air conditioning adoption shoot up in the United States. After World War II, manufacturers started routinely using CFCs as propellants for all sorts of products, including insecticides and hair spray. It was the mid-1970s, three decades after Midgley\u2019s death, before the damage from his two inventions became publicly known. CFCs had punched a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica; if left unchecked, the hole would have expanded to the point of eventually threatening all life on Earth. As a result of continued industry pressure, leaded gasoline was not phased out in the United States until 1996 and slowly thereafter throughout the world. The last nation to get rid of it, Algeria, still sold it until 2021, and lead additives continue to be used in aviation fuel. A 2022 study estimated that half of the current US population had been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in early childhood, but the damage to the world\u2019s collective health is harder to quantify. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed to phase out CFCs from 1989 until 2010, after which they were banned. (CFC emissions have been rising again recently, a sign that they may still be produced illegally.) The hole in the ozone layer is on the mend and will likely heal in the next half\u2013century in a rare environmental win. \u201cThe very sad truth is that we don\u2019t know especially the number of children who have been adversely affected,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cThere is no safe level of lead in a child\u2019s body. We\u2019re talking tens of millions of children, hundreds of millions of children over a half-century or more that have been affected adversely, their life chances diminished from lead dust as a result of the exhaust gases that got into the ground or into the streets.\u201d A tragic death Midgley\u2019s life ended under tragic circumstances. After contracting polio in 1940, he became severely disabled and devised yet another invention: a machine that would lift him out of bed and into a wheelchair autonomously, via strings and pulleys. But on November 2, 1944, he became entangled in the machine and died of strangulation. For a long time, it was believed to have been the ultimate irony \u2014 the inventor dying by his own invention. But the reality may be even darker, according to Kovarik. \u201cThe official cause of death was suicide,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had a tremendous sense of guilt. The industry told him he was brilliant. But he did stuff that in hindsight was pretty irresponsible. The lead poisoning could have contributed to his psychosis.\u201d Midgley received several awards and honors in the late stages of his life. The Society of Chemical Industry awarded him the Perkin Medal in 1937; the American Chemical Society gave him the Priestley Medal in 1941 and elected him as president in the year of his death. A biographical memoir from the National Academy of Sciences, written by his mentor Kettering in 1947, contains nothing but praise and ends by saying that Midgley left behind \u201ca great heritage to the world from a busy, a diversified, and a highly creative life.\u201d History has other examples of inventions that turned out to be unwittingly deadly, such as TNT, which was originally developed for use as a yellow dye and not used as an explosive until decades later. Midgley is unique in having developed two such inventions, but although it\u2019s tempting to see him as an environmental villain, experts say his role was more akin to a cog in the machine. \u201cHe was just an employee,\u201d Kovarik said. Markowitz agrees. \u201cThis was corporate-sponsored research,\u201d he said. \u201cHad it not been Midgley, I\u2019m sure it would have been somebody else who would have come up with these solutions.\u201d Striving for growth and innovation at all costs was reflective of the conception of progress in the first half of the 20th century, Markowitz added. \u201cOnly with the environmental movement that started in the 1960s and 1970s did we begin to consider what the consequences of technological progress could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has had a really sobering effect, but up through the 1950s there were very few voices questioning the idea that progress was our most important product.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/thomas-midgley-jr-leaded-gas-freon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_ozempic-benefits-diabetic-kidney-disease", "text": "Weekly injections of semaglutide medications like Ozempic significantly reduce the risk of serious kidney outcomes, major cardiovascular events and death among people who have type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, according to a new study. Diabetes is a key risk factor for kidney disease, which is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide; about 1 in 3 people with diabetes also has chronic kidney disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But new research shows that weekly injections of semaglutide cut the risk of severe outcomes from diabetic kidney disease by about 24%. These severe outcomes \u2013 including significant loss of kidney function, kidney failure and death from kidney or cardiovascular causes \u2013 occurred 331 times among trial participants who were treated with semaglutide, compared with 410 events among those who received the placebo. When scaled by the number of years each person was in the trial, there were 5.8 events for every 100 years of follow-up among those taking semaglutide, compared with 7.5 events for every 100 years of follow-up among those who received the placebo. High sugar levels in the blood of people with diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the kidneys, and this can also cause strain on the heart. The new study found even broader related benefits of semaglutide treatment among people with diabetic kidney disease. Kidney function declined more slowly overall, the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack was 18% lower and the risk of death from any cause was 20% lower among people who were treated with semaglutide compared with those who received the placebo, the research found. The study, published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Renal Association Congress, is based on the results of a drug trial conducted among about 3,500 people across 28 countries who were living with both type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. About half of the participants received weekly 1-milligram injections of semaglutide \u2013 the dose approved to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic in the US \u2013 and the others got a placebo treatment. Overall, the study participants were followed for an average of about 3\u00bd years. The trial was initially expected to last about four or five years, but findings at the midpoint check-in were so promising that an independent monitoring committee recommended that it end early. \u201cIn this trial, we\u2019re able to show benefits that highlight how transforming semaglutide can be for people with diabetes and kidney disease,\u201d said Dr. Vlado Perkovic, a nephrologist and provost at the the University of New South Wales Sydney. He chairs the trial\u2019s steering committee and was lead author of the new study. \u201cThe effect size was a bit larger than we had expected, and therefore, the results were highly statistically significant. So the likelihood of this being a chance finding is infinitesimally small, and I think we can be highly confident that the results are robust and real.\u201d Three other drug treatments have been shown to provide benefits for people with diabetic kidney disease, and the researchers note in the new study that \u201cclinicians and patients will need to consider the order and priority of use for semaglutide.\u201d A combination of therapies could be important, and many of the trial participants were also receiving some other type of treatment for their diabetes. \u201cSemaglutide showed some benefits on top of what is currently considered standard of care,\u201d said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development for Novo Nordisk. The Danish company is the only drug manufacturer with semaglutide products that are approved for use in the US \u2013 Ozempic for treatment of diabetes and Wegovy for treatment of obesity \u2013 and it funded the new study. Similar benefits were found across all levels of starting kidney function, but there was a particular focus on those at highest risk. More than two-thirds of trial participants were considered to be at very high risk of severe outcomes including kidney failure, cardiovascular events or death, according to risk calculators outlined in global clinical practice guidelines. In part, focusing on this high-risk group offers clearer insight into the benefits of treatment. But, experts say, many people also don\u2019t realize they have kidney disease until it has reached later stages \u2013 and many don\u2019t realize just how dangerous it can be. During each year of this trial, about 8% of the participants had a major kidney event, and almost 5% of people died. \u201cKidney disease attributed to diabetes, or diabetic kidney disease, is one of the most common and deadly complications of diabetes. Yet, unfortunately, there\u2019s very low awareness around it,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Tuttle, chair of the Diabetic Kidney Disease Collaborative for the American Society of Nephrology. She is also the executive director for research at Providence Inland Northwest Health, an investigator with the Institute of Translational Health Sciences and professor of medicine at the University of Washington. \u201cPart of the problem is that the condition is asymptomatic until late stages, so physicians and patients have to be very intentional about identifying kidney disease.\u201d It\u2019s recommended that people with diabetes get tested for kidney disease every six months with blood or urine tests. But this doesn\u2019t always happen, and some people wait until they have symptoms such as fatigue, swelling or changes in urination frequency. Diabetes treatments are in high demand because it\u2019s such a common disease, said Tuttle, who was also part of the new research. But semaglutide is so promising because it seems to have benefits that apply to multiple complications that can arise because of it. In addition to lowering blood sugar, semaglutide products have been shown to help with weight loss, heart failure and potentially curbing addictive behaviors. \u201cI think these drugs that affect multiple final common pathways are really highly effective because when we try to just treat one risk factor, it\u2019s almost like putting your finger in the dike. You can\u2019t plug all the holes. To me, what semaglutide really does is, it addresses a broad spectrum of risk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does reduce weight, it does lower glucose in does lower blood pressure a little bit, and then we think on top of that, it has the direct effects on the kidney. It\u2019s really the whole package.\u201d There are significant disparities in diabetes prevalence and kidney disease in the US. Black, Hispanic and American Indian adults are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes than White adults, according to CDC data. And Black people in the US are about three times more likely to have kidney failure than White adults. However, most of the participants in the semaglutide trial were White, and the findings could not be assessed among important subgroups. \u201cWhen we have something that\u2019s effective, we also have to turn our sights to getting treatments to patients,\u201d Tuttle said. But many of the highest-risk people who could benefit most from treatment don\u2019t have access to it. \u201cNow, we have a highly effective therapy that reduces things that really matter to patients, families and communities: keeping their kidney function, preserving life and reducing the rates of cardiovascular events. But that\u2019s all great only if people get the treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cSo now, really, the challenge before all of us is to move much more expeditiously from evidence generation to implementation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/ozempic-benefits-diabetic-kidney-disease/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}

If you\u2019re unlucky, maybe you found one already burrowing into your skin, engorged with your blood. Ticks are parasitic bloodsuckers, capable of spreading deadly disease, and they\u2019re becoming increasingly common. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. Ticks 101 Ticks are arachnids, close cousins of mites and more distant cousins of spiders. There are\u00a0more than 800 species of ticks found around the world, and 84 that have been documented in the United States. However, only a handful in the US bite and transmit diseases to humans. The most common ones are blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks, but they feed on lots of animals besides deer), lone star ticks, American dog ticks and brown dog ticks. After a tick egg hatches, it goes through three life stages: larva, nymph and adult. Both male and female ticks feed on blood by inserting their barbed, straw-like mouthparts into the skin of their host (unlike mosquitoes, which only bite if they\u2019re females preparing to lay eggs). However, only female ticks drink to the point that they become engorged. \u201cWhen you see a super big and engorged female, that means she\u2019s going to be laying eggs and starting that life cycle process over again,\u201d said Kait Chapman, an extension educator and urban entomologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These arachnids change dramatically in size and appearance based on how old they are and how much blood they\u2019ve drunk. \u201cThe nymph blacklegged tick, if you put these unfed ones on a poppy seed bagel, they blend in quite nicely,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island and director of that school\u2019s Center for Vector-Borne Disease and its TickEncounter Resource Center. Meanwhile, an engorged adult female of the same species can swell to the size of a pea. Tick bites and diseases While there are some months when different species and life stages are more active, it\u2019s possible to get bitten by a tick any time of year. If you find a tick attached to you (or your pet), you should remove it carefully. \u201cThe recommendation is that you use a pair of tweezers, get the tick by its head as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to twist, because we could leave part of that mouthpart embedded in the skin. And we don\u2019t want to grab the body because if you squeeze the body the tick could regurgitate more, which means that you\u2019re increasing your chance of getting tick-borne illness.\u201d Your impulse might be to squash the freshly removed tick, but it\u2019s better if you drown it with hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol and keep it to show to an expert or at least take a photo. That way, you can identify what kind of tick it is and how long it\u2019s been feeding; the University of Rhode Island\u2019s\u00a0TickEncounter website has tools\u00a0based on coloration, size and geographic location. It\u2019s important to identify the tick because certain species carry different diseases. They pick up bacteria, viruses and other microbes from the blood of infected hosts, and when they bite a new victim, they can pass those pathogens along. Blacklegged tick larvae and nymphs, for instance, often feed on white-footed mice,\u00a0which can carry a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. When a tick that\u2019s fed on one of these infected mice then feeds on a human, it can pass along that bacterium, which causes Lyme disease. Lone star ticks, on the other hand, don\u2019t feed on white-footed mice and consequently aren\u2019t carriers of Lyme. (They do carry other disease-causing microbes, though, and their bites can introduce a sugar molecule into the bloodstream that\u00a0makes people allergic to red meat.) In\u00a0a September 2023 study, researchers identified a protein that appears to play a big part in how some ticks \u2014 including the deer tick and the Western blacklegged tick \u2014 get infected by the harmful bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum before spreading it to human hosts and causing anaplasmosis, which is different from Lyme disease. Anaplasmosis can cause severe headaches, fever and chills, vomiting, and fatigue,\u00a0according to Cedars-Sinai. Understanding this protein may give scientists a better sense of how to stop the spread of the disease through ticks, the study said. But there is still a lot of research ahead before they get there. Preventing tick bites The diseases carried by ticks can be debilitating or even life-threatening, and the risk of infection increases the longer a tick has been on you. While there are some treatments available, it\u2019s best to avoid getting bitten in the first place. Various studies have suggested factors that could play a role in tick attraction, including a recent paper showing a\u00a0connection between tick attraction and static electricity\u00a0in a laboratory setting. And while ticks are attracted to cues such as the carbon dioxide exhaled by animals, they tend to lie in wait rather than actively seeking out their prey. \u201cContrary to popular belief, they don\u2019t fall from trees. They simply sit at the edge of a tall blade of grass, for example, that\u2019s maybe hanging over someplace, and they\u2019ll put their front leg out. We call that questing,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey will wait for that host to brush right by them, and so that\u2019s primarily how people get ticks: They brush by it; it attaches to their leg or their clothes.\u201d Insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus have been\u00a0approved by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0to protect against ticks. However, these chemicals work differently against ticks than they do against mosquitoes. For instance, DEET \u201cburns the feet of ticks, and they fall off because their feet are burning,\u201d as opposed to interfering with the tick\u2019s ability to find its prey the way DEET affects mosquitoes, Mather said. What\u2019s more, \u201cas soon as the product is dried, it doesn\u2019t burn as much, so it really doesn\u2019t last very long for ticks.\u201d Instead, Chapman recommends preventing tick bites by covering your skin and tucking the bottoms of your pants into your socks. Ticks also are killed by half an hour in the dryer, so toss your clothes in as soon as you get home, even before you wash them. What\u2019s more, \u201cwe favor\u00a0wearing treated clothes with permethrin\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s far, far more effective\u201d than bug spray, Mather said. \u201cIt blocks nerve conduction in ticks, and it makes them hyper-excited and then they just lose function pretty quickly, and it actually ends up killing them.\u201d Depending on where you live, he said, it might also make sense to investigate exterminating ticks living in your yard. These precautions might seem extreme, but to Mather, they\u2019re the way of the future, because \u201cwe live in a \u2018more ticks in more places\u2019 world, and more people are being exposed.\u201d Climate change may play some role\u00a0in the spread of ticks, but Mather said he believes that the influx of the parasites has more to do with white-tailed deer becoming more common in areas where higher densities of people live. As a result, he said, \u201cMore people are being exposed to the ticks that are reproducing on white-tailed deer.\u201d Despite the spread of ticks and the severity of illnesses that they can cause, Chapman stressed that with proper precautions (for you and your pets \u2014 ask your vet for tick preventatives), they shouldn\u2019t hold you hostage inside your home. \u201cYes, ticks exist. Yes, they can be a public health concern, but we don\u2019t want you to let ticks keep you indoors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should still be able to go outside and enjoy nature, but you just have to, once again, perform those tick checks. So take a little bit of time. Do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness", "text": "Eating a vegan, vegetarian or lacto-ovo vegetarian diet significantly reduces the overall risk of developing cancer, heart disease and dying early from cardiovascular disease, according to a new \u201cumbrella\u201d analysis of more than 20 years of research. An umbrella review looks at existing metanalyses of large numbers of studies, providing a high-level view of existing research on a topic. In addition to lowering cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, the umbrella analysis found a \u201cprotective effect\u201d for specific cancers, including \u201cliver, colon, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, melanoma, kidney and non-Hodgkin lymphoma,\u201d said lead author Dr. Angelo Capodici, a graduate student in health science, technology and management at Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna in Pisa, Italy. Vegetarians don\u2019t eat any animal flesh, while the lacto-ovo version of vegetarianism allows dairy products and eggs while excluding all meat, poultry and fish. Veganism, the stricter form of vegetarianism, bans any food products made from meat, poultry and seafood as well as any animal by-products such as gelatin. However, the protective nature of the diets could be sabotaged if poor dietary choices were made, the study authors said via email. \u201cDiets that emphasize consumption of unhealthy plant foods, such as fruit juices, refined grains, potato chips, and even sodas\u201d might counter the positives of a plant-based diet for health, said study coauthor Dr. Federica Guaraldi, medical director of the pituitary unit at the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna in Italy. Fruit juices, which are \u201cfull of sugars or sweetener,\u201d Guaraldi said, \u201c(were) recently demonstrated to have detrimental impact on metabolism as much as or even more than white sugar.\u201d Results may be affected by other lifestyle factors Researchers have long known that people who follow plant-based diets often live healthier lives full of exercise and an avoidance of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains, snacks, alcohol and tobacco, the study said. \u201cWhat is attributed to diet here may be in part due to other lifestyle practices,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThat is a minor concern, however,\u201d Katz said in an email. \u201cThe net effect of plant-predominant dietary patterns is clearly favorable to crucial health outcomes even if some of the observed benefit is attributable to other lifestyle practices.\u201d In fact, adopting a plant-based diet, even without additional exercise, could still yield health benefits, according to a November study on twins by Christopher Gardner, one of the coauthors of the umbrella analysis published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. In the 2023 study, healthy twins who ate a vegan diet for eight weeks had lower \u201cbad\u201d\u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, better\u00a0blood sugar levels and\u00a0greater weight loss\u00a0than siblings who ate a diet of meat and vegetables, according to Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in Palo Alto, California. \u201cThere was a 10% to 15% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 25% drop in insulin, and a 3% drop in body weight in just eight weeks, all by eating real food without animal products,\u201d Gardner told CNN at the time. One reason for that may be the nutritional boost that plants provide, including high levels of vitamins, minerals and other substances with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, while also reducing the inflammatory impact of meat and processed food, the authors said. \u201cPlants have more fiber (animal foods have zero), less saturated fat and zero cholesterol (all animal foods have cholesterol),\u201d Gardner said in an email. \u201cAn entirely separate category is phytochemicals (literally, \u2018plant chemicals\u2019) such as antioxidants. By definition there are no phytochemicals in animal foods.\u201d No meat, poultry or seafood, but dairy and eggs are OK The new review analyzed 48 metanalyses that had investigated the impact of eating a vegetarian or vegan diet on the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease and early death. \u201cWe analyzed reviews considering\u00a0vegan and vegetarian diets that completely exclude(ed) meat, poultry and seafood,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Davide Gori, an associate professor of biomedical and neuromotor sciences at the University of Bologna in Italy. \u201cTo be more precise regarding vegetarian diets, lacto-vegetarian (allowing certain dairy products such as yogurt, cheese and milk), ovo-vegetarian (allowing whole eggs, egg whites and egg-containing foods such as mayonnaise, egg noodles and certain baked goods), (and) lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets were included,\u201d Gori said in an email. However, vegetarian diets limiting but not completely excluding certain types of meat and fish, such as pesco- or pollo-vegetarian diets, were excluded, he said. The review found eating these plant-based diets reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and inflammation by affecting risk factors such as body mass index, fasting glucose and other measures of blood sugar control, and the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) measurements of blood pressure. The diets also significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and \u201cC-reactive protein \u2014 an index of inflammation that is typically higher in cardiovascular and metabolic disease,\u201d Gori said. Metabolic disease is a constellation of symptoms such as obesity, high blood pressure and poor control of cholesterol and blood sugars that can all lead to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. However, there was no benefit in eating plants for pregnant women, an \u201cintriguing finding\u201d that needs further research, said Guaraldi of the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences. It\u2019s also possible that the hormones of pregnancy might affect findings, and \u201cwe cannot rule out that participants have taken supplements during the study period that could have altered the impact of diet on the considered parameters.\u201d Special considerations of plant-based diets Because certain vitamin and minerals are more easily found and absorbed from meat, dairy or fish, vegetarians and vegans must take extra precautions to add those into their diets, experts say. Unless the diet is carefully optimized, additional sources of B12, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin D may be needed to avoid a deficiency, according to the Mayo Clinic. \u201cStrictly vegan diets can be deficient in vitamin B12,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThis is easily resolved by consuming foods fortified with (vitamin) B12 \u2014 easy to do because the recommended daily allowance for B12 is lower than any other vitamin or mineral. \u201cIron is another nutrient that is harder to get from a fully vegan diet,\u201d Gardner added. \u201cMany plant foods are relatively high in iron (beans/legumes). Again, supplements can be helpful.\u201d Protein is also a challenge, but good sources in plants include legumes such as lentils, chickpeas and beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains and soy products such as edamame, tempeh and tofu. Processed meat substitutes are options as well, experts say, but due to the processing can be packed with sodium, so read labels carefully.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_hiv-breastfeeding-recommendations-aap", "text": "Each time LaTonya looks at framed photos of herself breastfeeding her baby son for the first time, she swells with emotion. As a mother living with HIV in Colorado, it was a moment she wanted to commemorate. \u201cThat\u2019s how important it was to me to be able to breastfeed,\u201d LaTonya said about the photos. \u201cSo, I wanted to make sure we had that forever.\u201d For the first time, the American Academy of Pediatrics has changed its position to say people with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, can breastfeed their infants with \u201cvery low\u201d risk if they follow certain guidelines with support from their medical care team. Avoiding breastfeeding is the only option with zero risk for HIV transmission, but going forward, pediatricians should offer support and counseling for women who wish to breastfeed, who are receiving antiretroviral treatment, known as ART, as prescribed and who are maintaining an undetectable amount of virus in the body, according to a new clinical report from AAP that was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. Previously, the academy recommended that mothers with HIV in the United States not breastfeed their infants, regardless of their viral load and antiretroviral therapy use. Recommendations against breastfeeding for people with HIV date to about 1985, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that women with HIV infection avoid breastfeeding. \u201cThe AAP recommends that for people with HIV in the United States, replacement feeding (with formula or certified, banked donor human milk) is the only option that is 100% certain to prevent postnatal transmission of HIV,\u201d the new report says. \u201cHowever, pediatric health care professionals should be prepared to provide infant feeding counseling and a family-centered, culturally sensitive, harm reduction approach for people with HIV on ART with sustained viral suppression who desire to breastfeed.\u201d HIV is a virus that attacks the body\u2019s immune system, and if not treated, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. LaTonya has been living with HIV for about 20 years, she said, but as soon as she gave birth to her son, she knew that she wanted to breastfeed because of the health benefits breastfeeding has for infants, including being associated with a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes and sudden infant death syndrome. \u201cBeing a mom is absolutely amazing. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world,\u201d LaTonya said, adding that every parent desires to give their child \u201cthe best shot\u201d at being the best person that they can be. \u201cI feel like breastfeeding was a step towards me being able to provide that for him,\u201d she said of her son. After she talked talking about her decision with her doctors, they developed a plan for her to breastfeed since her viral load is undetectable and she is taking antiretroviral medications. They discussed \u201cconstant monitoring of viral loads\u201d to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a spike\u00a0in her viral load and that \u201ccomplete adherence to medication was essential,\u201d LaTonya said. CNN is not publishing her full name to protect her medical privacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s essential for people to understand the science behind it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re undetectable, you cannot transmit it to your partner. It\u2019s essential for people to understand that, as well as, if you\u2019re adhering to your medication, that it\u2019s not going to transfer through the breast milk to your child. And so therefore, why deprive your child of \u2026 having that benefit?\u201d \u2018This has been a long evolution\u2019 Although HIV can be passed to infants through breastfeeding, research has shown that the use of antiretroviral drugs can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission, and these medicines are found to be safe during breastfeeding. In the absence of the mother taking ART or the infant taking preventive antiretrovirals, the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk appears to be highest in the baby\u2019s first four to six weeks of life, ranging between 5% and 6%, according to the AAP report. But the risk is \u201cestimated to be less than 1%\u201d if the mother is taking antiretroviral medications and the virus is suppressed in her body, meaning there is no detectable viral load, the report said. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is that the AAP for the first time is explicitly saying that pregnant people with HIV who are on treatment and undetectable can be supported to breastfeed,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Abuogi, lead author of the report and a pediatrician in Colorado who works with people with HIV during their pregnancies. \u201cThis has been a long evolution, and people living with HIV have been a part of advocating for this change,\u201d Abuogi said. \u201cSome women feel shame or distress or feel like they\u2019re not fulfilling their role as a mother if they can\u2019t breastfeed, and some are really worried that that discloses their HIV status in their community \u2014 if breastfeeding is the norm and you have to explain why you\u2019re not doing it.\u201d It\u2019s estimated that about 5,000 people with HIV give birth in the United States each year. \u201cSo having the opportunity to offer women the choice, as all women have, and to support their decision is really empowering,\u201d Abuogi said. \u201cPeople living with HIV should have all of the same infant-feeding options as anyone else, and we\u2019re really working to make that a safe decision for women.\u201d Last year, an advisory panel to the US Department of Health and Human Services made similar updates to its recommendations around infant-feeding, saying that \u201cindividuals with HIV who are on ART with a sustained undetectable viral load and who choose to breastfeed should be supported in this decision.\u201d The new AAP position now aligns with those updated recommendations from the HHS panel, said Dr. Rana\u00a0Chakraborty,\u00a0a pediatric infectious disease specialist and researcher\u00a0at\u00a0Mayo Clinic\u00a0in Minnesota, who is a\u00a0member of HHS\u2019  Panel on Treatment of\u00a0HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s been under discussion for a few years now. It began with the Department of Health and Human Services panel, and I think the authors of this report from the AAP have really summarized very nicely the current\u00a0national guidelines\u00a0in the US,\u201d said Chakraborty, who was not involved in the new AAP report. \u201cA number of investigators, including many from the US working in relatively resource-limited settings, were\u00a0previously\u00a0able to demonstrate that\u00a0breastfeeding\u00a0could be\u00a0undertaken\u00a0safely if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and maintains undetectable HIV viral loads \u2014 in other words, the amount of virus in one drop of blood needs to be less than 50 copies per milliliter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the US, this is\u00a0also doable. But\u00a0breastfeeding during\u00a0maternal HIV infection\u00a0does need a\u00a0supporting\u00a0multidisciplinary team of providers to make sure that this can be done safely for\u00a0both\u00a0mom and baby.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re seeing a consensus\u2019 The AAP recommendations signal that there is now a consensus among leading medical groups that mothers living with HIV can be supported and counseled in safely breastfeeding their babies, said Dr. Elaine Abrams, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, who has treated people living with HIV during their pregnancies and postpartum but was not involved in the new AAP report. \u201cAll of the bodies that provide guidelines to clinicians are now saying the same thing. We\u2019re seeing a consensus, and the consensus also puts the mother right up-front central in the conversation and decision-making,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s moved away from telling her what to do, to rather understanding what she wants to do, providing her with evidence and information and then supporting her in her decision,\u201d Abrams added. \u201cIn the old days, that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case.\u201d In the early 2000s, studies emerged showing that infants born to women with HIV in low-income countries had increased risks of illness and death when they were given formula \u2014 and that was found to be associated with the mothers not having safe drinking water to mix with the formula, according to the new AAP report. That prompted the World Health Organization to recommend that people with HIV should breastfeed their babies in places without safe drinking water and accessible formula. As more mothers with HIV breastfed, more studies then found that when the mother took ART or the infant was given antiretrovirals preventively, that effectively reduced the risk of HIV transmission. The new AAP report noted that there is no consensus on the optimal regimen of preventive antiretrovirals for infants during breastfeeding. Also, people who breastfeed are recommended to do so exclusively, because mixing breastfeeding and formula or solid foods\u00a0has been associated with increased HIV transmission. \u201cThis increased rate may be a result of disrupted infant gut integrity associated with consuming substances other than human milk, decreases in the amount of antiviral or anti-inflammatory substances typically consumed in human milk, or other mechanisms,\u201d according to the AAP report. LaTonya said that among the guidance that her medical team discussed with her for breastfeeding was to not incorporate formula but to breastfeed exclusively. \u201cOne of the guidelines that we went over is, if we were going to breastfeed, that was the only thing that we could do,\u201d LaTonya said. \u201cWe could not mix formula and breastfeeding.\u201d Along with supporting and counseling patients with HIV who wish to breastfeed, the AAP also recommended in the new report that pregnant people be routinely tested for HIV and those living with HIV or newly diagnosed should be linked to treatment. LaTonya said that she hopes the new AAP recommendations encourage health-care providers to educate the public more about what an undetectable level of HIV means, how infections can be treated and how the virus can be suppressed. \u201cIt\u2019s something people live with, and it\u2019s not something to be afraid of,\u201d LaTonya said. The time for doctors to have those types of educational discussions with their patients would be when someone has a routine HIV test, she said. \u201cThey will talk to you about gonorrhea and chlamydia, but the HIV portion is missing. And so therefore, a lot of people are still stuck in the \u201880s with their mentality of HIV and AIDS,\u201d LaTonya said. \u201cI believe that is mostly due to lack of education.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/hiv-breastfeeding-recommendations-aap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_belly-button-health-indicator-partner-content-wellness", "text": "Navels, belly buttons, innies or outies \u2026 whatever term you use, your umbilicus may have plenty to tell you about the state of your health. For some, they are the thing of nightmares \u2013\u00a0omphalophobia\u00a0(the fear of belly buttons) is a real condition. For others, they are a fashion accessory to be shown off in a crop top, or decorated with a body piercing. Whatever your feelings about belly buttons, one thing\u2019s for sure - it once joined you to your mother. The umbilical cord is severed at birth to leave just a small clamped stump that progressively withers and falls away a week or two later. What you\u2019re left with, in most cases, is a small wrinkled depression. That\u2019s if you have an \u201cinnie\u201d, as most of us \u2013\u00a090% apparently\u00a0\u2013 do. From this point, the belly button seems to become redundant \u2013 other than to gather dust and fluff. But that\u2019s not the whole story \u2013 your navel has more depth to it than just a few millimetres. READ MORE: What your hair can tell you about your health\u00a0 The umbilicus is an access point for the vessels carrying blood to and from the fetus. These have come from the placenta and run through the\u00a0umbilical cord, coated in\u00a0Wharton\u2019s jelly\u00a0\u2013 a gelatinous connective tissue contained in the cord that insulates and protects them. There are normally three vessels within the cord. The one carrying oxygen and nutrients to the foetus is the\u00a0umbilical vein. It passes through the umbilicus and feeds into the developing foetal circulation. There are also\u00a0two umbilical arteries, though these carry deoxygenated blood and waste products, flowing in the other direction back to the placenta. This circulation is not needed after the baby is born, and once disconnected from the placenta the umbilical vessels naturally close up. But the little stump of cut cord left clinging on can still be of use for a short time, especially in newborn babies who are poorly. The vessels can have\u00a0drip lines inserted\u00a0and be used for infusions of medicine, or have blood samples taken from them for testing. READ MORE: What your skin can tell you about your health The umbilicus is a portal in the wall of the abdomen - it\u2019s a little-known fact that during your embryonic development your intestines actually have to\u00a0leave your abdominal cavity\u00a0because of limited space, but return a few weeks later. They do so via the umbilicus, passing into the cord. As a result the umbilicus is not just an access point, but a point of weakness. An\u00a0umbilical hernia\u00a0occurs if a section of intestine pokes through any gap. This may require an operation to correct it. The nun and the navel Poor\u00a0Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey. She was a nun who devoted much of her life to the care of patients in a hospital in Minnesota. She trained as a nurse, later becoming a surgical assistant to the doctor William Mayo. It was during this tenure that she highlighted an interesting observation. At the time (the late 19th century), cancers of the abdomen and pelvis were typically diagnosed much later, and unfortunately were often more extensive. We call this process\u00a0metastasis, where a cancer starts in one organ or location, then spreads to another. Mary Joseph noted that some patients with metastatic cancer had a new palpable swelling or nodule in their umbilicus. She did the noble deed of reporting this to Mayo, who fairly evidently hadn\u2019t noted it himself. He went on to rather\u00a0ignominiously publish these findings\u00a0under his own name, without giving due credit to his esteemed colleague. It was only after the deaths of Dempsey and Mayo - both in 1939 - that another doctor, Hamilton Bailey, rightly named the finding\u00a0Sister Mary Joseph\u2019s nodule. The\u00a0nodule\u00a0is firm, of variable colouring, and actually arises from spread of the cancer to the umbilical tissue. It\u2019s not seen as commonly these days, since more cancers are now diagnosed earlier before extensive spreading occurs. READ MORE: What your earwax and tears can tell you about your health\u00a0 Medusa\u2019s head Other signs can be observed in the navel that have a footing in mythology. One example allows us to draw a connection between the liver and the umbilicus. The skin around the navel has beds of\u00a0superficial veins\u00a0that feed back towards the deeper circulation. They actually drain blood into the hepatic portal vein, a large vessel that is heading into the liver, chock-full of nutrients absorbed from the gut. If the\u00a0pressure in the portal vein becomes too high\u00a0(mostly as a result of liver diseases, like alcohol cirrhosis) pressure builds in the connecting vessels too. Veins have thinner walls than arteries and tend to\u00a0balloon under pressure. As a result, the normally small veins around the navel dilate in size and become visible beneath the skin, fanning in all directions.

{"id": "2024_05_23_health_colon-cancer-blood-test", "text": "To screen for colon and rectal cancers, most people have colonoscopies, which can feel invasive and require anesthesia, or they may take an at-home stool test, which can be more convenient but also awkward \u2014\u00a0and not appealing for the squeamish. But a simple blood test could soon become more broadly available. Palo Alto, California-based biotechnology company Guardant Health has applied for US Food and Drug Administration approval of Shield, its blood test to screen for early signs of colorectal cancer, and on Thursday, a panel of expert advisers to the FDA gathered to discuss data on the screening test. The FDA\u2019s Molecular and Clinical Genetics Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee met to discuss the benefits and risks of the test and vote on whether it\u2019s safe and effective. The panel voted 8-1 that the Shield test is safe for use in people who meet the criteria for testing, 6-3 that the test is effective for use in those meeting the criteria and 7-2 that the benefits of the test outweigh the risks. The discussions and voting outcomes will be shared with the FDA, which takes into consideration but does not have to follow the committee\u2019s advice when deciding whether to approve the test. If Shield receives FDA approval, it will be the first approved blood screening test for colorectal cancer that meets requirements for Medicare reimbursement, said Dr. Craig Eagle, chief medical officer at Guardant Health. Current options for colorectal cancer screening for people at average risk include a stool-based test done either annually or every three years; a traditional colonoscopy every 10 years; a virtual colonoscopy every five years; or a sigmoidoscopy procedure, which involves using a tube-like instrument called an endoscope to examine the lower part of the colon, every five years. The Shield blood test is already available as a laboratory-developed test or LDT, so it does not necessarily require approval by the FDA to be performed under current regulations. However, the agency\u2019s approval could make the test more widely available and broadly covered as another primary screening option. The test would not replace the other screening methods that are commonly used. Rather, according to Guardant, it could be another noninvasive option, which could help boost the number of people who complete recommended screenings. \u201cCurrent primary non-invasive screening options are limited to stool-based tests,\u201d Eagle wrote in an email. \u201cOur Shield blood test offers patients a convenient option that has a proven level of performance within range of non-invasive tests.\u201d Several research teams and companies have been working to develop simple blood tests to screen for colon and rectal cancers. \u201cThe argument is that a point-of-care blood test can actually significantly reduce the incidence rate of very advanced disease and save lives, even if it has lesser potential to prevent the disease,\u201d said Robert Smith, senior vice president of early cancer detection science at the American Cancer Society. A blood-based test would not be able to identify concerning lesions or polyps in the colon or rectum, as a colonoscopy would. With visual exams, like colonoscopies or sigmoidoscopies, a lesion or polyp that has the potential to develop into cancer can be identified and removed, thus preventing the disease. \u201cMost people would like to see a blood-based option that was more accurate with respect to finding precursor lesions in addition to cancers. But the rather remarkable thing about colorectal cancer screening is that people vary in their readiness to do one test or another,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou have to give people a choice.\u201d Guardant\u2019s Shield test would be for colorectal cancer screening in people 45 or older who are at average risk of the disease, according to FDA meeting materials. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that screening for colorectal cancer start at age 45 for people at average risk. The test would not be recommended for high-risk people, such as those with personal or family histories of the disease, and people who receive an \u201cabnormal\u201d test result using Shield would be referred for a colonoscopy. Since the launch of the lab-developed version of the Shield test in May 2022, it has been used by more than 20,000 people, and more than 90% of those who were prescribed the test have completed it, according to Guardant Health. \u201cAny test developer knows that they have to get their test approved by the FDA for it to really gain traction,\u201d Smith said. Mixed vote on effectiveness At Thursday\u2019s meeting, the FDA advisers indicated some division about the test when answering three questions about its safety and effectiveness and whether the benefits outweigh any risks. \u201cI voted yes on all three, with the indication that this is to be used in asymptomatic individuals for the detection of colon cancer. I did feel like it met that indication,\u201d panel member Dr. Sean Spencer, a gastroenterologist and physician scientist at Stanford University, said in the meeting. \u201cI think in the labeling, it should clearly indicate that this is not to detect adenomas and it is not designed as a preventive strategy,\u201d Spencer said. Adenomas are\u00a0tumors that are not cancerous. Panel member Dr. Charity Morgan also voted yes to all three categories. \u201cMy reasoning was very similar to Dr. Spencer\u2019s: the indication is for detection of colorectal cancer. If the indication had said something about advanced adenomas, that would have changed my vote,\u201d said Morgan, a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201cI was on the fence about the effectiveness because of the limited sensitivity for stage I. I think if the labeling was very clear that this test is strong as for detecting stages II, III and IV, that would turn my vote from a weak yes to a strong yes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut ultimately, I concluded that they did show effectiveness as well as safety and a good risk-benefit profile.\u201d Meanwhile, panel member Dr. Padma Rajagopal voted that she thinks the test is safe and that the benefits outweigh the risks, but she does not think the test is effective due to its limitations in detecting advanced adenomas and says it\u2019s not as effective in detecting stage I cancers as in detecting more advanced disease. \u201cIf there were refinements to that indicated use or refinements in the way that providers and patients were educated, I will change my vote to a yes,\u201d said Rajagopal, a physician-scientist at the National Cancer Institute. Panel member Dr. William Brugge voted that, while he thinks the Shield test is safe, he does not think that it\u2019s effective or that the benefits outweigh the risks. \u201cMy primary concern here is that I don\u2019t think Shield is a particularly good screening test for colon cancer,\u201d said Brugge, a gastroenterologist at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He added that he thinks \u201cmany of the other existing tests\u201d are better. The FDA advisers\u2019 votes will not immediately change or shift the American Cancer Society\u2019s screening recommendations, Smith said. \u201cThe American Cancer Society typically looks for FDA approval at this higher level before we would include a test in our guidelines,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe really want to hear how the FDA thinks about this test, and then with respect to guidelines, I can\u2019t tell you what any one organization \u2013 including ours \u2013 is going to do, because it\u2019s a process that requires a great deal of literature review and evidence review and consideration of the FDA decision, as well as the implications,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process that takes some time.\u201d How the test works The Shield test works by detecting tumor DNA in blood samples, and a physician would need to order the test and kit for their patient. The test was found to have around 83% sensitivity and 90% specificity in a study published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine. Sensitivity\u00a0refers to a test\u2019s ability to accurately identify people with disease, designating them as positive. Specificity refers to its ability to accurately designate people without a disease as negative. That study, which included nearly 8,000 people, was among the data that the FDA panel members reviewed in Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cFDA seeks the Panel\u2019s input on whether the information submitted by Guardant is adequate to support the safety and effectiveness of the Shield for the proposed intended use,\u201d the meeting materials say. The study found that about 83% of participants who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer via colonoscopy tested positive for the disease on the Shield test, compared with about 17% who had a false negative. The test showed about 88% sensitivity in detecting stage I, II or III colorectal cancer and a lower sensitivity, around 13%, in detecting precancerous lesions. About 90% of the study participants without advanced colorectal cancer or precancerous lesions tested negative on the blood test, compared with about 10% who had a false positive test result. Many people skip screening The FDA meeting materials note that colorectal cancer occurs in about 150,000 people in the United States each year and is associated with more than 50,000 deaths annually. The disease is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and it\u2019s estimated that more than 75% of people who die from colorectal cancer were not up to date with their screenings. For the average person, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women, according to the American Cancer Society. Signs and\u00a0symptoms of colorectal cancer\u00a0include changes in bowel habits, rectal bleeding or blood in the stool, cramping or abdominal pain, weakness and fatigue, and weight loss. The share of colorectal cancer diagnoses among adults younger than 55 in the US\u00a0has been rising since the 1990s, and when it comes to screening methods, new research suggests that the use of at-home stool tests for the disease has become more popular, especially among younger adults. Data released last week by Epic Research, owned by the health-care software company Epic, shows that in early 2018, colonoscopies accounted for about 96% of colorectal cancer screenings, but that proportion fell below 70% by the third quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the use of DNA stool tests significantly rose in the second quarter of 2020, reaching 31% of screenings by the fourth quarter of 2023. The study included data on more than 1.4 million first-time colorectal cancer screenings conducted by colonoscopy or DNA stool testing between 2018 and 2023. Despite the current colorectal cancer screening recommendations, \u201ca significant portion of the eligible population hesitates to participate in screenings. Common deterrents include the discomfort associated with stool-based tests, the preparation required for procedures, and anxiety surrounding colonoscopy examinations,\u201d Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt, a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and past president of the Florida Urological Society, wrote in a CNN opinion piece in March. \u201cThis apprehension may contribute to only\u00a0about 60% of those eligible\u00a0for colorectal cancer screenings staying up to date on the recommended tests,\u201d Brahmbhatt wrote, adding that when it comes to blood-based screening tests, \u201cthe hope is, once approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, this blood test would increase screening for colorectal cancer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/colon-cancer-blood-test/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_health_ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness", "text": "The ultraprocessed foods your kids eat now may be putting them a greater risk for cardiometabolic problems \u2013 like heart attack, stroke and diabetes \u2013 in adulthood, a new study suggests. \u201cOur study highlights the importance of promoting the substitution of ultra-processed foods with healthier alternatives, such as unprocessed or minimally processed options, in efforts to prevent further cardiometabolic health problems in children,\u201d said lead author of the study Dr. Nancy Babio, associate professor of Rovira I Virgili University and researcher from Institut d\u2019Investigaci\u00f3 Sanit\u00e0ria Pere Virgili and CIBEROBN in Spain. From this study, families and institutions should take away how early life lays the foundation to problems dealt with in adulthood, said Dr. Stuart Berger, a pediatric cardiologist and chair of the section of cardiology and cardiac surgery for the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the research. The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, analyzed data from more than 1,400 children ages 3 to 6 recruited from schools across seven cities in Spain. The children\u2019s caregivers met with researchers in person and completed questionnaires at home on physical activity, food consumption and demographics from 2019 to 2022, according to the study. Researchers divided the data from the children into three groups based on the amount of ultraprocessed food they ate. Children who consumed the most ultraprocessed foods were more likely to have risk factors like a higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure and waist-to-height ratio, the study showed. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, chicken nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. \u201cAmericans eat ultraprocessed foods every day,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. A group of Americans in a study published on May 8 ate at least three servings of ultraprocessed food a day, with one group eating an average of seven daily servings, the study showed. Many studies have shown the negative health effects of ultraprocessed foods in adults, but Friday\u2019s study is among the first to show the impact they can have on the cardiometabolic health of young children, said Berger, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago. \u201cThis particular topic, ultraprocessed food consumptions and risk, is a very important topic in kids,\u201d he said. Starting young The study is observational, meaning that while researchers can identify an association between how much ultraprocessed foods children eat and their health, they cannot say that one causes the other, Berger said. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be mindful of ultraprocessed foods for young children, because how they eat for the rest of their lives is greatly impact by their early nutrition, he said. \u201cWhat we know is people who eat a certain way, even moms who eat in utero, set up baby\u2019s preferences,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere are a ton of publications that have shown that what we eat early in life \u2026 actually sets the stage for what happens in the future.\u201d Shifting your child\u2019s diet away from ultraprocessed foods and toward more fresh options is easier to do when they are very young, Berger said. Ultra-convenient The problem is that avoiding ultraprocessed foods is not equally easy for everyone. The study found that the children with the highest amount of ultraprocessed foods in their diet had mothers who were younger, had a higher BMI and had lower levels of education and employment. In places where fresh food might be harder to obtain, ultraprocessed foods are more accessible and inexpensive, Freeman said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are also ultra-convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, people reach for them when they feed their kids, and their kids aren\u2019t hungry, but they\u2019re filled with all these different chemicals and substances and seasonings and salts of sugars and whatever that they become very addicted to.\u201d Freeman stressed that giving kids ultraprocessed foods without also providing fresh fruits and vegetables sets them up for problems down the road. Adding in more nutritious foods and encouraging physical activity as much as possible is critical, Berger added. \u201cIf you can do something to create a healthy lifestyle early, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that you can you can eliminate metabolic syndromes later in life like diabetes, obesity, and all the complications associated with diabetes and obesity,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta", "text": "I\u2019ve been reporting on Alzheimer\u2019s disease for more than two decades, and any progress in the field has seemed incremental at best, leaving most patients and their loved ones with few options. But in the process of filming a new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I met with people all across the country who had been diagnosed with or who are at high risk of the disease. With lifestyle changes alone, I saw levels of amyloid plaque decrease in their brains, their cognition improve and even signs of reversal of the disease. It was extraordinary and it also made me start to think about my own brain, because I have a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. So with some trepidation, I decided to learn more about my risk for dementia. It was one of the most personal and revealing\u00a0experiences I have ever gone through. To start, I underwent an intensive exploration of my brain, far deeper than I even thought possible. This wasn\u2019t a simple look at the anatomy or even the genetics that might predispose me to a particular type of dementia. The goal was to obtain a complete story of my brain, from my earliest days through my education and formative years to now: a man in his mid-50s. Most importantly, the in-depth testing could give me a clearer idea of where I was headed and how to steer my path in the most favorable direction. Even as a brain surgeon myself, I was surprised at how well the health of your brain can be measured. With the heart, it is pretty well-accepted that a battery of tests can help give us a clear idea of how to predict, prevent and treat heart disease. Until recently, however, we really could not say the same about the brain. Many brain doctors still struggle even to define the criteria for a healthy brain. The general consensus was that the \u201cblack box\u201d in your skull was pretty fixed and that there was little you could do to assess it, let alone optimize it. Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist, convinced me otherwise, and it led to one of the most fascinating \u2014 and somewhat frightening \u2014 days I have had in my life. I\u2019ve known Richard for a long time, and we are friends. We have had great conversations about our shared love for the brain, and I often turn to him to get his thoughts on neurological developments in the news. What has always struck me about Richard is that he is consistently unwilling to accept the status quo in medicine, almost more as a matter of justice rather than scientific pursuit, although he is that rare individual who is stellar at making a difference in both. So I immediately thought of him when considering the idea of a preventive neurology visit. To be clear, I wasn\u2019t going to Richard because I thought I had any sort of problem. But that is the point: When people refer to the US medical field as a \u201csick-care\u201d system instead of a health-care system, this is what I think they mean. Richard would certainly see me if I were sick, but he preferred to see me now, while I was healthy, fully believing he could help me maintain my brain, reduce my chance of dementia and even optimize my function, as he described in a 2018 study. I flew into Boca Raton, Florida, to see Richard at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases of Florida clinic on a beautiful day in March. He had advised me ahead of time to not exercise or eat that morning and to prepare for a day of intense mental gymnastics. Although this wasn\u2019t an IQ test, he said, in some ways, it would be far more personal. I must say that it felt very meta to get an assessment of my own brain and find out whether it was functioning as it should or if there were problems I had not yet noticed. Was I getting rusty? Maybe I was making errors that my family, friends and colleagues were too polite to tell me about. If there were gaps in processing speed or executive judgment, they might now be uncovered and unmasked. When I got to the clinic, I first underwent a battery of blood tests, checking my phosphorylated tau ratio, better known as the Alzheimer\u2019s blood test, and measures of my lipids, inflammation and glucose levels, to name just a few. I was also tested for my genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. If I was a carrier of the APOE4 gene, it could carry significant higher risk of the disease. I spit into a tube to check my oral health. After that, I stepped on a body composition scale to figure out where and how much bone, fat and muscle I had in my body. I was a little surprised to catch Richard in the corner, looking at the readout and saying, \u201cInteresting \u2026\u201d while stroking his chin. Nobody likes to see their doctors do that. Not even doctors like to see other doctors do that. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked across the room. \u201cOh,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably fine.\u201d He later told me that he saw evidence of an old left arm injury and accurately predicted that I had had an intense leg workout the day before. It was a real reminder of how clearly the body keeps score. Even though I hadn\u2019t thought about that injury in years, it had clearly left its mark on my body and still triggered a finding on this test. After that came the cognitive testing. This was perhaps the most surprising. At first, I was told to relax and listen to the detailed short story of an Atlanta football team captain, a quarterback who had injured his finger on a fishing trip before the big game. I thought I had been paying attention but suddenly realized I probably wasn\u2019t as engaged as I thought. \u201cWhat day did he injure himself, and how many stitches did he need? What was the player\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked 15 minutes later. Could I even be certain if it was his thumb or left ring finger? Quick: Recite as many words as you can starting with the letter \u201cG\u201d and then immediately rattle off as many animal names as possible, both in one-minute increments. The longer the words and the more unusual the animals, the better. There were lists of words to remember, three-dimensional cubes and clocks to be drawn, and dozens of faces to match with their names. I had to scratch and sniff 50 different smells and determine, in one instance, if something smelled more like gasoline, acetone or a forest fire. In another instance, it was lavender or lilac. I found myself suddenly being unsure and trying to summon up a memory of that smell to try to answer correctly. I felt like my brain was being cross-examined by a very skilled prosecutor. It wasn\u2019t just about the number of errors I made but the types of errors, how long I took to respond and whether I simply lost my attention. There are obvious red flags that pop up if someone draws a clock backward or if they have lost their ability to distinguish certain smells. The more subtle concerns were around visual-spatial construction or an ability to ignore incongruent stimuli in the Stroop Color and Word Test, such as identifying the color red, even if that word appears in purple on the screen. Although I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with dyslexia, Richard thinks it might be something I have. \u201cDo you count on your fingers?\u201d he asked me. I have always done that and never considered it to be notable or suggestive of something significant. Turns out I was less likely to remember words with lots of Bs and Ds in them because I may have always shied away from letters I more easily confused. These types of insights about my own brain, big and small, were all so fascinating (and a bit unsettling) to me. For Richard, however, they represented opportunities for early intervention, some of which are remarkably simple. \u201cMost doctors would look at your results and say you are doing fine,\u201d Richard explained before he showed me the results of my lab testing. \u201cBut what they are really saying is that you are probably fine \u2013 for the next few years. I am playing the long game here, and I think you are going to see a lot of areas we can start to address now, today.\u201d I am a pretty competitive guy, so I am used to having all \u201cgreens\u201d pop up when I review my lab testing results. After all, I take great pride in my health and approach it with the same rigor that I approached my grades in medical school. I wanted to do really well, certainly as well as I could possibly do. So when Richard flipped over my lab results and showed me a page that had not only a considerable amount of yellow but even a few reds, my heart dropped. My homocysteine level was elevated, but my B12 level was low. That wasn\u2019t surprising to Richard, because he had also found a mutation in my MTHFR gene, which meant that I probably didn\u2019t process homocysteine well. My omega-3 levels were all right, but not when you compared them with my omega-6 levels. My DHEA levels were a little low, which might partly explain why I have had more trouble putting on muscle than I did a decade ago. And I was surprised to learn that I was carrying more inflammation in my body than I expected, especially given that I felt fine. What was most revealing to me was how clearly these blood test abnormalities could be associated with neurological function. Richard told me that issues of metabolism, such as even slight insulin resistance, can accelerate amyloid deposition, which can lead to amyloid plaques, those telltale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, down the line. He also said that, in his experience, cholesterol and lipid abnormalities can be associated with problems with executive function and speed of processing. He added that he associates depression with lower attention and slower processing speeds. I\u2019ve been practicing neurosurgery for 30 years, and I had never heard of this. Richard was able to draw a link between very functional aspects of the brain to very specific problems in the body. And, more important, he has presented scientific evidence showing that optimizing those physical targets is associated with improved cognitive function. Richard also wanted to address an activity I did on a daily basis: my neighborhood walk with my three dogs. \u201cKeep doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now with a weighted vest.\u201d Why? Not having enough lean muscle mass is problematic. He told me people typically do a good job addressing their arms and legs, but loading the spine with additional weight helps activate core muscles, such as abdominals and obliques, as well as stimulating the growth of new bone cells. This could lead to a critical redistribution of the fat, muscle and bone in my body and help drive down any insulin resistance that I may be genetically predisposed to and eventually lower my risk of developing amyloid in the brain. On Richard\u2019s advice, I started to make a few changes to my nutrition and day-to-day routine. Over the years, I had gone back and forth on fish oil, not overly impressed with the data on heart health and finding it challenging to keep the pills refrigerated, especially when I was on the road. For Richard, though, it was clear. As healthy as my diet is, he had no doubt that I needed to take the extra steps to supplement with omega-3 fatty acids to help my omega-3/omega-6 ratio in the pursuit of better brain health. This would also help with the absorption of B vitamins, he added. Those needed to be supplemented as well, and Richard was very specific about this. \u201cMake sure to get the bottle with 1,000 micrograms of B12 and 400 micrograms of methylfolate along with 1.5 milligrams of B6.\u201d Those fairly straightforward recommendations to improve my fatty acids could probably make an impact with my executive function, he told me. In the recommendation about brain health, I did not expect an intervention involving my feet, but the nerves that run to the feet are the longest in our body. When you don\u2019t move your toes and feet regularly and freely, Richard says, you can lose sensory awareness, also known as proprioception, leading to a \u201csensory paralysis.\u201d Over time, the nerve connections that run from your feet to your brain start to disappear. Once your feet are weak, your weight will be unevenly distributed when walking and exercising. The better your feet can tolerate a load evenly, the more options they have for movement, the better and more cooperative things will be up the chain, including your knees, hips and lower back. Consider wearing toe spacers occasionally, he told me. Start with 10 minutes a day every few days, and increase the time as you get used to them. Some of the recommendations were more sophisticated. For example, Richard would ideally want even more testing. He\u2019d like to get a detailed DEXA scan of my entire body, not just for bone health but to get a clear look at how much visceral fat I am carrying. Visceral fat is not the subcutaneous fat that you can pinch between your thumb and your forefinger. Rather, it\u2019s the problematic stuff that chokes off the internal organs in your belly. Because visceral fat is so buried and woven into your internal organs, it\u2019s actually quite hard to assess how much someone has. A person could be skinny and still have a lot of visceral fat. Because I had some inflammatory elevations, he worried that I might be one of those people. He also suggested a brain MRI. He was worried that there might be cerebral blood vessel injury because of a slightly elevated fibrinogen level, a protein that can help the blood clot. The concern was that I might be making more frequent micro clots, which could put me at increased risk of vascular dementia later in life. And finally, a coronary calcium CT scan to detect coronary artery disease at its earliest stages, because as a general rule, what is bad for the heart is also bad for the brain. To be clear, most of these tests aren\u2019t part of routine care, and I struggle with the cost of it all. They can be expensive and probably wouldn\u2019t be covered by a person\u2019s insurance, especially if they aren\u2019t showing symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia or mild cognitive impairment. That is why Richard is also working to make much of it available for free at home. Nearly all the cognitive testing could be available in the future through a free app. Even the blood work could be done via finger-prick testing, if all goes as expected with Richard\u2019s research trial. Although a complete DEXA scan requires a facility, there are home scales that do a reasonably good job at measuring overall body composition, not just weight, and can help follow those trends over time. When I first visited with Richard after all my testing, I honestly expected to be told I was doing fine \u2013 even excellent. That is what every doctor had told me before. But the evidence is clear that when it comes to your brain, prevention and even optimization are possible. We know that in so many areas of medicine, there is a very large white space between being totally healthy and being sick. And it\u2019s an area that a sick-care system would not spend much time addressing, especially if the recommendations are as simple and wildly effective as a few vitamins, toe spacers and a rucksack. Going through this experience for \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient\u201d was more revealing and jarring than I could have imagined. After all, nobody wants bad news from a doctor, especially when it comes to your brain. But I can take comfort in knowing these tests aren\u2019t laying out a certain future or preparing me for inevitable catastrophe but rather giving me the personalized knowledge that I can use to take action toward a longer, healthier life and a sharper, healthier brain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-treatment-real-world-effectiveness", "text": "Demand for Wegovy and other GLP-1 drugs used to treat obesity and diabetes has skyrocketed, but a new report suggests that many people may not be sticking with their weight-loss treatment long enough. An analysis of health insurance claims released Tuesday found that most people using GLP-1 medications \u2013 about 58% \u2013 were on their treatment plan for less than 12 weeks, falling short of a key benchmark in the weight-loss treatment timeline. Professional organizations have set this as a guideline for when to reassess whether a treatment is providing clinically meaningful weight loss. Users start with a low dose of these medications and gradually increase it over time until they reach a targeted dose. But the analysis shows that nearly a third of people \u2013 more than 30% \u2013 dropped out after the first four weeks of treatment, before reaching the targeted dose. The findings are based on pharmacy and medical claims data for about 170,000 people with insurance coverage under Blue Cross Blue Shield plans who were prescribed GLP-1 medications that were approved to treat weight management between 2014 and 2023. \u201cThese are long-term medications to treat a chronic disease,\u201d said Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist and director of obesity medicine at Endeavor Health in Chicago, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cThis is absolutely a marathon, not a sprint. And when we do treat this as a sprint, I think patients are likely to get off of medication much faster.\u201d Experts say that impatience with results is one of many reasons patients might stop treatment. Only about two-thirds of adults who have used injectable weight-loss drugs say they feel that they were effective, according to a new KFF poll. And people who stopped using the medications were significantly less optimistic about their benefits: Only about half of those who had used injectable weight-loss drugs in the past said they were effective, compared with nearly three-quarters of those who were actively using the treatments. Side effects \u2013 such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation that are common early on \u2013 may also drive people away. Data from the longest clinical trial of Wegovy showed that 17% of people using the drug decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects. But experts say that many deterrents can be managed with appropriate counseling from a provider. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have frequent touchpoints, frequent interactions, then it\u2019s really it\u2019s hard to manage side effects. It\u2019s hard to manage expectations. It\u2019s hard to see if there\u2019s improvement in some of these other metabolic comorbidities,\u201d said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new research.  Each person will respond to treatment differently and assess the balance of costs and benefits to their heath differently. \u201cThere\u2019s not a line in the sand for every single person. Physicians and patients have to just look at all the data and make a decision about treatment together,\u201d she said. Findings from the Blue Cross Blue Shield data emphasize the important role that providers can play in helping patients stick with their treatment with GLP-1s. People who met with their providers less frequently \u2013 and those living in underserved regions with broader health inequities \u2013 were more likely to discontinue GLP-1 treatment sooner. Each additional follow-up visit increased a patient\u2019s chances of staying on the treatment by 60%, said Dr. Razia Hashmi, vice president of clinical affairs for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. And although most prescriptions came from primary care physicians, those who were prescribed GLP-1s by endocrinologists or others with expertise in weight management were more likely to reach at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment. \u201cWraparound support services really make a difference \u2013 whether a person has lifestyle support management, nutrition, diet and side effect management,\u201d Hashmi said, and \u201chealth equity matters. Social drivers of health \u2013 transportation, access to food, socioeconomic status \u2013 all of that also makes a difference.\u201d Cost can often be a prohibitive factor for these medications \u2013 a month\u2019s supply of GLP-1 medications can often cost about $1,000 \u2013 but the analysis included only people who had insurance plans that covered weight-loss medication prescriptions. Insurance plan copays may have affected cost considerations, but the individuals in this analysis were not paying out-of-pocket for their treatment. But using GLP-1 treatments are still an investment in many ways. \u201cWhether it\u2019s an employer trying to make a decision or an individual patient trying to make a decision, it\u2019s really important to understand the success factors,\u201d Hashmi said. \u201cWe want the investment to pay off.\u201d Another new report supports the claim that the benefits of GLP-1s are extended with long-term, consistent treatment. One of the first reports offering real-world data on GLP-1 efficacy found that people using the medicines had lost an average of about 1.4% of their starting body weight after three months, which steadily increased to an average of about 3% weight loss after a full year on the treatment. The analysis from Dandelion Health, a health care analytics firm, is based on the electronic health records of nearly 17,000 people who were prescribed a GLP-1 from 2019 through 2023. Compared with a group of people with a similar set of clinical characteristics \u2013 matched closely on demographic factors such as age and ethnicity, treatment indicators such as average body mass index and diabetes prevalence, history of treatments such as bariatric surgery and prevalence of related comorbidities \u2013 the analysis found that those on GLP-1s lost about twice as much weight. These injected medications, called GLP-1 agonists, are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss.\u00a0In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose\u00a0at least 10% of their starting weight.\u00a0But the new report suggests that the real-world efficacy is not as promising as clinical trial data would suggest. And experts warn that the GLP-1 treatment process can be different for everyone. \u201cThere are some people who are under-responders, there are some people who are over-responders, and there\u2019s some that respond as expected to the medication,\u201d Narang said. \u201cStudies are still happening to understand why.\u201d The data from Dandelion Health showed that the 10% of people with the best response to GLP-1s had results that mirrored what clinical trials found, but the 10% with the least success with the treatments had no weight change, or even an increase in weight, over time. Still, GLP-1 medications may have benefits far beyond weight loss \u2013 for heart and liver health, for example \u2013 which may extend even to people who don\u2019t lose as many pounds as they might have expected, experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to not use the scale as the only outcome of whether you should stay on this medication. People might be making slow but steady progress, which could warrant ongoing treatment,\u201d Dushay said. \u201cThere may be some direct benefits of the medication in the absence of significant weight loss, which is also why you should be talking to your doctor at length about why you\u2019re using this medication.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-treatment-real-world-effectiveness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_health_teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness", "text": "A new report details the role social media plays in the lives of young people, and how they manage the various pros and cons \u2014 including in the context of being a person of color or LGBTQ+, or having depression. Those benefits and drawbacks include valuing online platforms for social connection, self-expression and information, while also feeling the brunt of social media\u2019s effects on their attention span, confidence and contentedness, according to the report released Tuesday by Common Sense Media and Hopelab, a social innovation lab and impact investor aiming to support the well-being of young people. READ MORE: How to know if you have \u2018phone addiction\u2019 \u2014 and 12 ways to address it \u201cMost conversations and headlines surrounding social media and youth mental (health) focus solely on the harms, portraying young people as passive consumers. This research shows that it\u2019s much more complex,\u201d said Amy Green, head of research at Hopelab, in a news release. \u201cIf we truly want to improve the well-being of young people, we need to listen to their experiences and ensure that we do not inadvertently remove access to crucial positive benefits.\u201d Also driving the research is the national youth mental health crisis, the authors said, marked by increasing rates of mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and antidepressant medications prescribed to youth. In conversations about these phenomena, social media has consistently been at the center, though mental health issues can have multiple contributing factors.\u00a0 Conducted by the NORC \u2014 previously called the National Opinion Research Center \u2014 at the University of Chicago, the research includes 1,274 teens (ages 14 to 17) and young adults (ages 18 to 22) recruited online between October and November 2023. The young people \u201cprovided direction and input regarding survey content\u201d and participated in focus groups and interviews to help the research team prioritize and interpret results, according to a news release. The report is the third in a series tracking the influence of social media on well-being among youth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The researchers found the rate of depressive symptoms among youth is about 10% down from pandemic highs but is still high and comparable to the elevated levels of 2018. Nearly half of young people reported experiencing any severity of depression, and nearly a third (28%) said they had moderate to severe symptoms. Additionally, about half of LGBTQ+ youth reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, compared to nearly one-quarter of their non-LGBTQ+ peers. Those with depression were more susceptible to social comparison and pressure to show their best selves on social media. But they were also more likely to find resources to support their well-being and curate their feeds for this purpose \u2014 done by selecting a \u201cnot interested\u201d button on content they don\u2019t like, flagging inappropriate or offensive content, or blocking someone whose content bothered them. These youth also positively curated feeds by \u201cliking\u201d and spending more time on content they did enjoy, since many social media algorithms work by giving you more content based on your level of engagement with certain topics. This was especially important for LGBTQ+ youth who, along with Black and Latinx young people, faced more exposure to harassment and stress online. \u201cIn focus groups, Black youth told us their experiences with in-person harassment lowered their tolerance for similar behavior on social media, and meant they were more willing to give up the benefits to protect themselves from hateful comments,\u201d said lead researcher Amanda Lenhart, head of research at Common Sense Media, via email. The findings confirm what many researchers have seen scientifically and anecdotally, said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association, via email. Prinstein wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Social media and mental health Many participants also revealed the positives they gain from social media, citing online platforms as a place to seek support and advice; decompress; connect with loved ones and others who share their experiences, interests or identities; stay informed; and keep up with their favorite influencers or content creators. \u201cAnother important finding is the importance of social media as a space of connection, creativity and professional opportunities for Black youth,\u201d Lenhart said. Dr. Douglas Gentile, distinguished professor of psychology at Iowa State University, encouraged being \u201ccareful about interpreting (self-reported) data like these,\u201d he said via email. \u201cPeople are surprisingly bad at actually knowing what the effects of media use are on themselves,\u201d Gentile, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, added. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say that anyone is lying. Just that we only see little pieces of how the media influence us.\u201d Nearly one-fourth of participants reported using social media almost constantly throughout the day, up 7% from the rate the authors found in their 2018 report, the authors found. Many young people reported an inability to control their use, social media distracting from other activities and unconsciously reaching for social media when bored. To counteract these behaviors, on top of customizing their feeds, many have also taken breaks from social media to avoid the temptation or deleted their accounts permanently. \u201cSocial media could offer (more) benefits to youth if it was designed with a primary focus on youth well-being rather than a focus on keeping kids engaged for as long as possible to make a profit from their data,\u201d Prinstein said. While, or after, using social media, try doing an emotional check-in, Lenhart said. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018How am I feeling right now? Did I see anything that made me feel sad?\u2019\u201d Taking a temporary or permanent break from the content causing the most distress could be helpful, Lenhart added, especially if you already struggle with depression. If you\u2019re a parent or guardian wondering how to best manage your teen\u2019s social media use, one of the most important things you can do is \u201ckeep communication channels open,\u201d Lenhart said. Parental involvement is important, as young adults have expressed regret that their parents allowed them to use social media so young, wishing they could go back and tell their parents to not give in to their demands, Prinstein said. Ask the teens in your life what they like about these platforms and what types of connections or activities support their mental health, Lenhart said. Let them know you\u2019re there to help figure out a solution if social media is upsetting them or interfering with other responsibilities. Respect \u201cthat each young person is an expert in their own lived experience,\u201d Lenhart said. \u201cYoung people are valuable teachers in their own right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/teen-social-media-mental-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_weekly-insulin-fda-committee", "text": "Most types of insulin therapy, an important part of diabetes treatment for many people, are given as daily injections to help manage blood sugar levels. Now, the maker of a once-weekly insulin injection is seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but a committee of agency advisers is divided on whether the benefits of the product may outweigh the risks. In a meeting Friday, the FDA\u2019s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee weighed whether the benefits of Novo Nordisk\u2019s weekly product, called insulin icodec, outweigh its risks. If the agency signs off, the treatment will be the first weekly insulin available in the United States. The committee\u2019s discussions focused on the safety and efficacy of insulin icodec, specifically in people with type 1 diabetes. The advisers were asked to answer a question of, based on the available data, whether Novo Nordisk has demonstrated that the benefits of insulin icodec outweigh its risks for improving glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Four voted yes. Seven voted no. The advisory committee\u2019s discussions and voting outcomes will be shared with the FDA, which takes into consideration but does not have to follow the committee\u2019s advice when deciding whether to approve the treatment. An analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials found that once-weekly insulin icodec was better at reducing high blood glucose levels in comparison with the once-daily therapy insulin degludec, but insulin icodec was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia, also known as low blood glucose, which can lead to a loss of consciousness or seizures. \u201cInsulin icodec was associated with 50 to 80% more clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia compared to insulin degludec at Week 52, depending on the method of analysis,\u201d the committee\u2019s meeting materials say. If the product is approved by the FDA, some panel members said, there should be guidance on ways to mitigate and treat the risk of hypoglycemia. Committee member Dr. Barbara Onumah, a endocrinology in Largo, Maryland, voted yes on the benefits of insulin icodec outweighing its risks. \u201cThis would add a tool to the toolbox for clinicians,\u201d Onumah said. \u201cIt will not be beneficial for every person, but it might be useful for some persons,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a few risk mitigation things that need to be ironed out clearly so that for the general provider or practitioner who would be writing this prescription, should it be approved, will be doing it correctly and safely \u2013 because safety would be very important.\u201d Committee member Dr. Matthew Drake, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, voted no. Drake said his rationale was based on comparing insulin icodec with the current gold standard of insulin degludec, \u201cwhich has a good safety profile in my experience,\u201d he said. Committee member Erica Brittain also voted no but called it a hard decision. \u201cI agree that there\u2019s theoretical benefits, and anyone could understand wanting to have fewer injections, and that\u2019s very important,\u201d said Brittain, a biostatistician at the National Institutes of Health. \u201cUnfortunately, within the trial data, we don\u2019t see the benefit of better glycemic control, which I think was promised in terms of adherence. I understand that that would be hard to show in this clinical trial population, but things kind of go the other way,\u201d she said. The committee also discussed how a weekly insulin injection might be an easier treatment regimen to follow than daily injections. Studies suggest that about 53% of adults with type 1 diabetes adhere to existing insulin therapy schedules, \u201cwith approximately 22% of patients missing at least one basal insulin dose over any 14-day period,\u201d according to the FDA advisory committee\u2019s meeting materials. \u201cNonadherence to insulin therapy is a precipitating factor for diabetic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.\u201d Novo Nordisk isn\u2019t the only company developing a weekly insulin therapy for diabetes patients. Last week, Eli Lilly announced that its once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa was \u201cequally safe and effective\u201d in Phase 3 trials involving adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin for the first time and those who require multiple daily insulin injections. However, Lilly has not yet requested FDA approval.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/weekly-insulin-fda-committee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_health_happiness-rewire-brain-gupta-podcast-wellness", "text": "Happiness is an idea that has been woven into the fabric of humanity, going back to ancient civilizations. Roughly 250 years ago, it made its way into this country\u2019s Declaration of Independence as an unalienable right: \u201cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Although we\u2019ve grappled with it for millennia, the concept of happiness and how to attain it remains pretty elusive. Some might see it as having a sense of general well-being. For others, it might be feeling a spark of unadulterated joy. Yet others might find happiness chasing a dream and reaching it. It might be some combination of these \u2013 or something else entirely. I like to think of myself as a pretty happy guy. I have three wonderful teenage daughters and a wife, Rebecca, with whom I just celebrated a 20th anniversary; I\u2019m close to my parents, my \u201cbaby\u201d brother and his family. I have moments of complete contentment and a career that feels meaningful to me as a practicing neurosurgeon and CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent. But I also realize it\u2019s not that simple. There are other layers to happiness and a lot of nuance within those layers. The pursuit of happiness A challenging question is, what are the best ways to pursue happiness? Are we born with a stable, set level, or is it something we can cultivate, increase and strengthen? If it\u2019s the latter, how can we successfully go about it? Even though \u201cthe pursuit of Happiness\u201d is built into the country\u2019s founding, it seems that many Americans are just not that good at it. In the most recent World Happiness Report, the United States dropped to No. 23 (from No. 15 the previous year), marking the first time in the report\u2019s 12-year history that the US was not in the top 20 happiest countries. A separate Gallup poll, also from 2024, found that less than half (47%) of Americans are \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their personal lives. It\u2019s not just Americans. As it turns out, humans as a species may not excel at happiness. This may surprise you, but happiness is not necessarily something that we are genetically primed to attain. We have to really work at it. \u201cIf anything, natural selection kind of doesn\u2019t really care about our happiness that much. I mean, natural selection\u2019s job is just to keep us alive and keep us around to reproduce. And I think it does that not by making us feel these moments of contentment but maybe just the opposite,\u201d cognitive scientist Dr. Laurie Santos told me recently. \u201cIt does that by building in a negativity bias. So we\u2019re just a little bit worried that there could be a tiger around the corner, that we could get shunned at work. And we\u2019re kind of constantly on the alert for that,\u201d she said. Santos, who has a doctorate in psychology, is at Yale University, where she teaches Psychology and the Good Life, the most popular course in the university\u2019s history, and is the host of \u201cThe Happiness Lab\u201d podcast. She is also the first guest on the 10th season of my podcast, \u201cChasing Life,\u201d which kicked off this week. During this season, I talk to experts across a variety of disciplines about the scientific underpinnings of happiness \u2014 defining it, attaining it, maintaining it and increasing it \u2014 and its effects on our minds and bodies. Listen to more of my conversation with Santos here. I\u2019m happy but \u2018constructively dissatisfied\u2019 The fact that we haven\u2019t evolved to prioritize happiness may be why, despite being a generally happy person, I am also \u201cconstructively dissatisfied.\u201d It\u2019s a term I came up with on the fly while talking to Santos. And here, I\u2019m making a distinction between happiness and satisfaction. I\u2019m still happy overall, but I think if I ever became satisfied, that might erode my happiness. That\u2019s because, in my mind, satisfaction leads to complacency, which leads to stagnation. So, I seemingly have one of those personalities that needs \u2013 maybe even thrives on \u2013 dissatisfaction; being satisfied or complacent dampens my energy and enthusiasm. The times when I feel happiest are when my constructive dissatisfaction propels me into motion, contributing to the betterment of a situation, whether it\u2019s removing a brain tumor, finishing a documentary, working in my garden or even making dinner with my family. Another guest this season of the podcast, health psychologist and author Kelly McGonigal, said the term made perfect sense to her. \u201cBecause dissatisfaction often is the soil in which growth and positive change happens,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd dissatisfaction doesn\u2019t actually have to be a lack of appreciation or gratitude. If you can envision a better future for yourself or others, it requires feeling a gap between how things are and how things could be.\u201d The \u201cconstructive\u201d modifier before \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d is really important to me because I don\u2019t want to just wallow in dissatisfaction; I want it to be useful. And as long as I don\u2019t let the dissatisfaction grow too much, where it overpowers my emotional well-being, it works for me. But I have to admit, it can sometimes be a source of tension and a regular struggle. \u201cIt strikes me that you\u2019ve kind of gotten something out of the journey, gotten something out of that struggle,\u201d Santos told me. But she also warned about going overboard. \u201cWe can push ourselves and engage in challenges; those can be some of the happiest, most flow-inducing moments of our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need to make sure we\u2019re doing that in balance.\u201d She said that if we lose sleep, ignore friendships and make ourselves miserable, \u201cmaybe think about pushing yourself in a different way.\u201d Or find a way to mitigate the negative feelings. \u201cThe antidote to that would be to think what are ways that I could be on that important, purposeful journey but also bring a few more moments of true happiness into my life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, maybe I need a little bit more laughter or some breaks, or I need to engage in that purposeful pursuit with a bit more social connection, or something like that.\u201d Tried and true strategies It is true, according to Santos, that most of us have a set point of happiness. Mine is probably a little lower than my brother\u2019s, for example; he is more outgoing and outwardly cheerful, even though we have very similar nature and nurture. Winning the lottery may raise your level of happiness for a while, and a tragedy may lower it, but most people will eventually settle back to their baseline after some time. Santos believes, however, that with some diligent and intentional practice, you can start to turn up your thermostat of happiness. It is what she teaches her students, as well. For example, she not only lectures her students about the behavior and mindset shifts that are known to nudge up happiness, she makes her students practice them as homework. Instead of course requirements, she calls them course rewirements, because performing them on a regular basis actually can rewire you. Among the low-hanging fruit, Santos recommends making sure you\u2019re paying attention to healthy practices, like getting enough sleep and exercise and eating right. Also on the list: become a bit more \u201cother\u201d-oriented and try to develop an attitude of both gratitude and compassion outside yourself and internally, as well. But my favorite bit of advice is to cultivate and nurture your social connections. \u201cEvery available study of happy people suggests that happy people are more social,\u201d Santos said. And I would gather the opposite is also true: Social people are happier. \u201cSo we just need to make time for our friends and family members and loved ones.\u201d She\u2019s not the only one to preach this. Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist who runs the Harvard Study of Adult Development \u2014 the longest study of adult life, running 85-plus years and counting \u2014 said the secret of both happiness and health boils down to good relationships. How could that be? According to Waldinger, warm relationships (even just one) generally keep people\u2019s bodies stronger and brains sharper, most likely because they help buffer us against the vicissitudes of life. This reduces our exposure to circulating stress hormones (which, when they are constantly high, wreak havoc on the body and mind) as well as dials down resulting inflammation, thought to be at the root of many chronic modern diseases. So \u2014 again, for most of us \u2014 the diseases of aging are mitigated, in part, by our happiness. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to become an extrovert or the life of a party, and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend hour upon hour enduring superficial banter. But, Waldinger said, you should put some effort into consistently nurturing your relationships. To do that, he recommends a few things: Be proactive and reach out to friends; establish routines like a weekly phone call; liven up longstanding relationships by doing new things; make new friends by connecting around shared interests; and get more comfortable striking up conversations with strangers. The recipe is going to vary from person to person and depend on what amount of social interaction feels right for you. Having meaningful relationships really resonates with me. I know from my own life too that good, strong connections to family and friends are really important. And they are what ultimately make me happiest of all. Listen to the full episode with happiness professor Laurie Santos here, and join us next week on the podcast when we explore the surprising link between happiness and anxiety.

{"id": "2024_05_25_world_solar-magnetic-field-science-newsletter-wt-scn", "text": "I was lucky enough to catch an awesome glimpse of the northern lights\u00a0from my own home this month when the biggest solar storm to reach Earth in two decades made auroras visible at latitudes much farther south\u00a0than usual. Despite living in the light-filled streets of central London, my smartphone camera picked up a green haze and a pulsing sheet of purple and pink light. Capturing the moment was an unforgettable experience and one that I had thought would involve expensive travel to the northernmost reaches of our planet. The storms that create spectacular auroras such as those I witnessed originate from the sun\u2019s dynamic magnetic field, an astrophysical enigma that scientists this week came closer to unraveling. Solar update Figuring out how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works will help scientists improve the forecasting of space weather, which dazzles night sky watchers but can disrupt GPS and communication satellites. The sun\u2019s looping magnetic field lines, which form a tangled web of structures more complex than those on Earth, are difficult to study directly. To grasp what\u2019s going on, scientists create mathematical models. A new model, which took more than a decade to develop and required a NASA supercomputer to conduct the detailed calculations, found that the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated much closer to the surface than previously thought. The team believes its model is more accurate because it accounts for a unique solar feature.

The inferno consumed the wooden structure, situated in an Iron Age settlement called Tossal de Baltarga, and killed six animals penned in a stable. Archaeologists believe the fire was deliberate. Had it been accidental, the building\u2019s owners likely would have released the livestock and returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden gold, which was concealed in a jar. The arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic, according to the new study. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but the excavation uncovered telling details of the lives of an Iberian people called the Cerretani. Sky watch The builders of Stonehenge placed the huge stones that make up the prehistoric monument in line with sunrise and sunset on the longest and shortest days of the year, revealing an intimate understanding of the sun that\u2019s still palpable today. But does the 4,500-year-old site in southwest England \u2014 and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world \u2014 also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge has a lunar link first gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored \u2014 until now. This summer, archaeologists are using the lunar standstill, a little-known phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years, to investigate. Across the universe Space scientists have observed the edge of a black hole \u2014 an area known as the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 for the first time. Andrew Mummery, lead author of a new study on black holes and a research fellow at the University of Oxford, compared it to \u201cthe edge of a waterfall\u201d at the end of a river, where orbiting material from nearby stars plummets into the abyss. In the plunging region, matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead hurtles into the black hole. But unlike at the black hole\u2019s event horizon, or surface, light can still escape at this point. The study\u2019s findings, which Albert Einstein predicted, could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes. Wild kingdom Corvids \u2014 the group of birds that includes crows, ravens and jays \u2014 are famously smart. One corvid species may even be capable of something researchers refer to as \u201cmental time travel.\u201d This type of recollection enables the mind to recall a seemingly unimportant bit of information that you didn\u2019t consciously commit to memory \u2014 for instance, remembering what you had for lunch yesterday. Researchers working with Eurasian jays trained to find food hidden under cups said these birds may be capable of the feat of memory. In the experiment, which involved decorated cups, the jays were able to remember what a particular cup looked like, even after the cups were rearranged and a time delay. And in other corvid news, crows can count up to four, the latest research has found.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_crows-can-count-study-scn", "text": "Perhaps \u201cbirdbrained\u201d isn\u2019t such an insult after all \u2013\u2013 crows, the ubiquitous urban bird, can vocally count up to four, the latest research has found. Not only can the inquisitive creatures count, but they can match the number of calls they make when shown a numeral, according to a new study, led by a team of researchers with the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2019s animal physiology lab in Germany. The way the birds recognize and react to numbers is similar to a process we humans use, both to learn to count as toddlers and quickly recognize how many objects we\u2019re looking at. The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, deepen our growing understanding of crow intelligence. \u201cHumans do not have a monopoly on skills such as numerical thinking, abstraction, tool manufacture, and planning ahead,\u201d said animal cognition expert Heather Williams via email. \u201cNo one should be surprised that crows are \u2018smart.\u2019\u201d Williams, a professor of biology at Williams College in Massachusetts, was not involved in the study. In the animal kingdom, counting isn\u2019t limited to crows. Chimpanzees have been taught to count in numerical order and understand the value of numerals, much like young children. In attempting to woo mates, some male frogs count the number of calls from competing males to match or even one-up that number when it\u2019s their turn to croak at a female. Scientists have even theorized that ants retrace their paths back to their colonies by counting their steps, though the method isn\u2019t always accurate. What this latest study showed is that crows, like young humans, can learn to associate numerals with values \u2013\u2013 and count out loud accordingly. Can crows count much like toddlers do? The research was inspired by toddlers learning to count, said lead study author Diana Liao, a neurobiologist and senior researcher at the T\u00fcbingen lab. Toddlers use the words of numbers to tally the number of objects in front of them: If they see three toys in front of them, their counting could sound like \u201cone, two, three\u201d or \u201cone, one, one.\u201d Maybe crows could do the same, Liao thought. She was inspired, too, by a June 2005 study on chickadees tailoring their alarm calls to a predator\u2019s size. The larger a predator\u2019s wingspan or body length, the fewer \u201cdee\u201d sounds the chickadees used in their alarm call, the study found. The opposite was true for smaller predators \u2013\u2013 the songbirds would use more \u201cdee\u201d sounds if they encountered a smaller bird, which could be greater threats to chickadees since they are more agile, Liao said. The authors of the chickadee study couldn\u2019t confirm whether the small songbirds had control over the number of sounds they made or if the number of sounds were an involuntary response. But the possibility piqued Liao\u2019s curiosity \u2013\u2013 could crows, whose intelligence has been well-documented over decades of research, show control over their ability to produce a certain number of sounds, effectively \u201ccounting\u201d like toddlers do? The crows planned their number of caws Liao and her colleagues trained three carrion crows, a European species closely related to the American crow, over more than 160 sessions. During the trainings, the birds had to learn associations between a series of visual and auditory cues from 1 to 4 and produce the corresponding number of caws. In the example researchers provided, a visual cue might look like a bright blue numeral, and its corresponding audio could be the half-second song of a drumroll. The crows were expected to perform the same number of caws as the number represented by the cue \u2013\u2013 three caws for the cue with the numeral 3 \u2013\u2013 within 10 seconds of seeing and hearing the cue. When the birds had stopped counting and cawing, they would peck at an \u201center\u201d key on the touchscreen that presented their cues to confirm that they were done. If the birds had counted correctly, they\u2019d receive a treat. It appeared that as the cues continued, the crows took longer to react to each cue. Their reaction times grew as \u201cmore vocalizations were impending,\u201d Liao wrote, suggesting that the crows planned the number of caws they were going to make before they opened their beaks. The researchers could even tell how many calls the birds planned to make by the way their first call sounded \u2013\u2013 subtle acoustic differences that showed that the crows knew how many numbers they were looking at and had synthesized the information. \u201cThey understand abstract numbers \u2026 and then plan ahead as they match their behavior to match that number,\u201d Williams said. Even the mistakes the crows made were somewhat advanced: If the crows had cawed one too many times, stuttered over the same number or submitted their responses with their beak prematurely, Liao and her researchers could detect from the sound of the first call where they went wrong. These are the \u201csame kinds of errors humans make,\u201d Williams said. We\u2019re still learning how smart crows are Birds and many other animals were previously thought to make only on-the-spot decisions based on stimuli in their immediate environments, a theory popularized by the 20th century animal behaviorist B.F. Skinner. But the latest research by Liao and her colleagues provides more evidence about crows\u2019 ability to synthesize numbers to produce a sound and suggests that the skill is within their control. The study team\u2019s findings are highly specific but still significant \u2013\u2013 they challenge the once common belief that all animals are merely stimulus-response machines, said Kevin McGowan, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, who has spent more than two decades studying wild crows in their habitats. McGowan wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study, McGowan told CNN, demonstrated that \u201ccrows aren\u2019t just simple nonthinking machines out there reacting to their environment \u2013\u2013 they\u2019re actually thinking ahead and have the ability to communicate in a structured, preplanned way. It\u2019s sort of a necessary precursor for having a language.\u201d Crow intelligence has been studied for decades. Scientists have investigated New Caledonian crows creating their own compound tools to access food. The birds appear to establish rules, according to a November 2013 study coauthored by the University of T\u00fcbingen lab\u2019s lead researcher, Andreas Nieder. Crow language has confounded scientists for decades, too, with its widely varying tones and expressions, McGowan said. The study by Liao and her colleagues isn\u2019t even the first to consider whether crows can count. That research began with Nicholas Thompson in 1968, animal cognition expert Irene Pepperberg noted. A research professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Pepperberg is best known for her work with an African grey parrot named Alex. Thompson hypothesized that crows could count based on their caws, the duration and number of which the birds appeared to control in a given burst of sound. The crows\u2019 counting abilities \u201cseem to exceed the demands which survival makes for such abilities,\u201d he wrote. Another University of T\u00fcbingen study on crows\u2019 counting abilities from September 2015 trained the birds to recognize groupings of dots and recorded the activity of neurons in the part of the crows\u2019 brains that receives and makes sense of visual stimuli. The researchers found that the crows\u2019 neurons \u201cignore the dots\u2019 size, shape and arrangement and only extract their number,\u201d the university said in a statement at the time. \u201cSo, crows\u2019 brains can represent different quantities, and crows can quickly learn to match Arabic numerals to those quantities \u2013\u2013 something humans usually explicitly teach their children,\u201d Williams said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/crows-can-count-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}

Florida enacted a new law\u00a0on May 1, 2024, that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, with\u00a0a few exceptions\u00a0\u2013 including documented rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Florida joins the majority of\u00a0Southern states\u00a0that now have complete bans or highly restrictive abortion laws, enacted since the Supreme Court overturned the\u00a0federal right to get an abortion\u00a0in June 2022. Many of the restrictive laws ban abortion after a set number of weeks. Florida Republicans supporting the bill have labeled it a\u00a0reasonable compromise between a full abortion ban and few abortion restrictions. READ MORE: Mexico is a destination for Americans seeking reproductive health services  Some OB-GYNs\u00a0have explained that\u00a0many women\u00a0do not even know they are pregnant at\u00a0six weeks.\u00a0Research shows that women\u00a0on average find out they are pregnant at five and a half weeks. About 23% do not know until seven weeks of pregnancy or later. So, do Americans, including those enacting six-week bans, actually understand how the timing or dating of pregnancy works? We are\u00a0scholars\u00a0of\u00a0political science,\u00a0gender and public opinion\u00a0and are writing a book about public opinion on abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the federal right to get an abortion in June 2022. How does pregnancy work? To gain insights into this issue, we developed a few pregnancy questions and included them in a research survey in late September 2023. The survey had 1,356 respondents, who were broadly representative of the U.S. population. The respondents\u2019 median age was 46. Approximately 49% of these people were men, while 70% were white and 29% were college graduates. Meanwhile, 43% of them were Democrats, and 38% were Republicans. READ MORE: Fetal personhood rulings could nullify a pregnant patient\u2019s wishes for\u00a0end-of-life\u00a0care The first question asked respondents how pregnancies are dated.\u00a0The correct answer\u00a0is that pregnancies are dated using the first day of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period, which is often two to three weeks before conception. The second question asked about trimesters. Many Americans are familiar with the term trimester, and\u00a0polling consistently shows\u00a0that Americans find abortion most acceptable during the first trimester. We asked Americans if they knew approximately how many weeks a trimester was. The correct answer is 13. Americans\u2019 pregnancy knowledge We found that only one-third of respondents knew how pregnancy is dated. A majority \u2013 approximately 60% \u2013 falsely thought that pregnancy is dated from conception or in the weeks since the woman last had sex. Less than one-fourth of the respondents answered both pregnancy knowledge questions correctly. In our survey, we also asked respondents whether they support a six-week abortion ban. Similar to other\u00a0national surveys, we find that most Americans oppose strict abortion restrictions \u2013 only 35% support six-week bans. Importantly, we find that those who support six-week abortion bans are significantly less likely than others to correctly understand the timing of pregnancy. The statistically significant relationship between having low levels of pregnancy timing knowledge and support for a six-week abortion ban holds in analyses controlling for potentially confounding variables. Some anti-abortion lawmakers\u00a0have demonstrated\u00a0their\u00a0ignorance\u00a0about pregnancy\u00a0before. There is, for example, a long history of some anti-abortion politicians saying, incorrectly, that it is\u00a0extremely rare\u00a0for a person who is raped to get pregnant. Our survey shows that a large swath of those opposing abortion lack knowledge about the basics of pregnancy. A gender disparity Perhaps not surprisingly, women in this survey knew more about pregnancy than men. The question about how pregnancies are dated, for example, was answered correctly by 43% of women compared with only 23% of men. As mentioned above, a majority of Americans incorrectly believe pregnancy is dated from conception, but significantly more men than women think this is true. This finding is particularly important when considering the gender breakdown of the Florida state lawmakers who approved the six-week ban. Although we do not have data on the pregnancy knowledge of those legislators, we do know that those who voted for the ban were\u00a0overwhelmingly men. Florida\u2019s six-week ban will make it much harder for anyone to get abortions there \u2013 and it will also affect people in\u00a0neighboring states\u00a0who want or need an abortion. In 2023, Florida was home to the closest abortion clinic for\u00a06.4 million women\u00a0living in the South. In 2023,\u00a0around 7,700 women\u00a0from other Southern states,\u00a0where abortion is now largely banned, traveled to Florida to get abortions. Overall, our findings raise serious questions about whether Americans without medical training \u2013 much like those in our state legislatures \u2013 have the necessary knowledge needed to regulate abortion access.

{"id": "2024_05_20_health_california-phys-ed-heat-rules-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "Yahushua Robinson was an energetic boy who jumped and danced his way through life. Then, a physical education teacher instructed the 12-year-old to run outside on a day when the temperature climbed to\u00a0107 degrees. \u201cWe lose loved ones all the time, but he was taken in a horrific way,\u201d his mother, Janee Robinson, said from the family\u2019s Inland Empire home, about 80 miles southeast of Los Angeles. \u201cI would never want nobody to go through what I\u2019m going through.\u201d The day her son died, Robinson, who teaches phys ed, kept her elementary school students inside, and she had hoped her children\u2019s teachers would do the same. The Riverside County Coroner\u2019s Bureau ruled that Yahushua died on Aug. 29 of a heart defect, with heat and physical exertion as contributing factors. His death at Canyon Lake Middle School came on the second day of an excessive heat warning, when people were\u00a0advised to avoid strenuous activities\u00a0and limit their time outdoors. Yahushua\u2019s family is supporting\u00a0a bill\u00a0in California that would require the state Department of Education to create guidelines that govern physical activity at public schools during extreme weather, including setting threshold temperatures for when it\u2019s too hot or too cold for students to exercise or play sports outside. If the measure becomes law, the guidelines will have to be in place by Jan. 1, 2026. Many states have adopted protocols to protect student athletes from extreme heat during practices. But the California bill is broader and would require educators to consider all students throughout the school day and in any extreme weather, whether they\u2019re doing jumping jacks in fourth period or playing tag during recess. It\u2019s unclear if the bill will clear a critical committee vote scheduled for May 16. \u201cYahushua\u2019s story, it\u2019s very touching. It\u2019s very moving. I think it could have been prevented had we had the right safeguards in place,\u201d said state Sen. Melissa Hurtado (D-Bakersfield), one of the bill\u2019s authors. \u201cClimate change is impacting everyone, but it\u2019s especially impacting vulnerable communities, especially our children.\u201d Last year marked the planet\u2019s warmest on record, and extreme weather is becoming more frequent and severe, according to the\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Even though most heat deaths and illnesses are preventable, about\u00a01,220 people in the United States are killed by extreme heatevery year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Young children are especially\u00a0susceptible to heat illness\u00a0because their bodies have more trouble regulating temperature, and they rely on adults to protect them from overheating. A person can go from feeling dizzy or experiencing a headache to passing out, having a seizure, or going into a coma, said\u00a0Chad Vercio, a physician and the division chief of general pediatrics at Loma Linda University Health. \u201cIt can be a really dangerous thing,\u201d Vercio said of heat illness. \u201cIt is something that we should take seriously and figure out what we can do to avoid that.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many children have died at school from heat exposure. Eric Robinson, 15, had been sitting in his sports medicine class learning about heatstroke when his sister arrived at his high school unexpectedly the day their brother died. \u201cThey said, \u2018OK, go home, Eric. Go home early.\u2019 I walked to the car and my sister\u2019s crying. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that my little brother\u2019s gone. That I won\u2019t be able to see him again. And he\u2019d always bugged me, and I would say, \u2018Leave me alone.\u2019\u201d That morning, Eric had done Yahushua\u2019s hair and loaned him his hat and chain necklace to wear to school. As temperatures climbed into the 90s that morning, a physical education teacher instructed Yahushua to run on the blacktop. His friends told the family that the sixth grader had repeatedly asked the teacher for water but was denied, his parents said. The school district has refused to release video footage to the family showing the moment Yahushua collapsed on the blacktop. He died later that day at the hospital. Melissa Valdez, a Lake Elsinore Unified School District spokesperson, did not respond to calls seeking comment. Schoolyards can reach\u00a0dangerously high temperatures\u00a0on hot days, with asphalt sizzling up to 145 degrees, according to findings by researchers at the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. Some school districts, such as\u00a0San Diego Unified and\u00a0Santa Ana Unified, have hot weather plans or guidelines that call for limiting physical activity and providing water to kids. But there are no statewide standards that K-12 schools must implement to protect students from heat illness. Under the bill, the California Department of Education must set temperature thresholds requiring schools to modify students\u2019 physical activities during extreme weather, such as heat waves, wildfires, excessive rain, and flooding. Schools would also be required to come up with plans for alternative indoor activities, and staff must be trained to recognize and respond to weather-related distress. California has had heat rules on the books for outdoor workers since 2005, but it was a latecomer to\u00a0protecting student athletes, according to the\u00a0Korey Stringer Institute\u00a0at the University of Connecticut, which is named after a Minnesota Vikings football player who died from heatstroke in 2001. By comparison, Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, this spring\u00a0signed a law\u00a0preventing cities and counties from creating their own heat protections for outdoor workers, has the best protections for student athletes, according to the institute. Douglas Casa, a professor of kinesiology and the chief executive officer of the institute, said state regulations can establish consistency about how to respond to heat distress and save lives. \u201cThe problem is that each high school doesn\u2019t have a cardiologist and doesn\u2019t have a thermal physiologist and doesn\u2019t have a sickling expert,\u201d Casa said of the medical specialties for heat illness. In 2022, California released an\u00a0Extreme Action Heat Plan\u00a0that recommended state agencies \u201cexplore implementation of indoor and outdoor heat exposure rules for schools,\u201d but neither the administration of Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, nor lawmakers have adopted standards. Lawmakers last year failed to pass legislation that would have required schools to implement a heat plan and replace hot surfaces, such as cement and rubber, with lower-heat surfaces, such as grass and cool pavement.\u00a0That bill, which drew opposition from school administrators, stalled in committee, in part over cost concerns. Naj Alikhan, a spokesperson for the Association of California School Administrators, said the new bill takes a different approach and would not require structural and physical changes to schools. The association has not taken a position on the measure, and no other organization has registered opposition. The Robinson family said children\u2019s lives ought to outweigh any costs that might come with preparing schools to deal with the growing threat of extreme weather. Yahushua\u2018s death, they say, could save others. \u201cI really miss him. I cry every day,\u201d said Yahushua\u2019s father, Eric Robinson. \u201cThere\u2019s no one day that go by that I don\u2019t cry about my boy.\u201d KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/california-phys-ed-heat-rules-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_health_weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-young-people", "text": "The number of young people in the US who are prescribed GLP-1 agonist drugs\u00a0like Wegovy and Ozempic for weight loss and diabetes soared 594.4% in just three years, according to new research. Demand for these drugs has skyrocketed for people of all ages recently, but the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal JAMA, found that between 2020 and 2023, the number of prescriptions written for people ages 12 to 25 increased from 8,722 to 60,567. Young women and adolescent girls had the biggest increase in the number of prescriptions. The study looked information from a database that reports prescriptions from more than 93% of retail pharmacies in the United States, although the data cannot capture what exactly the prescriptions were intended to treat and whether the patient actually used the medications. For context, the study authors also looked at prescription trends for other medications and found that there was a 3% decrease in the prescription of other drugs for this age category during this same time period. The study looked at Ozempic (which uses the active ingredient semaglutide), Trulicity (dulaglutide) and Byetta (exenatide), which are approved to treat type 2 diabetes and can help with weight loss, and Saxenda (liraglutide) and Wegovy (semaglutide), which are approved for weight management. Each can be prescribed for children as young as 10 or 12. Tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, is approved only for adults. The authors from the University of Michigan Medical School and Yale University said that, given how many young people are being prescribed these medications, efforts to promote safe and appropriate prescribing should include endocrinologists, doctors who practice family medicine and nurse practitioners. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are affecting an increasing number of young people. The number of people ages 10 to 19 with type 2 diabetes doubled just over the past two decades in the US, a 2023 study found. The study predicted that by 2060, the number of young people with type 2 diabetes will increase 673%. Obesity is also a significant problem for young people in the US, where the average young adult is now overweight, according to a 2023 study. About 1 in 6 adolescents is overweight, and almost 1 in 5 has obesity, studies show. Obesity alone affects 14.4 million children and teens in the US. Having obesity as a young person significantly increases a person\u2019s chance of weight problems when they are older, research shows. Obesity and overweight can also be a significant risk factor for other health conditions like heart disease, kidney problems and even cancer, studies show, in additional to mental health conditions. Dr. Melanie Cree, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado who has been working with this class of medication in clinical trials with children for almost a decade, says the drugs have been a game-changer not just to help kids lose weight and lower blood sugar, but also to  lower liver fat and improve cardiac and kidney function \u2013 \u201call of those conditions that go with type 2 diabetes.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s not only that they\u2019re lowering blood sugars. It\u2019s that they appear to be decreasing the complications that we see from type 2 diabetes, so that they\u2019re really affecting multiple aspects,\u201d said Cree, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cThey\u2019re really changing the face of what diabetes looks like in an individual and in the field of diabetes across the board.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics updated its guidelines for managing obesity last year and said that, in addition to behavior and lifestyle treatments for the whole family, the use of weight loss medications is appropriate for children 12 and over. Cree said she sees few downsides to these drugs. Some of her patients have had to stop taking them or can\u2019t take as much because of side effects like nausea, and she\u2019d like to see more research on that topic. When her patients can get access, Cree said, the positive changes have been significant. Many have experienced \u201cprofound\u201d weight loss, she said, transforming their lives. The most significant downsides have nothing to do with the physical impact of the medications; rather, it\u2019s that the medicine can be expensive and many of her patients can\u2019t get insurance to cover the cost, particularly if they\u2019re used for weight loss. Additionally, many patients have had a hard time filling prescriptions because of drug shortages. One parent of a child who lost a significant amount of weight told Cree that the medicine gave her her daughter back. \u201cI had another girl who, after some weight loss, went to prom last fall, and it was the first dance she had ever gone to, because it was the first time she felt comfortable wearing a dress,\u201d Cree said. \u201cSo really, really poignant stories from these adolescents.

{"id": "2024_05_21_health_nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness", "text": "The nightmares are intense and often horrifying, sometimes lasting well into the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a serial killer after me and the last few years I have the same one,\u201d according to a Canadian patient. \u201cHe\u2019s got my legs or something I can still feel something on my legs even when I\u2019m then awake.\u201d Another English patient described nightmares \u201cwhere I can\u2019t breathe and where someone is sitting on my chest.\u201d Yet another shared stories of \u201creally nasty\u201d violent visions in their sleep. \u201cHorrific, like murders, like skin coming off people,\u201d said one Irish patient about his nightmares. \u201cI think it\u2019s like when I\u2019m overwhelmed which could be the lupus being bad \u2026 so I think the more stress my body is under then the more vivid and bad the dreaming would be.\u201d Nightmares and \u201cdaymares,\u201d dreamlike hallucinations that appear when awake, may be little-known signs of the onset of lupus and other systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to a new study published Monday in the journal eClinicalMedicine. Such unusual symptoms may also be a signal that an established disease may be about to intensely worsen or \u201cflare\u201d and require medical treatment, said lead study author Melanie Sloan, a researcher in the department of public health and primary care at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. \u201cThis is particularly the case in a disease like lupus, which is well known for affecting multiple organs including the brain, but we also found these patterns of symptoms in the other rheumatological diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and systemic sclerosis,\u201d Sloan said in an email. Lupus is a long-term disease in which the body\u2019s immune system goes haywire, attacking healthy tissue and causing inflammation and pain in any part of the body, including blood cells, the brain, heart, joints and muscles, kidneys, liver, and lungs. \u201cCognitive problems and many of these other neuropsychiatric symptoms we studied can have a huge influence on people\u2019s lives, ability to work, to socialize, and just to have as much of a normal life as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThese symptoms are often invisible and (currently) untestable but that shouldn\u2019t make them any less important to be considered for treatment and support.\u201d Jennifer Mundt, an assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who was not involved in the study, said in an email she was pleased the study focused on nightmares. \u201cAlthough nightmares are a very distressing problem in many medical and psychiatric conditions, they rarely get focused on except in the context of PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome),\u201d Mundt said. \u201cA\u00a0recent study\u00a0showed that 18% of people with long-COVID have (frequent) nightmares, and this compares to a general population prevalence of about 5%,\u201d she said. \u201cHearing the patient perspective is critical so that research and clinical care can be guided by what is most important to patients themselves.\u201d Doctors and patients need to know While research in the field is rather new, a March 2019 study found patients with inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases also experienced nightmares and other REM sleep disorders such as sleep paralysis. REM is short for rapid eye movement, the stage of sleep in which people dream and information and information and experiences are consolidated and stored in memory. In that study, one 57-year-old man recalled being \u201cthreatened by feral birds of prey\u201d in his nightmares, while a 70-year-old woman dreamed her nephew was in grave danger but she could do nothing to help him. The new study surveyed 400 doctors and 676 people living with lupus and also conducted detailed interviews with 50 clinicians and 69 people living with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including lupus. Researchers found 3 in 5 lupus patients, and 1 in 3 patients with other rheumatology-related diseases, had increasingly vivid and distressing nightmares just before their hallucinations. These nightmares often involved falling or being attacked, trapped, or crushed or committing murder. \u201cI\u2019d be riding a horse, going around cutting people out with my sword. One of them was somebody attacking me and I ended up slitting their throat,\u201d the English patient said. \u201cI\u2019m not a violent person at all. I don\u2019t even kill an insect,\u201d the patient continued. \u201cAnd I came to the conclusion that\u2019s probably me fighting my own (autoimmune) system. \u2026 I\u2019m probably attacking myself, that\u2019s the only thing I can logically make sense out of it. Systemic autoimmune diseases often have a range of symptoms, called prodromes, that appear as signs of a sudden and possibly dangerous worsening of the condition. In lupus, for example, headaches, an increase in fatigue, painful, swollen joints, rashes, dizziness and a fever without an infection are well-known signs of an upcoming flare. Recognizing these warning signs are important, Sloan said, because they allow \u201cearlier detection and therefore treatment of flares, some of which can be organ damaging and even fatal in lupus patients.\u201d However, unique warning symptoms such as nightmares and daymares are not in the diagnostic criteria for lupus or other diseases, Sloan said. The study found doctors infrequently ask about such experiences, and patients often avoid talking about them to their physicians. \u201cWe are strongly encouraging more doctors to ask about nightmares and other neuropsychiatric symptoms \u2014 thought to be unusual, but actually very common in systemic autoimmunity \u2014 to help us detect disease flares earlier,\u201d said senior study author David D\u2019Cruz, a consultant rheumatologist at Guy\u2019s Hospital and Kings College London. Connect the dots to autoimmune disease On first glance, it would make sense that such neurological manifestations as nightmares would occur if the autoimmune disease impacts the brain, which lupus often does, Sloan said. But that\u2019s not what the study uncovered. \u201cInterestingly, we found that lupus patients who were classified as having organ involvement other than the brain, such as kidneys or lungs, often also reported a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the lead up to their kidney/lung flare,\u201d Sloan said via email. \u201cThis suggests that monitoring these symptoms \u2014 such as nightmares and changing mood \u2014 as well as the usual rashes and protein in the urine (due to inflammation in the kidneys), etc., may help with earlier flare detection in many patients, not just those who go on to develop major brain involvement,\u201d she said. However, there is no reason for people with occasional nightmares or daytime dreams to be worried they may have an inflammatory autoimmune disease, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. \u201cThis study could alarm the general public into believing or worrying\u00a0about whether they have lupus or a related autoimmune disorder if they have nightmares or hallucinations, which are what doctors call \u2018nonspecific symptoms,\u2019 meaning that a variety of conditions (medical and psychiatric) can manifest with these symptoms,\u201d Schenck said in an email. It is indeed \u201cperfectly normal\u201d to have occasional nightmares and even daymares, or hallucinations, which \u201care also more common than we think,\u201d Sloan said. However, if those are intense, upsetting and occur around other symptoms such as extreme fatigue, headaches and other signs of autoimmune disorders, they \u201cshould be discussed with a doctor,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be afraid or embarrassed to talk about these symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases, reporting these symptoms earlier, even if they seem strange and unconnected, may lead to the doctor being able to \u2018join the dot\u2019s\u2019 to diagnose an autoimmune disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/health/nightmares-daymares-autoimmune-flares-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_01_11_health_short-attention-span-wellness", "text": "I\u2019ve been working steadily for hours but feel as if I haven\u2019t even started. My attention is being pulled from my assigned task \u2014 writing this story \u2014 by a myriad of what I believe are necessary work interruptions. (OK, a couple were from my cat, who also firmly believes in their necessity.)   My kids and I call days like this \u201csquirrel days\u201d in honor of Dug, the talking dog in (squirrel !!) the 2009 Pixar movie \u201cUp,\u201d who (squirrel !!) was constantly distracted by well, just about (squirrel !!) \u2026 Unfortunately, all too many of us are having \u201csquirrel\u201d days, according to Dr. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who studies how digital media affects our lives. In her book \u201cAttention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity,\u201d Mark explains how decades of research have tracked the decline of the ability to focus. \u201cIn 2004, we measured the average attention on a screen to be 2\u00bd minutes,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSome years later, we found attention spans to be about 75 seconds. Now we find people can only pay attention to one screen for an average of 47 seconds.\u201d Not only do people concentrate for less than a minute on any one screen, Mark said, but when attention is diverted from an active work project, they take about 25 minutes to refocus on that task. (Wait, what??) \u201cIn fact, our research shows it takes 25 minutes, 26 seconds, before we go back to the original working sphere or project,\u201d Mark said. Why you have a short attention span How can that be? \u201cIf we look at work in terms of switching projects, as opposed to the micro view of switching screens, we find people spend about 10\u00bd  minutes in any work project before being interrupted \u2014 internally or by someone else \u2014 and then switch to another work project,\u201d Mark said. Yes, but then we go back to the original work, right? Wrong, Mark said. Instead, when we are interrupted on project two, we switch yet again to a different task \u2014 call it project three. Unbelievably, her research has shown we are also interrupted on project three and move on to project four.   \u201cAnd then you go back and pick up the original interrupted project,\u201d Mark said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019re interrupted and you do nothing. For over 25 minutes, you\u2019re actually working on other things.\u201d  (At least I can tell my boss that when I miss my deadline.) \u201cHowever, there\u2019s also a switch cost,\u201d Mark added. \u201cA switch cost is the time it takes you to reorient back to your work: \u2018Where was I? What was I thinking of?\u2019 That additional effort can also lead to errors and stress.\u201d How to focus Why is all of this a problem? After all, it\u2019s called multitasking, thought by many to be a highly prized skill for coping with the demands of the information age.  \u201cWith the exception of a few rare individuals, there is no such thing as multitasking,\u201d Mark said. \u201cUnless one of the tasks is automatic, like chewing gum or walking, you cannot do two effortful things at the same time.\u201d For example, she said, you can\u2019t read email and be in a video meeting. When you focus on one thing, you lose the other. \u201cYou\u2019re actually switching your attention very quickly between the two,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd when you switch your attention fast, it\u2019s correlated with stress.\u201d  Blood pressure rises. Heart rate speeds up. Psychological measures of stress also show negative outcomes, she said, such as more fatigue and mistakes and less productivity: \u201cThe more people multitask, the more errors they make.\u201d  Who did this to us? We did, of course, with the help of tech culprits such as social media, tablets and television. But Mark blames email the most.    \u201cTo me, email is probably the worst because it\u2019s become a symbol of work,\u201d she said, adding that her research has found a direct correlation between email and more stress. \u201cWe cut off email for some workers in an organization for one workweek,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing heart rate monitors, we found that they became significantly less stressed and were able to focus significantly longer.\u201d  (I find myself pausing to look up flights to Bora Bora. Oh, right. They have email there, too.) \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a person can just completely cut off from technology and work in today\u2019s world,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSo let\u2019s learn how to live with it in a way that maintains our positive well-being.\u201d How to increase your attention span Regaining your focus requires you to be mindful of how you are using technology, Mark said, a daunting task if you consider the average American spends at least 10 hours a day on screens. Paradoxically, you can use technology to help, she said. Schedule rote work for the first part of the day when you\u2019re not fully alert, then use technology to block distractions when you\u2019re at your mental best. At night, offload tasks from your brain by writing them down and then put the list away. Distracted by social media sites? Hide them, Mark said: \u201cTake the icons off your desktop and bury the apps on your phone inside folders, where it takes an extra effort to find them. Leave your phone in another room or put it in a drawer and lock it.\u201d    It\u2019s also important to learn when to take a break. \u201cIf you have to read something more than once or if the words are just not registering, it\u2019s time to stop and replenish,\u201d she said. The best break is a walk in nature: \u201cJust a 20-minute walk in nature can help significantly relax people,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd we found it can help people produce significantly more ideas \u2014 it\u2019s called divergent thinking.\u201d Too cold to walk outside? Do something engaging that takes no mental effort. \u201cI have a friend who is an MIT professor, and his favorite activity is matching socks,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnother friend likes to iron. Ideas can incubate and then we come back to the hard work, and we see it with fresh eyes.\u201d  ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/01/11/health/short-attention-span-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_health_slouching-spine-health-conversation-partner-wellness", "text": "Often a posture assigned to teenagers and disaffected youth, slouching is traditionally considered to be a \u201cbad\u201d posture \u2014 with some claiming it will damage your spine and cause pain. The term itself hails from medieval Norse meaning \u201clazy fellow\u201d \u2014 and later the middle English word meaning \u201cwalking, sitting or standing with a loose attitude.\u201d In the last 150 years or so, posture has come to be associated with aspects of a person\u2019s value, dignity, respectability and morality.\u00a0Erect posture\u00a0has been deemed \u201chealthy,\u201d \u201cthe aesthetic utopia,\u201d \u201cdignified,\u201d \u201ca backbone against subjugation,\u201d \u201cattractive\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d by various cultures, political movements and even social media influencers. READ MORE: Why sitting with crossed legs could be bad for you So it\u2019s not difficult to see then how slouching came to be considered \u201cbad\u201d for us since it\u2019s long been considered to be a bodily representation of negativity. But while posture is heavily overlaid with psychological meaning, is it really that bad for our spines if we slouch? Are certain postures really \u201cgood\u201d and others \u201cbad\u201d? The great news is that in the past two decades, there\u2019s been a plethora of rigorous clinical studies conducted which have concluded that there\u2019s\u00a0no relationship\u00a0between slouching and spinal pain. There\u2019s also\u00a0no evidence\u00a0that people who slouch are more likely to suffer with back or neck pain compared to non-slouchers. There\u2019s also no clear evidence that slouching while sitting at your desk or while using your phone causes damage to the spine. Even the UK government\u2019s latest guidance on\u00a0working with screens\u00a0puts less emphasis on an idealised posture at the workstation. READ MORE: Understanding that chronic back pain originates from within the brain helps recovery Instead, they emphasise the importance of adopting comfortable positions, varying your positions, avoiding awkward positions (such as flexing or arching your back or neck) and including regular breaks from your static posture throughout the day. All of these tips will help reduce the risk of\u00a0developing pain\u00a0and muscle fatigue. So if you experience back or neck pain, you can rest assured that the posture you adopt when walking or sitting probably isn\u2019t to blame as much as you might have been led to believe. Instead, it\u2019s probably related more to other features of life \u2014 such as how\u00a0stressed\u00a0or\u00a0physically active\u00a0you are and if you have\u00a0previously had back pain. There\u2019s a pretty good reason why slouching doesn\u2019t damage our spines, and that is because our spines are designed to allow movements as diverse as Olympic weightlifting to limbo dancing. Our spines aren\u2019t going to be damaged by a bit of sitting down, even if we happen to be wiggling our fingers on a keyboard at the same time. And while standing desks are popular, prolonged standing is no more comfortable for the spine than prolonged sitting READ MORE: Why you get shorter as you age The best thing to do throughout your day, to both make your body feel more comfortable and to\u00a0increase your productivity\u00a0and positive sense of well-being is to break up prolonged periods at your desk with breaks to walk, stretch, stand or sit down. Positive posture But there is one area where slouching may have a negative effect. Slouching has been linked to poorer information and memory recall, as well as worse mood when compared to\u00a0sitting upright. These memory and mood problems are shown to be\u00a0rapidly improved\u00a0when moving from a slouched to\u00a0erect posture. So perhaps there is some truth to the notion that slouching may still be a bodily representation of negativity. But aside from that, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests there\u2019s\u00a0no single, ideal or good posture. Differences in spinal posture are not related to pain. And, in fact, posture naturally varies from person to person \u2014 and can even vary depending on\u00a0race, sex, and even mood. So if you\u2019re a sloucher, rest assured that it isn\u2019t really bad for you and is as good as any other posture you adopt. Comfortable postures are safe and sitting is not dangerous. READ MORE: Surgery won\u2019t fix my chronic back pain, so what will? Overall, the human spine is designed to be on the move rather than static in one posture for long periods, which is why movement and changing your posture throughout the day is important to reduce fatigue and subsequent discomfort. If you can\u2019t move around and spend all day slouched in front of the computer, this may cause you some discomfort \u2014 but it\u2019s not actually damaging your spine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/health/slouching-spine-health-conversation-partner-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_new-experiments-milk-h5n1-infected-cows-raise-questions-flash-pasteurization", "text": "New lab experiments with milk from cows infected by H5N1 influenza,\u00a0known as\u00a0bird flu, confirm that it is infectious, especially when left raw, or untreated, and\u00a0potentially even when\u00a0flash pasteurized. The researchers, from the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, are part of a federally funded program called the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response, or CEIRR.\u00a0This network has been conducting rapid research to answer pressing questions in the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle. In a research letter posted online on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers describe the results of experiments using milk from four infected cows \u2014 two from New Mexico and two from Kansas. Because H5N1 virus is considered a select agent, it was handled in a high-security Biosafety Level 3 lab at the University of Wisconsin, using strict safety protocols. First, they confirmed the raw milk was chock-full of H5N1 virus.\u00a0 Then, they stored some of the raw milk at refrigerator temperature to see if levels of the virus in milk would drop off over time.\u00a0 Over 5 weeks, viral levels in raw milk dropped a bit, but not much. \u201cThat it wasn\u2019t decaying over time is concerning,\u201d said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Emory University who is also part of the CEIRR network but was not involved in the study. In another series of tests, the researchers checked to see what types of pasteurization might work best for inactivating the virus. They heated small samples of the milk at times and temperatures used in two types of pasteurization: low-temperature, long-time, or vat pasteurization; and high-temperature short-time, or flash pasteurization, which is the most common method used in the US today,\u00a0according to\u00a0the International Dairy Foods Association. Heating the milk to 63 degrees Celsius, or 145 degrees Fahrenheit, for intervals between 5 and 30 minutes \u2014 the vat pasteurization method \u2014 reduced the virus to undetectable levels. Heating the milk to 72 degrees Celsius, or 181 degrees Fahrenheit, for 15 or 20 seconds \u2014 conditions that approximated flash pasteurization \u2014 greatly reduced levels of the virus in the milk, but it didn\u2019t inactivate it completely. Milk samples heated for 15 or 20 seconds were still able to infect incubated chicken eggs, a test the US Food and Drug Administration has called the gold-standard for determining whether viruses remain infectious in milk. \u201cBut, we emphasize that the conditions used in our laboratory study are not identical to the large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,\u201d senior study author Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist who specializes in the study of flu and Ebola, said in an email. That\u2019s a good reason not to panic over the study findings, said Lakdawala. Lakdawala said that commercial flash pasteurization involves a preheating step, which wasn\u2019t done here.\u00a0It also involves homogenization, a process that emulsifies the fat globules in milk so the cream won\u2019t separate.\u00a0Both of those steps would probably make it harder for the virus to survive, but she adds that the results of this study suggest full process of commercial flash pasteurization should be done \u201cwith all the steps in place.\u201d Recent tests of\u00a0297 dairy products\u00a0purchased at retail stores by the FDA found traces\u00a0of\u00a0genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 of 5 milk samples, and further testing confirmed the viral fragments were inert and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to the general public is low, but people\u00a0should not eat or drink\u00a0raw milk or products made from it. To date, H5N1 influenza has been found in\u00a058 dairy herds in nine states.\u00a0 Michigan has now surpassed Texas as the state with the greatest number of infected herds. To test whether the raw milk could infect other animals, researchers also squirted\u00a0some of the milk\u00a0into the mouths of mice.\u00a0 The animals showed signs of illness the next day. On day four, the mice hadn\u2019t died of their infections, but they were euthanized so that researchers could see what parts of their bodies had become infected. Scientists found the virus all over their bodies, with high viral loads in the lungs and respiratory tract.\u00a0 They also found virus in the mammary glands of the mice, even though they weren\u2019t producing milk at the time. Taken together, their findings confirm that raw milk can infect susceptible animals, the researchers said\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and that could also indicate a risk to humans. In a recent news briefing, officials with the US Department of Agriculture said that to their knowledge, none of the raw milk from farms known to have H5N1 infections was being sold to consumers. Not all dairy farms are testing their cows, however, and some of the infected cows in the current outbreak have not shown any symptoms. \u201cRaw milk is unsafe at any speed, and the notion that you could protect yourself against H5 infection by consuming it is erroneous. There are there are much safer ways to protect oneself namely avoiding raw milk,\u201d CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah said in a briefing. Asked if the\u00a0raw\u00a0milk\u00a0in the new experiments\u00a0looked different than normal, Kawaoka said the researchers only got a small number of samples but some had more debris than milk from healthy cows. That would get filtered out prior to sale, he said.\u00a0Some of the milk looked yellow-ish, but he points out that milk from healthy and infected cows would likely be mixed together in a big vat, making it look normal \u2014 and\u00a0impossible to tell whether milk is safe to drink just by looking at it. \u201cThis is good quality research with conclusions backed up by solid data,\u201d said Dr. Ruth Harvey, deputy director of the Worldwide Influenza Center at the Francis Crick Institute in London, in a comment on the study given to the nonprofit Science Media Centre. \u201cThe limitations of the experimental set-up for the heat inactivation part of the research are clearly stated: that the conditions used are not identical to large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThe findings that viable virus was found in the milk samples after 5 weeks of storage at (4 degrees Celsius), and that mice could be infected through drinking milk containing the virus, back up the conclusions that drinking raw milk could pose a risk,\u201d Harvey added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/new-experiments-milk-h5n1-infected-cows-raise-questions-flash-pasteurization/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_glp-1-drugs-stomach-paralysis", "text": "Injected medications that treat diabetes and obesity increase the risk of a rare but serious side effect: stomach paralysis, according to new data on the real-world use of the drugs. At least three new studies based on large collections of patient records show that the risk of being diagnosed with stomach paralysis, or gastroparesis, is higher for people who take GLP-1 agonists than for those who don\u2019t. The studies have not been scrutinized by outside experts or published in medical journals, so the data is considered preliminary. Two were presented Saturday at the medical conference Digestive Disease Week 2024 in Washington; the third is slated to be presented Monday. Injected medications called GLP-1 agonists are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss.\u00a0In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose at least 10% of their starting weight.\u00a0Studies have also concluded that they have benefits for the heart as well as the waistline. Drugmaker Novo Nordisk said 25,000 people are starting Wegovy every week in the US alone. The drugs curb hunger by slowing passage of food through the stomach. They also help the body release more insulin and help send signals to the brain that turn down cravings. In some people, however, these medications can also cause unpleasant-to-severe bouts of vomiting, which may require medical attention.\u00a0They can also slow the stomach so much that medical tests show a condition called gastroparesis. Most of the time, doctors say, gastroparesis will improve after stopping the medication.\u00a0But some people say that their condition did not get better even months after coming off the drug, with life-altering consequences. Measuring the risk of gastroparesis In the new studies, the risk of gastroparesis appears to be rare, but it is consistent.\u00a0Compared with similar people who didn\u2019t take GLP-1 medications, those who did had about a 50% higher risk of being diagnosed with the condition. One study led by researchers at University Hospitals in Cleveland used records collected by the TriNetX database, which includes millions of patient records from 80 contributing heath care organizations.\u00a0The analysis focused on adults who were obese, with a body mass index higher than 30, but who did not have a diagnosis of diabetes and had not been diagnosed with gastroparesis or pancreatitis at least six months before starting a GLP-1 medication.\u00a0Records from more than 286,000 patients were included in the study. Diabetes by itself can also increase the risk of gastroparesis, especially if a person\u2019s blood sugar hasn\u2019t been well-controlled for a long period of time. Among people who were prescribed a GLP-1 medication for weight loss \u2013 such as semaglutide (branded as Ozempic and Wegovy), exenatide (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza) \u2013 10 out of every 10,000, or 0.1%, were diagnosed with gastroparesis at least six months later.\u00a0By comparison, 4 out of 10,000 people, or 0.04%, who were matched in the database based on their age, sex, ethnicity and other factors, but who were not taking a GLP-1 medication, developed the condition. The difference, which was statistically significant, amounted to a 52% increased risk of being diagnosed with stomach paralysis while on a GLP-1 medication. A second study, led by researchers at the University of Kansas, also used records from the TriNetX research network database.\u00a0It included patients who were prescribed GLP-1 medications for diabetes or obesity between December 2021 and November 2022, and it compared them with people who had diabetes or obesity and had been seen by a doctor during the same time frame but had not been prescribed a GLP-1 medication. Records from nearly 300,000 patients were included in the study. Compared with those who were not taking a GLP-1 medication, those who did were about 66% more likely to be diagnosed with gastroparesis.\u00a0This study found that 0.53% of patients on GLP-1 medications were diagnosed with stomach paralysis, or about 1 case of gastroparesis for every 200 people taking the drugs. People taking GLP-1 medications were also more likely to have nausea and vomiting or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to be prescribed a proton pump inhibitor.\u00a0They were more likely to have their gallbladders removed and experience drug-induced pancreatitis. \u201cAlthough these drugs do work and should be used for the right reason, we just want to caution everyone that if you do decide to start this, be prepared that you have a 30 percent chance that you may have GI side effects, and then the drug may have to be discontinued,\u201d said study author Dr. Prateek Sharma, a professor of medicine at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. Some side effects with the medications may also diminish over time as people get used to their doses. This is one reason doctors start with a low dose of the drug and work up to higher amounts over time. Sharma noted that the study included people who had diabetes in both the group taking the GLP-1 medications and in the comparison group, and they still found a higher incidence of stomach paralysis in those taking the medications, suggesting that diabetes alone wasn\u2019t driving the increased risk. \u201cThe drug was the only thing which was different between these two groups,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we do show that all GI side effects or symptoms, nausea, vomiting and gastroparesis, were significantly higher in the GLP-1 takers as compared to the controls,\u201d said Sharma, who is also president-elect of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Was an adverse event missed in clinical trials? Even though these drugs have been extensively studied, Sharma thinks it is possible that gastroparesis is rare enough that it didn\u2019t show up in the drugs\u2019 clinical trials because they didn\u2019t include enough patients. \u201cYou need hundreds of thousands of patients to come up with these conclusions, but that\u2019s why I think these database studies are much more important there,\u201d Sharma said. Another reason it may have been missed in clinical trials was the way researchers often test for it, according to Dr. Michael Camilleri, a gastroenterologist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic who has studied gastroparesis with the GLP-1 drug liraglutide. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, if you\u2019re going to study the problem with gastric emptying, you have to look at the gastric emptying of solids, not of liquids,\u201d from the stomach, Camilleri said. Liquids pass through the stomach more rapidly than solids. \u201cWhen the pharmaceutical companies did the appraisal of the effects of this class of medications on gastric emptying, they usually use a method that assesses the emptying of liquids from the stomach,\u201d he said. It\u2019s called the acetaminophen absorption test, and it\u2019s often used because it\u2019s faster and less expensive than a gastric emptying study with scintigraphy, which uses a radioactive tracer to see how much solid food is left in the stomach hours after a meal. Acetaminophen is absorbed through the stomach and carried into the bloodstream by liquids. Measuring how quickly acetaminophen shows up in the blood can give an idea how fast liquids are passing through the stomach, but not solids. Camilleri and other experts say acetaminophen absorption is not an adequate test for gastroparesis on GLP-1 medications. Camilleri was a co-author on a third study being presented Monday at Digestive Disease Week that looked at gastroparesis with GLP-1 medications. That study combed through records of nearly 80,000 patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication by doctors in the Mayo Clinic\u2019s health system.\u00a0The researchers focused on a subset of 839 people who\u2019d had symptoms of gastroparesis and who had gotten a gold-standard test for the condition: a procedure called gastric emptying scintigraphy. About one-third of that group, 241 people, had food in their stomach four hours after eating a test meal, which means they qualified as having gastroparesis. However, the study didn\u2019t calculate the difference in the risk of gastroparesis between people using the drugs and those who were not. Camilleri said it\u2019s likely that the gastroparesis risk is be underestimated in these studies because not everyone who had symptoms would have ultimately gotten the test needed to diagnose it. In the Mayo Clinic study, women and people who also reported having constipation on the GLP-1 medications were more likely to receive a diagnosis of gastroparesis. Camilleri said that constipation may be one clue that people will have trouble with gastroparesis on a GLP-1 medication but that there are still many questions to answer. \u201cFor the people who get this complication, it is extremely serious,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/glp-1-drugs-stomach-paralysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_health_michigan-bird-flu-human-case", "text": "A case of H5 influenza, also known as avian influenza or bird flu, has been reported in a farm worker in Michigan who had regular exposure to infected livestock, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s the second case reported as part of an ongoing outbreak of the virus in birds and cattle across the country and the third bird flu case ever reported in a person in the US. However, health officials emphasized Wednesday that the risk to the general public remains low. The person was being monitored for the virus because of their exposure to infected cattle, the CDC said in a news release Wednesday. A nasal swab tested negative for influenza at the state health department and later at the CDC, but an eye swab tested positive. The person reported only eye symptoms, and they have recovered. Eye symptoms such as redness, swelling and watering were also the only ones reported in the previous\u00a0human case\u00a0in this outbreak, in a dairy farm worker in Texas. That man took antiviral medications and recovered with no lasting problems. \u201cIt is not unexpected that comprehensive testing identified a human infection,\u201d the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cInformation to date suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person.\u201d The Michigan farm worker was one of about 170 people enrolled in an active monitoring program in which they received a text message from the state health department each day that asks about potential symptoms. When the person indicated the presence of symptoms, public health workers took samples, offered antiviral medications to them and their close contacts, and urged them to isolate. The CDC received the samples on Tuesday and reported the test results to Michigan health officials that night, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC. \u201cThis case was not unexpected,\u201d Shah said Wednesday, emphasizing the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to help farms prepare for the spread of the virus. \u201cIt does not change our assessment of the risk overall. What it does do, however, is it reinforces the message that CDC has been putting out since late March, which is that entities involved with this \u2013 be they local health departments, farms, farm workers and farm worker organizations \u2013 ought to be alert but not alarmed by these developments. \u201cWe have not seen evidence of other cases in this area or elsewhere in any of our monitoring systems, let alone any evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is reassuring, but the work of public health is not done. In the coming days, we\u2019ll have additional information on the genomic sequence or the DNA fingerprint of this particular virus. And we\u2019ll be able to compare it to the virus from infected cows in Michigan, as well as to compare it to the virus from the earlier human case in Texas.\u201d The fact that the nasal specimen tested negative while the eye swab was positive is also, \u201cin a sense, reassuring,\u201d Shah said, as it indicates a reduced likelihood that the virus is spreading through respiration. Although remnants of the virus have been found in samples of dairy products purchased from grocery stores, the US Food and Drug Administration \u201ccontinues to affirm our assessment of the safety of the commercial milk supply,\u201d Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the agency\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said Wednesday. \u201cTo date, the totality of the evidence \u2013 including studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization against multiple pathogens, recent studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] and eggs at lower temperatures than generally used in dairy products, and negative retail sample results to date \u2013 continue to indicate the commercial milk supply is safe. We also continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk\u201d or milk that has not been pasteurized. Testing with a substitute virus in ground beef found some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, but it was present at \u201cmuch, much reduced levels,\u201d according to Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the US Department of Agriculture, and it\u2019s not clear whether it would be enough to make someone sick.
