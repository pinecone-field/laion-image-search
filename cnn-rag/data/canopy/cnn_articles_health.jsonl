{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2022_07_18_health_how-to-stay-cool-without-air-conditioning-wellness", "text": "Whether you\u2019re without power, enduring extreme heat or trying to save money, there are ways to feel comfortable without artificial cooling.  Heat can foster fun summer activities, but the body shouldn\u2019t be too hot for too long, as too much heat can harm your brain and other organs, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Sweating is the body\u2019s natural cooling system, but when that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s increased risk for developing the heat-related illness hyperthermia \u2014 signs of which include heat cramps, heat edema and heat stroke. Heat combined with high humidity exacerbates this risk, since the air\u2019s saturation level makes sweat accumulate on the skin, preventing the body from cooling naturally.     Staying cool can be done by using some basic supplies and knowing how to manipulate your home to control its temperatures. Here are 14 methods for doing so.   Stay hydrated When you\u2019re hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer emeritus in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.  The temperature of the water doesn\u2019t matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can\u2019t do that without enough moisture, since the body cools itself by sweating.  Take a cold shower or bath Taking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature, Porter said. For an extra cool blast, try peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that tell your body something you\u2019re eating or feeling is cold.  Use cold washrags on your neck or wrists  Place a cold washrag or ice bags (packs) on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you\u2019ll cool down more quickly.  Use box fans  Place box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you\u2019re spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.  If the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, opening the windows on both sides of the house during those times can facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. If you do this, you can opt to use or not use the fans, but the fans would help cool the house faster, Porter said. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again. Just resting near a fan would reduce your body temperature as well.  Close your curtains or blinds If you have windows that face the sun\u2019s direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to \u201ckeep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up (the) inside,\u201d Porter said.  You could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.  If you do turn the air conditioning on, don\u2019t set it below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, founder of Spaces Alive, an Australia-based design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.  \u201cIt just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,\u201d she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.  Sleep in breathable linens Cotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.  The lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That\u2019s because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.  Sleep in the basement  If you can\u2019t sleep through the night because you\u2019re too hot, try sleeping somewhere besides your bedroom, if that\u2019s an option. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.  Don\u2019t refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing  Common advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out to wear while you sleep. But this isn\u2019t a good idea, Porter said.  Because of \u201cthe amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019d have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d  Close the doors of unused rooms  If no one\u2019s using a room that doesn\u2019t have vents or registers, close the door to that area to keep the cool air confined to only occupied areas of the house.  Use the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom  Flip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.  Install energy-efficient light bulbs Incandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs, then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.  Switching light bulbs can save money but won\u2019t reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. However, if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you\u2019re sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.  Cook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside Oven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.  Enjoy frozen treats Eating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don\u2019t go overboard on the sugar if you\u2019re overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.  \u201cSugar would run your metabolism up and you\u2019d start feeling internally hot,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.\u201d  Research what your state offers If you\u2019ve tried everything and still can\u2019t beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.  Depending on your state, some cooling centers \u2014 air-conditioned public facilities where people might go for relief during extremely hot weather \u2014 may be open and taking precautions to ensure they\u2019re as safe as possible. You could start by checking with your local utility offices, as they would know who is offering certain programs, Porter recommended.

{"id": "2024_05_23_health_prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness", "text": "Chemical toxins are everywhere \u2014 in our water, food, air and soil. Exposure to those toxins during pregnancy can create serious health issues in elementary school children that can affect their lives for years to come, a new study found. Children born to European mothers exposed to four families of chemicals that disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine (hormone) system had elevated levels of metabolic syndrome at ages 6 to 11. Metabolic syndrome can include obesity, elevated blood pressure, and abnormally high cholesterol and insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Within the group of children exposed to the highest levels of chemicals, 62% were overweight or obese, compared with 16% of children within the low-risk group, said first author Nuria Gu\u0308il-Oumrait, a Fulbright scholar at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cMoreover, the levels of blood insulin and triglycerides, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group,\u201d G\u00fcil-Oumrait said in an email. \u201cIn contrast, HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group.\u201d HDL cholesterol is considered a \u201cgood\u201d blood fat as it helps clear ateries. Metabolic syndrome is typically associated with adult cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, but the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has seen symptoms appearing in kids at younger and younger ages. Having metabolic syndrome as a child is highly predictive of chronic disease as an adult, experts say. \u201cThis research stands out as one of the most comprehensive endeavors delving into early-life environmental origins of metabolic risk, further bolstering prior toxicological and epidemiological evidence in this area,\u201d said Vicente Mustieles, Mariana Ferna\u0301ndez and Carmen Messerlian in an editorial published with the study that appeared Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Mustieles and Fern\u00e1ndez are investigators at the Biomedical Research Center at the University of Granada, Spain. Messerlian is an assistant professor of environmental reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. CNN reached out to the International Council for Chemical Associations for comment but did not hear back before publication. A spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, however, provided the following statement. \u201cWe will review the details of this study once it\u2019s released. ACC\u2019s members are serious about their responsibility to produce chemistries that offer important safety, product performance and durability benefits and that can be used safely. Our members undertake extensive scientific analyses to evaluate potential risk of their chemicals, from development through use and safe disposal.\u201d Dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals The research team behind the new study performed blood and urine tests on 1,134 mothers during their pregnancies and later repeated those tests on their children between the ages of 6 and 11. The tests were looking for mixtures of nine chemical classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly found in the environment. Endrocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants with the \u201cability to cross the blood-placenta barrier and interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance,\u201d the study said. These and other chemicals \u201cend up in the blood, tissue, and organs of fetuses and infants through maternal transplacental and breastfeeding pathways in a never-ending cycle,\u201d Mustieles, Fern\u00e1ndez and Messerlian wrote. The study tested for pesticides; heavy metals; flame retardants; plasticizers such as phthalates and phenols; and PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are found in surface and groundwaters around the world at levels much higher than many international regulators allow. Called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because\u00a0they fail to break down fully in the environment, PFAS have been used since the 1950s to make consumer products nonstick, oil- and water-repellent, and resistant to temperature change. Some of the most studied PFAS, such as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone disruption,\u00a0according to the EPA. Toxic heavy metals in the soil and water include lead and arsenic  \u2014 studies have found alarming levels in manufactured baby food. There is no safe level of lead, while arsenic, mercury and other heavy metals can harm the body and brain at relatively low doses, experts say. A December 2014 meta-analysis of studies on arsenic\u00a0found that a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15. Flame retardants have been linked to a 300% higher risk of cancer. These chemical toxins are the greatest contributor to intellectual disability in children worldwide, resulting in a total loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability, according to an\u00a0August 2020 study. Phthalates, found in hundreds of consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys, have been connected to premature death among people ages 55 to 64\u00a0in the United States. Prior research has connected phthalates with\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and\u00a0undescended testicles in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and testosterone levels in adult males. Phthalates are also linked in studies to\u00a0childhood obesity,\u00a0asthma,\u00a0cardiovascular issues\u00a0and\u00a0cancer. In the study, phthalates were the only group of chemicals that were associated with a lower level of metabolic syndrome. All of the other chemical families increased risk. People are exposed to a mixture of chemicals daily Chemicals may vary in their impact on the body. For example, certain PFAS compounds tend to accumulate in the liver, contributing to fatty liver disease and high cholesterol. And flame retardants and other chemicals may be stored in body fat, contributing to obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, according to the editorial. Since people are exposed to numerous types of potentially toxic substances each day, designing a study that could capture the cumulative impact on different parts of the body would provide a more realistic picture of any potential health impact. By focusing on metabolic syndrome, which combines measurements of blood sugars, lipids such as cholesterol, the existence of fat tissue and the impact on the heart, the current study was one of the first to accomplish this goal, the editorial said. \u201cWe almost always consider health risks from single chemicals, one at a time, as if we are exposed to just one chemical at a time,\u201d said Jane Houlihan, the national director of science and health for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies\u2019 exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. \u201cHere the research team shows that children\u2019s risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life can be driven by the complex mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the body at any moment and it highlights the particular risk of chemical exposures during pregnancy,\u201d she said. Healthy Babies Bright Futures\u00a0published a report in 2019\u00a0that found toxic metals in 95% of the baby foods randomly pulled off supermarket shelves, which led to the introduction of The Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, a bill that would allow the US Food and Drug Administration to set stricter standards and allow the FDA to monitor these standards through access to the records of food suppliers and manufacturers. \u201cGiven the steep rise in metabolic syndrome in the US, health officials and companies should be doing all they can to tighten safety standards and to get these chemicals out of commerce and out of our everyday products,\u201d Houlihan said. How to limit exposure There are ways to minimize exposure to plastics and other toxins, which is especially critical during pregnancy and childhood as developing fetuses and small bodies are more easily damaged, Houlihan said. Reduce rice intake for infants and children, and be sure to rinse grains well before using as this removes up to 60% of the arsenic, she said. Limit juice and be sure to carefully wash and peel vegetables and fruits, and if possible, buy organic. Stay away from stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and don\u2019t use waterproofing sprays. Check your local area for levels of PFAS and other chemicals in your drinking water. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy nonprofit, has created a national tap water database\u00a0searchable by zip code\u00a0that lists PFAS and other concerning chemicals, as well as a\u00a0national map\u00a0that illustrates where PFAS has been detected in the US. If your drinking water is of concern, consider purchasing a reverse osmosis filter, the most effective kind, EWG said. NSF, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, has\u00a0a list of recommended filters. Tap water is often a better choice than bottled water, however, which is packed with nanoplastics that can invade cells and tissues and leach toxic chemicals into the body. At home, one easy change is to use glass or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones when heating food. If possible, try to cook with ceramic, cast iron, or stainless-steel pans and avoid cookware treated with chemicals to avoid food sticking. Another good choice is to use stainless steel or glass bottles instead of plastic ones. \u201cChoose cosmetics that are free from endocrine disruptors such as parabens, benzophenone, triclosan, and phthalates,\u201d Gu\u0308il-Oumrait suggested. Consider the same for food, sunscreens, household cleaners and other everyday products encased in plastic. The EWG has several consumer databases that provides links to consumer products with fewer chemicals, including food scores, personal care products, sunscreen recommendations and a healthy living app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness", "text": "Knee pain is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Whether it\u2019s due to past or current injury, arthritis or simply the wear and tear of aging, the discomfort can be debilitating. In most cases, proactive ways can help you soothe and strengthen your knees. As a mobility coach, I teach people how to use movement as medicine. In the case of knee pain, there\u2019s one simple yet effective exercise I favor to help alleviate pain and strengthen the muscles around your knees: the reverse lunge. Unlike traditional lunges, the reverse lunge is gentler on your joints. This lunge variation not only has the power to strengthen your knee function but also enhances overall lower body strength and stability. Read on to learn how incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness regimen can help you move past the pain and build a stronger foundation for knee health. Understanding your knee pain Knee pain is hard to ignore as it affects your ability to perform everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs and even sitting and standing. The knee joint is a complex structure made up of bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons, all working together to provide stability and movement. When any of these components are compromised, pain can ensue. It may be experienced as a constant or intermittent ache, throbbing or even stabbing pain that may or may not come with swelling. Common causes of knee pain include: \u2022\u00a0 Osteoarthritis: a degenerative joint disease that results in the breakdown of cartilage. \u2022\u00a0 Patellar tendinitis: inflammation of the tendons connecting the kneecap to the shinbone. \u2022\u00a0 Meniscus tears: injuries to the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee. \u2022\u00a0 Ligament injuries: tears or strains to any of the four main knee ligaments (ACL, MCL, PCL and LCL). \u2022\u00a0 Bursitis: Inflammation of the bursae, small sacs of fluid that cushion the knee joint. It\u2019s important to determine the cause of your knee pain before attempting any specific rehab plan. Addressing knee pain often requires a multifaceted approach that may include physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, medication and targeted exercises such as the reverse lunge. Before adding reverse lunges to your fitness regimen or beginning any new exercises or therapies, check with your doctor or other health care professionals you are seeing for help with your knees. Benefits of the reverse lunge The reverse lunge is a basic yet powerful exercise that strengthens the muscles around your knees, improves your core strength and enhances overall lower body strength, mobility and stability. Here are some key benefits: \u2022\u00a0 Reverse lunging strengthens muscles that support your knees. Building stabilizing muscles around the knee joints improves movement quality and reduces pain and injury risk. \u2022\u00a0 The dynamic movement of reverse lunging increases joint lubrication by stimulating the production of synovial fluid. Lubricating the knee joint reduces friction and promotes smoother, pain-free motion. \u2022\u00a0 Unlike forward lunging and other forward stepping exercises, the backward motion of reverse lunges puts less strain on the knees and emphasizes more stability, making them an ideal choice for individuals with knee pain. \u2022\u00a0 Practicing reverse lunges improves balance and stability. Because reverse lunges are unilateral, they are a balance training exercise that strengthens your core and stabilizing\u00a0 muscles to reduce the risk of injury by \u201cmoving wrong.\u201d \u2022\u00a0 They enhance mobility. Regularly practicing reverse lunges improves hip, knee and ankle mobility. \u2022\u00a0 They aid in functional activities. The movement mimics everyday activities, such as kneeling down to tie your shoes or picking something up off the floor. How to perform a reverse lunge Performing a reverse lunge correctly is crucial to reaping its benefits and avoiding injury. Follow these steps for proper form: 1.\u00a0 Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, shoulders relaxed, and arms at your sides or on your hips. Engage your core to maintain balance. 2.\u00a0 Take a step backward with your right foot, landing on the ball of your foot. Your left foot should remain in place, fully connected with the floor. 3.\u00a0 Bend both knees to lower your body until your left thigh is parallel to the ground and your right knee is either lightly touching or nearly touching the floor. 4.\u00a0 Keep most of your weight in your front foot and leg and ensure that your left knee is aligned over your left ankle, not pushed too far forward beyond your toes. 5.\u00a0 Maintain good upper-body posture with your shoulders back and chest open. Avoid leaning forward. 6.\u00a0You do not need to hold the lunge position for any specified length. Go at your own pace, returning to the starting position by pushing through your left heel to lift your body back to standing. Repeat the movement with the opposite leg. Aim for two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions on each leg, depending on your fitness level. Need to modify or want to progress? The intensity of reverse lunging can be varied to accommodate different fitness levels. Beginners or anyone struggling with balance should place one hand on a stable support, such as a chair or wall. For those wanting an advanced variation, hold dumbbells at your sides or a kettlebell at your chest or in one hand at your side or overhead to add resistance and increase the intensity. Use an appropriate weight for your fitness level and goals. To get the most out of practicing reverse lunges, keep these tips in mind: Consistency is key. Regular practice yields the best results. Aim to include reverse lunges in your routine at least two to three times per week. Focus on form. Quality over quantity. Proper form maximizes effectiveness while preventing injury. Listen to your body. If you experience any painful sensation beyond normal muscle fatigue, stop and reassess your form. Consult a health care professional if necessary. Knee pain doesn\u2019t have to sideline you from staying active and enjoying life. By incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness routine, you can take proactive steps toward healthier, pain-free knees. So, step back, lunge and move forward with stronger, more resilient knees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_cucumber-recall-salmonella-fda-cdc", "text": "Recalled cucumbers might be linked to a multistate salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 160 people. The US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local partners are investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Africana that has led to 162 illnesses in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Among those cases, 54 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Out of 65 people interviewed for the investigation, 47 reported eating cucumbers, the FDA said Wednesday, and testing by state partners had identified salmonella in a cucumber sample. More testing is underway. The agencies are also investigating an outbreak of Salmonella\u00a0Braenderup to determine whether it\u2019s related to the\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0Africana outbreak. The\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0Braenderup outbreak has led to 158 illnesses in 23 states. \u201cThe two outbreaks share several similarities, including where and when illnesses occurred and the demographics of ill people,\u201d the FDA said Wednesday. Late last month, Florida-based Fresh Start Produce recalled fresh cucumbers shipped distribution centers, wholesalers and food service distributors in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Two teams of scientists have discovered a theoretically habitable planet, smaller than Earth but bigger than Venus, orbiting a small star about 40 light-years away. The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said. But though the exoplanet could potentially be habitable for humans and is relatively \u201cnear\u201d our solar system in astronomical terms, it is unlikely that anyone will visit there soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not reachable, it\u2019s 12 parsecs away,\u201d said Palethorpe, adding that it would take about 225,000 years to reach Gliese 12b with the fastest spacecraft that currently exist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_health_meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness", "text": "Twenty years ago, Dan Harris appeared to have it all. He had joined ABC News in 2000 by age 29, and had covered the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, in addition to other historic events around the world. What viewers didn\u2019t see was the tumult behind the scenes: Harris experiencing depression from his time as a war correspondent and anxiety from working in a high-pressure industry. He tried to stay afloat by using cocaine, ecstasy and prescription sleeping pills. It would all come crashing down on June 7, 2004, when Harris had to sub for anchor Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. While reporting news updates, he had a nationally televised panic attack that \u201cwas the direct result of an extended run of mindlessness, a period of time during which I was focused on advancement and adventure, to the detriment of pretty much everything else,\u201d Harris wrote in his 2014 book, \u201c10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works.\u201d But this moment, though frightening, would be the catalyst for a journey that propelled him from anguish, drug abuse and being a meditation skeptic to mindfulness \u2014 and to a total occupational overhaul. Now, his career focus is meditation and happiness, and helping others struggling with the thought traps keeping them from a more mindful life. It did take a few years for him to get to meditation, after trying out different psychiatrists and therapy. Before Harris began meditating in summer 2009, \u201cI had no real understanding of it except for a baseline reflexive hostility,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was I raised by atheists, but they were also recovering hippies. They had forced me to do yoga and go to granola health food stores, and we did a lot of camping, and I just found all that sh*t very annoying.\u201d Raised by scientists, Harris was convinced by seeing the scientific research on meditation \u2014 studies that showed meditation can lower blood pressure, boost your immune system, and alleviate anxiety and depression. A regular practice can also rewire brain regions associated with stress, focus, compassion and self-awareness, science has shown. He also credits the work of Dr. Mark Epstein, a psychiatrist and Buddhist then in private practice in Manhattan, and Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, another scientist who teaches a secularized form of Buddhist meditation and is a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Masschusetts Medical School. (In the preface of the recently released 10th anniversary edition of his book, Harris acknowledges how the focus on Western scientists and gurus devalues the contributions of Asian and Asian American people, and how he has been complicit and tried to rectify these mistakes.) Harris is now a meditation expert himself. \u201cI find that I just am less yanked around by my urges and thoughts and emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I screw up, I\u2019m quicker to apologize. I\u2019m more focused on the baseline level of calm that I didn\u2019t have before.\u201d When it comes to the benefits, perfection isn\u2019t one of them, he noted. \u201cI retain the capacity to be a schmuck,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s more like you can get better with a little bit of work over time. And that work will build on itself \u2014 the 10% compounds annually.\u201d \u00a0 Harris tackled some common barriers to trying meditation for CNN and suggested how you can overcome them. Change \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll try\u2019 One of the most common excuses people have for not meditating is thinking they won\u2019t be able to focus or sit still long enough. But Harris contends that if you notice you\u2019re getting distracted while meditating, that\u2019s actually \u201cproof that you\u2019re doing it right.\u201d Distractibility is an evolutionarily beneficial aspect of the human condition, as it keeps us safe, he added. \u201cClearing your mind is impossible unless you\u2019re enlightened, or you have died.\u201d Therefore, the active \u201cseeing of the distraction is proof of success,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause what you want over time in meditation is to understand how the mind works.\u201d \u201cThe whole point of meditation is not to stop thinking \u2014 it\u2019s to focus on one thing, usually the breath coming in and going out. And then every time you get distracted, you start again and again and again,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat starting over is like a bicep curl for your brain, and that\u2019s the mechanism by which the brain changes.\u201d Getting familiar with the fact that you\u2019re thinking is key for developing the skill of recognizing thoughts or feelings and intentionally choosing what to do about them, rather than unconsciously and automatically reacting. It\u2019s similar to when you\u2019re exercising for the first time, and the first couple weeks might be challenging, Harris said. Then it can get easier, but it\u2019s not supposed to be effortless. Others feel they can\u2019t find the time or don\u2019t know where to start. But when you want to form a habit, the best move is to start small, Harris said. Start at one minute of meditation daily for a couple weeks before increasing your time, he recommends. Over time, you might notice yourself moving from extrinsic motivation \u2014 such as being advised to do it or reading the research on it \u2014 to the intrinsic motivation that helps you maintain the habit because you feel it\u2019s helping you. There are many free or inexpensive resources that can help you get started, such as those on apps, YouTube or Harris\u2019 own website, or in books, he said. And some cities have meditation or mindfulness centers where you can learn from a teacher and practice with others \u2014 another great way to maintain a habit since it keeps you accountable. The fear of being well Some people are also of the mindset that \u201cthe only way to survive is to be, like, constantly neurotic\u201d lest they lose their edge or ambition, Harris said. But consider prominent and successful advocates for meditation that include athletes, musicians, TV hosts or corporate executives, such as LeBron James, Oprah Winfrey, Arianna Huffington, Jerry Seinfeld, LinkedIn Executive Chairman Jeff Weiner and ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. \u201cDo these people seem like they\u2019ve lost their edge?\u201d Harris said. \u201cDo you think your edge will go away if you\u2019re more focused, less emotionally reactive and a little bit calmer during stressful situations? No, actually the opposite is true.\u201d READ MORE: One habit could reduce your fears of public speaking, criticism, failure and more Harris\u2019 own story is also a testament to how your relationship to work or your values can change once you have reached a healthier place \u2014 and how the success in that newfound reality can be different, but maybe even better or more fulfilling, than what you had imagined or planned. \u201cThis is not the version of success the pre-meditation version of me thought was what I wanted. I wanted to stay in network news and climb as high as I could,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut this opened up a whole new realm for me. I publish books, have my own podcasts and social media feeds, and I continue to have opportunities. I started a company, and I\u2019m exploring a new one. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more potential than I had imagined, and I am absolutely not less ambitious.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/health/meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_menstruation-early-wellness", "text": "Younger generations are getting their first periods earlier, and the length of time it takes to become regular is changing \u2014 which could point to later health problems, according to a new study. \u201cAmong individuals born between 1950 and 2005, we found that younger generations were starting their first period (menarche) earlier, and the time it took for their periods to become regular also increased,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Zifan Wang, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an email. The study, which published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, looked at data from more than 70,000 participants who filled out surveys as part of the Apple Women\u2019s Health Study, which is a long-term research of menstrual cycles using data from the Apple Health mobile application. The data was collected digitally, relying on people to self-report the information based on their memories of early menstruation and thus limiting the results, Wang said. But other research has documented the trend in first menstrual cycles starting at earlier ages over time. In the latest study, researchers compared trends in the ages of first periods and how long it took for menstruation to become regular by age groups, Wang said. They found that the trends were even stronger in people from racial and ethnic minority groups and/or of lower socioeconomic status. \u201cThis is important because early menarche and irregular periods can signal physical and psychosocial problems later in life,\u201d Wang said, \u201cand these trends may contribute to the increase in adverse health outcomes and disparities in the US.\u201d A vital sign Menstruation is like a vital sign, said Dr. Eve Feinberg, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the research. \u201cYou want to make sure that the body is regulated,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cAnd when cycles are not regular, it\u2019s generally a sign that something else may be going on.\u201d Scientists and health care providers already know that early periods and a longer time for cycles to regulate are associated with poor effects on health, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, Wang said. The longer people have irregular menstrual cycles, the longer they may be exposed to an imbalance between two important hormones: estrogen and progesterone, Feinberg said. Estrogen signals growth, whereas progesterone signals for that growth to stop, she added. To prevent conditions\u00a0\u00a0 such as uterine cancer, you need to have the signals to both start and stop growth. Theoretically, longer exposures to estrogen without a good balance of progesterone could affect an increase in endometrial cancers and fertility problems in the future, she said. And an early period itself may pose problems, Feinberg added. For an 8-year-old to be going through puberty, there is often a disconnect between the age of the child\u2019s mind and body, she said. Where are these trends coming from? The next question is: Why are these menstrual trends changing? Earlier periods might be associated with high body mass index, or BMI, during childhood, Wang said. \u201cThis implies that childhood obesity, which has been increasing in the US, might be contributing to people getting their periods earlier,\u201d Wang added. The cause could also be other environmental factors such as nutrition or the prevalence\u00a0of microplastics, Feinberg said, adding that further investigation is needed. Additional research can help physicians counsel people better about their menstruation and recognize the impact on their patients\u2019 health, said one of the study\u2019s principal investigators, Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, assistant professor of environmental, \u00a0\u00a0reproductive and women\u2019s health at Harvard\u2019s T.H Chan School of Public Health. Physicians should evaluate children with early periods or a long duration of irregular cycles to make sure there isn\u2019t an underlying problem, Feinberg said. \u201cSometimes even using birth control pills at an earlier age to help give earlier exposure to progesterone \u2026 may give a little bit more cycle control and may possibly be protective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think the key is probably really understanding what\u2019s driving this and getting to the root cause.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/menstruation-early-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_02_13_health_adhd-body-doubling-productivity-benefits-wellness", "text": "Once a week, ADHD coach Robin Nordmeyer joins a Zoom meeting with other coaches while she writes blogs, does administrative tasks or works on content for presentations she has been putting off.  Nordmeyer, who has ADHD, isn\u2019t necessarily using the meeting to collaborate with others \u2014 she just needs their presence as a motivator to help her get things done.  \u201cI run a business, and I have to balance lots of different areas of the business,\u201d said Nordmeyer, cofounder and managing director of the Center for Living Well with ADHD-Minnesota, an ADHD coaching group near Minneapolis serving all ages.  \u201cSome of those things come very easy \u2014 like, they\u2019re in my wheelhouse, they energize me, I can\u2019t wait to get to them,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cAnd some of those things are a little more tedious, or I have some resistance around them.\u201d  What Nordmeyer does to get through those tougher tasks is sometimes known as \u201cbody doubling,\u201d a productivity and self-help strategy that involves working with another person around to help improve motivation and focus. It has been popular for some time among people with ADHD \u2014 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \u2014 especially during the pandemic.  \u201cThe idea is that the presence of another is essentially a gentle reminder to stay on task,\u201d said Billy Roberts, clinical director of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cFor folks (with) ADHD whose minds tend to wander and get off task, the body double somehow works as an external motivator to stay on task.\u201d  Body doubling isn\u2019t just for people with ADHD, but like many \u201ccoping strategies, something that can be helpful for anybody is more central and important for folks with ADHD,\u201d said Dr. J. Russell Ramsay, founding codirector of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s ADHD Treatment and Research Program.  Why body doubling works A neurodevelopmental disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood but lasting into adulthood, ADHD stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University\u2019s Center on the Developing Child. Those skills help us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and multitask. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity \u2014 so people with this disorder might have trouble concentrating, staying organized, managing their time or controlling their impulses, which can affect both their work and personal lives, Roberts said.  If people with ADHD have no intrinsic interest in a task, Roberts said, they typically struggle with a lack of internal motivation to complete it or even to get started. Body doubling provides that motivation, experts said.  \u201cIt also draws on our social selves,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cA lot of people with ADHD will say, \u2018I have a hard time getting started on this if I\u2019m doing it for myself, but if I know somebody else is relying on me, if somebody else is waiting outside for me to show up to go for our walk, I\u2019m more likely to go and be there because I don\u2019t want to let them down.\u2019\u201d  There doesn\u2019t appear to be extensive research on body doubling for productivity, according to Roberts and other experts. \u201cBut I do know that the idea of externalizing motivation is a long-standing, evidence-based mechanism for managing ADHD,\u201d Roberts said.   In theory, the method is pretty straightforward, but there a few factors to keep in mind to make the most of it. How to use body doubling effectively Body doubling can help with pretty much any task you\u2019re having a hard time getting done \u2014 whether that\u2019s work, chores, exercise, schoolwork or paperwork. The other person doesn\u2019t have to be doing the same thing as you, unless the activity you need body doubling for \u2014 such as exercising \u2014 requires that assistance.   Be choosy about whom you ask to be your body double. The person should be as committed to you completing your work as you are, Roberts said \u2014 not distracting you with conversation or anything else. Choose someone who usually makes you feel comfortable and safe, and who can encourage you when necessary.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep a body double session focused on its purpose,\u201d Nordmeyer said. If conversations do come up, table them for later, perhaps during a break or dinner. Asking someone to be your body double might feel awkward, but Roberts said the best approach is often a straightforward one. You could say, \u201cIt\u2019s something I heard can help with productivity. Would you mind just being around me while I work on this? Maybe you have something you could work on, too.\u201d  You could also barter with them, in a sense, by making an offer such as, \u201cYou help me organize my garage on Saturday; I\u2019ll help you organize your home office on Sunday,\u201d Ramsay said.  Those small first steps of seeking a partner and setting up the session get you started and keep you going, he added. Scheduling regular body doubling sessions is one option, Nordmeyer said, or just ask whenever the need arises. How transparent you are about why you need a body double is up to you, as is whether you have more than one body double. \u201cIt depends on the individual,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf it turns into a distraction more than mindfulness, accountability or behavioral support, then you just want to rework things. You can kind of tinker with things until you find what works.\u201d  Virtual body doubling If you don\u2019t have a friend or colleague to be your body double, you aren\u2019t out of luck.  Some TikTok users, such as Allie K. Campbell, regularly go live while they\u2019re working so others can use them as a virtual body double. There are also body doubling or coworking platforms or apps such as Flown, Focusmate or Flow Club.  In virtual sessions, \u201cmost body doubles ask you to share your camera, and a lot of people are real nervous about being visible,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cThe purpose of that is to make sure you\u2019re still in your chair working. \u2026 But there might be other ways you can create that accountability through a chat feature.\u201d  The benefits of body doubling are likely why some people like working on things in coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces \u2014 which can be sources of passive body doubling if you don\u2019t have someone to ask, Roberts said. \u201cSome people work better with community support and just the awareness of other people around them,\u201d he added. \u201cYou saw that a lot with the pandemic, like people learning more about the kinds of structure they needed.  \u201cWe all think and work differently, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d Roberts said.

{"id": "2013_07_02_health_tuberculosis-tb-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at Tuberculosis (also known as TB), an infection, caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that usually affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain.  About TB Two types of TB exist - Latent TB infection (non-infectious) and TB disease (infectious). Latent TB infection:- A person infected with latent TB shows no symptoms and may not feel sick.- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.- It is not possible to spread TB bacteria from the infected person to others.- Individuals with a latent TB infection may never develop the disease, as bacteria remains dormant. In other cases, especially involving people with a weak immune system, the bacteria may become active and cause TB disease.- Treatment is required to ensure the infected person does not develop active TB disease but in some cases preventative treatment may not be an option. - Without treatment, about 5-10% of individuals infected with latent TB will develop the disease.  TB disease:- Symptoms of TB of the lungs include coughing up blood and chest pain.- Other symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills and fatigue.- It is possible to spread TB bacteria from the infected person to others.- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.- Treatment typically involves a combination of drugs taken for six months. - Persons with a weak immune system, such as those with HIV or diabetes, are more prone to catching TB disease.  Facts TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings. Germs can stay in the air for hours.  In 2022, about 10.6 million people worldwide became ill with TB, and 1.3 million died (including 167,000 with HIV). In 2022, a total of 8,331 new TB cases were reported in the United States. Up to 13 million people in the United States are living with latent TB. Timeline 1546 - Italian scientist Girolamo Fracastoro hypothesizes that TB is contagious.  1679 - Dutch scientist Francis Sylvius details the impact of TB on patients.  1865 - French military doctor Jean-Antoine Villemin proves the illness can transmit from human to animal or from animal to animal.  1882 - German doctor Robert Koch identifies the bacterial strain as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 1800s - Tuberculosis causes as much as one-quarter of all deaths in Europe during the 19th century. Famous people who die from tuberculosis include John Keats, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte, Anton Chekhov and Franz Kafka.   1921 - After years of trials involving animal testing, French bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin successfully administer a vaccine called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in an infant whose mother died of TB. 1930 - In Germany, more than 70 infants who received the BCG vaccine die of TB. It is later concluded that the vaccine was contaminated in the lab.  1944 - Microbiologist Selman A. Waksman and his associates at Rutgers University report the discovery of a new antibiotic called streptomycin. 1944 - Physicians H. Corwin Hinshaw, Karl H. Pfuetze and William H. Feldman successfully use streptomycin to treat a patient with TB. 1952 - A scientific journal publishes studies heralding the success of a breakthrough treatment called isoniazid.   1985-1992 - Tuberculosis makes a resurgence. Scientists attribute this to several factors, including the spread of HIV.  1994 - The World Health Organization declares tuberculosis a global emergency.  1995 - The WHO launches Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course (DOTS). It is a treatment plan containing five components, including standardized recording and reporting.   2008 - The WHO reports the highest rates of MDR-TB worldwide.  December 8, 2010 - The WHO endorses a new test that diagnoses tuberculosis within hours instead of months. 2018 - A promising new vaccine called M72/AS01E is shown to be effective in many people already infected with TB.  2021 - A study concludes that a four-month multidrug regimen to treat TB is as effective as a six-month regimen.

{"id": "2024_05_31_health_moderna-rsv-vaccine-fda-approval", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration has approved another vaccine to help protect older people from respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV. The shot, made by Moderna and sold under the name of mResvia, could be another tool in the country\u2019s RSV arsenal in the fall. Moderna\u2019s shot is the third RSV vaccine for people 60 and older that\u2019s gotten the green light from the FDA and the first mRNA vaccine among them. It\u2019s the company\u2019s second product to receive FDA approval, behind its Covid-19 vaccine. The other FDA-approved RSV vaccines are made by GSK and Pfizer. There\u2019s also an RSV vaccine for pregnant people in the US that can\u00a0protect an infant after birth and a preventive antibody that can be given to prevent serious illness in babies. The virus is ubiquitous and typically causes mild infection. Globally, about 64 million people get sick with RSV each year, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Many people who get RSV feel like they have a cold, and they will typically recover in a few weeks, but the virus can be particularly dangerous for older people, young children and people with underlying health conditions. Depending on how bad the season is, between 60,000 and 160,000 older adults are hospitalized with RSV every year, and between 6,000 and 10,000 die, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RSV symptoms can include a runny nose, cough, fever, sneezing, wheezing and a decreased appetite, but an infection can also turn into pneumonia or make underlying breathing problems like asthma or COPD worse. In a single year, millions of people are sent to the hospital with a lower respiratory tract infection that started with RSV. Seniors who have underlying heart problems or lung diseases and those with suppressed immune systems are at the highest risk that RSV could turn into pneumonia or kill them. Moderna said Friday that approval of its RSV vaccine was based on clinical trial data showing that even about four months after someone gets the shot, the vaccine had an 83.7% efficacy at preventing lower respiratory tract disease. The vaccine trials involved 37,000 adults in 22 countries. Moderna says a longer-term analysis showed that the vaccine provided continued protection nearly nine months after vaccination. The company said there were no serious safety concerns identified in the trial, and the most common problems were pain at the injection site, headache and fatigue. \u201cThe FDA approval of our second product, mRESVIA, builds on the strength and versatility of our mRNA platform,\u201d St\u00e9phane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in a news release. \u201cmRESVIA protects older adults from the severe outcomes of RSV infection, and it is the only RSV vaccine available in a pre-filled syringe designed to maximize ease of administration, saving vaccinators\u2019 time and reducing the risk of administrative errors. This approval is also the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved for a disease other than COVID-19. With mRESVIA, we continue to deliver for patients by addressing global public health threats related to infectious diseases.\u201d The CDC recommends the two other approved RSV vaccines for adults 60 and older using shared clinical decision-making, meaning seniors should discuss with their doctor whether they should get the shot. The agency\u2019s independent committee of vaccine advisers will consider at its meeting June 26 whether Moderna\u2019s vaccine should be recommended. The CDC makes the final determination on whether to recommend the vaccine and gives doctors guidance on how it should be used. Moderna said it expects that its vaccine will be available for eligible groups in the US in time for the 2024-25 RSV season, which typically starts in the fall and peaks in the winter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/moderna-rsv-vaccine-fda-approval/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_health_mdma-ptsd-fda-advisers", "text": "A federal advisory committee on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly against of the use of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. The novel treatment has the potential to transform a field with significant need, but the committee had concerns about the integrity of the particular trials up for review. After hearing presentations from the US Food and Drug Administration, treatment sponsor Lykos Therapeutics and members of the public, the independent committee voted on recommendations to be made to the FDA. Two of the 11 committee members said that they considered the treatment effective, while nine said that it was not. Only one committee member said that the benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks as presented, but the other 10 voted that they did not. This was the first time FDA advisers have considered a psychedelic drug for\u00a0medical\u00a0use. MDMA is known as an entactogen, a class of psychoactive drugs that produce experiences of emotional communion, relatedness and emotional openness. It\u2019s currently classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and changing this status would be a marked shift. The FDA has final say on whether the treatment is formally approved. The agency often follows recommendations from its independent advisory committees but does not have to do so. About 5% of adults in the United States \u2013 about 13 million people \u2013 experience PTSD in any given year, according\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the National Center for PTSD. But current treatment options \u2013 including antidepressants and some specialized forms of cognitive behavioral therapy \u2013 are limited in their scope and effectiveness, with few alternatives available to help those don\u2019t respond well to them. At Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Lykos Therapeutics presented positive data from two late-stage clinical trials that used MDMA in combination with therapy to treat PTSD. Many of the FDA advisory committee members applauded the exploration of this line of treatment and lauded the potential it holds, but several shortcomings \u2013 notably regarding bias in efficacy data and missing information about safety \u2013 raised critical doubts. About 200 people participated in the Lykos trials, with a treatment program that involved three eight-hour sessions where participants took MDMA in the presence of two therapists. The MDMA sessions were spaced about a month apart, along with additional therapy sessions. \u201cParticipants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms,\u201d the FDA wrote in a briefing document about the studies. But the agency also noted that \u201cseveral factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment for this application,\u201d posing key questions for the members of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee to consider. The studies were designed to be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the MDMA treatment and who didn\u2019t. This type of study is considered the gold standard because it helps reduce bias in results by minimizing the effects of external factors. But MDMA\u2019s hallucinogenic effects have \u201cprofound alterations\u201d on a person\u2019s state of being, and the vast majority of participants knew which group they were in simply by the nature of their experience. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that conducts independent reviews of treatments, tests and procedures, also cited \u201csubstantial concerns about the validity of the results\u201d of the Lykos trials in a report published in March. Those concerns centered around bias, both from the unblinding of the trial and from other influences on patient perspectives. In addition to blurry data on efficacy, there were concerns about safety data, the FDA said. MDMA is known to have potential for abuse, but the FDA cautions that the research did not appropriately assess this as an adverse event in the context of the treatment program. Reports from illicit use of MDMA suggest that it may pose risks to both heart and liver health. The phase III clinical trials showed \u201csignificant increases in both blood pressure and pulse\u201d among participants, the FDA said, but certain related assessments were incomplete. And liver health was assessed only in small groups from earlier phases of the clinical trials. The unique factors of this type of treatment and the complexity of the considerations at hand were acknowledged throughout the committee meeting. \u201cI absolutely agree that we need new and better treatments for PTSD, especially in the somatic treatment space. However, I also note that premature introduction of a treatment can actually stifle development and stifle implementation and lead to premature adoption of treatments that are either not completely known to be safe not fully effective or not being used at their optimal efficacy,\u201d said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer, deputy director for research at the National Center for PTSD. As a member of the advisory committee, he voted against the treatment. \u201cI think this is a really exciting treatment. I\u2019m really encouraged by the results to date, but I feel that both from an efficacy and a safety standpoint it is still premature.\u201d Dr. Walter Dunn, a staff psychiatrist at the Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California Los Angeles, was the only committee member to vote in favor of the treatment on both questions of efficacy and the balance of risks and benefits. His confidence in the risk-benefit analysis was low, he said; psychotherapy is an integral component of this treatment program, and it could be \u201cthe greatest strength of the treatment\u201d but \u201calso its greatest liability\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s not within the FDA\u2019s scope to regulate, he said. And specific guardrails the FDA outlined to be put in place with approval of the treatment to protect patient safety were incomplete. \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m voting yes because I\u2019m putting on my clinician hat,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWorking in the VA, as a former servicemember myself, I have colleagues who deployed who have PTSD, and this has the potential to make a to make a difference. Now, that\u2019s not without its risks.\u201d The questions are all familiar to Lykos, and the company has had conversations with the FDA throughout its research, CEO Amy Emerson told CNN before the meeting. \ufeffThe advisory committee meeting is the \u201cnext big milestone\u201d in the process and an opportunity to gather even more information, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just such an urgent patient need for new treatment options, and we really use that as our guiding light as we develop MDMA-assisted therapy,\u201d she said. \u201cAll along, we\u2019ve been really committed to safety, and that will always be top of mind.\u201d There is growing interest and support to explore the use of psychedelics as therapeutics. Along with MDMA, drugs like ketamine and psilocybin mushrooms are being studied in clinical trials to treat a variety of mental health disorders. \u201cDepression, PTSD, eating disorders \u2013 they\u2019re all different. You can\u2019t just lump these together and say, \u2018Psychedelics are good for this,\u2019\u201d Emerson said. \u201cYou need to study it, you need to look at the safety and efficacy profiles of each, and we have to be careful to not treat these things as panaceas or like a magic bullet.\u201d The Lykos treatment is the first to reach this point in the process, and the way the FDA and its advisory board proceed could set key precedents. \u201cIt\u2019s an early but exciting moment. The promise is there, the potential is there, and we just have to find out through careful study and time how impactful these medications will be,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Many questions remain about the specific conditions needed to achieve effective use of this treatment, and even the most supportive experts caution about\u00a0the limitations of the treatment and recommend additional research. \u201cI hope that the drug gets approved but in a way where it can be made available and monitored in a responsible manner,\u201d said Dr. Rachel Yehuda, director of the Center for Psychedelic Psychotherapy and Trauma Research at Mount Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee. \u201cMy fear would be that we stop being curious, we stop asking the right questions, we stop trying to figure out mechanisms of action, we stop trying to perfect and scale like we do with any other treatment.\u201d It\u2019s critical to protect vulnerable populations who may benefit from this treatment, experts say. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that psychedelics are probably uniquely susceptible to the blurring of the boundaries between strictly applied medical treatments that are provided by experienced clinicians under very well-monitored circumstances versus recreational use, so there\u2019s a great interest in trying to get this as right as possible,\u201d said Dr. Jon Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s research council and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \u201cThe last thing you want is for a promising treatment for a devastating condition to go off the rails in an unbounded, unmonitored kind of use.\u201d Also, the trials have excluded people who may be most vulnerable to substantial side effects of MDMA, such as adolescents and those with coinciding conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and it\u2019s important to continue gathering data to understand how the treatment works in these populations, he said. \u201cAny\u00a0FDA\u00a0approval\u00a0of\u00a0MDMA\u00a0must\u00a0be\u00a0accompanied\u00a0by rigorous regulations, strict prescribing and dispensing controls, comprehensive patient education, and ongoing monitoring and surveillance systems,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association wrote in a letter to the FDA\u2019s advisory committee. In addition to potentially setting a precedent in mental health treatment, the particular treatment program that Lykos has studied is \u201clabor-intensive,\u201d Yehuda said. It requires a significant amount of investment \u2013 both logistically and emotionally \u2013 from participants and providers, which is challenged by the shortage of mental health professionals in the US. \u201cWe never had a situation where something that the government had deemed harmful gets a 180 and becomes an approved treatment for a condition,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, the question is, \u2018Are we going to be able to use the moment in a way that really furthers the mental health of our population?\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/mdma-ptsd-fda-advisers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_laser-hair-removal-devices-wellness", "text": "With hotter weather often comes more skin showing\u2014and for many that means increased sense of pressure to get rid of body hair. Diet culture already makes summer a tricky time, with advertisements and headlines about celebrities emphasizing the importance of a \u201cbikini body.\u201d Adding a social expectation to remove hair from legs, underarms and bikini area can make it the season of body consciousness. If you want that hair gone, there are a lot of options to address the hair: laser, at home devices, waxing, creams and shaving, said Dr. Deirdre Hooper, cofounder of Audubon Dermatology in New Orleans. While they are all generally safe, she noted that there are some things to consider if you choose to use one of these methods. Laser hair removal The most effective way to get rid of hair in an area long-term is to get laser hair removal procedures in a practitioner\u2019s office, said Dr. Suzanne Kilmer, the founder and director of the Laser & Skin Surgery Center of Northern California and clinical professor at the University of California, Davis Medical Center in Davis, California. \u201cA laser is the most effective way to remove hair because it uses a particular wavelength of light that\u2019s going to perfectly target your hair based on your hair color and your skin color,\u201d Hooper said. Laser hair removal treatments are offered both at dermatologists\u2019 offices and places like medical spas. The safest bet is to have the procedure one in the office \u2013 especially for darker skin tones, Hopper said. \u201cThe darker your skin type, the more you really need to vet who is doing the treatments,\u201d Kilmer said. Only certain wavelengths can be used on darker skin types, and a cooling system is important to get effective hair removal without burn, she added. \u201cIf you have dark skin, don\u2019t even try going to (an inexpensive medical spa) because I get all the burns from those places,\u201d Kilmer said. At home devices You might have seen advertisements all over your social media pop up for devices marketed to be like at home laser hair removal. These tools aren\u2019t new however, Hooper said. They have been around for more than a decade, and they aren\u2019t really laser treatment, she said. Whereas lasers are a targeted beam, at home devices use an intense pulsed light (IPL) of a wide range of wavelengths to work on different hair types and skin types, Hooper added. At home devices are much less expensive than office treatments, generally safe and usually do reduce the hair in that area, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get good results with an at home IPL \u2013 probably 60% to 75% of what you could get with an in-office laser procedure \u2013 and it\u2019s done at your convenience at a lower cost,\u201d she said. However, you may be spending your money on the device only to realize that you want a more effective treatment, Kilmer said. \u201cThey may get temporary hair removal, but it\u2019s very difficult to get good permanent hair removal,\u201d she said. There is also a big safety caveat, Hooper added. The IPL devices target pigment, not hair necessarily. If you have darker toned skin or have a tan, you are at a greater risk for the device burning your skin, she added. \u201cI have treated three of these (burns) this spring already in my office,\u201d Hooper said. Hooper suggests consulting with your dermatologist about if your skin is a good candidate for IPL devices, using them when you haven\u2019t had recent sun exposure, testing on small areas first, and keeping in mind that different parts of your body will have different levels of pigment. Waxing, creams and shaving Waxing and shaving are time honored methods of hair removal, Hooper said. The thing to keep in mind if you go the waxing route with your hair removal is that as hair grows back and tries to pop through the skin, those with coarser and curlier hair are more likely to get in grown hairs, she added. Using a cream dissolves the hair, leaving it less stubby and not quite as noticeable, Kilmer said. But they can be irritating for the skin. Like waxing and creams, shaving isn\u2019t going to stop your hair from growing back \u2013 but contrary to a popular myth, it doesn\u2019t make you grow more hair either, Hooper said. It is common for skin to get more irritated in the summer if you are shaving more frequently, she added. No matter what body parts you are shaving, Hooper recommends doing it at the end of your shower or bath when the hair and skin have had some time to be exposed to water. And a razor with few blades is better, because there is less of a chance of micro nicks in your skin. \u201cActually, some of the less snazzy razors that only have two or three blades are less irritating,\u201d she said. Immediately after, you can use lotion to moisturize the skin. Just be sure it doesn\u2019t have fragrance, which can be irritating, Hooper said. If you do get irritation when the hair starts to come back, use aloe vera for redness and over the counter cortisol cream to calm the irritation, she said. But if you are looking for less hair, less ingrown hair and less maintenance, your best bet is going to be laser hair removal first with the at home devices as a runner up, Hooper said. \u201cTry to find a way to see someone who can do a laser on you who is safe and knows about the risks associated with laser \u2013 ideally a board-certified dermatologist,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/laser-hair-removal-devices-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_antidepressant-discontinuation-withdrawal-symptoms-wellness", "text": "Antidepressants can do wonders for persistent mental health problems. But some people may be reluctant to take the medications, fearing what could happen if they want to stop taking them one day. That risk has now been quantified, thanks to a new review of 79 studies \u2014 known as a meta-analysis \u2014 totaling 21,002 adult participants age 45 on average. Roughly 15% of participants who discontinued antidepressants experienced withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, insomnia and irritability, according to the review published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry. One in 35 participants experienced severe symptoms once they stopped taking antidepressants. The review is the first publication of a larger project on antidepressant withdrawal symptoms, the authors said. \u201cThere is strong evidence that antidepressants can be effective for many people who are experiencing a depressive disorder, either alone, or alongside other treatments such as psychotherapy,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Henssler, senior author of the study and senior physician in the department of psychiatry and neurosciences at Charit\u00e9 \u2014 University Medicine in Berlin, in a news release. \u201cHowever, they do not work for everyone, and some patients may experience unpleasant side effects. In patients who have recovered with the help of antidepressants, the decision from doctors and patients may be to stop taking them in time,\u201d Henssler added. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s important both doctors and patients have an accurate, evidence-based picture of what might happen.\u201d The occurrence of withdrawal symptoms was reported or described as early as 1959, but researchers neglected those reports until the late 1990s, according to the review.\u00a0 Until now, \u201cthere has been a lot of \u2018debate\u2019 about the important problem of antidepressant withdrawal in the last few years, which has appeared within print and social media, with very high estimates of withdrawal being pronounced at around 50% and half (considered) as severe,\u201d said Dr. Sameer Jauhar, senior clinical lecturer in affective disorders and psychosis at King\u2019s College London, in a news release. Jauhar wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis was based on a very unconventional review,\u201d Jauhar added, \u201cwhich included data from online surveys, which are notoriously difficult to interpret (ask anyone involved in election polling).\u201d To determine the risk of withdrawal more accurately, the authors reviewed data from 44 randomized controlled trials and 35 observational studies published between 1961 and 2019. These studies investigated abrupt cessation or tapering of an established antidepressant or placebo. More than half of these studies focused on mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, and more than a fourth concentrated on anxiety disorders. \u00a0 The authors also discovered the medications most often linked with withdrawal symptoms were desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, imipramine and escitalopram. Those with the lowest rate of discontinuation symptoms were fluoxetine and sertraline. Pharmaceutical companies funded 45 of the studies, but this backing didn\u2019t appear to influence the overall results, according to the review. The rate of withdrawal symptoms in pharma-funded studies was about the same as trials not funded by pharmaceutical companies. \u201cThis work is a salutary lesson, as some people may have been dissuaded from taking a potentially effective treatment, based on poor quality evidence,\u201d Jauhar said. \u201cScience does correct itself, and the authors are to be congratulated on this work.\u201d The findings are also an important first step to helping patients responsibly discontinue taking antidepressants, said Dr. Christiaan Vinkers, a psychiatrist and full professor in the department of psychiatry at Amsterdam University Medical Center, in a news release. What these findings mean for patients Another weakness of the review was that many of the included studies weren\u2019t primarily focused on antidepressant discontinuation, but rather the efficacy of antidepressants versus placebos, Dr. Tony Kendrick, professor of primary care at the University of Southampton in England, said in a news release. These studies \u201calso happened to observe patients in the wash-out period coming off the drugs at the end of the trials. Consequently, the period of taking the antidepressant was 12 weeks or less in 36 out of the 79 included studies,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cSevere discontinuation symptoms would not usually be expected to arise after only a few weeks of antidepressant use.\u201d Some of the other included studies had much longer treatment periods \u2014 some up to a year or longer. Regarding why antidepressant discontinuation sometimes leads to withdrawal symptoms, it\u2019s important to note these medications aren\u2019t addictive, Henssler said. The effects could be due to the suddenly lower amount of neurotransmitters in your brain, according to the Cleveland Clinic. In the review, there was no difference between studies on tapered or abrupt discontinuation. But the authors cautioned that finding isn\u2019t a firm conclusion due to variation in study designs. And other research still indicates tapering can be helpful for reducing the chances and severity of symptoms, they said. Though the rates of withdrawal aren\u2019t nearly as high as previously reported, when it comes to patients wanting to quit their antidepressants, doctors should still have conversations about what doing so would mean for the patient and how to do it safely, Jauhar said. \u201cThe doctor should help them to do so slowly and in a controlled manner that limits the impact of any potential withdrawal symptoms \u2026 at a pace that suits them and their individual needs,\u201d said Dr. Oliver Howes, chair of the psychopharmacology committee at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom, said in a news release. Howes wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Carefully strategizing is important also because of the risk of relapsing into the condition being treated, depending on a person\u2019s mental health history, Dr. Paul Keedwell, a consultant psychiatrist and member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said in a news release. The study didn\u2019t provide information on the duration of withdrawal symptoms, but other research suggests they can last for up to two weeks in most cases, Keedwell said. Discontinuation is more difficult for people who have been on their medications for a year or more, he added \u2014 in that case withdrawal symptoms can last for months but rarely up to a year. However, \u201cit is important to say that withdrawal symptoms are not dangerous, and the risk of experiencing them at some future date should not be a reason for refusing antidepressant treatment,\u201d Keedwell said. \u201cThe pros and cons of treatment should always be discussed with your doctor.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/antidepressant-discontinuation-withdrawal-symptoms-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_health_maternal-deaths-high-income-nations", "text": "The United States continues to have a higher rate of women dying in pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum compared with all other high-income nations, even despite recent declines in the US maternal death rate, a new report shows. There were about 22 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in the United States in 2022, the most recent year for which data was available. That rate was more than double, sometimes triple, those seen in most other high-income countries that year, according to the report released Tuesday by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on health care-related issues. And the rate of maternal deaths among Black women in the United States remains even higher, at nearly 50 deaths per 100,000 live births, the new report shows. Meanwhile, half of the high-income nations in the new report had fewer than 5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, and one country recorded zero maternal deaths: Norway. Unlike Norway and some other peer nations, \u201cthe US has a maternal care workforce shortage problem, which is only supposed to get worse,\u201d said\u00a0Munira\u00a0Gunja, lead author of the report and senior researcher at the International Program in Health Policy and Practice Innovations at the Commonwealth Fund. In the United States, she noted, there is\u00a0limited access to midwives, who provide support to a patient from the prenatal period through postpartum. \u201cWe have an under-supply of midwives, and midwives are underutilized, whereas in most other countries, midwives greatly outnumber ob-gyns. They\u2019re part of their health care systems. Midwifery care is not integrated enough into our system,\u201d Gunja said. In the United States, \u201cthere\u00a0are several barriers to\u00a0getting midwifery care, and other countries just don\u2019t have that. They\u2019re able to make sure that every woman has access to care, whether it be in some cases an ob-gyn and in most cases a midwife,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the US, we\u2019re the only country in this analysis without a universal health system. Nearly 8 million women of reproductive age are without health insurance.\u201d In Norway, which has universal health coverage, prenatal care is accessible free of charge, and high-risk pregnancies are effectively identified. US \u2018is still such an outlier\u2019 Researchers at the Commonwealth Fund analyzed maternal mortality data from 14 high-income countries: Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. The data, which came from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, showed that the top three nations with the highest maternal death rate were the United States, Chile and New Zealand. Chile and New Zealand each recorded about 14 deaths per 100,000 live births. The three nations with the lowest maternal death rate were Norway with zero, Switzerland with a rate of 1 death per 100,000 live births and Sweden with about 3 deaths per 100,000 live births. During the Covid-19 pandemic, maternal death rates increased in Australia, Japan, the Netherlands and the US, according to the report, which notes that the increase may have been due to a rise in Covid-related infections, complications worsened by the virus or delays or decreased access to care at the time. More recently, maternal death rates have started to decline in Chile, Norway and the US. The US maternal mortality rate fell from 32.9 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021 to 22.3 per 100,000 in 2022, according to data from the CDC. \u201cIt is encouraging to see fewer maternal deaths in the U.S. in 2022, however the U.S. is still such an outlier, and the racial disparities are profoundly disturbing,\u201d Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, senior vice president for advancing health equity at the Commonwealth Fund, said in a news release. \u201cIt is time to center equity by diversifying the workforce and addressing head on the racial inequities in health care quality and access,\u201d she said. \u201cNow is the time to prioritize what we know is already working well in other countries: expanded health insurance coverage, stronger workforce and support systems, and paid maternity leave.\u201d The new report points to the US health care system, policy differences and maternity care deserts \u2013 where residents have limited or no access to maternity health care \u2013 as among the factors driving the high US maternal mortality rate. The US and Canada have the lowest overall supply of midwives and ob-gyns to care for pregnant and postpartum mothers, with only 16 and 13 providers per 1,000 live births respectively, according to the new report. In Canada, the maternal death rate is estimated to be about 8 deaths per 100,000 live births. More than 2.2 million US women of childbearing age \u2013 15 to 44 \u2013 live in maternity care deserts, a report by the nonprofit March of Dimes found in 2022. And last year, a separate analysis found that hospitals in a 10th of US counties have lost their childbirth units in the past five years. Midwives \u201ccould help address maternity workforce shortages in the U.S., where nearly half of counties lack a single ob-gyn. An estimated 8,000 more ob-gyns are needed to meet demand \u2014 a number that may rise to 22,000 by 2050,\u201d according to the new report. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period, up to 42 days after giving birth, and US women are least likely to have postpartum home visits, according to the new report. All the countries in the report, apart from the US, guarantee at least one home visit within a week postpartum. On the state level, only some Medicaid programs in the US cover these visits. \u201cThe World Health Organization recommends at least four health contacts in the first six weeks following birth, yet two of five U.S. women \u2014 more often than not younger, low-income, and uninsured \u2014 skip their one postpartum check-up,\u201d according to the new report. In the first week postpartum, the most common contributors to maternal deaths were severe bleeding, high blood pressure and infection, while cardiomyopathy \u2013 a heart muscle disease \u2013 was the leading cause of deaths later in the postpartum period, according to the new report. The US also stands alone as the only high-income country where there is no federally mandated paid leave policy for postpartum mothers, according to the new report. US women are less likely to have guaranteed paid leave compared with women in other high-income nations, where at least 14 weeks of paid leave from work is mandated. \u201cMaternal deaths are a preventable problem, and this problem can be solved. A lot of countries have been able to figure out ways to make it so that all women are in safe hands when it comes to having a baby and after giving birth. We need to extend that to women in the US as well,\u201d Gunja said. \u201cWe know most deaths are during the postpartum period \u2013 so making sure we have federally mandated paid leave, making sure we make it easy for women to get postpartum care, which means having home visits and not making women go to the doctor.\u201d A need for maternal health equity Racial disparities in maternal death rates persist not only in the United States but in other parts of the world where some women have less access to postpartum support, according to the new report. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, for example, Black women are four times more likely to die than white women are. In Australia, Aboriginal women are about twice as likely as non-Aboriginal women to die from maternal complications,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cOur findings suggest that an undersupply of maternity providers, especially midwives, and lack of access to comprehensive postpartum support, including maternity care coverage and mandated paid maternity leave, are contributing factors,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBecause both these factors disproportionately affect women of color, centering equity in any future policy changes will be a key to addressing the crisis.\u201d The Commonwealth Fund\u2019s report \u201chighlights the need to have enhanced maternal health care and maternal health equity in the US,\u201d said\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Tochi\u00a0Iroku-Malize, a family physician in Long Island, New York, and board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, who was not involved in the new report. \u201cFor us in family medicine, we know that we do play a crucial role in providing the obstetric care throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, which is needed, and maternal health care cannot stop after a patient gives birth,\u201d she said, calling on her US colleagues to watch out for maternal health complications \u2013 such as inflammation of the heart muscle or mental health conditions \u2013 in their postpartum patients, as the majority of maternal deaths occur during that time. \u201cA postpartum patient\u2019s body is still going through immense physical, hormonal and emotional changes that you really cannot overlook,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our training as family physicians, it helps us to screen and address the full spectrum of physical, emotional and social needs during pregnancy and the postpartum period.\u201d Adding more birth workers to the maternal health care workforce remains an important component and major need, said Dr. Michelle Owens, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Jackson,\u00a0Mississippi, who was not involved in the new report. \u201cBut we also need to ensure we have systems in place to facilitate escalation of care when needed so that each birthing person has access to the appropriate care in a timely manner. Timely diagnosis and treatment of complications are essential to ensuring the overall health and safety of our mothers and their children,\u201d Owens, a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, wrote in an email. \u201cACOG recommends that expectant mothers engage as active partners in their care, attend their scheduled appointments during and after pregnancy, and consider pregnancy planning in order to optimize pregnancy outcomes,\u201d she added. \u201cFinally, patients need to feel empowered to voice their concerns to their healthcare\u00a0providers, and for their providers to listen to their concerns and work collaboratively with patients for resolution of their\u00a0concerns.\u201d The report joins several other studies that have highlighted the United States\u2019 high maternal mortality rate, said Dr. Christopher Zahn, interim CEO and chief of clinical practice and health equity and quality for ACOG. \u201cDespite capturing different time periods and using different methodologies, what we can confidently take away from these reports is that the number of maternal deaths in this country is still unacceptably high,\u201d Zahn, who was not involved in the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s latest report, wrote in an email. \u201cIn 2016, the public was surprised to learn from a widely publicized study in The Lancet that the United States had the highest rate of maternal mortality compared to other developed countries. The Commonwealth Fund report shows that nearly a decade later this is still the case. This is obviously disheartening news, but we also must acknowledge that, despite the collective effort put toward improving maternal health outcomes, we have faced tremendous setbacks,\u201d Zahn said, referring to disruptions in access to care due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the overturning of Roe v. Wade and ongoing health inequities resulting in racial and ethnic disparities. \u201cThe areas of weakness in our policies and systems have been longstanding pain points and are clearly all contributors to the poor maternal health outcomes we are experiencing today,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cACOG will continue its work in improving quality and safety in maternal health care, educating its members on the necessity of eliminating racism and bias in medicine and advocating for policies that are supportive of both clinicians and patients in an effort to improve outcomes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/maternal-deaths-high-income-nations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_bird-flu-michigan-third-human-case", "text": "A\u00a0third person in the US\u00a0has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle, the\u00a0Michigan Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0said Thursday.\u00a0This is the second human case reported in the state and the fourth ever in the US. This time, in addition to some of the eye symptoms seen with previous H5N1 cases, the farmworker\u00a0reported a cough and other respiratory symptoms\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0more typical of human influenza infections, the health department said. \u201cThis individual had respiratory symptoms, including a cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes,\u201d Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday. \u201cWhat the respiratory symptoms tell us, more than anything, is that this virus, like many viruses, can present in more than one way, and for that reason, we should remain alert, not be alarmed,\u201d he added. Experts said that the addition of respiratory symptoms doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the virus has become more dangerous or that it may transmit more easily from person to person.\u00a0Instead, they say, the person probably developed lung symptoms because of the route of infection, perhaps by breathing in infectious aerosols in the milking parlor instead of rubbing their eyes with contaminated hands. \u201cWith the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye. With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,\u201d Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief\u00a0medical\u00a0executive for Michigan, said in a news release. \u201cNeither individual was wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.\u201d About 220 people are being monitored in Michigan because of potential exposure to the virus, Shah said. Michigan, the state with the highest number of dairy herds reported to be infected, is also beginning to conduct blood testing to see how many workers may have antibodies to the H5N1 virus, which would reflect past infections or exposures. The CDC agreed that the risk to the general public remains low. But this case highlights the elevated risk to those who work with infected animals. The CDC has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. \u201cPreviously, we focused on the importance of eye protection, given the conjunctivitis in the first two cases, but this case also underscores the importance of barrier protection, things like masks and other forms of protection for dairy workers, particularly those who are working with affected cows,\u201d Shah said. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. This is the third human infection known to be caused by this highly pathogenic form of avian influenza that\u2019s currently infecting dairy cattle in the US. None of the three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission. The other two cases involved eye infections, or conjunctivitis. The most recent worker had some mild eye symptoms but was not diagnosed with conjunctivitis. The person had direct contact with infected cattle\u00a0and notified local health officials that they were feeling sick.\u00a0Their symptoms are described as mild. The patient has been given the antiviral medication oseltamivir, the same active ingredient as Tamiflu, and they are isolating at home. Their family members have not developed symptoms, but they have also been offered antiviral medication as a precaution. None of the other workers at the dairy farm has gotten sick, and they are being monitored, the CDC said. \u201cGiven the high magnitude of interactions between people and dairy cows as well as with contaminated milking equipment, it is unsurprising that there are more human infections,\u201d said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University who is studying how the virus is transmitting in dairy barns. \u201cEvery time the virus is able to replicate in a person, there is the potential for the virus to adapt to humans and gain molecular features for replication in the respiratory tract and to spread person-to-person,\u201d Lakdawala said. Flu viruses are classified by two of the proteins that sit on their outer envelopes: H, or hemagglutinin, proteins and N, neuraminidase, proteins. CDC testing has confirmed that this third person carries a flu virus with an H5 protein, and the agency will do further sequencing to determine whether the N portion of the virus is N1, as is suspected. It expects to have those results in the next few days. The CDC confirmed Wednesday night that the person had an H5 influenza infection and forwarded the results to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that it was moving forward with a plan to repackage 4.8 million doses of a vaccine against H5N1 that is stored in bulk form in the Strategic National Stockpile. The bulk supplies would be put into multidose vials so they could be distributed and administered more easily. Officials said Thursday that before the vaccine would be given, it would need to go through certain regulatory steps. They also said there\u2019s not currently a plan to offer or recommend the doses to any specific  group of people. The fill-and-finish process to repackage the vaccines will take at least a couple of months, officials said in the news briefing. In the meantime, Michigan\u2019s health department is advising people working on poultry or dairy farms to get a seasonal flu vaccine. \u201cIt will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu viruses,\u201d the department said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/bird-flu-michigan-third-human-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}

The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other.

{"id": "2024_05_31_health_art-live-longer-wellness", "text": "Most people don\u2019t pick up a coloring book, paintbrush, poetry collection or museum membership for the health benefits \u2014 but maybe it\u2019s time to start. Research shows that art experiences, whether as a maker or a beholder, transform our biology by rewiring our brains and triggering the release of neurochemicals, hormones and endorphins. In response to a growing body of evidence that art can radically improve both physical and mental health in effective and measurable ways, more health care practitioners are prescribing arts engagement as part of treating a wide array of conditions, including: obesity, heart disease, chronic pain, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, loneliness and depression. The power of diverse arts practices to promote healing, well-being and even longevity provides benefits that rank right up there with exercise, nutrition and sleep, argued Susan Magsamen in her bestseller, \u201cYour Brain on Art: How the Arts Transform Us,\u201d coauthored with Ivy Ross. Could this be why the arts have evolved over millennia to become central to human experience? \u201cI always thought of art as a luxury,\u201d conceded Bianca Bosker in her new book, \u201cGet the Picture: A Mind-Bending Journey among the Inspired Artists and Obsessive Art Fiends Who Taught Me How to See.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t feed you, house you or be used to kill predators.\u201d But she discovered that many scientists consider art a basic human need. \u201cArt is one of our oldest creations (humans invented paint long before the wheel), one of the earliest means of communication (we drew long, long, long,\u00a0long\u00a0before we could write), and one of our most universal urges,\u201d she wrote. Both Bosker and Magsamen recommend that everyone make art a daily practice, based on evidence and experience. Here\u2019s why they see art as anything but a luxury. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: You both argue that art is fundamental to human existence. How do you explain that to skeptics? Susan Magsamen: We are literally physiologically wired for the arts. Input from our senses builds connections among our brains\u2019 86 billion neurons. Engaging with art, whether as a spectator or creator, actually brings information into our bodies and profoundly impacts our biological circuitry. Art\u2019s simultaneous activation of multiple neurological and physiological systems \u2014 a unique evolutionary phenomenon \u2014 involves the entire brain, body and spirit. The next time you feel moved by your favorite song, consider that an artist\u2019s choices are changing you on a cellular level. Bianca Bosker: Many experts agree that art is both an innate human impulse and a biological predisposition that has helped our species survive. It\u2019s only a modern-day misconception that looking at art is purely philosophical or intellectual. At its core, art is a physical experience \u2014 and that applies not only to music \u2014 with its thrumming bass that you can feel \u2014 but also to painting and visual arts as well. For the past 100 years or so, society has focused on the ideas behind artwork \u2014 that the thought trumps the thing. But when you watch artists making art, it is a physical experience. It\u2019s practically athletic. Engaging with artwork in person, as two bodies in space, is crucial. Research shows that factors like an artwork\u2019s size, or how we move around it, can change how we value art. \u00a0You can think about connecting with art the way you do with people. Just as a virtual meeting with someone is different from sitting across the dinner table, it\u2019s very different to look at a tiny image of an artwork on Instagram than it is to be body to body with, for example, a huge Mark Rothko painting. There\u2019s fascinating anecdotal evidence of how artworks can act on people at a physical level. The term \u201cStendhal syndrome\u201d describes people going to pieces \u2014 struck with dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, fainting spells or crying \u2014 in front of pieces of art. Stories like how a woman in a museum in Houston stripped naked in front of a Cy Twombly\u00a0\u00a0 painting suggest that, on a physical level, art can move us to do some incredible things. Magsamen: Not all artworks are positive, of course. It\u2019s critical to consider the kinds of sensorial experiences you bring into your life because of their power to make you feel, change your mood and affect your body. CNN: Bianca, you discuss finding value in some art experiences that might be considered unpleasant. What are the benefits of work that confuses us or makes us uncomfortable? Bosker: The fact that art isn\u2019t always pleasant is often part of its power. Scientists have puzzled over this question of why, over the last many thousands of years, humans have continued to keep engaging with art, even when, as they put it, it can \u201churt our sense of beauty.\u201d One compelling explanation is that we\u2019re drawn to uncomfortable, confounding images and experiences because our brains love the prediction errors they offer, aka surprises. Some researchers think art helps us fight the reducing tendencies of our minds. Contrary to common assumptions, we do not see the world like a video camera, dispassionately recording what\u2019s around us. Instead, our brains evolved to compress reality, acting like trash compactors, and for good reason. Oversimplifying our view of the world enabled us to spot the lion jumping out to eat us. But that ability also comes with risks. As some scientists put it, vision is a hallucination. What we\u2019re seeing is a construction based on our own individual filters of expectation that preemptively sort, dismiss and prioritize all the raw data coming in, even before we get the full picture. Looking at art can yank off those filters, surprising us and knocking our brains off their well-worn pathways. The glitch that art introduces is a gift that opens us to experiencing more nuance and beauty in the world around us. Magsamen: Art that pushes us beyond our limits helps form new neural pathways that might not otherwise develop in our day-to-day. Exercising these through art can help build resilience to get us through the suffering and uncertainties of life. When you\u2019re in despair, entering a church or other grand building can evoke awe, wonder and the sense of something bigger than you. Similarly, art, music and design\u00a0\u00a0 can alter our moods, taking us outside of ourselves. Building that capacity is an evolutionary imperative. CNN: What physiological benefits do the arts bring? Magsamen: Pinning down a definition of art can make some of the research tricky, but what we know suggests that artworks have very real effects on our mental and physical well-being. Physicians around the world prescribe visits to museums, engagement with arts and encounters with beauty. Different art forms affect the brain and body in different ways. Just as when we are prescribed medications, (it\u2019s true that) types, doses and durations of art work differently for different people. Doctors, social workers and public health practitioners are beginning to understand enough to collaborate with their clients to personalize their recommendations of particular artistic endeavors in specific frequencies and amounts to effect beneficial outcomes. Like exercise and good nutrition, engaging in the arts routinely will support your health. CNN: How can people develop an art practice to get those benefits? Bosker: Everything you need to have a meaningful experience with art is right in front of you. You don\u2019t need to have studied art history or spent years going to art fairs. You need attention and curiosity. An artist gave me great advice on how to engage with a work\u2014just try to notice five things about a piece, either in the work or in how it makes you feel.\u00a0Like,\u00a0\u201cThis pink makes me want to lick it\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201cThis green won\u2019t let me look away.\u201d The other foundational advice I give is to slow down. Many museum\u00a0visitors spend more time reading the description of the art than looking at the art itself, with the median time we spend with a work of art, both the piece and the label, being\u00a0just 21 seconds. Try \u201cslow looking.\u201d And pay attention to the physical form. Examining the artist\u2019s decisions offers you a pathway into the piece and a way to engage with art on your own terms. I used to take a scorched-earth approach to visiting museums with the attitude that seeing every single thing was how I\u2019d get my money\u2019s worth. That\u2019s the visual equivalent of binging at an all-you-can-eat buffet and then wondering why you feel ill. Instead of racing between masterpieces, spend more time with art that surprises you. And look for art everywhere, observing the everyday with an art mindset to counteract the reductionist tendencies of our brains. CNN: Do we have to be \u201cgood\u201d at art to reap its benefits? Magsamen: No. The art you\u2019re making doesn\u2019t have to be good for it to be valuable for you. One study showed that doing just 45 minutes of any kind of art lowered the stress hormone cortisol by as much as 25%.\u00a0\u00a0 Other research suggests artmaking builds skills in executive function, decision-making and, if you\u2019re working with others, collaboration. Playing music builds cognitive skills and enhances learning. And just one art experience per month can extend your life by 10 years. The process, not the product, is what\u2019s important. Bosker: You do not need any sort of license to engage with art. Art is a choice. It\u2019s a decision to fight against complacency and forge a life that\u2019s richer, more uncomfortable, more mind-blowing, more uncertain and ultimately, more beautiful.

Mini cucumbers and English cucumbers are not included in the recall. The recall comes after the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture found that a sample tested positive for salmonella. The US Food and Drug Administration is conducting more testing to see whether it\u2019s related to an ongoing outbreak investigation. Fresh Start Produce notified its customers that received recalled cucumbers directly from the company about the recall and requested that their own customers be notified of the recall. The cucumbers are \u201cunlikely in the marketplace,\u201d the company said, but customers can check with retailers to determine whether recalled cucumbers were sold there. Products should be discarded or returned to the store. Symptoms of a salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that can start within hours or days of consuming the bacteria. Most people will recover with treatment but should seek immediate attention from a health-care provider if they have severe symptoms, symptoms that don\u2019t improve after a few days or signs of dehydration. Children, elderly people and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to become severely ill.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/health/cucumbers-recalled-salmonella/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_fauci-testimony-house-hearing-covid-19", "text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified on Monday at a House subcommittee hearing about the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the origins of the virus. The hearing was Fauci\u2019s first public testimony on Capitol Hill since his retirement from government service. It turned contentious at times as Republicans grilled Fauci over a wide range of topics, including the basis for public health recommendations during the pandemic and email use by public health officials. Here are key takeaways from the hearing: US still needs to close communication gaps to be better prepared for next pandemic Fauci said there are still some things the US needs to work on to be more prepared for another pandemic in the aftermath of Covid-19, saying in \u201csome respects\u201d the country is better prepared to deal with a health crisis than in 2020, \u201cbut in others, I am still disappointed.\u201d One thing that he hopes the US will do better moving forward is tightening communication between the federal response and local public health officials. Fauci said there was a \u201cdisconnect between the health-care system and the public health system\u201d during Covid-19 in the US. Specifically, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not demand information from local agencies, which caused a lag in sharing data. \u201cWe were at a disadvantage,\u201d Fauci said, adding that the CDC is working on ways to fix this pain point. Republicans grill Fauci over public health official\u2019s use of email Fauci testified Monday that he has not used his personal email to conduct business, and he was not aware before a congressional investigation that a former senior adviser at the National Institutes of Health had used unofficial email. \u201cWhat you saw, I believe, with Dr. Morens was an aberrancy and an outlier,\u201d Fauci testified on Monday, referring to a former senior adviser at NIH. \u201cThe individuals at the NIH and NIAID are a very committed group of individuals and this one instance that you point out is an aberrancy and an outlier.\u201d The House Oversight select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic previously released a series of private emails that Republicans argue show that some NIH officials deleted emails and tried to get around requirements to disclose information through public records laws. In a memo published at the end of May, committee members said Dr. David Morens, a former senior adviser to Fauci, engaged in \u201cnefarious behavior.\u201d Fauci said he had worked on research publications with Morens in his role as a senior adviser, but Morens\u2019 role did not include advising Fauci on any department policy. The committee points to email that Morens sent another colleague that suggests he would send email to Fauci\u2019s private account and \u201cthere is no worry about FOIAs.\u201d FOIA is the Freedom of Information Act, the law that gives the public the right to obtain federal records, including emails sent within government agencies. Morens\u2019 email goes on to say that he can also hand information to Fauci to avoid it being a part of the public record. Fauci testifies about possible origins of virus that caused Covid-19 In Fauci\u2019s testimony, he addressed what he said were \u201ccertain issues that have been seriously distorted concerning me,\u201d particularly around the origin of the virus that led to the Covid-19 pandemic. Fauci testified that in early 2020, he was informed through phone calls with two scientists \u2014 Jeremy Farrar, then the director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK and Kristian Andersen, a scientist at Scripps Research \u2014 that they and others were concerned that the virus that causes Covid-19 could have been manipulated in the lab. The day after those calls, Fauci said he participated in a conference call with several international virologists to discuss manipulation in the lab or possible spillover from animals to humans. He characterized the discussion as \u201clively,\u201d with arguments on both sides. Fauci said he did not try to steer the discussion in any direction. Fauci said the virologists on the joint call decided to more carefully examine the genomic sequence and after further examination, and said, \u201cseveral who at first were concerned about lab manipulation became convinced that the virus was not deliberately manipulated.\u201d Scientists found the most likely scenario, Fauci said, was a virus that transferred from an animal to a human, \u201calthough they still kept an open mind.\u201d \u201cThe accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous,\u201d Fauci said, noting he had no input into the content on a paper published in March 2020 that discussed the possible origins of the virus. Some of the world\u2019s leading scientists have investigated the origins of the virus, including a committee of experts from the World Health Organization. Most scientists believe that the virus spread from animals to humans in China. Some studies have also said that the theory that the virus escaped from a Chinese lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, cannot be ruled out. Most US intelligence agencies say the virus was not genetically engineered, but it is still not totally clear how the pandemic started. A US intelligence analysis released last year said either origin was possible, and the community remains split on the issue. The US Department of Energy assessed last year that it had \u201clow confidence\u201d in the lab leak theory. No US federal agency believes that the virus that causes Covid-19 was created as a bioweapon. \u201cI cannot account nor can anyone account for other things that might be going on in China, which is the reason why I have always said and will say now, I keep an open mind as to what the origin is,\u201d Fauci said Monday. Fauci details threats he and his family have received Fauci detailed the threats he received during his time as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, describing death threats against him and threats against his wife and daughters. Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell asked Fauci to explain what some of the threats were and he replied: \u201cEverything from harassments from emails, texts, letters of myself, my wife, my three daughters. There have been credible death threats leading to the arrest of two individuals \u2013 and credible death threats means someone who clearly was on their way to kill me. And it\u2019s required my having protective services essentially all the time.\u201d Fauci said he feared that the threats against public health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic would serve as a \u201cpowerful disincentive\u201d for the best and brightest candidates to take up the profession. \u201cThey say to themselves, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go there. Why should I get involved in that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re reluctant to put themselves and their family through what they see their colleagues being put through,\u201d he testified. The 6-foot social distance guideline came from the CDC, Fauci clarifies Fauci clarified that the 6-foot guidance for social distancing given during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic did not come from him, but from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cIt actually came from the CDC. The CDC was responsible for those kinds of guidelines to schools, not me,\u201d Fauci said. Fauci, who repeated the guidance during the pandemic, once said that there was no science behind it \u2014 but he meant that there were no clinical trials to back it up. \u201cIt had little to do with me since I didn\u2019t make the recommendation and my saying \u2018there was no science behind it\u2019 meant there was no clinical trial behind that,\u201d Fauci said. He added that he believed the CDC used studies about droplets years ago as reasoning for the 6-foot guidelines. When the CDC first promoted the idea of 6-foot \u201csocial distancing\u201d for people who had to be around others during the pandemic, scientists thought that larger contaminated droplets would fall out of the air quickly and couldn\u2019t travel farther than 6 feet. At the time, the World Health Organization recommended that people keep a meter, or 3.3 feet, between them. But even as early as 2021, scientists were starting to understand that the coronavirus is airborne, meaning it could spread through droplets\u00a0and aerosols, smaller particles that could travel\u00a0even farther\u00a0and float in the air. That\u2019s in large part why public health agencies emphasized the importance of people wearing masks to reduce the number of germs that could float in the air and make people sick.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-testimony-house-hearing-covid-19/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}

Both of these strains of the influenza A virus have primarily affected farmed and wild birds, infecting flocks around the world. About 900 human cases of H5N1 have been reported since 1996, and about half of people known to be infected have died.\u00a0On Wednesday, WHO said it had confirmed the first case of human infection of H5N2 in a 59-year-old resident of Mexico. The source of the person\u2019s infection is unknown, although WHO noted that H5N2 viruses had been reported in poultry in Mexico. Because any new influenza A infection in people has the potential for high public health impact, it must be reported to WHO.\u00a0The organization said that based on current knowledge, the risk to the general public from H5N2 is low, since other H5 subtypes are known to infect humans but none has been shown to cause sustained human-to-human spread. The person, who had multiple underlying medical conditions, had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before they developed new symptoms. In mid-April, they developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness.\u00a0On April 24, they sought medical attention and were hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. The person died of complications that day. On May 8, a sample sent for specialized testing indicated that it was positive for H5N2, and the result was subsequently confirmed by a different lab. Of 17 people at the hospital who\u2019d been in contact with the patient, no further cases were identified. Twelve additional contacts were identified near the person\u2019s residence, and seven of those had symptoms, but testing of samples from these cases didn\u2019t identify Covid-19 or any type of flu.\u00a0Scientists are now testing blood samples to see whether they can find antibodies that would point to past infections. In March, an H5N2 outbreak was reported in a backyard poultry farm in a neighboring state to the one where the person lived.\u00a0According to WHO, it hasn\u2019t been possible to establish whether this case is related to recent poultry outbreaks. Flu viruses normally circulate in birds but occasionally can jump to other species, including humans.\u00a0People catch the viruses from direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, type A flu strains can be classified as bird flu, swine flu or other types of animal influenza viruses. Bird flu infections in humans can cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal.\u00a0 Eye infections like conjunctivitis, gut symptoms and brain swelling are also possible.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/bird-flu-mexico-human-h5n2/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_fda-vaccine-advisers-covid-shot", "text": "Another new version of the Covid-19 vaccine will probably be coming this fall. The US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s\u00a0committee of independent advisers\u00a0voted unanimously Wednesday to recommend that the agency tell vaccine manufacturers to update the Covid-19 shots so they will be more effective against the JN.1 lineage of the coronavirus. The committee voted on the question, \u201cFor the 2024-2025 Formula of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., does the committee recommend a monovalent JN.1-lineage vaccine composition?\u201d All 16 of the advisers voted \u201cyes.\u201d The decision now goes to the full FDA. If the agency agrees with its advisory committee, the new shot will be a monovalent vaccine, offering protection against one coronavirus variant. Some previous vaccines have been bivalent, meaning they were formulated to protect against two variants. There are a few virus variants in circulation now, but they are relatively similar. JN.1 and its descendants KP.2 and KP.3 are the versions of the virus that are most common in the US right now, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA told the advisory committee Wednesday that studies have shown that currently available Covid-19 vaccines appear to be less effective against the variants that are now in circulation. When manufacturers updated their vaccines last year to better match the variants that were in circulation then, it seemed to offer better protection. \u201cMatch does matter somewhat,\u201d said Dr. Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cJN.1 has continued to evolve, and it makes it somewhat difficult to pick the particular specific strain to be used\u201d this year, he told the committee. Because of manufacturing timelines, experts have to make predictions now if they want a new vaccine for fall. This is what the FDA\u2019s committee has done for the past couple of years, and \u201cI think it\u2019s worked pretty well,\u201d Weir said. Covid-19 cases are relatively low right now. Only 3% to 4% of people who are getting tested are positive for the virus, said Dr. Natalie Thornburg, acting chief of the Laboratory Branch of the Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC. By comparison, at the peak of the Omicron surge in late 2021, test positivity rates were at 30%. Hospitalization rates are also the lowest they have been since March 2020, Thornburg said. Many people have some protection against the disease through vaccination or because they\u2019ve had Covid before. People who got the current Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 which was updated last fall \u2013 have protection from serious disease and death across all age groups, but as with past formulations, that protection wanes over time, Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles, vaccine effectiveness program lead with the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the committee. The advisers agreed that more people need to get updated vaccines. Only about 25% of adults have gotten the most recent shot, according to a presentation to the committee. In only the fall and winter months last season, Covid sent more than half a million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000, according to data presented at the meeting. The people most likely to get seriously ill or die were unvaccinated, Link-Gelles said, and among the children who were hospitalized, half had no underlying conditions. \u201cThis, I think, emphasizes the need for vaccination regardless of underlying condition, status or age,\u201d she said. The Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers told the committee that they have done some work to prepare for the FDA\u2019s decision on the composition of the vaccine. Animal and lab studies show that shots made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax that target the JN.1 variant seem to work well and are safe, the companies said. Novavax said its updated shot would need to be the JN.1 version because its protein vaccine takes about six months to make, and that\u2019s the version it has been working on. The company said it could get the shot to US warehouses by August. Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines can be developed more quickly, and those companies said they could have either a JN.1 shot or a KP.2 shot ready for fall. Moderna said it could supply the US market by mid-August, and Pfizer said its shot could be immediately ready upon approval. The committee discussed but did not vote on whether the shot should match JN.1 or KP.2. Most of the members preferred JN.1 so Americans would have an option to get an mRNA vaccine or a more traditional protein-based vaccine. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told the committee that the FDA will take these recommendations into consideration as it makes its final choice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/fda-vaccine-advisers-covid-shot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_health_internet-addiction-teen-brain-activity-wellness", "text": "Teens who spend lots of time on social media have complained of feeling like they can\u2019t pay attention to more important things like homework or time with loved ones. A new study has possibly captured that objectively, finding that for teens diagnosed with internet addiction, signaling between brain regions important for controlling attention, working memory and more was disrupted. The findings are from a review, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Mental Health, of 12 neuroimaging studies of a few hundred adolescents ages 10 to 19 between 2013 and 2022. \u201cThe behavioural addiction brought on by excessive internet use has become a rising source of concern since the last decade,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. The criteria for clinical diagnosis of internet addiction in the included studies were \u201cone\u2019s persistent preoccupation with the internet, withdrawal symptoms when away from the internet, and sacrificing relationships (for) time to spend on the internet over an extended period of time (e.g., 12 months),\u201d said Max Chang, first author of the study and outreach case manager at the nonprofit Peninsula Family Service in San Francisco, via email. \u201cThe pattern of behaviour results in significant impairment or distress in the individual\u2019s life.\u201d Given the changing state of adolescent brains compared with adults, the authors felt understanding the impacts of internet addiction on the teenage participants\u2019 brains was vital. When participants clinically diagnosed with internet addiction engaged in activities governed by the brain\u2019s executive function network \u2014 behaviors requiring attention, planning, decision-making and impulse control \u2014 those brain regions showed substantial disruption in their ability to work together, compared to those in peers without internet addiction. The authors think such signaling changes could suggest these behaviors can become more difficult to perform, potentially influencing development and well-being. \u201cWhile this paper presents a straightforward systematic review suggesting that there are associations between functional connectivity in the brain and internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 there are a number of fundamental limitations to be aware of that are critical to any interpretation,\u201d Dr. David Ellis, a behavioral scientist at the University of Bath\u2019s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour, said in a news release. \u201cCause and effect cannot be drawn from these studies,\u201d said Ellis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cSecond, the focus on functional connectivity comes at the expense of any critique about the key measure of interest. Specifically, internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 which was initially conjured up by (psychiatrist) Ivan K. Goldberg in 1995 as a joke. \u201cToday, the conceptualisation and measurement of internet \u2018addiction\u2019 is neither universally accepted and certainly not diagnosable using the survey instruments used in the studies included as part of the review,\u201d Ellis added. \u201cSimilarly, the enormity of activities that the internet allows for immediately makes this definition somewhat redundant.\u201d In the United States, internet addiction isn\u2019t included in the DSM-V \u2014 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the US. It does, however, list internet gaming disorder. All the studies the authors reviewed were all conducted in Asia and consisted of mostly male participants. China was the first country to declare internet addiction a \u201cpublic health crisis.\u201d \u201cSuch definitions, despite being widely critiqued, also have a tendency to move the focus away from genuine online harm and towards a conclusion that suggests the removal of technology from people\u2019s lives will be helpful,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSolid evidence to suggest that removing the internet brings any tangible benefits has not been forthcoming.\u201d Additionally, all studies were conducted at one point in time, said Dr. Eva Telzer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cGiven that there are no longitudinal data,\u201d Telzer said, \u201cit is very possible that adolescents who have underlying differences in brain connectivity patterns are more vulnerable to developing internet addiction.\u201d Overcoming internet addiction If internet addiction is what caused the disruption in participants\u2019 brain signaling, the reason why may have to do with neural pathways related to addiction, said Dr. Smita Das, an addiction psychiatrist and clinical associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine in California. Das wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The functional connectivity patterns in participants\u2019 brains are, in fact, in line with those observed in people with substance addictions, said Dr. Caglar Yildirim, an associate teaching professor of computer science at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston. Yildirim wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cOverall, the mechanisms underlying internet addiction are more like an emerging pattern than a finished picture,\u201d Chang said. \u201cA lot of causality between what happens in the brain and what is displayed through behavior is still being understood. As of now, observation using biomarkers such as functional connectivity helps bridge that gap.\u201d\u00a0 If you\u2019re wondering if your teen struggles with internet addiction, behaviors such as withdrawing from relationships are a telltale sign, Chang said. \u201cSimilar to substance and gambling disorders, internet addiction rewires the brain, making it harder to resist internet related stimuli,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, unlike gambling or substance usage, the internet is an important part of our lives. Balancing the usefulness and dangers of the internet is a field that is very crucial going forward in adolescent development.\u201d Find what keeps your teen off the internet and help them do more of it, Yildirim suggested. You can also talk with your child\u2019s doctor to see if behavioral strategies can work, Das suggested. Therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness and motivational interviewing are helpful. The latter, which originated in the field of addiction treatment, is a counseling method that aims to increase a patient\u2019s motivation for, and commitment to, behavioral change by eliciting and exploring the patient\u2019s own reasons for wanting change. In severe cases, a psychiatrist may suggest medication to treat certain types of technology addiction, she added.

{"id": "2024_05_31_health_pig-kidney-transplant-removal", "text": "A genetically engineered pig kidney has been removed from a transplant patient\u00a0after it started losing function, according to a statement on Friday from NYU Langone Health. The patient, 54-year-old Lisa Pisano of New Jersey, is stable and has started dialysis, her doctors said. Pisano first received a mechanical heart pump, called an LVAD, on April 4 and then, on April 12, received a kidney and thymus gland from a gene-edited pig. Her case is the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, and it was the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the thymus. The kidney had to be removed due \u201cunique challenges in managing both her cardiovascular health and kidney function\u201d 47 days after the transplant, NYU Langone Health said. There were multiple episodes where \u201cthe blood pressure she could generate from the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was not adequate to provide optimal perfusion to the kidney, causing cumulative reduction in her kidney function,\u201d said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, in the statement. \u201cOn balance, the kidney was no longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen.\u201d There were no signs of rejection after a recent biopsy of the kidney, according to Montgomery, but there was \u201csignificant injury to the kidney from episodes of insufficient blood flow.\u201d Pisano\u2019s heart pump is continuing to function. \u201cLisa is a pioneer and a hero in the effort to create a sustainable option for people waiting for an organ transplant. Her strength and bravery in the face of adversity inspires and drives us as we continue pursuing the hope and promise of xenotransplantation,\u201d said Montgomery. The need for organs far outstrips the number available.\u00a0Every day, 17 people die in the US waiting for an organ, and kidneys are in shortest supply.\u00a0According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, roughly 27,000 kidneys were transplanted in 2023, but nearly 89,000 people were on the waiting list for those organs. Experts say xenotransplants \u2013 transplants of animal organs into people \u2013 are crucial to solving the organ shortage. Gene editing makes precise edits to a pig\u2019s DNA to help keep the human body from recognizing the animal\u2019s organs as foreign and rejecting them. Pisano\u2019s doctors received permission from the US Food and Drug Administration to do the new procedures under its expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policies, which give terminally ill patients without other options access to investigational medical products outside of clinical trials. The kidney came from a pig genetically engineered to disrupt a gene responsible for the production of a sugar, called alpha-gal. It\u2019s found on the surface of animal cells and\u00a0can be recognized and attacked by human antibodies. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed under the cover of the kidney in an attempt to help Pisano\u2019s immune system recognize the organ. While the kidney ultimately had to be removed from Pisano, Montgomery said the kidney would be studied for further insights and\ufeff stressed the importance of her contribution to the larger goal. \u201cLisa knew the world would learn a great deal through her altruism, and we will apply what she has taught us as we seek to make xenotransplantation a solution for the inadequate supply of human organs,\u201d Montgomery said in the statement.

{"id": "2024_06_05_health_h5n1-bird-flu-in-wastewater", "text": "Results from recent wastewater testing across the US suggests that H5N1 bird flu may not be as widespread as first feared. The data, released Monday by the nonprofit WastewaterSCAN network, showed detections of the H5 protein portion of the flu virus in sewage from 14 water treatment plants in five states, mostly in Texas and Michigan, suggesting that an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle may largely be confined to states that have already been identified as having affected herds. \u201cWe\u2019re not detecting H5 everywhere. We\u2019re only detecting it in certain locations,\u201d said Dr. Alexandria Boehm, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. The test for H5 was run in 190 monitoring sites across the US over the past two weeks.\u00a0Nine states are not enrolled in the WastewaterSCAN network and so are not included in the surveillance: South Carolina, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. There were detections in two states where no affected dairy herds have been identified: Iowa and Minnesota.\u00a0However, both states have seen recent outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry. Boehm explained that the researchers aren\u2019t sure exactly what the sources of H5 in wastewater may be. It could be from permitted discharges of unused or leftover raw milk to wastewater treatment plants where the samples are collected. \u201cIn the case of Amarillo in Texas, for example, they had a dairy processing plant that was making processed dairy products, and their waste stream discharges into the wastewater treatment plant because milk, raw milk from the local area, was coming into that plant with H5N1,\u201d Boehm said. That may not be the source in all areas, however.\u00a0There\u2019s a chance the H5 detections might also be due to human infections or from less-likely sources such as infected wild birds that might contaminate wastewater or stormwater runoff that picks up H5N1 virus on its way into sewers, perhaps from bird droppings, Boehm said. People shouldn\u2019t be unduly alarmed if H5 appears in a nearby sewer system, Boehm said. \u201cThe way that we\u2019re thinking about it is that wastewater is providing an additional tool to the nation\u201d to keep eyes on the virus amid the outbreak, Boehm said. Experts say such tools are needed because testing of cattle has been limited, and the farm workers who are most at risk of catching the virus from infected cattle often live on minimal incomes and might not want to be tested if it means they could miss days of work without pay. As of Tuesday, 81 dairy herds with infected cows have been identified across nine states.\u00a0States reporting the highest numbers of affected herds are Michigan, Idaho and Texas, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The USDA issued an order in late April requiring dairy cattle to test negative for H5N1 before they can be transported across state lines, but many farmers have been reluctant to let government officials into their farms to conduct further surveillance for the virus. Dr. Eric Deeble, deputy assistant secretary for the USDA, said last week that more than 17,000 tests for H5N1 flu had been run on cattle, with the caveat that\u00a0some of the samples were pooled, so one test may represent more than one cow. But when asked to estimate whether one thousand, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of cows had been affected, Deeble said he could not, underscoring the large degree of uncertainty involved in understanding the scope of the outbreak. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring for human infections through a representative network of clinics that submit test results for respiratory viruses to the agency and through public health laboratories.\u00a0It\u2019s also hoping to conduct an epidemiological study to better understand the risk of transmission between animals and humans on farms. In a study published May 29, the CDC estimated that there was a 72% to 77% chance that current surveillance would detect one human case of H5N1 in an emergency room or urgent care clinic monthly, provided the person had symptoms similar in severity to a case of seasonal flu, and there were at least 100 cases of H5N1 in the population. \u201cWhile these findings indicate that existing flu surveillance systems are likely to detect at least one novel influenza case before the virus has spread widely, CDC is asking that health care providers remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of influenza virus infection over the summer and maintain high rates of testing,\u201d the agency said in a news release.\u00a0It also encouraged providers to forward any specimens that test positive for influenza A to public health laboratories for additional testing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/h5n1-bird-flu-in-wastewater/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_tattoo-lymphoma-cancer-study", "text": "A Swedish study has found a potential link between tattoos and a type of cancer called malignant lymphoma, but it ultimately calls for more research on the topic, and cancer experts say the possible link is overblown. The researchers, from Lund University, said they wanted to do the study because so little is known about the long-term health effects of tattooing, despite its continuing popularity. In the US alone, nearly a third of people have at least one tattoo, a 2023 Pew Research Center survey found. The study, published in the most recent edition of the journal eClinicalMedicine, involved nearly 12,000 people in Sweden. From population registries, researchers identified everyone diagnosed with malignant lymphoma between 2007 and 2017 \u2013 nearly 3,000 people \u2013 and matched them with a group of the same age and gender mix who didn\u2019t have cancer. Malignant lymphoma is cancer of the lymphatic system, the part of the body that helps fight off germs and disease. Known risk factors include a weakened immune system caused by illness or immune disorders like AIDS, infections such as Epstein-Barr, age and a family history of the disease. Some exposure to chemicals like pesticides and herbicides can also increase the risk of lymphoma, in addition to secondhand smoke. In 2021, the study authors sent questionnaires to the people they had identified, asking about certain lifestyle factors that may increase the risk of this kind of cancer and about whether they had any tattoos. Even after the researchers factored in things that are known to affect cancer risk like smoking and age, they found that the risk of malignant lymphoma was 21% higher among those who had at least one tattoo. The finding is only an association, not a direct link, but the study authors emphasized that more research will be needed to flesh out this conclusion. To the researchers\u2019 surprise, they found no evidence to suggest that the risk increased as the person\u2019s skin was covered in more tattoos. \u201cWe do not yet know why this was the case. One can only speculate that a tattoo, regardless of size, triggers a low-grade inflammation in the body, which in turn can trigger cancer,\u201d said co-author Christel Nielsen, an associate professor in the\u00a0Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Lund University, in a news release. \u201cThe picture is thus more complex than we initially thought.\u201d The study was not set up to determine what the link between cancer and tattoos may be, if any, but experts are skeptical. The conclusion is \u201creally overstated,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved with the research. \u201cIf I were writing that paper, if I were the editor, I would have said the conclusion is, there is no evidence for a strong association,\u201d he said. The data is solid, he said, but the main risk factors for lymphomas are not found in tattooing. \u201cI would say the message here should be, we really didn\u2019t learn a lot about whether tattoos are associated with cancer with this, and if I had to make a conclusion, I would say the data suggests there is no association,\u201d Rebbeck said, noting that a smaller 2023 study on a connection between tattooing and lymphomas or hematologic cancer also found no increased risk. The 21% estimate of added risk comes from the models in the new study, but it is not statistically significant, he said. Dr. Catherine Diefenbach, director of the Clinical Lymphoma Program at the NYU Langone Health Perlmutter Cancer Center, said some things about the study don\u2019t add up. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make sense to me is why there\u2019s no correlation with the size of the tattoo. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to me that if there is an immune or toxic response, that the bigger tattoo didn\u2019t have any impact at all on the association,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of questions I have from this study.\u201d Diefenbach said she\u2019s never been asked about a connection between tattooing and cancer, but she has seen news reports about the new research. \u201cI think people are getting very nervous about something that is an early study that has to be validated,\u201d she said. The study authors speculate that if tattoos do increase the risk of a malignant lymphoma, one reason may be because of a problem with the ink itself. Tattoo ink can often have chemicals that are considered carcinogens, including metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Earlier studies have shown that the ink can sometimes travel through the body, and tiny particles can get stuck in the lymph nodes, which could lead to health problems. Another study found that tattoo ink could slightly alter parts of blood cells that communicate with others, but it is unclear whether that has an effect on health. Even infections are rare after tattooing, studies show. In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration issued draft guidance to the makers of tattoo ink and its distributors to help them recognize when ink may be contaminated, after the agency received reports about contaminated inks and some companies recalled those inks. The FDA will log and investigate complaints against the industry, but it doesn\u2019t regulate the practice or the inks used in tattooing because it\u2019s considered a cosmetic procedure. Nielsen said her group will look into whether tattoos are associated with other types of cancer or inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, lupus, high blood pressure and heart disease. Rebbeck notes that these types of research can be tricky for the public to interpret. He helps run cancerfactfinder.org, which aims to help people understand what does and does not cause cancer. Some have asked about tattoos, but the research doesn\u2019t really show a connection, he says. \u201cI would say we really don\u2019t know very much, but there\u2019s no strong evidence that having a tattoo is going to cause cancer,\u201d Rebbeck said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/tattoo-lymphoma-cancer-study/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_08_23_health_avian-flu-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds.   There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called \u201cInfluenza A (H5N1),\u201d or the \u201cH5N1 virus.\u201d Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces.  Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia.   The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa.

{"id": "2024_06_03_health_alcohol-planes-heart-study-wellness", "text": "The \u201cfasten seat belt\u201d sign is off, and the time for a nap on your flight is on. You grab your neck pillow, eye mask and a glass of wine to make sure you are well-rested on the other side. That tactic isn\u2019t such a good idea, according to new research. Airplane cabins are pressurized to maintain the equivalent of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) of elevation, meaning the air pressure and oxygen levels are lower than what most people experience on Earth. Combine that with alcohol consumption and sleep, and it\u2019s more likely a person will experience an intensified drop in oxygen saturation in their blood, according to a study published Monday in the journal Thorax. \u201cPlease don\u2019t drink alcohol on board of airplanes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Eva-Maria Elmenhorst, deputy of the department of sleep and human factors and leader of the Working Group on Performance and Sleep at the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne, Germany, in an email. To investigate, researchers created an atmospheric environment similar to an airplane cabin in flight. Over two nights, 48 healthy adults slept for four hours in two different environments \u2014 once without alcohol and once after drinking the equivalent of two glasses of wine or cans of beer, according to the study. On the nights with alcohol, researchers saw a lowered amount of oxygen and an increased heart rate, the study showed. \u201cThe combination of alcohol intake with sleeping under hypobaric conditions poses a considerable strain on the cardiac system and might lead to exacerbation of symptoms in patients with cardiac or pulmonary diseases,\u201d the researchers said. The study is small, but it provides a starting point from which researchers should keep investigating the relationship between sleep, flight and alcohol, said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. Many people may be drinking onboard to help them get to sleep in an often uncomfortable cabin \u2014 but doing so negatively impacts both long-term health and the immediate goal of getting some rest, experts said. Alcohol gets you sleep \u2014 but not good sleep The study authors didn\u2019t just collect data on heart strain. They also took a closer look at the participants\u2019 quality of sleep. It wasn\u2019t great. Time in REM sleep \u2014 the rapid-eye movement stage that may be important to memory consolidation and brain recuperation \u2014 was shorter for people in the airplane conditions who had alcohol, the study showed. The finding isn\u2019t a surprise, Freeman said. Alcohol may help you get to sleep, but the quality isn\u2019t as good as sleep while sober, he said. \u201cMany people have witnessed when people drink heavily, their snoring and the sleep apnea is much more severe,\u201d Freeman said. The quantity of sleep under the influence also tends to be different, said Dr. Shalini Paruthi, adjunct professor at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. People tend to get more fragmented sleep after drinking, meaning they wake up more in the night and tend not to sleep as long, said Paruthi, an American Academy of Sleep Medicine spokesperson. She was not involved in the research. \u2018Sometimes people will just think about the immediate effect of \u2018ooh it will make me fall asleep faster\u2019 but they forget about all the other effects of the alcohol,\u201d she said. Be especially careful not to mix sleep aids with alcohol, because both are depressants and intensify their sedative effects when taken together, Freeman said. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen \u2026 people taking sleeping pills combined with alcohol, which is a major issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, there\u2019s oftentimes a medical emergency.\u201d How to rest before your destination If possible, try to keep to your natural body cycles when flying, Freeman said \u2014 although that might not always be possible. That can look like choosing a flight that lines up with your sleep patterns so you can either land and just finish sleeping or land and start your day, he said. Avoid creating those sleep and wake cycles with too many stimulants such as coffee or energy drinks and depressants like alcohol, he added. Next, stay hydrated, because flying typically involves a dry environment and people don\u2019t always hydrate properly, Freeman said. The best thing to drink is water, he said. Foods served at airports and airplanes can lean salty, greasy and heavily processed, so Freeman recommends either packing your own or finding airport options that are lighter and largely plant-based. Exercise can also help you sleep better, so he advises avoiding the elevators and moving sidewalks to get some steps in instead. If you are on a long flight, try to get up and get some movement as well, Freeman said. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019ll point out is there\u2019s lots of evidence that suggests that the blue lights that are emitted from screens and all that interfere with our sleep patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are trying to sleep on a plane, consider getting a noise-canceling headphone and maybe not use your screens, especially while you\u2019re waiting for the flight to take off.\u201d It may be harder to keep up your healthy habits on days when you fly, but making efforts to do so can help you arrive feeling good and ready for an adventure, Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/health/alcohol-planes-heart-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_06_08_health_pets-air-quality-wildfire-smoke-safety-wellness-climate", "text": "More than 100 fires are burning across Canada, with some wildfires forcing evacuations and affecting air quality in Canada and the northern tier of the United States \u2014 and experts have noted that pets could be at risk, too. Dr. Gabrielle Fadl of the Bond Vet Clinic in New York City told CNN last year that her practice has had a \u201csignificant influx of calls\u201d from concerned clients seeking guidance on how to protect their animals from the poor air quality outside. It also received a few calls from patients, particularly pregnant and older people, requesting to reschedule appointments. \u201cExposure to polluted air can have a profound impact on our pets\u2019 health, leading to respiratory issues, allergies, and even exacerbating existing conditions such as asthma,\u201d Fadl said. To ensure pets\u2019 well-being, Fadl advised considering the following precautions. Limit outdoor activities Reduce the time your pets spend outdoors as much as possible, especially during periods of unhealthy air quality. Doing so can help minimize their exposure to harmful pollutants and allergens, Fadl said. You also shouldn\u2019t run with your dog outdoors, said Dr. Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the department of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIf you can, just walk a little bit more slowly so you\u2019re not breathing as deeply,\u201d he added. \u201cThat can help.\u201d Avoiding strenuous activity is important for pets as well since they can\u2019t breathe as deeply as humans, said Dr. Jessica Bell, an assistant professor in the college of veterinary medicine at Washington State University. Animals also can experience difficulty breathing, asthma-like symptoms and bronchitis. If you must take pets outside, do so when air quality is best, Bell said. \u201cThat might be early in the morning before the air quality changes with settling of moisture.\u201d New York City\u2019s Emergency Management advised wiping your pet\u2019s muzzle, feet and coat with a damp cloth after being outside. Create a safe environment indoors Even pets kept indoors can be affected by the air quality outside, Bell said, so make sure you have proper ventilation in your home. Keep the windows closed to prevent outdoor pollutants, such as fine particulate matter, from entering. These particles are the tiniest, yet most dangerous, of pollutants, and have been linked to health problems such as heart disease, asthma and other respiratory illnesses. \u201cA major difference between wildfires and, for example, a fire that you might burn in a backyard bonfire is that often there are synthetic materials being burned that produce compounds that can be dangerous like hydrogen cyanide,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Kornreich, director of the Cornell Feline Health Center in Ithaca, New York. \u201cCarbon monoxide can also get into the bloodstream, and those two interfere with the delivery of oxygen to organs,\u201d Kornreich added. \u201cIn some cases, these fires can also produce chemical irritants. So the chemicals can actually trigger inflammation in the airways.\u201d Additionally, use air purifiers or filters to improve air quality inside. When keeping pets indoors, activities for them can be important, Bell said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of puzzle games that dogs and cats can do,\u201d she said. \u201cFill the puzzles (with) their treats or their dog food and hide it in the house. They have to hunt for them or have to roll them around or they knock all the kibbles out.\u201d Also ensure pets have access to clean water both indoors and outdoors so it\u2019s not tainted with smoke, Bell added. Monitor animals\u2019 symptoms Be on the lookout for any signs of respiratory distress or discomfort in your pets such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing or trouble breathing. Pay attention to any changes to their normal behavior, such as wanting to play fetch for 10 minutes instead of an hour as usual, Bell said. \u201cThat decrease in activity \u2014 we just have to pay attention to (it) and not force them to be active when their body says not to be.\u201d Indoor cats should be monitored for these same symptoms, she added. \u201cIf you notice any concerning symptoms, seek prompt veterinary care,\u201d Fadl said. Consult with a veterinarian Reach out to a trusted veterinarian for expert guidance catered to your pet\u2019s needs. Vets can also recommend appropriate preventive measures or treatments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/06/08/health/pets-air-quality-wildfire-smoke-safety-wellness-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}

At times, however, those blessings may overflow, according to \u201cB,\u201d a 43-year-old Atlantan who CNN is not identifying for privacy reasons. \u201cI love Champagne bubbles and having Champagne on a patio on Sunday with friends \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0it\u2019s an ideal day,\u201d B said. \u201cBut my friends hang out all the time, and even on a weeknight, it would end up being bottles of wine. I felt like I should have invested in box wine, especially during the pandemic.\u201d Today, B has given up alcohol, turning instead to marijuana gummies when she wants a buzz. The use of weed to replace alcohol is a growing trend in the United States. In fact, a recent study found \u2014 for the first time ever \u2014 the daily use of cannabis of any kind among Americans surpassed the daily use of alcohol. In sheer numbers, of course, many more people still drink alcohol on occasion than use marijuana, which is now legal for recreational use in\u00a024 states and Washington, DC, and for medical use in\u00a038 states\u00a0and DC. Still, nearly 18 million people age 12 and older reported using marijuana daily or near daily in 2022, compared with about 15 million who said they used alcohol with the same frequency, according to the study\u2019s analysis of the most recent data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual government survey. \u2018My heart was racing\u2019 For B, giving up alcohol was a necessity. Her periodic binge drinking with friends was taking a toll. Hangovers and an increasing sense of anxiety on the mornings after affected her work performance and her ability to exercise, an enjoyable part of her life. \u201cI\u2019m really healthy, I eat clean and work out all the time, and I just was not feeling good anymore,\u201d B said. \u201cThen one day I was laying on my couch, and my heart was racing like it was coming out of my chest.\u201d Both alcoholism and heart disease ran in B\u2019s family: \u201cI\u2019ve had relatives that have dropped dead of a heart attack in their driveway.\u201d Simply drinking less wasn\u2019t an option for her. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to moderate in the past, but it\u2019s hard to do that when you\u2019re around people who are drinking,\u201d B said. \u201cSo I decided to quit alcohol completely. My friends were really supportive, and it was easier than I thought it would be.\u201d After a few months of total sobriety, however, B began to experiment with cannabis gummies and found them easy to incorporate with a nonalcoholic drink or two. \u201cI don\u2019t like getting super high,\u201d B said. \u201cI\u2019ll just cut off a fourth of a gummy to take the edge off after a long day at work. If I\u2019m with friends at a party where I know I\u2019ll be there awhile, I might take a half or even a whole one.\u201d Weed or alcohol: Which is better? Is replacing alcohol with weed a healthier option? It depends, experts say. \u201cQuestioning one\u2019s relationship with alcohol is a very healthy trend,\u201d said Carol Boyd, founding director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was not involved in the analysis. \u201cWe know that moderate alcohol consumption has health risks, and risk increases as alcohol consumption increases,\u201d Boyd said in an email. Just one drink a day can raise blood pressure, trigger a dangerous irregular heartbeat or even shrink your brain, studies have found. Those are just a few of the many pitfalls of alcohol use, including the risk of cancer. Binge drinking, defined as consuming four or more drinks in two hours for women (five or more for men) was on the rise during the pandemic. Binging was higher in women, sending twice as many to the emergency room during the pandemic than before. In fact, the alcohol-induced death rate for both sexes jumped 26% between 2019 and 2020, the first year of the pandemic. At first glance, the harms of marijuana appear equally worrisome. By using cannabis before the age of 25, young people can permanently damage their brains, wreaking havoc with their ability to learn, remember, solve problems and pay attention, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Daily marijuana use\u00a0raises the risk of stroke by 42%\u00a0and heart attack by 25%, even if there is no prior history of heart disease and the person has never smoked or vaped tobacco, according to a February 2024 study. Weed has\u00a0also been linked\u00a0to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation; myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle;\u00a0spasms of the heart\u2019s arteries\u00a0and a higher risk of\u00a0heart failure. However, many participants in those cardiovascular studies are smoking or vaping marijuana instead of ingesting it, said Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician and cannabis specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who authored \u201cSeeing\u00a0 Through the Smoke: A Cannabis Specialist Untangles the Truth About Marijuana.\u201d \u201cNo doctor recommends smoking marijuana, unless someone is in acute pain or has cancer and is on chemotherapy, when they might want the faster pain relief that comes from inhaling,\u201d Grinspoon said. Burning anything, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, creates\u00a0toxic compounds that are harmful to health when inhaled, said marijuana reseracher Dr. Beth Cohen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cCannabis smoke contains toxins, carcinogens, and particulate matter that have been linked to cancer, lung damage, and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cWith potential harms for any substance, we would expect to see a dose response. So, I\u2019m particularly concerned about the increases in daily or near daily use of cannabis.\u201d In fact, marijuana smoke may even be more harmful than tobacco because users hold the hot smoke in their lungs longer to maximize their high. A March 2021 study by Boyd found teens twice as likely to report \u201cwheezing or whistling\u201d in the chest after vaping marijuana than after smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes. \u201cNew data is beginning to show\u00a0that secondhand marijuana smoke may be just as dangerous as the primary smoke,\u201d Robert Page II, a\u00a0professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora, told CNN in a prior interview. However, there are many other options than inhaling marijuana smoke, Grinspoon said, including \u201cusing topicals like oils, lotions or a skin patch, or a suppository, or a tincture put under the tongue or in tea, or an edible. You don\u2019t have to smoke the cannabis.\u201d There is a problem, however. Research on edibles, such as baked goods, candies and beverages, and other methods of using cannabis is in its infancy. Whether there are longer-term impacts on human health than ingesting too much at one sitting and getting an uncomfortable high are unknown. \u201cWe do not yet know risks of daily use of edibles \u2014 thus, I cannot say whether the trend will end up as a healthy one,\u201d Boyd said in email. \u201cRegulation is uneven, products vary, and use is still illegal under federal law. We need better data!\u201d \u2018Like the Wild West\u2019 B lives in Georgia, a state where only medical marijuana is allowed. Therefore, B began using hemp-based gummies laced with delta-9, the most abundant form of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the part of the cannabis plant that creates a high. The synthetic form used in edibles is called delta-9 THC-O acetate. With the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which removed the hemp plant from the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s schedule of controlled substances, B can buy numerous brands of hemp gummies nearly everywhere, including her local gas station. \u201cFirst, I want to commend her for giving up alcohol,\u201d said Grinspoon, who is on the board of the advocacy group Doctors for Drug Policy Reform, which addresses cannabis, psychedelic and drug regulation in general. \u201cBut the hemp products she buys at the gas station or liquor store or the like are completely unregulated, sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids like delta-8, delta-9 and delta 10 that are pretty cheap to make. \u201cThat\u2019s really dangerous for a million reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in these new synthetic cannabinoids. You can get all kinds of industrial byproducts, a mixture of all kinds of synthetics, or an extremely high or low dose of the synthetic. It\u2019s like the Wild West out there.\u201d \u201cPotentially harmful chemicals \u201care needed to convert cannabinoids in hemp into synthetic products like delta 8, according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while manufacturing may \u201coccur in uncontrolled or unsanitary settings.\u201d Of the nearly 2,400 calls about delta 8 to the National Poison Center in one year from 2021 to 2022, 70% required a doctor\u2019s care and 8% were admitted, the FDA said. One child died. A June 2018 review of existing literature on synthetic versions of cannabis found they may cause more severe adverse effects, which could include breathing problems, a spike in blood pressure, chest pain and a rapidly beating heart, cognitive impairment. anxiety, agitation, suicidal ideation, and even death. \u201cIn and of itself, it\u2019s not good that more people are using cannabis,\u201d Grinspoon said. However, If they are going to use it to replace alcohol, he added, \u201cpeople should be buying marijuana and hemp cannabis products at a legal, regulated dispensary in a state where the product is tracked from beginning to end and tested along the way.\u201d If a person chooses to buy weed or hemp online or at a smoke shop, be sure to choose a product with a label that shows they have paid an independent outside company to assure the purity of their products, he said. \u201cMy other advice for people who want to use weed is to get educated,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t smoke it. Start at a very low dose and go slow. Don\u2019t use it before driving. And get it from a medical marijuana dispensary or well-regulated legal shop, as that is much safer than these hemp-derived products that are unregulated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_health_cardiovascular-disease-report-2050", "text": "About 61% of US adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, new research from the American Heart Association predicts. The biggest driver of this trend will be the large number of people who have or will develop high blood pressure, which makes them much more likely to develop dangerous problems like a heart attack or stroke. Other cardiovascular problems include heart attacks, arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or a-fib, heart failure and congenital heart disease. Despite innovations in treatments, heart disease has been the leading killer of Americans for decades, responsible for more than 800,000 deaths every year. In the research published Tuesday, the association predicts that 45 million adults will have some form of cardiovascular disease \u2013 excluding high blood pressure \u2013 or will have a stroke in 2050, up from 28 million in 2020. An aging population will be another force behind these trends, as the older you get, the more likely you are to have heart problems. By 2050, 22% of the US will be over the age of 65, whereas seniors made up just 13% of the population 10 years ago, studies say. The median age in the US is projected to increase from 37 in 2010 to 41 in 2050, other research shows. The American population is also becoming more diverse, and communities of color tend to have a disproportionate number of heart problems. By 2050, people who identify as Hispanic will make up about a quarter of the US population, vs. about 20% today, and people who identify as Black will be 14.4% of the country, up from 13.6% today. The number of people who identify as Asian will also increase, from 6.2% of the population to 8.6%, according to US Census predictions. People who identify as Hispanic are projected to have the greatest population growth for cardiovascular disease or stroke, the new research says. Black adults now have the highest number of heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, the association\u2019s research shows. They also are projected to have the most problems with poor diet and an inadequate amount of sleep, both behaviors contribute to heart problems. The biggest overall increase among cardiovascular conditions will be in the number of people who have a stroke, the American Heart Association predicts, jumping from 3.9% to 6.4%. That would nearly double the number of people who have a stroke from 10 million to 20 million adults between 2020 and 2050. In terms of risk factors, growing numbers of people with obesity and/or diabetes will also raise the risk of heart problems. Poor diet, which can hurt heart health, is projected to be the health behavior that will affect the most people. The report suggests that nearly 70 million young adults alone will be eating poorly in 2050. The new research predicts that the number of people with obesity will increase from 43.1% to 60.6%, affecting more than 180 million people by 2050. The number with diabetes will increase from 16.3% to 26.8% and impact more than 80 million in that period, the report said. The report also offers a closer look at the heart health of children. It finds \u201cconcerning trends\u201d in key risk factors, including a predicted increase in the number of kids living with obesity, in large part due to a lack of exercise and poor diet. The report projects that the number of US children with obesity will jump from 20.6% in 2020 to 33% in 2050, meaning 26 million kids will have obesity by that time. There\u2019s one positive heart health note, the researchers said: The number of people with high cholesterol is projected to decline. It\u2019s been falling for years, studies show, due in part to the sharp increase in the number of people who take drugs called statins, which can reduce the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver. A 2023 study found that more than 92 million adults in the US \u2013 more than a third of the population \u2013 took a statin in 2018-19, a 197% increase from 2008-09. \u201cClinical and public health interventions are needed to effectively manage, stem, and even reverse these adverse trends,\u201d the researchers wrote. One significant change they suggest is the creation of clinical and policy interventions specifically to help people of color, who are already disproportionally affected by heart problems and who tend to have less access to basic affordable health care. Prevention efforts to improve population health would also be important, the researchers said, and would save the US a significant amount of money. The costs of cardiovascular problems \u2013 including direct health care costs and productivity losses \u2013 are expected to almost triple to more than $1.8 trillion by 2050.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/cardiovascular-disease-report-2050/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "health"}}
