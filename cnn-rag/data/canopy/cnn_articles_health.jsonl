{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_health_violent-dreams-parkinsons-dementia-wellness", "text": "Donald Dorff could hear the crowd roaring as he snatched the quarterback\u2019s pitch from the air and sprinted toward the goal line. \u201cThere was a 280-pound tackle waiting for me, so I decided to give him my shoulder,\u201d the 67-year-old told National Geographic magazine in 1987. \u201cWhen I came to, I was on the floor in my bedroom,\u201d Dorff said. \u201cI had smashed into the dresser and knocked everything off it and broke the mirror and just made one heck of a mess. It was 1:30 a.m.\u201d How did a dream from a retired grocery manufacturer from Golden Valley, Minnesota, become worthy of a profile in a well-known national magazine? Five years earlier, Dorff had become the first patient diagnosed with an unusual disease called rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, or RBD. There\u2019s more. Dorff\u2019s case also launched researchers on a journey that uncovered one of the earliest signs of two devastating diseases: Parkinson\u2019s and a unique form of dementia called Lewy body. Symptoms include screaming, kicking and throwing punches The discovery of RBD was made in 1982 when Dorff, after years of experiencing \u201cviolent moving nightmares,\u201d became a patient of psychiatrist and sleep specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck,\u00a0then working at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis. \u201cDuring rapid eye movement or REM sleep, the brain basically paralyzes the body so that we cannot act out our dreams,\u201d Schenck, now a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota, told CNN recently. \u201cBut Dorff was able to get up and hurt himself while dreaming, a very odd behavior. We were scratching our heads about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we put him in a sleep lab, and lo and behold, all his physical behaviors came out of REM sleep, which had never been reported before.\u201d More patients with the unusual disorder were identified, many exhibiting a disturbing set of violent symptoms, Schenck said. \u201cThey start kicking in bed, throwing punches at their bed partners, talking or screaming loudly, things like \u2018Get the hell out of here!\u2019 Then the wife has to scream really loudly to stop the episode,\u201d he said. \u201cLimb jerking, twitching, throwing out your arm, throwing punches, kicking, sitting up, standing, jumping out of bed and running. Those behaviors are very typical with RBD,\u201d he added. One 70-year-old patient, described by his wife as having a gentle nature during the day, would punch and kick her as many as five times a night, Schenck said. On one occasion, he tried to strangle his wife while dreaming of fighting off a mauling bear. Another patient, also 70, dreamed he had just taken down a deer and was going to break its neck. In reality it was his wife\u2019s neck, which he discovered when he woke up. (She quit sleeping in the same bed.) By 1986, Schenck and his team had published their first paper on the newly discovered sleep disorder. As he followed patients over the years, however, Schenck discovered something more disturbing \u2014 the behavior could be a \u201ccanary in the mine\u201d for later neurodegeneration. \u201cLosing the paralysis of REM sleep that is the basis of RBD is the earliest and strongest predictor of a later diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy body,\u201d Schenck said. RBD can affect women, too Lewy body dementia can refer to two different types of dementia:\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which both affect cognition. Parkinson\u2019s disease, however, is a slowly progressive disorder that inhibits muscle control, balance and movement \u2014 although about 4 in 5 people with Parkinson\u2019s ultimately develop dementia, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. In both Parkinson\u2019s and the two dementias, cells in and around the stalk-like stem at the bottom of the brain begin to die. In addition to breathing, swallowing, heart rate and eye and facial movements, the brain stem also controls the sleep-wake cycle. Early damage to the brain stem caused by Parkinson\u2019s can interfere with the body\u2019s innate ability to freeze the muscles while dreaming, thus allowing the body to sit up, scream, flail or otherwise act out a dream. Hallucinations, which are common in Parkinson\u2019s, can also occur, according to case studies. A 67-year-old man would see faceless, hooded or cloaked figures or animals while awake during the night. The images vanished when the man turned on a light or got up to investigate. Such nighttime behaviors can often be controlled with medication, including high doses of melatonin or the drug clonazepam, which stops seizures and relaxes tense muscles, Schenck said. \u201cEither one alone or both in combination works 80% to 90% of the time, and there are a long list of alternative treatments,\u201d said Schenck, who first published the connection between RBD and Parkinson\u2019s in February 1996. \u201cWe know the mechanism for RBD very well, and we know how to treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next step is to slow down or halt the progression to Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.\u201d At first, researchers believed RBD only affected men but then realized that women are equally impacted. \u201cJust as many women have this problem, but because it\u2019s much milder and doesn\u2019t cause injury as often, they frequently don\u2019t come in to seek help,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cYet they have lost that muscle paralysis in REM sleep, and they\u2019re just as much at risk for future Parkinson\u2019s disease as the men.\u201d A clinical trial is underway at nine medical centers in the United States, Schenck said. Called the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy Consortium, the research hopes to identify potential treatments for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and slow its progression into Parkinson\u2019s and dementia. Seek medical treatment if violent dreams begin As a child, Donald Dorff shared a room with three brothers and never had any signs of a sleep disorder. On his wedding night, however, he scared his new bride with loud talking, groaning, teeth grinding and minor movements, according to Schenck\u2019s case study. About 41 years later, however, he began to have vivid, violent dreams that he would act out. In one dream, he was riding a motorcycle when another motorcyclist tried to ram him. \u201cI decided I\u2019m going to kick his motorcycle away and at that point my wife woke me up and said, \u2018What in heavens are you doing to me?\u2019 because I was kicking the hell out of her,\u201d Dorff told Schenck during treatment. In another dream Dorff was under attack by a man with a rifle and preparing to shoot back when he suddenly woke up. \u201cI was kneeling alongside the bed with my arms extended like 1 was holding the rifle up and ready to shoot.\u201d One night Dorff dived into a bedside dresser and cut himself, Schenck said. It was then that he found Schenck\u2019s clinic and went there for treatment. While some people with RBD develop full-blown Parkinson\u2019s rather quickly, Dorff was not one of them. He died of prostate cancer, Schenck said, and was able to control his violent nighttime behavior until his death as long as he remained on medication. Dorff\u2019s case helped physicians discover an early key to two devastating disorders, allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never been a sleepwalker or sleep talker throughout your life and suddenly, after the age of 50, you start and the talking becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should be evaluated by your primary care doctor,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cYour doctor should consider neurological evaluation because that could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/health/violent-dreams-parkinsons-dementia-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_health_bird-flu-animals-humans", "text": "Mark Naniot remembers 2022 as the summer from hell. As the co-founder of Wild Instincts animal rescue in Wisconsin\u2019s Northwoods, Naniot and his team spent the season sweating in gloves, gowns, smocks and masks and going through what felt like endless rounds of disinfection as they moved between the cages of the sick and injured animals they cared for. The precautions were necessary for a trio of infectious diseases occurring with some frequency in wild animals that summer: Covid-19 was still making life difficult, and a devastating contagion called chronic wasting disease was showing up in deer in the area. Then, there was H5N1 bird flu to contend with.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s highly, highly transmissible,\u201d said Naniot, who has been involved in animal rescue for 35 years. Since it was first discovered in birds in 1996, H5N1 has shown itself to be a Swiss Army Knife of a virus, evolving the necessary tools to break into the cells of a growing list of species.\u00a0So far, it has infected and killed millions of wild and farmed birds.\u00a0It\u2019s also been found in at least 26 different kinds of mammals, including, most recently in the United States \u2014 cows, cats and house mice. The voraciousness of the virus prompted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization in April to call it \u201ca global zoonotic animal pandemic.\u201d Along the way, people have been a kind of collateral damage. Humans can be infected, but we aren\u2019t really the intended targets. That could all change quickly, however. \u201cInfluenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors don\u2019t always work in favor of the virus.\u00a0Most of the time, viruses with errors won\u2019t work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive.\u00a0But every once in a while, a random error can result in a change to the virus that give it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow. If humans happen to be that environment, and H5N1 changes at the right place at the right time, suddenly the animal pandemic could become a major problem for people, too. Naniot had seen wild birds come into Wild Instincts rescue with H5N1 \u2014 bald eagles, hawks and owls \u2014 but nothing had prepared him for the red fox kits. The baby foxes were brought in stumbling and uncoordinated, making him think they might have gotten into some kind of poison. Then the seizures started. \u201cThey would have these severe, severe seizures,\u201d Naniot said. \u201cScreaming very loud, whole-body tremors.\u201d The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. \u201cAnd then it would get longer and longer and longer,\u201d he said. Naniot hadn\u2019t known his young patients could get bird flu. Further research clued him in to the fact that foxes had recently joined a growing list of species that could succumb, usually after eating the flesh of infected dead birds. \u201cThe severity of the seizures is something I really hadn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Naniot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad thing to see, the progression of the disease.\u201d Risks to humans Though H5N1 is known to have infected nearly 900 people in the past 30 years, these infections have been sporadic and usually self-limiting. The virus can still be deadly, however: More than 50% of people who are known to have been infected with H5N1 have died. Still, the virus isn\u2019t particularly good at infecting humans. Even when virus manages to get into a person and cause symptoms, it rarely gets passed to someone else. \u201cWe call these dead-end infections,\u201d said Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinarian and expert in zoonotic infections, at the University of Guelph in Canada. The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in.\u00a0 But it is not a virus that\u2019s well-adapted to humans, so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions \u2014 the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs \u2014 which would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath. There have been at least three of these have apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who worked closely with infected milk cows.\u00a0Two of the workers developed conjunctivitis, or eye infections.  In one case, the worker reported getting splashed with raw milk in their eyes. A third developed respiratory symptoms after close contact with cows.\u00a0All were successfully treated with an antiviral medication.\u00a0None developed severe symptoms or infected others. Using a strain of H5N1 from the recent cattle outbreak, scientists recently confirmed that this version of the virus is unlikely to transmit through the air. In experiments with ferrets, which are considered the gold standard for studying how viruses transmit in people, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew a sample of the same H5N1 virus taken from a farmworker with the flu in Texas to experimentally infect six of the animals.\u00a0Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals.\u00a0These animals could touch, nose and lick the sick animals, and all of them became ill. Next, the CDC tested airborne transmission by putting three healthy ferrets into an enclosure where they could breathe the same air as sick animals but couldn\u2019t touch them.\u00a0 Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. So far, that seems to be what\u2019s happening in the real world, too.\u00a0 Though more than 80 dairy herds have tested positive across at least 12 states, the number of human infections has apparently been low, though there\u2019s been little testing to confirm that. These early ferret experiments are good news, the CDC noted, because it means the virus would need to change to become an infection spread person-to-person through the airborne droplets. The agency said it plans to repeat the tests. As Covid has shown, all of this could change in the the rub of an eye or a small cough. The more opportunity the virus has to spread, the more opportunity it has to change in ways that will help it pry its way into human cells. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand everything we know today is a snapshot of today, and these viruses can change very quickly,\u201d said Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and former director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the Chasing Life podcast. \u201cThey can adapt, and they can spread very easily when they do change,\u201d said Bright, who is now CEO of Bright Global Health.  Dr. Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says that while humans have been exposed to seasonal strains of the flu, and flu vaccines help build immunity H1 and H3 flu strains, H5N1 would look pretty different to our bodies. \u201cOur existing immunity to H3 and H1 is not necessarily going to protect us against exposure to an H5 virus,\u201d she said. The CDC\u2019s ferret study also had some sobering findings.\u00a0 In contrast to seasonal flu, which makes ferrets sick, but doesn\u2019t kill them, H5N1 killed all the ferrets that were infected. \u201cWhile the three cases of A(H5N1) in the United States have been mild, it is possible that there will be serious illnesses among people,\u201d the CDC wrote in its conclusions on the study. In the more than two dozen human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide since 2022, with the most recent iteration of the virus, there\u2019s been a wide spectrum of severity.\u00a0Fourteen illnesses were severe or critical, seven were fatal, six were mild and eight didn\u2019t have any symptoms at all, according to the CDC. Dr. Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist and immunologist at Emory University who specializes in the flu, thinks the difference in symptom severity may be due to previous exposure to seasonal viruses. Her experiments in ferrets suggest that our bodies wouldn\u2019t necessarily be totally defenseless.\u00a0 In her lab, ferrets with previous exposures to seasonal flu strains didn\u2019t get as sick when exposed to new flu viruses compared to those with no prior exposure to seasonal strains.\u00a0 She says she hasn\u2019t tested this with any of the strains involved in the cattle outbreak, however. So while we probably don\u2019t have any antibodies\u00a0\u2014 the immune system\u2019s front-line soldiers \u2014 at the ready to fight off an H5 infection, there are memory cells in our tissues that might recognize parts of a new flu virus and respond. How much help we might get from past exposures to flu viruses is difficult to predict, however, which is why vaccination would still be important to tune up our immunity. Plans to stop the virus from spreading The US has vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, and last month, government officials said 4.8 million doses are being\u00a0\u201cfilled and finished\u201d so they would be ready for use, though there\u2019s no plan to give them to anyone yet. Finland has already ordered 20,000 doses of a different H5 strain \u2014 H5N8 \u2014 which, will be used as soon as they\u2019re available to protect workers who might be vulnerable to the virus, such as scientists and those in direct contact with infected animals\u00a0on mink farms, local\u00a0officials told\u00a0health and science news outlet,\u00a0STAT News. For now, the CDC maintains its assessment that the risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, though people who work with infected animals have a higher risk and should wear protective clothing and take additional precautions to avoid getting sick. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, has made that protective equipment available to states for use on farms, and the USDA has made additional funding available to farms to support efforts to safeguard their livestock from disease. But so far, wearing this equipment is voluntary, and there are concerns that it might be difficult for farm workers to wear the full recommended kit, which includes coveralls, an apron, a mask, eye protection, a head covering, gloves and boots during the summer, which is again expected to break heat records. The government has also said it is working on the development of a rapid test for H5N1. Bright thinks severity of symptoms may depend on how much virus a person is exposed to when they are infected. Touching contaminated milk or the body of a dead bird and then\u00a0rubbing your eyes or nose might deliver a smaller dose of the virus, and ultimately result in milder symptoms. Whereas ingesting large amount of virus \u2014 as some animals do when they scavenge for food or as humans in some countries do when consuming dishes made with duck blood \u2014 could lead to severe disease. \u201cThe virus is able to infect a number of internal organs. So it doesn\u2019t just locate, say, in the lungs, as we would think most influenza viruses would,\u201d Bright said. It\u2019s also been found in \u201cthe brains and then the spleens, the intestines, and the heart and throughout the body of those animals.\u201d Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the WHO\u2019s Collaborating Centre on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s at the top of the list in terms of bad guy viruses,\u201d he said, noting that the virus is nerve-loving, or neurotropic. \u201cSo it goes to the brain and causes very, very severe disease.\u201d Infected animals often behave strangely or aggressively.\u00a0Ducks waddle in circles, twisting their necks, writhing on the ground. \u201cI would hate to see it in humans,\u201d Webby said. So far, the virus hasn\u2019t made the changes that would enable it to become a fully human pathogen, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear whether it ever will. \u201cI\u2019ve been a student of this virus. And I surely have been amazed at how it\u2019s changed over the course of the last 20-some years, but at the same time, you know, I\u2019m looking for evidence that it is likely to become a virus infecting humans and then transmitted by humans to other humans. And we just haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d he added. Naniot at the Wisconsin animal rescue said they tried to save about seven infected fox kits in the summer of 2022, but all of them died. Other rescue organizations in their network had a few foxes infected with H5N1 that survived, but they ultimately went blind. While all the precautions they took to safely work with the animals were arduous, Naniot said he\u2019s grateful they were effective. They never spread the virus to any of the other animals in the facility \u2014 including themselves. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s kind of like when Covid went through, you know, it first started someplace,\u201d he said. Naniot says he hasn\u2019t encountered any infected animals since 2022, but he\u2019s watching the news closely in case any cow herds become infected in Wisconsin, knowing that he could easily see H5N1 again. \u201cIt spread kind of like wildfire, and it\u2019s a highly, highly contagious disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/bird-flu-animals-humans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

Mosquitoes and ticks can transmit vector-borne illnesses, and they are showing up with greater frequency. What can people do to protect themselves while still enjoying all that the summer months have to offer? And what treatments are available if you or your loved ones get bit? To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0Let\u2019s start by talking about tick-borne diseases, specifically Lyme disease. What is Lyme, and why is this something people should pay attention to? Dr.\u00a0Leana Wen:\u00a0In the United States,\u00a0Lyme disease is the\u00a0most common vector-borne disease\u00a0and is transmitted by ticks. People who contract Lyme disease may experience temporary symptoms similar to the flu, such as muscle aches, fever and headache. They also may develop a rash and have joint pain. The concern with Lyme is that some untreated patients progress to having long-term symptoms. These can be severe and debilitating and include ongoing nerve pain, facial paralysis and abnormal heart function. CNN: When is peak season for Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0We are in peak season now. In areas where the disease is prevalent such as the eastern United States, people can be bitten by blacklegged ticks that carry Lyme disease from spring into fall, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, there were reports that Lyme diagnoses\u00a0peaked\u00a0just before the Fourth of July holiday. CNN: Has the incidence of Lyme disease increased in recent years? Wen:\u00a0Yes. The rates of Lyme diagnoses have\u00a0doubled\u00a0from 2004 to 2018, with an increase in geographic prevalence, meaning that more areas have a high incidence of this disease compared to before.\u00a0(Newer data show an even more dramatic increase, though\u00a0surveillance methodology\u00a0has improved to capture more diagnoses.)\u00a0There are a variety of theories as to why this is the case. Most are centered on the influence of climate change \u2014 for example, that warmer temperatures expanded the tick habitat and perhaps also sped up tick life cycles. This is the same with other vector-borne diseases, like those carried by mosquitoes, which are also on the rise\u00a0likely due to rising temperatures. CNN: What can people do to reduce their odds of contracting Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0The most important step is to prevent tick bites. If you are in an area known to have Lyme, you should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when hiking. Use insect repellent that contains the ingredient DEET. After the activity, examine carefully for ticks. If you have young children and pets, take the time to examine them as well. If you find a tick, remove it, save it for identification purposes in a small jar and contact your primary care provider.\u00a0Early antibiotic therapy\u00a0can prevent you from developing Lyme disease. Also, if you end up developing symptoms, get tested right away. Antibiotic treatment can reduce the progression to chronic symptoms. CNN:\u00a0What about mosquitoes? What diseases can they carry? Wen:\u00a0Mosquitoes can transmit a lot of diseases to humans including the West Nile virus,\u00a0dengue\u00a0and malaria. West Nile\u00a0is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. While most people with the illness do not become ill, around 1 in 150 infected people develop a serious illness that can be fatal. In 2023,\u00a047 states\u00a0reported West Nile cases. In total, there were 2,406 reported instances in the US. Dengue is another virus transmitted by mosquitoes. Outbreaks are common globally, and occasionally there are cases reported in the US. Most of these cases\u00a0occur in travelers, but the types of mosquitoes that can spread dengue are found throughout many parts of the US. That means local transmission is possible. In recent years, transmission of dengue by people who have no travel history has happened in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. Another infection transmitted by mosquito that is far more common in other parts of the world is malaria. If untreated, symptoms can become severe and\u00a0progress\u00a0to kidney failure, seizures, coma and death. While most US cases involve travelers who contracted malaria from other parts of the world, locally transmitted cases have occurred, too. Last year, there were such cases reported in Florida, Texas and Maryland. CNN: You\u2019ve mentioned the US cases of malaria. What should people do who are traveling to other countries known to have these and other mosquito-borne illnesses? Wen:\u00a0I advise that people consult the\u00a0CDC\u2019s comprehensive guide, which includes recommendations for each destination country, and make an appointment with your primary care physician or travel medical clinic. Depending on where you are going, your planned activities and your personal medical history, you may be recommended to have additional vaccines or prophylactic medications. For instance, if you are going somewhere with a concern for yellow fever, you may need to get that vaccine. If you are traveling to areas with high rates of malaria, you may be recommended to start antimalarial medicines. CNN: What can everyone do to reduce their chance of getting bitten by mosquitoes? Wen:\u00a0Everyone should keep two key steps in mind. The first is to reduce bites. You can do this by covering arms and legs with clothes when possible. Clothing treated with the insecticide permethrin can provide an added layer of protection. You can also use insect repellent. Make sure to\u00a0use repellents\u00a0that are registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency. These will contain active ingredients like DEET and are safe, even for children and pregnant women. The second key step is source control \u2014 meaning to reduce the mosquitoes near you. During peak mosquito season, in the summer and early fall, use screens on windows and doors to reduce the mosquitoes in your home. In addition, it\u2019s crucial to look for standing water in your garden, as these are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Check for items around your home that could hold water \u2014 such as buckets, trash containers, tires and toys\u2014 and empty and wash them at least once a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Two teams of scientists have discovered a theoretically habitable planet, smaller than Earth but bigger than Venus, orbiting a small star about 40 light-years away. The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said. But though the exoplanet could potentially be habitable for humans and is relatively \u201cnear\u201d our solar system in astronomical terms, it is unlikely that anyone will visit there soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not reachable, it\u2019s 12 parsecs away,\u201d said Palethorpe, adding that it would take about 225,000 years to reach Gliese 12b with the fastest spacecraft that currently exist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_health_heat-stroke-sun-exhaustion-health-xpn-wellness", "text": "It\u2019s only June, and Americans across parts of the US South and West have already experienced record heat waves. Extreme heat weather events are expected to affect more than 60 million people across the US this summer. This comes as last summer was officially deemed the hottest recorded. The rate of emergency department visits related to extreme heat increased significantly in 2023 compared to the previous five years, with nearly 120,000 visits due to heat-related issues, according to a recent study published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Reports. With summer temperatures on the rise, what should people know about the dangerous condition of heat stroke? What are the symptoms, and how can others recognize if someone needs help? What are other types of illnesses associated with extreme heat? Especially those most susceptible to the ill effects of high temperatures? To find out how to handle the heat, I spoke with CNN wellness analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What should people know about heat stroke? What is it, and what are its symptoms? Dr. Leana Wen: Heat stroke is a medical emergency. It must be treated immediately because it can quickly become fatal. The body normally has the capacity to control and regulate its temperature. Heat stroke occurs when this mechanism is overwhelmed. The body\u2019s temperature rises rapidly, and the person can\u2019t cool down. Your internal temperature can rise rapidly to 106 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in 10 to 15 minutes. If that happens, a person may become confused and dizzy, and feel faint. They could have slurred speech and lose consciousness. They may even start to have seizures and abnormal heart rates. If someone around you is having these symptoms, they need to go to the hospital right away. Bystanders should not hesitate to call 911. CNN: Is there anything else bystanders can do to help that person while help is on the way? Wen: Move the person into a shaded, cool area. Place cold, wet cloths or ice packs on the neck, armpits and groin, and soak clothing with cold water. Make sure to stay with that person until emergency service workers arrive. CNN: Are there less severe forms of heat-related illnesses? Wen: Yes. Before someone reaches the point of having heat stroke, they may have heat exhaustion. Symptoms include nausea, tiredness, dizziness, headache, heavy sweating and cool, clammy skin. It\u2019s crucial to move to a cool place right away. Loosen your clothes and take a cool bath if possible; if not, put wet cloths on your body. Watch for worsening symptoms, such as feeling faint and throwing up, and seek help if these occur or if you are no better in an hour. People engaging in physical activity also may have heat cramps, where they have painful muscle spasms in hot weather. They should stop exercising and drink water or an electrolyte solution. CNN: Are there other types of illnesses associated with extreme heat? Wen: Yes. There are actually two major effects of extreme heat. The first is what we\u2019ve spoken about, which is the high temperatures directly impacting the body and causing it to overheat. The second is caused by high temperatures exacerbating an underlying medical condition. Extreme heat puts strain on organs, including the heart, lungs and kidneys. Researchers estimate that the interaction between heat and cardiovascular disease was either a direct or contributory cause of 1 in 4 heat-related deaths. And heat extremes can worsen health risks from chronic conditions, including diabetes and some mental health diagnoses. CNN: Who are the most susceptible to ill effects of high temperatures? Wen: Extreme heat can affect everyone, but there are three groups of people who are the most susceptible to its ill effects. The first are the very young and the elderly. Both groups have less physiological reserve and may have more problems regulating their body temperatures. Young children also may not be able to report how they are feeling. Both groups are also at higher risk of dehydration. The second group includes those people with chronic medical conditions. Certain medications may interfere with the body\u2019s ability to adapt to changes in temperature. Extreme heat puts pressure on organ systems, thereby exacerbating underlying conditions. The third category encompasses those people who have occupational exposure or socioeconomic constraints that increase their exposure to heat. This category includes people who must work outdoors and those experiencing homelessness or otherwise do not have access to cool spaces in their residence. CNN: What steps should people in these vulnerable groups take if high temperatures are forecasted? Wen: Everyone should take additional precautions when heat advisories are issued. Even before temperatures reach the point of triggering these advisories, those who are elderly, very young and who have underlying medical conditions should try to limit their time outdoors during the hottest times of day. Try to exercise early in the mornings or in evenings. If you have to be out during the day, find shade when possible. Make sure to stay hydrated. Those around vulnerable individuals can help them to stay safe by monitoring the amount of time they are spending outdoors when it\u2019s hot outside and watching for any concerning symptoms. And never, ever leave children, older adults or pets unattended in a car; the temperature inside the car heats up extremely rapidly and can be fatal. People who have jobs where they must work outdoors should use caution. They should keep well-hydrated, use good sun protection, try to seek shade and cool off in air-conditioned spaces when they are not working if possible. Those experiencing homelessness or who otherwise do not have access to air-conditioned spaces should seek out local resources such as cooling centers and temporary shelters during heat waves. Extreme weather events are a time when we all need to watch out for people around us. Keep a close eye on children and be sure to check up on elderly neighbors and others in our communities who may need assistance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/heat-stroke-sun-exhaustion-health-xpn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_juul-vaping-products-fda", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday it had rescinded marketing denial orders\u00a0for vaping products from Juul Labs Inc., although it has not yet decided whether the products will ultimately stay on the market. Juul said Thursday its products will remain on the market during scientific review. On Thursday, the FDA said court decisions since then \u201cestablish new case law and inform the FDA\u2019s approach to product review to maintain the agency\u2019s commitment to issuing final decisions that are appropriate on both the scientific merits and the law.\u201d In 2022, the FDA\u00a0issued a marketing ban on Juul products, including devices and tobacco and menthol-flavored pods. The marketing denial order was stayed weeks later as \u201cscientific issues warranted additional review,\u201d but had not been rescinded. Juul appealed the decision and the products stayed on store shelves pending the appeal. Recission of the marketing ban \u201cis not an authorization or a denial and does not indicate whether the applications are likely to be authorized or denied,\u201d the FDA said Thursday. \u201cThe agency\u2019s continued review does not alter the fact that all e-cigarette products, including those made by JUUL, are required by law to have FDA authorization to be legally marketed.\u201d As of the end of May, the FDA says it has only authorized 23 e-cigarette products and devices after the products have undergone what the FDA says is \u201crigorous scientific review\u201d that includes toxicologic assessments. To get the green light, the products must also be appropriate by the FDA\u2019s product standard. In a statement, Juul said it\u00a0looks forward to \u201cre-engaging with the agency on a science- and evidence-based process to pursue a marketing authorization for JUUL products.\u201d The American Lung Association said on Thursday that it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the FDA\u2019s decision. \u201cThe Lung Association is deeply troubled that the marketing denial orders for Juul have been rescinded and urge FDA to issue marketing denial orders for all of its products. Juul is largely responsible for the youth e-cigarette epidemic from 2017-2019. These products and its manufacturer clearly do not meet the standard for protecting the public health. FDA must\u00a0follow the law and not permit any Juul product or other tobacco product to be sold in the U.S. prior to it receiving a premarket authorization,\u201d said Erika Sward, the association\u2019s assistant vice president of nationwide advocacy, in a statement. Juul has remained one of the most popular e-cigarette products on the market and are also among the most popular with young people. For the past decade, the FDA and US Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s annual National Youth Tobacco Survey has found that in general e-cigarettes are the most popular tobacco products among young people. In a statement, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids cited the popularity of the brand and said, \u201cthe FDA\u2019s continuing delays in reviewing Juul\u2019s marketing applications are unacceptable and harmful to America\u2019s kids.\u201d \u201cThe FDA should swiftly finish its review and again deny marketing applications for all Juul products given Juul\u2019s primary role in causing the youth e-cigarette epidemic and the continuing popularity of Juul\u2019s products among youth,\u201d Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids CEO and president Yolonda Richardson said in part in the statement. \u201cThere is no question that Juul fueled this epidemic by introducing a sleek, easy-to-hide product that was sold in appealing flavors including menthol, marketed in ways that appeal to kids, and delivered massive doses of nicotine that can quickly addict kids. Juul\u2019s history shows that its products are highly appealing to kids, and it cannot be trusted to act responsibly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/juul-vaping-products-fda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_world_nasa-prefire-mission-launch-scn", "text": "NASA has launched the first of two research satellites to measure how much heat is lost to space from the Arctic and Antarctica. The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other. Doing so should allow the satellites to collect data about phenomena that take place on a short time scale and require frequent measurements \u2014 such as how the amount of cloud cover affects the temperature on Earth beneath it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/world/nasa-prefire-mission-launch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_health_anxiety-positive-energy-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014  Tossing and turning in the wee hours. A low but constant buzzing in the brain that thwarts concentration. A feeling of tense restlessness. Most have experienced this sort of anxiety \u2014 not clinical anxiety, which might result in a full-on panic attack, but the run-of-the-mill kind that leaves you feeling uncomfortable. \u201cAnxiety is this simple definition: that feeling of fear or worry that comes in situations of uncertainty,\u201d neuroscientist Dr. Wendy Suzuki\u00a0recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life. \u201cThat\u2019s my simplistic definition of everyday anxiety.\u201d That experience is not pleasant. \u201cThe general feeling is, \u2018I just want to get rid of it,\u2019\u201d said Suzuki, a professor of neural science and psychology at New York University as well as dean of the school\u2019s College of Arts and Science. She is also the author of \u201cGood Anxiety: Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion.\u201d \u201cThe misunderstanding is that it is valuable,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning system that we all need. It is a tool that helps us figure out what we hold dear. If we don\u2019t have that, I think something important will be taken away from our lives.\u201d You can listen more on how anxiety can be good here. Suzuki explained how anxiety evolved to protect us. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that in this day and age,\u201d she said. But 2.5 million years ago, \u201can ancestor with a little baby (was) walking around trying to find food, and there\u2019s a crack of a twig and that could either be \u2026 a big animal coming to eat her or it could be the crack of a twig.\u00a0She better be ready, or we\u2019re not going to have any ancestors after her.\u201d The crack of the twig left her anxious but alert to danger. \u201cAnd then her body is (in) the fight-or-flight response,\u201d she said. \u201cThat same response, including all of the fight-or-flight (reaction), gets activated when we look at the news, when we look at social media, at what\u2019s going on today,\u201d she said. \u201cOur heart rates are going up, our respiration rates are going off \u2014 that is not good physiologically for us. And so \u2026\u00a0that is your No. 1 reason to learn how to modulate that stress response.\u201d The first step toward getting to \u201cgood\u201d anxiety, Suzuki said, is learning how to lower your level of everyday anxiety. So, what can you do to ratchet it down? Here are Suzuki\u2019s top five tips: Take a deep breath Practice breath meditation. \u201cBreath meditation is the oldest form of meditation and can be so effective in really calming ourselves down \u2014 and immediately,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cThat\u2019s my No. 1 go-to for people who say, \u2018I just need something right now.\u2019\u201d One calming pattern is box breathing. To do it, inhale deeply for four counts, hold for four counts, exhale for four counts and hold again for four counts. \u201cRepeat to calm your mind and body,\u201d she said. Get moving Go for a short walk, Suzuki recommended. \u201cDid you know that just 10 minutes of walking can significantly reduce anxiety and depression levels in people? You don\u2019t even have to change your clothes to get that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat that\u2019s doing is stimulating the release of neurotransmitters that don\u2019t necessarily decrease your anxiety, but they increase your feelings of reward and happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cThose neurotransmitters that go up include dopamine and serotonin and noradrenaline and endorphins.\u00a0Every single time you move your body, it\u2019s like giving your brain a wonderful bubble bath of neurochemicals, and it works immediately.\u201d Reframe your anxiety Turn anxiety-inducing situations into personal challenges to foster growth and resilience \u2014 and enjoy the newness of uncertain circumstances. Paraphrasing Deepak Chopra, Suzuki recommended embracing uncertainty because it can make life interesting to live. \u201cIn my life, the uncertainty can be something that brings excitement, can bring joy. Not all the time, but maybe you can take part of that and embrace it as something useful,\u201d she said. For example, she said, \u201cIf the same thing happened every single time I went on vacation, that would not be a fun vacation. I like the newness; I like learning new things and being exposed to new things. And I can\u2019t control that by definition.\u201d Spin straw into gold Turn your worry into action. To enhance productivity and reduce worry, transform your anxious what-if list into a productive to-do list, Suzuki advised. \u201cI like to say that there are gifts that come with your anxiety,\u201d she said, citing what often happens to her right before she goes to sleep. \u201cI have this worry list that hits me right before I\u2019m going to go to sleep. And so what do I do? I turn that what-if list into a to-do list,\u201d she said. \u201cI just say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to remember these things, so Wendy, you can go to sleep now.\u2019 But the next morning I go and take all those things that made me not sleep the night before, and I go do something about them. \u2026 In that way, I make myself more productive. And I use my anxiety as the tool that it\u2019s supposed to (be).\u201d Practice compassion Support others, Suzuki said, letting them know they are not alone. \u201cReach out with a kind word to someone experiencing similar anxiety,\u201d she said, noting that some people feel shame about being anxious over a certain situation. \u201cThis simple act can release dopamine and improve your own mood.\u201d We hope these five tips help you turn your anxiety into something more productive. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week on the Chasing Life podcast when we delve into therapy and learn what it can and can\u2019t do to increase your happiness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/health/anxiety-positive-energy-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "health_abortion-pill-safety-dg", "text": "The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone \u2014 the first drug in the medication abortion process \u2014 is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That\u2019s a death rate of 0.0005%. Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin \u2014 a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia \u2014 is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra \u2014 used to treat erectile dysfunction \u2014 is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA. \u201c[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIts safety is very well established.\u201d Weighing medication abortion against the alternatives Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion. \u201cIt reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,\u201d she said. It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications \u2014 like hemorrhages or infections \u2014 for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a\u00a02015 study\u00a0conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications. The likelihood of\u00a0serious complications via procedural abortion\u00a0\u2014 performed second-trimester or later \u2014 is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And\u00a0childbirth\u00a0by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%. Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said. In a\u00a0study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol. Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen. \u201cIt\u2019s clear people can use these medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, at home even without the help of a medical professional very safely,\u201d said Aiken. Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it\u2019s readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN in April. However, a lesser-effective method means more people will likely have unsuccessful abortions. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that it might not work for some people, and it will prolong their abortions,\u201d said Upadhyay. \u201cThen by the time they get back to the clinic, they\u2019re seeking abortion later in pregnancy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/health/abortion-pill-safety-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_fda-committee-recommends-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-donanemab", "text": "On Monday, a panel of independent advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted to endorse Eli Lilly\u2019s drug donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease, agreeing that it was safe and effective. One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, killing more people than prostate and breast cancer combined. Donanemab works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildups in the brain  that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These plaques are harmful deposits that can form in the brain as people age. Removing the plaque seems to slow down the brain changes that seem to happen with Alzheimer\u2019s. As the drug enters the brain it binds to the amyloid plaques and its presence catches the attention of the immune system that facilitates the plaque removal. There is no cure and there is still no drug to prevent the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, but donanemab and Leqembi, another drug that is already on the market made by Eisai and Biogen, has been shown to slow the progression of the disease in its early stages. Lilly told the FDA\u2019s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee that its data from late-stage clinical research showed \u201chighly meaningful results\u201d for patients who took donanemab, with a 37% lower risk of progression of the disease over a year and a half compared to patients who got the placebo. Serious adverse events were \u201cgenerally comparable\u201d among all the groups in the trials, and were infrequent, Lilly told the committee, occurring in only 2% of patients. The patients on donanemab had a slightly higher mortality rate \u2014 2%, compared with 1.7% in the placebo arm of the trial. Three people died while taking the drug after developing ARIA, or micro-hemorrhages known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. In trials of Leqembi, the drug that\u2019s already on the market, some patients experienced ARIA, but it was at a lower rate than seen in the donanemab trial. Leqembi has also been tied to patient deaths. Since most donanemab patients who experienced problems with ARIA did so in the first six weeks of the trial, Lilly told the committee that it added another MRI to the trial to look for the problem before giving the patient a second infusion. The aim would be to detect patients with asymptomatic ARIA. If it was detected, providers would pause treatment so it could resolve and not become more serious or symptomatic. Looking at these results from the late-stage clinical trials, the FDA committee voted on\u00a0two specific questions and discussed three other main topics. The committee voted an unanimous \u201cyes\u201d to the questions of whether the data showed that the drug is effective for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and whether the benefits of the drug outweighed the risks in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s in the population enrolled in the clinical trials. The FDA will take the committee\u2019s advice into consideration as it decides whether to greenlight the drug. Committee member\u00a0Dr. Dean Follmann, assistant director for Biostatistics at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he voted yes because the evidence \u201cwas strong and consistent across subgroups.\u201d In voting yes, Sarah Dolan, the acting consumer representative on the committee and a consultant with the Critical Path Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said she was pleased with the outcome of\u00a0the research. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge unmet medical need here that hopefully can be addressed,\u201d Dolan said. Committee member Dr. Kathleen Poston, the director of Stanford Movement Disorders Center, said she voted yes believing there was a benefit to the drug, \u201cas long as the risks are being monitored.\u201d The trials only included patients that had low-medium levels of tau, a protein that can become abnormal and contribute to the disease. Lilly excluded patients that had no or very low tau because the study wouldn\u2019t follow the patients long enough to see if the drug made a difference. They also excluded people with high amounts of tau. The committee had some concern about extrapolating the results to a subset of patients with other levels of tau; they wanted to see more data. The majority of the committee also wasn\u2019t comfortable with the FDA requiring a tau PET test to determine if a patient was eligible to take the drug\u00a0since the test is not widely available and would make it difficult for some people to get the drug. The\u00a0FDA also asked the committee to consider additional factors about ongoing research and factors related to the possible administration of the drug. Lilly suggests patients may be able to stop the drug if they show enough progress on it. The committee suggested research would have to show what would be the appropriate criteria to stop or restart the drug if symptoms came back. The committee also noted that there was little diversity in the trial, most participants were White, and said future research will need to include more people of color to understand how the drug works in diverse populations. The committee also noted that if the drug is approved, doctors will have to educate their patients about the benefit versus the risk of taking this medication. Initially, when the FDA said that it was going to hold this meeting, it came as a\u00a0surprise announcement\u00a0since many experts had thought the drug would have been approved by the FDA\u00a0last year. Before the votes, Dr. Reisa Sperling, a professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School told the committee that without treatments, the growing number of people with Alzheimer\u2019s could become a serious threat to the country. \u201cWe\u2019re doing such a good job at keeping people alive longer, we are creating a public health emergency if we don\u2019t find a way to stave off this disease,\u201d Sperling said. In the meantime, Lilly said it is working on additional Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cRecognizing the enormous burden this disease carries, we take the responsibility of bringing a well characterized disease modifying therapy to patients very seriously,\u201d Dr. David Hyman, chief medical officer with Eli Lilly and Company told the committee. Lilly views donanemab as \u201can important but ultimately incremental\u201d step in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Ultimately, Hyman said Lilly would like to develop a drug that would treat the disease before someone even starts to show symptoms and are working on such a drug. \u201cPatients deserve more, and we continue to work on additional approaches to address this disease,\u201d Hyman said. After the meeting, Lilly said it was happy with the committee\u2019s positive vote. \u201cWe are pleased with the committee\u2019s unanimous recognition of donanemab\u2019s positive benefit-risk profile,\u201d said Mark Mintun, Eli Lilly\u2019s group vice president of neuroscience research and development in a news release. \u201cWe look forward to bringing this treatment option to patients.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Association had urged the committee to recommend approval of donanemab, welcomed the committee\u2019s unanimous vote in favor of the drug. \u201cA future with more approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatments is a tremendous advancement for people eligible for these drugs,\u201d said Dr. Joanne Pike, Alzheimer\u2019s Association President and CEO. \u201cProgress with treatment is happening.\u201d USAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s, a national nonprofit, that testified in favor of the drug during the public comment period in the meeting said that there is an urgency and a \u201cmassive unmet need\u201d for Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. \u201cIf approved by the FDA, donanemab would be the second drug on the market to help people in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s live a better quality of life for a longer period of time, while providing patients and their doctors with another option for their treatment plans,\u201d said chair and co-founder George Vradenburg. \u201cWe are grateful to the advisory committee for its endorsement of this promising treatment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/fda-committee-recommends-eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-donanemab/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_health_planetary-diet-longevity-study-wellness", "text": "Closely following a planet-friendly diet of mostly fruits, vegetables and whole grains reduces the risk of premature death by nearly one-third in people, while also dramatically cutting the release of greenhouse gases devastating the planet, a new study found. \u201cEating more whole plant foods, less animal foods, and less highly processed foods is better for people and planet alike,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who was not involved in the study. \u201cIn this paper, we see that same message amplified: adhering to a dietary pattern conducive to the health of the planet and sustainability is associated with meaningful reductions in all-cause mortality,\u201d he said in an email. Katz is the founder of\u00a0the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine Food production plays a major role in the climate crisis. Raising livestock for human consumption, for example, uses an enormous amount of agricultural land and contributes to deforestation, biodiversity loss and water pollution, experts say. Animals that chew their cud can emit noxious gases with an astounding impact on the environment. Burps and poo\u00a0from cattle, sheep and goats generate methane, a greenhouse gas\u00a080 times more powerful than carbon dioxide\u00a0in warming the planet in the span of 20 years, according to the UN Environment Programme. One adult cow, for example, can belch or fart up to 500 liters of methane a day. Add them up, and they can generate nearly 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, experts say. Eating a planet-healthy diet, however, cut land use by 51%, greenhouse gas emissions by 29% and fertilizer use by 21%, while also extending the lives of people, according to the study. \u201cChanging how we eat can help slow climate change, and fortunately what\u2019s healthiest for the planet is also best for us,\u201d said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. \u201cFor every major cause of death we looked at, there was a lower risk in people with better adherence to the planetary health diet,\u201d Willett said. A diet for people and the planet In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission, composed of 37 leading scientists from 16 countries, created a diet with dual goals \u2014 maximizing human health while reducing the environmental impact of feeding billions of people. The resulting meal plan stressed a higher consumption of a rainbow of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes and other plant-based proteins while reducing meat and dairy to small portions. The study, published Monday in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, analyzed dietary data gathered from more than 200,000 women and men to see how it matched up against the Eat-Lancet dietary guidelines. All the people were enrolled in long-term government studies \u2014 the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study \u2014 and had no major diseases when the research began. Every four years for 34 years, study participants filled out dietary questionnaires, providing researchers with an enormous amount of data. Researchers then scored the diets based on the intake of 15 food groups. Foods that are good for the planet take fewer overall resources to grow and include whole grains, tubers, vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, soybean foods and unsaturated plant oils, such as olive oil. Foods that require a large use of land, such as cattle, and to a lesser extent sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, were also measured, as was intake of added sugar, which has many known health risks. While other studies have looked at the impact of the planetary health diet, none has matched the scope of this study, Willett said. \u201cThis is a substantially larger and much longer study which has repeated assessments of diet over more than three decades, which allows more statistical precision,\u201d he said. The top 10% of people who followed the Eat-Lancet planetary diet were 30% less likely to die prematurely from any cause than those in the bottom 10%, the study found. In addition, those who most closely followed the planetary diet had a 28% lower risk of neurodegenerative mortality, a 14% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, a 10% lower risk of dying from cancer and a 47% lower risk of dying from a respiratory disease, which applied to nonsmokers as well, Willett said. \u201cThe findings show just how linked human and planetary health are. Eating healthfully boosts environmental sustainability \u2014 which in turn is essential for the health and well-being of every person on Earth,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/planetary-diet-longevity-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_supreme-court-rejects-challenge-abortion-pill-mifepristone", "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. The ruling is a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement in what was the first major Supreme Court case on reproductive rights since the court\u2019s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a unanimous court. The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Though technical, the court\u2019s reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. \u201cWe recognize that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to others using mifepristone and obtaining abortions,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cBut citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities \u2013 at least without the plaintiffs demonstrating how they would be injured by the government\u2019s alleged under-regulation of others.\u201d The challenge to the drug had been vehemently opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, which warned that a ruling that second-guessed the regulations for mifepristone could open the door to legal challenges targeting all sorts of medications. Under the Constitution, Kavanaugh wrote, \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue.\u201d \u201cCitizens and doctors who object to what the law allows others to do may always take their concerns to the Executive and Legislative Branches and seek greater regulatory or legislative restrictions on certain activities,\u201d he wrote. Much of Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion covered the various legal thresholds a plaintiff must reach to make it appropriate for courts to intervene in a dispute. Turning to the anti-abortion doctors and medical groups that sued the federal government over the current regulatory regime for the drug, Kavanaugh wrote that the plaintiffs suffered neither the monetary nor the physical injuries that could have established standing. He noted that federal law already protects individual health care providers who have objections to performing abortions for moral reasons. \u201cIn short, given the broad and comprehensive conscience protections guaranteed by federal law, the plaintiffs have not shown \u2013 and cannot show \u2013 that FDA\u2019s actions will cause them to suffer any conscience injury,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence to bring up other issues he had with the anti-abortion groups\u2019 standing claims. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that the Justice Department was \u201cgratified\u201d that the ruling \u201censures that mifepristone remains available for women across the country on the terms approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d  Danco, a mifepristone manufacturer that had intervened to also defend access to the drug, said it was \u201cpleased with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this incredibly important case.\u201d The ruling, Danco spokesperson Abigail Long said, \u201cmaintained the stability of the FDA drug approval process, which is based on the agency\u2019s expertise and on which patients, healthcare providers and the US pharmaceutical industry rely.\u201d \u201cThe decision also safeguards access to a drug that has decades of safe and effective use,\u201d Long said in the statement. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that brought the lawsuit on behalf of the anti-abortion doctors, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u00a0that the Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the FDA\u2019s lawless removal of commonsense safety standards for abortion drug,\u201d while alluding to the fact that the legal fight over the rules could continue with other plaintiffs. Ingrid Skop, an anti-abortion OB-GYN and member of one of the medical groups suing the FDA, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointing that the FDA was not held accountable today for its reckless decisions.\u201d Originated in Texas with Trump-appointed judge At the outset of the case, the anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations who challenged the FDA rules sought to pull mifepristone off the market entirely, arguing it was unsafe \u2013 a claim that has been refuted by mainstream medical organizations. That effort came against a backdrop of conservative state laws that severely limited abortion in much of the country. As those bans helped propel the demand for medication abortion,\u00a0mifepristone became a logical target for the anti-abortion movement. Medication abortions account for nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US, according to some estimates. A\u00a0federal\u00a0judge in Texas nominated by former President Donald Trump, Matthew Kacsmaryk, sided with the anti-abortion groups, but his ruling never went into effect. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed part of that ruling, holding the drug\u2019s two-decade-old underlying approval would stand. But the appeals court sided with the doctors who challenged subsequent decisions by the agency that expanded access to the drug, including the ability to dispense it through the mail. None of those lower court rulings went into effect because the Supreme Court intervened last year and ordered that the status quo around mifepristone remain in place until the justices reviewed the case. The Supreme Court heard arguments in March. In the meantime, a group of GOP-led states intervened in the case at the trial judge-level, signaling that the legal fight over abortion pill access could continue even as the Supreme Court has rejected the lawsuit brought by the anti-abortion doctors. Steve\u00a0Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said that Thursday\u2019s ruling \u201cdoesn\u2019t cut off the possibility of future challenges to mifepristone,\u201d as he pointed to the efforts by those Republican states. \u201cBut the reasoning of the case should make those challenges less likely to succeed, because those plaintiffs (and others) will have a hard time showing that they were harmed by the FDA\u2019s actions,\u201d Vladeck said. The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 as part of a two-drug regimen to end a pregnancy. Over the course of two decades, the agency loosened restrictions it initially placed on the drug\u2019s use. In 2016, it allowed women to take the drug later into a pregnancy, to 10 from seven weeks\u00a0of\u00a0gestational age. It also permitted non-physicians, such as nurse practitioners, to prescribe it. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA announced it would no longer enforce the in-person dispensing requirement. Last year, after the doctors\u2019 lawsuit was filed, the FDA formalized that decision, allowing the drug to be dispensed through the mail. Both the FDA and several medical groups, including the American Medical Association, told the Supreme Court that mifepristone is safe. But the doctors, many of whom\u00a0have long been associated with\u00a0the anti-abortion movement, claimed that they faced the risk of being forced to treat patients dealing with complications from the drug, such as heavier-than-expected bleeding. They claimed that triaging those women had a substantial impact on their practices. And some said they had been called on to perform post-medication abortion procedures they said violated their beliefs. At the Supreme Court hearing earlier this year, several justices\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including members of the conservative\u00a0bloc\u00a0\u2013\u00a0expressed doubt that the doctors had overcome a procedural threshold known as standing, which requires plaintiffs\u00a0to\u00a0show that they had been harmed by the government\u2019s actions. None of the doctors who submitted declarations to a lower court actually prescribe mifepristone and none pointed to an instance when they\u00a0were\u00a0personally required to complete an abortion for a patient who had complications after taking the drug. The lead medical group in the suit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, was incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, months before it filed the lawsuit \u2013 allowing it to choose a court where it was guaranteed to be assigned to Kacsmaryk, who was appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration, along with a mifepristone manufacturer that intervened to defend the FDA, argued that since the anti-abortion doctors were not prescribing the drug, it wasn\u2019t appropriate for them to challenge the regulations. The decision landed in the middle of a presidential election that has already been heavily swayed by the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence. The 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ended the constitutional right to abortion that Roe established in 1973. The decision prompted conservative states to enact strict\u00a0limits\u00a0on the procedure, which prompted additional litigation and helped rally Democrats. President Joe Biden has repeatedly blasted the decision on the campaign trail this year. The mifepristone appeal was one of two abortion cases the high court was considering this month. The other deals with a strict ban on the procedure in Idaho. The Biden administration sued the state over that prohibition, arguing that a federal law requires hospitals that receive Medicare funding to provide stabilizing care in emergency rooms, including abortions, when the health of the pregnant woman is at stake.

{"id": "2024_06_07_health_earwax-eye-discharge-wellness-partner", "text": "Dry scalp? Blocked ears? Crusted eyes? Our bodies produce many different unusual, sometimes repellent secretions, and their function doesn\u2019t always seem entirely clear. But each has their own important role, which often goes unappreciated. Flaky or dry scalp is an extremely common condition, but in severe cases it certainly doesn\u2019t feel trivial. Put aside notions that it\u2019s a factor of poor hygiene \u2014 the underlying cause is not completely clear, but it may be exacerbated by hair care regimes that dry or irritate the scalp. What is known is that flakes of dandruff are made up of cell complexes, arising from sloughed off skin. The outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is composed in part of dead cells that act as an\u00a0essential protective barrier. Dead cells shed more easily and will be replaced with new ones as skin constantly regenerates and grows. If this happens at too great a rate, the result is dandruff. The first measure is to try an over-the-counter, anti-dandruff shampoo. These contain antifungal and anti-inflammatory compounds both understood to have dandruff-healing properties since fungi and inflammation are believed to be potential factors in the development of a crusty scalp. These compounds \u2014 selenium and coal tar for instance \u2014 can also help relieve the symptoms of itch that may often prove worse than the flaking. It\u2019s worthwhile trying a different formula if the first doesn\u2019t work. Certain conditions such as\u00a0psoriasis\u00a0and eczema can also be the underlying cause and may require alternative treatment. Scabs may be unsightly \u2014 but they function beautifully Scabs are the body\u2019s natural response to being wounded. Cuts, punctures or breaks in the skin open up blood vessels to the atmosphere around us. In response, the bloodstream recruits its clotting agents \u2014 the platelets \u2014 to help plug the gap. Platelets bring blood cells together to form a clot, creating a bung to stop bleeding and prevent bacteria shifting from the skin into the circulation, where they can do more damage. When the clot dries out, a scab is formed. Scabs can look horrible, but don\u2019t worry \u2013\u2014 they\u2019re meant to. Sometimes pus forms, which can give scabs a yellow rather than reddish-brown color and might suggest that an infection is brewing.\u00a0Redness of the uninjured skin\u00a0around and tracking away from the scab is another telltale sign of possible infection, too. Resist the temptation to pick off a scab from the skin, no matter how tempting it may seem. Scabs may be unsightly, or itchy, but they\u2019re performing the job they\u2019re supposed to \u2014 keeping out bugs and allowing wounds to heal. Take good care of them instead, by keeping them untouched and clean, and wait for them to shed themselves. READ MORE: Is hot yoga good for you? Exploring the science behind the sweat The eyes have it Sleep sand. Eye bogies. Doze dust. The debris we find in the corners of our eyes each morning goes by many different names. Few of us know exactly what it is, why it\u2019s there, or its scientific name, rheum. Tears lubricate the exposed surface of the eyes, stopping them from getting dry and sore. They also hose away grit and dust and have\u00a0natural antibacterial properties\u00a0to fight infections. But our eyes make more than just tears. The lids have many little glands that discharge\u00a0natural oily substances\u00a0allowing tears to spread evenly across the eye and prevent them evaporating away. In addition,\u00a0mucus-secreting glands, much like those in the nose that make snot, make a thin mucus that also helps to trap and eliminate rogue particles. In large amounts, oil and mucus can irritate the eyes but normally get swept away by tears and blinking during the day. By night, our eyes remain shut, and rheum builds up. Whether they take on the appearance of sticky bogies or crusts depends on how dry they get overnight, and may be proportional to how long you sleep. READ MORE: Why do my armpits smell? (Ear) waxing lyrical Earwax is a largely invisible entity \u2014 more often felt than seen. Notice a feeling of blocked or congested ears, or a smothered sense of hearing, and the wax in your ears might be becoming problematic. It also has a clinical name \u2014 cerumen. In part,\u00a0it\u2019s made of oils and sweat\u00a0from glands lining the ear canal. The majority of earwax though is keratin, the natural protein that toughens skin, hair and nails. This is because the\u00a0ear canal is lined with skin, all the way up to the eardrum. In mixing with the secretions, shed skin produces a waxy substance ranging in colors across the brown spectrum. Fresh, healthy earwax tends to be yellow to honey-brown in color, whereas older, thicker earwax becomes darker brown, sometimes even black. Notice red or green staining? Then blood or bacteria may be mixing with the wax. Among other diagnoses, this raises the possibility of an ear infection, especially if there\u2019s also a runny or foul-smelling discharge. Like many of the other bodily secretions, cerumen also traps debris and other nasties (even insects) that could irritate or damage the delicate eardrum. But problems arise if the wax builds up or hardens too much, blocking conduction of sound to the drum, and dampening your hearing. Nothing smaller than an index finger (with well-trimmed nails) should ever go in your ear canal. Stop cleaning with cotton buds, too. All this does is compress cerumen into little impacted cakes. Instead, medicinal olive oil from the pharmacy can help soften it down,\u00a0making it easier for the ear to clear it naturally. Blood, sweat and tears \u2014 and wax, skin and mucus \u2014 can cause many commonplace issues. But look beyond these minor ailments and be grateful that they\u2019re there. You\u2019d be sorry if they weren\u2019t.

{"id": "2024_06_06_health_mpox-vaccine-lgbtq-pride-month", "text": "As the LGBTQ+ community gears up for Pride celebrations this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hopes people will get more than just their rainbow gear and sunscreen ready. The agency is urging more people \u2013 particularly some gay and bisexual men \u2013 to get the mpox vaccine. The US Department of Health and Human Services plans to be at dozens of Pride and community events across the country to remind people that mpox is still a problem in the United States, but with vaccination, it doesn\u2019t have to be. Anyone can get sick with mpox, the painful and sometimes deadly disease formerly known as monkeypox. But in the global outbreak that started in 2022, certain members of the LGBTQ+ community are considered especially vulnerable. According to recent case reports, 90% of those who got mpox in the US during this outbreak who reported their sexual orientation were men who identified as gay or bisexual. And nearly all of those who got sick were unvaccinated. \u201cFor folks who have not yet gotten two doses of the Jynneos vaccine, it\u2019s really important for protecting them from this disease,\u201d said Alex Tuttle, an epidemiologist with the Poxvirus and Rabies Branch of the CDC. \u201cAbout a quarter of the population that we believe is at risk is currently vaccinated, so we really want to push that up, especially as we\u2019re going into these summer months where risk might be heightened a little bit.\u201d Mpox is a viral disease that can spread easily between people and from infected animals. It can spread through close contact such as touching, kissing or sex, as well as through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles, according to the World Health Organization. Symptoms include a fever, a painful rash, headache, muscle and back pain, low energy and enlarged lymph nodes. For decades, the disease had largely been found in Central and West Africa, but in the 2022 outbreak, cases also began spreading in Europe and North America. Case numbers in the US remain stable and are nowhere near as high as in 2022, when WHO declared the outbreak in North America and Europe a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But there were about 59 new cases a week reported in the US as of the end of April, according to a report published in May, which Tuttle co-authored. By comparison, at the height of the outbreak in 2022, there were about 3,000 new cases reported per week in the US. Another report published by the CDC Thursday looked at the kinds of patients who were seeking care at their local emergency room for mpox between June and December of last year. Of the 196 patients with rashes that doctors suspected could be mpox, three actually were infected. All three were gay or bisexual men who who engaged in sex with one or more partners that they initially met through dating apps. None had been vaccinated. Other studies have shown that the vaccine, which is now commercially available, can help keep people safe. A recent report confirmed that two doses of the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic are highly effective in preventing many mpox cases. If someone who was vaccinated did get sick, the vaccine can reduce the severity of symptoms. There have been scattered reports of infections among vaccinated people, including one cluster in May 2023 in Chicago, but these cases are rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases, the CDC said. Mpox isn\u2019t just an uncomfortable inconvenience. About 10% of people who got sick with mpox in the US in the latest outbreak were hospitalized, and five have died since October. People with compromised immune systems, particularly those with advanced HIV, have more severe infections, the CDC says. Another reason to get the vaccine is the threat of a deadlier version of the virus known as clade I, which carries a case fatality rate of up to 10%, compared with 0.1% to 3.6% for clade II, the version currently in circulation in the US. This version of the disease, the CDC said, is also more transmissible. It hasn\u2019t made its way to the US yet, but it is at the heart of an outbreak that the CDC is monitoring in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tuttle said the Jynneos vaccine should protect against clade I as well as clade II. \u201cThe measures that we have right now, both the vaccine and any of the antivirals, are expected to work on both clade I and clade II of the virus, should it come here,\u201d Tuttle said. Brian Hujdich, executive director of the\u00a0National Coalition for LGBT Health, said his organization and others will continue to work hard to encourage mpox vaccination. \u201cWith all the Pride events over the summer and just being summertime, there\u2019s going to be more interaction. And we\u2019ve seen already that there has been an increase in Virginia and in New York City and in some other locations,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it might not be in numbers that get a lot of attention, but even a small increase can be a preamble to an outbreak.\u201d The CDC is working with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, local organizations and community health partners on what it calls the Summer of Pride initiative, which includes a campaign to remind people that although mpox case numbers have declined significantly, the threat has not disappeared. \u201cI do think some people are surprised that it is still a problem,\u201d said Adrianna Boulin, director of racial equity, social justice and community engagement at Fenway Health, an organization that advocates for and delivers equitable care focused on the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cLast year, we had such a robust program of getting education and information out to people, and we saw mpox rates decline initially, so everyone is surprised, like \u2018wow, this is still an issue.\u2019 It\u2019s important for everyone to know about it, because it can impact all of us.\u201d Boulin, who is also president of Boston Pride of the People, the group that puts on that city\u2019s Pride parade and celebrations on June 8, said there is a health corner at the festival where a number of organizations will talk about the programs and services they offer, including information about the mpox vaccine. Fenway had been running mpox vaccination clinics when the outbreak started, but as the number of cases declined, fewer people were showing up, so it now offers the vaccine by appointment only. Across the country, doses have become much more readily available than early in the outbreak, when people had to stand in long lines at special clinics. Now, pharmacies and many regular medical providers have the vaccine. In addition to the big Pride festival, Fenway Health plans to be at several other LGBTQ events, Boulin said, and at each, workers will talk about mpox. \u201cPeople are excited that they\u2019re outside at these events and they\u2019re motivated, they\u2019re open, they\u2019re listening, and so those are all recipes for really getting information out to folks that they need to help their health,\u201d Boulin said. Key West Pride, which is one of the first of the year and runs from from June 5 to 9, said it will also have a visible health organization presence that will offer educational materials at its Street Fair/Dance Party about mpox and the benefits of the mpox vaccine. The local department of health also provides resources on mpox and vaccination, he said. Hujdich said an important message that health organizations will want to emphasize is that mpox vaccines provide not only protection but real peace of mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be worried about being in contact with people if you\u2019ve been vaccinated,\u201d Hujdich said, \u201cSo it gives you the freedom to enjoy and be proud during Pride.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/mpox-vaccine-lgbtq-pride-month/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_health_senate-hearing-fda-flavored-vapes", "text": "Republicans and Democrats on the US Senate Judiciary Committee showed rare agreement Wednesday as they took to task the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Justice for what they described as inaction on the country\u2019s youth vaping epidemic. Nearly three years ago, a federal court ruled that the FDA was violating the Tobacco Control Act by allowing e-cigarette products that did not have FDA pre-authorization to stay on the market. An FDA official testified Wednesday that the topic was a \u201ctop priority,\u201d but the agency has missed the September 2021 deadline that the court set to for the agency to complete its review of e-cigarette makers\u2019 applications to sell their products. Since that time, one study found, an estimated 2.1 million children have used e-cigarettes regularly, and the majority use flavored products. \u201cAfter the court-ordered deadline passed on September 9, 2021, the FDA could have ordered every single unauthorized e-cigarette off the market, and that\u2019s what it should have done,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, told Dr. Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cInstead, thousands of unauthorized e-cigarettes flooded the market.\u201d In fact, Durbin said, his staffers found vapes in flavors like Red Bull, strawberry, dragonfruit and watermelon bubble gum at a shop just a mile from FDA headquarters. \u201cNot a single one of these products has been authorized by the FDA. None of them. These illegal products, clearly designed for kids by their flavors, are being sold\u201d even in the shadow of FDA headquarters, he said. Placing one of the products in front of him, Durbin asked how the FDA could let such sales happen. \u201cThe volume of those applications and the volume of the market requires us to prioritize our enforcement efforts,\u201d King testified. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, also told the representatives from the FDA and the Department of Justice that she was displeased. \u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing to hear you kind of talk in circles about what you are planning to do, but you haven\u2019t established a plan, and you\u2019re not certain what your way forward is going to be,\u201d she said. King said the FDA has received 27 million applications for e-cigarette products. But unlike with companies that make drugs and medical devices, which pay user fees that fund the agency\u2019s work, the FDA is not allowed to\u00a0collect fees from e-cigarette makers. King asked the Senate committee for the authority to fund this increased workload. \u201cThe rapidly evolving tobacco product landscape presents an unprecedented time and resource challenge that no other center at FDA has ever faced,\u201d King said. Since June, the FDA has authorized only 23 e-cigarette products \u2013 none of them flavored \u2013 and has denied many more. Hundreds of thousands of additional applications are still pending. From 2020 to 2023, there was a 1,500% increase in flavored tobacco products sold in the US, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. He also brought in flavored vape products that his staffers bought, including watermelon bubble gum, apple melon berry and one called Tyson Heavyweight. \u201cDr. King, those are clearly designed for consumption by children, correct?\u201d Cornyn asked. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the intent of the manufacturer, but I can say that flavors do appeal to kids. Ninety percent of youth who use e-cigarettes use flavored varieties,\u201d King testified. About 10% of high school-age adolescents and nearly 5% of middle school students use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, King said. But when they do vape, teens and young adults are much more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. \u201cMore work is definitely needed,\u201d he testified. Enforcement of the law is the other challenge, the FDA and DOJ said at the hearing. The FDA has conducted thousands of inspections of e-cigarette manufacturers and distributors resulting in nearly 900 warning letters, King said. More than 500 warning letters have gone to retail stores, King said, but if the letters are ignored that\u2019s as far as the FDA can go, so it must rely on the DOJ and other agencies. It was only this week that the FDA and several law enforcement agencies announced that they were creating a task force that will use the criminal and civil tools available to fight the illegal sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. \u201cWhat in the hell have you been waiting for?\u201d Durbin asked Arun Rao, deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch in the Department of Justice. \u201cSenator, we have been acting on a number of fronts,\u201d Rao replied. He said the Justice Department has been working with the US Marshals Service and the FDA on seizures of illegal products, but he admitted that \u201cmany manufactures have exploited the premarket authorization process.\u201d Rao testified that many manufacturers whose products have been denied FDA authorization make minimal alterations and resubmit for approval. Some overseas e-cigarette makers will also misrepresent shipments in an effort to slip past regulators, and some stores make their own products. \u201cTaken together, these factors have made illegal e-cigarettes all too accessible,\u201d Rao said. Many products come from China, but that country has banned flavored e-cigarettes, and the products are not sold in Chinese stores \u2013 a point that wasn\u2019t lost on the committee. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell them in China, but you can sell them in the United States and essentially victimize and addict our children to these nicotine delivery devices,\u201d Cornyn said. Nicotine is highly addictive and hurts kids, testified Dr. Susan Walley, immediate past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Section on Nicotine and Tobacco Prevention and Treatment. Nicotine can permanently hurt a teen\u2019s developing brain, studies show, impairing working memory and attention. Flavored products are too tempting and easy to access, said Walley, who brought with her a flavored e-cigarette product called OMG Blow Pop that she said she purchased within walking distance of a school. \u201cSimply put, this is unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need the federal government to get these illegal products off the market.\u201d Even representatives of the vaping industry testified that they were unhappy with the FDA\u2019s authorization process. \u201cThis is a hot mess right now,\u201d said Tony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association. He complained that there was no clear pathway through the approval process and said that without one, \u201cwe are going to persist in having an illicit market.\u201d A high school senior, Josie Shapiro of Seattle, told the committee that vaping products are too easy to access. She said she started vaping after several friends did. \u201cThey thought vapes were harmless because of the fun flavors and colorful packaging,\u201d Shapiro testified. Shapiro said she has tried to quit several times, but vaping has taken over her and her friends\u2019 lives. \u201cI\u2019ve felt completely out of control, helpless and alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t spend quality time with my friends without thinking about when we were going to get our next hit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/health/senate-hearing-fda-flavored-vapes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and they went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products. The February 2023 erythritol in study found the risk of heart attack and stroke nearly doubled within three years when people had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood. For the new study on xylitol, the results were basically the same \u2014 people with the highest levels of xylitol compared to those with the lowest levels had nearly twice the risk of heart attack, stroke and death, Hazen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a receptor on our platelets, which we as yet don\u2019t understand, that is recognizing this molecule and signaling to the platelet to be more prone to clot,\u201d he said. \u201cOur tastebuds can\u2019t tell the difference in the structures between sugar and these other sweeteners, but clearly our platelets can.\u201d The World Health Organization warned consumers in 2023 to avoid artificial sweeteners for weight loss, and has called for additional research on the long-term toxicity of low- and no-calorie sweeteners, the study said. \u201cThrough their work, the investigators have shined a light on the safety of sugar substitutes. There is more to learn,\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s Tomey said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is worth remembering that sugar substitutes are no substitute for a sincere commitment to the several elements of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_health_therapy-benefits-happiness-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Therapy often gets a bad rap. In old movies, it\u2019s often depicted with a patient lying on a couch, talking to a stony-faced, note-taking analyst who never speaks. Critics sometimes derisively describe it as navel-gazing. Therapists are offhandedly called \u201cshrinks,\u201d a throwback to the ancient practice \u00a0of shrinking the head of a conquered enemy. And let\u2019s face it, the practice still carries a stigma for many; acknowledging you see a therapist is akin to admitting you are weak or \u201ccrazy,\u201d especially in some professions. When it comes to physical health, most of us don\u2019t hesitate too long to get help for injuries such as a broken bone or a burn. But when it comes to emotional health, there often is a delay, possibly resulting in a bigger mental health crisis. \u201cPeople don\u2019t come to therapy until they\u2019re having the equivalent of an emotional heart attack,\u201d psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently. Gottlieb is the author of \u201cMaybe You Should Talk to Someone,\u201d a cohost of the \u201cDear Therapists\u201d podcast\u00a0and the writer of the weekly \u201cDear Therapist\u201d advice column for The Atlantic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this hierarchy of pain with our physical health. We don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I fell down and broke my wrist, but I don\u2019t have stage 4 cancer, so I\u2019m just going to let my wrist hang out there and I\u2019m not going to get a cast.\u2019 And we have a very different attitude about emotional health,\u201d she said. Hesitancy over therapy may be due to its stigma, a skepticism about its worth, the cost in time and money, or just the uncertainty about how it works \u2014 and this reluctance to discuss mental health is pretty widespread. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center released in May, 31% of respondents said they would only be somewhat comfortable talking to a therapist about their mental health, while 18% said they\u2019d be either not too or not at all comfortable doing so. \u201cThere are so many misconceptions about therapy, and I think that often prevents people from going,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c(One) is that you\u2019re going to go in, you\u2019re going to download the problem of the week, and you\u2019re going to leave, and you\u2019re basically just complaining and getting validated for your complaints. \u201cAnd that is not what therapy is. We like to say that insight is the booby prize of therapy, that you can have all the insight in the world, but if you don\u2019t make changes out in the world, the insight is useless,\u201d she said, noting that most therapy takes place in the week between sessions \u201cwhere you are actually taking what you\u2019ve learned and doing something different.\u201d Taking action not only rewires your brain, but it can ultimately result in a happier you. \u201cDo they experience joy more? Yes. Are they generally more content in their lives? Do they feel less stressed, less sad, more able to manage when things don\u2019t go well, less reactive when they\u2019re in a situation that maybe is relationally difficult for them, more able to find sort of inner peace? Yes,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. I think that when people say, \u2018Oh, I just want to be happy.\u2019 All of the things that I just described bring you happiness.\u201d You can listen to the full episode here. How can therapy improve your happiness? Here are Gottlieb\u2019s top five reasons. 1. Therapy offers perspective Ideally, therapy is impartial. \u201cTherapy is like getting a really good second opinion on your life, from someone who\u2019s not already in your life,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWhen we try to get advice or guidance from people who are close to us, it\u2019s hard for them to separate out the relationship they have with us and to be able to see the issue objectively.\u201d Our friends, she said, give us \u201cidiot compassion\u201d \u2014 they loyally validate our feelings often without pointing out our own role in any conflicts. Therapists are trained to give us \u201cwise compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hold up a mirror to you, and we help you to see something about what is getting you stuck, that maybe you haven\u2019t been willing or able to see. We help you to see something that you can actively change,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAnd I think that there\u2019s something so empowering about that, and it\u2019s so translatable to many different relationships.\u201d 2. Therapy is a safe space In therapy, you can explore seemingly frivolous subjects. \u201cTherapy can make you happier because it helps you to really be intentional about what you want in your life. And I don\u2019t think we have a lot of spaces to talk about that,\u201d Gottlieb said, referring to concepts such as life satisfaction. \u201cSometimes people think, \u2018Well, I have a roof over my head and food on the table. So this whole thing about meaning and fulfillment \u2014 I can\u2019t really talk about that,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIn therapy, you have a space where you can really ask those hard questions, and nobody\u2019s judging you and nobody\u2019s trying to tell you, \u2018Well, you have enough already.\u2019\u201d 3. Therapy helps to connect with others Modern times have created an epidemic of loneliness; the pandemic only made it worse. Therapy can be a bridge. \u201cWe do have this epidemic of loneliness. And I think a lot of people want deeper connections, and they want more meaningful connections, but they don\u2019t know how to go about it,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think that we all grew up with certain ideas about what relationships look like, what friendships look like. (But) we aren\u2019t always aware of the ways in which we may be preventing ourselves from having more meaningful relationships.\u201d For example, many people avoid conflict or seek it out, while others have social anxiety or never learned the necessary social skills. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know how to reach out even if we want to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think in therapy, you learn how to create connection in your life, which is one of the most influential factors when it comes to happiness.\u201d 4. Therapy helps us see the big picture Therapy helps people see that they are part of larger forces, and not simply individuals who formed with no external influences. \u201cWe sometimes feel that the problems are sort of \u2018out there\u2019 \u2014 we don\u2019t really know that we are part of that dynamic, part of that dance,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c(Therapy) helps you to process that unfinished business.\u201d She pointed out that our parents were human and often did what they learned from their parents. \u201cAnd (therapy is) a place where you can say, \u2018What is some of this old stuff that I\u2019m carrying around with me that I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m carrying around?\u2019\u201d she said, noting that once you understand how your history influences how you navigate through the world, you can change patterns. \u201cIt makes you happier because you\u2019re not carrying around the burden of something that happened a long time ago,\u201d she said. 5. Therapy helps us control our story Our life is a narrative, and therapy can help us make sense of it. \u201cWhen you think about our lives \u2026 they\u2019re really stories. (Therapy) helps you clarify your story and take authorship of your story,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt helps you to take authorship of your own life. \u2026 If I\u2019m creating this one limited time that I have here \u2014 this one life that I have here \u2014 why am I letting all these other people write my story for me, and how can I really take ownership of my story?\u201d We hope these five tips help you understand the benefits of therapy.

{"id": "2024_03_25_health_mifepristone-abortion-pill-explained", "text": "Mifepristone can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor after the US Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit that challenged regulation of the abortion pill. Mifepristone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration decades ago and has been shown to be safe and effective. Anti-abortion advocates have claimed that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn\u2019t study it enough to approve it. A lawsuit was brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations alleged that the FDA violated the law in\u00a0how it regulated mifepristone. If a 5th\u00a0Circuit ruling had been upheld, it could have ended availability of mifepristone for medication abortion via telehealth, which would have affected abortion access \u2014 even in states where it\u2019s legal. The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. The court\u2019s reasoning could still allow other mifepristone challenges in the future. How mifepristone works Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery. Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it\u2019s sometimes known as RU-486. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period. This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show. How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country\u2019s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, that signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the FDA. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone\u2019s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show. Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra \u2013 used to treat erectile dysfunction \u2013 is nearly 10 times higher. Side effects of mifepristone Mifepristone usually doesn\u2019t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA. Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are \u201cexceedingly rare,\u201d happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations\u2019 amicus brief. How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, shows that this option has become steadily more common over the two decades it\u2019s been available, rising from less than 10% of all abortions in the US in 2001 to 53% in 2020 and 63% in 2023. Misoprostol on its own No matter the status of mifepristone,\u00a0misoprostol would still be available\u00a0and could be used for a medication abortion on its own. The only use of misoprostol that\u2019s approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it \u201coff-label\u201d by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor. Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a \u201creasonable\u201d option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective. This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization. People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, previously told CNN. \u201cMisoprostol still works very well and is very safe,\u201d Wong said. \u201cMifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.\u201d CNN\u2019s Devan Cole and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/25/health/mifepristone-abortion-pill-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_01_06_health_medication-abortion-process-wellness", "text": "Mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortions, can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor following the US Supreme Court rejection of a lawsuit challenging regulation of the abortion pill. \u201cWhile many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cA growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective,\u201d he said. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks\u2019 gestation, which is \u201c70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,\u201d according to the US Food and Drug Administration. In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.  Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. \u201cSome people do this because they cannot access a clinic \u2014 particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion \u2014 or because they have a preference for self-care,\u201d said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman\u2019s health. What happens in a medication abortion What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.  CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences? Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation. An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there\u2019s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo. The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes. Then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.  A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration. Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.  In fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled. The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.  CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion? Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed. Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.  Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription. Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator,  helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That\u2019s something people could get without a prescription. Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we\u2019re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we\u2019ve been doing more research on people\u2019s experiences with medication abortion, it\u2019s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.  CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise? Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It\u2019s rare, happening in about 2 out of every 100 pregnancies \u2014 and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion. People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization. If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill. Anyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful. People with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.  CNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion? Grossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever \u2014 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider. Heavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well. One of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it\u2019s wise to be on the lookout. We usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends. Most people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.  If someone still feels pregnant, isn\u2019t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician. People should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion.

{"id": "2024_06_10_health_illegal-e-cigarettes-new-task-force", "text": "Federal health officials are partnering with the US Department of Justice to fight the illegal sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. The US Food and Drug Administration and Justice Department announced Monday that they are creating a task force to target the issue. The task force will include people from the US Marshals Service, US Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies to identify and target illegal sales and distribution of e-cigarettes. \u201cUnauthorized e-cigarettes and vaping products continue to jeopardize the health of Americans \u2013 particularly children and adolescents \u2013 across the country,\u201d Benjamin Mizer, the acting associate attorney general with the Justice Department, said in a news release Monday. \u201cThis interagency Task Force is dedicated to protecting Americans by combatting the unlawful sale and distribution of these products,\u201d Mizer said. \u201cAnd the establishment of this Task Force makes clear that vigorous enforcement of the tobacco laws is a government-wide priority.\u201d While the FDA has authorized the sale of 23 specific tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products and devices to date, several unauthorized e-cigarettes have emerged illegally on the market, some of which appeal to minors. More than 1 in 10 young adults in the United States regularly use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey found that about 2.1 million youth reported currently using e-cigarettes. Under current regulations, new tobacco products must receive marketing authorization from the FDA before they can be sold; pre-existing e-cigarette products have been allowed to remain on the market, but the agency has asked\u00a0manufacturers to submit applications to keep them there. The new federal task force will hone in on several issues, \u201cincluding investigating and prosecuting new criminal, civil, seizure and forfeiture actions,\u201d according to the news release, and violations \u201ccan result in felony convictions and significant criminal fines and civil monetary penalties,\u201d as well as the seizures of unauthorized products. \u201cEnforcement against illegal e-cigarettes is a multi-pronged issue that necessitates a multi-pronged response,\u201d Dr. Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in the news release. \u201cThis \u2018All Government\u2019 approach \u2013 including the creation of this new Task Force - will bring the collective resources and experience of the federal government to bear on this pressing public health issue.\u201d The creation of this new task force comes after the FDA has issued more than 1,100 warning letters to several distributors, manufacturers, importers and retailers for illegally selling or distributing unauthorized tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. In December, the FDA announced seizing about 1.4 million units of unauthorized e-cigarette products. \u201cThe U.S. Marshals Service Asset Forfeiture Division stands ready to work with our Task Force partners in the seizure of unauthorized e-cigarettes from domestic distributors seeking to sell them unlawfully,\u201d Ronald Davis, director of the US Marshals Service, said in Monday\u2019s news release. Meanwhile, the American Lung Association has announced that it applauds the launch of the new federal task force. \u201cFor too long, manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers have acted without regard for the law or public health. The Lung Association has urged enhanced law enforcement actions be taken to hold manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors accountable for selling illegal tobacco products and to protect the public health, especially children\u2019s health,\u201d Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement Monday. He added that youth vaping is a \u201cserious\u201d public health concern. \u201cMany of the illegal e-cigarettes currently on the market are flavored products, which attract youth,\u201d Wimmer said in part. \u201cThe American Lung Association commends the DOJ, FDA and other agencies involved in this task force. Ongoing and coordinated enforcement is necessary to remove the illegal and addictive tobacco products from the market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/health/illegal-e-cigarettes-new-task-force/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an official health advisory warning about a \u201cpotential disrupted access to care among individuals taking prescription stimulant medications and possible increased risks for injury and overdose.\u201d Around the same time, the US Department of Justice announced a federal health-care fraud indictment against two executives from the digital health company Done Global, whose website describes it as \u201cmaking high quality psychiatric chronic care management more accessible and affordable for patients.\u201d The indictment\u2019s effect on patients \u201cis unknown at the time,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s advisory. \u201cPatients who rely on prescription stimulant medications to treat their ADHD and have been using this or other similar subscription-based telehealth platforms could experience a disruption to their treatment and disrupted access to care,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cA disruption involving this large telehealth company could impact as many as 30,000 to 50,000 patients ages 18 years and older across all 50 U.S. states.\u201d Ruthia He, the founder and CEO of Done Global Inc., was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday and accused of participating in a scheme to distribute Adderall over the internet, conspire to commit health-care fraud and obstruct justice, according to the Justice Department\u2019s announcement. The company\u2019s clinical president, David Brody, also was arrested in San Rafael, California. The Justice Department claims that He and Brody generated more than $100 million in revenue by arranging for the prescriptions of more than 40 million pills, targeting \u201cdrug seekers\u201d and instructing prescribers to prescribe stimulants to patients even if they didn\u2019t qualify. \u201cAs alleged, these defendants exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and carry out a $100 million scheme to defraud taxpayers and provide easy access to Adderall and other stimulants for no legitimate medical purpose,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news release. \u201cThose seeking to profit from addiction by illegally distributing controlled substances over the internet should know that they cannot hide their crimes and that the Justice Department will hold them accountable.\u201d Naomi Chung, Brody\u2019s attorney, said he had pleaded not guilty to all counts. \u201cDr. Brody worked to promote access to medical treatment for those with ADHD in the face of both widespread stigma and the unprecedented challenges of a global pandemic.\u201d Efforts to reach He or the company were not successful, and CNN has not been able to determine whether He has retained a lawyer because the case docket remains under seal. The arrests mark the Justice Department\u2019s first criminal drug distribution prosecutions related to prescribing via telemedicine through a digital health company, the agency said. If convicted, He and Brody will face a maximum penalty of two decades in prison. Last year, a CDC study found that prescriptions for stimulants often used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder surged during the pandemic, especially among adults. Between 2016 and 2020, the share of the population that had filled a prescription for a stimulant drug held relatively steady. But there was a large increase in 2021, with prescription fills jumping more than 10% across most age groups. The new CDC advisory noted that there is an ongoing prescription drug shortage in the United States involving several stimulant medications commonly prescribed to treat ADHD, a brain disorder that can make it difficult to concentrate or control impulsive behavior. It\u2019s estimated that ADHD affects about 4% of adults and about 10% of children in the US. About one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. \u201cPatients whose care or access to prescription stimulant medications is disrupted, and who seek medication outside of the regulated healthcare system, might significantly increase their risk of overdose due to the prevalence of\u00a0counterfeit pills\u00a0in the illegal drug market that could contain unexpected substances, including\u00a0fentanyl,\u201d according to the CDC advisory. \u201cGiven the national\u00a0drug overdose crisis\u00a0and threats associated with the illegal drug market, individuals struggling to access prescription stimulant medications are urged to avoid using medication obtained from anyone other than a licensed clinician and licensed pharmacy,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cHealth officials and healthcare providers may need to assist affected patients seeking treatment for ADHD and should communicate overdose risks associated with the current illegal drug market as well as provide overdose prevention education and mental health support.\u201d The CDC advisory also warned that without treatment, ADHD is associated with social and emotional impairment and a higher risk of drug or alcohol use disorder, unintentional injuries such as motor vehicle crashes, and suicide. \u201cAs more health care needs are met through telemedicine, we will not tolerate fraud schemes that seek to recklessly exploit digital technologies,\u201d Christi Grimm, inspector general of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in the Justice Department\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect the enrollees of federal health care programs by ensuring that requirements for the appropriate, legal prescribing of stimulants and other drugs are always met, and those who choose to violate them are held accountable.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/cdc-adhd-medication-alert/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}

In an open letter posted to the agency\u2019s website on Thursday,\u00a0it\u00a0urged states to\u00a0warn the public more strongly about the dangers of raw milk\u00a0and to\u00a0test\u00a0herds that produce it for sale. The\u00a0FDA\u00a0also recommended that states use their regulatory authorities to stop the sale of raw milk\u00a0within the state or\u00a0in areas where dairy herds have tested positive. On Thursday, Minnesota became the 10th\u00a0state\u00a0to report infected herds.\u00a0According to the US Department of Agriculture, 82 herds in the US have tested positive for the H5N1 virus. The FDA doesn\u2019t allow the sale of raw milk across state lines, but several states allow the sale of raw milk for human consumption within their borders, with varying requirements. Some states allow raw milk to be sold as pet food labeled \u201cnot for human consumption,\u201d\u00a0understanding that what people do with the milk in their own homes is up to them. Raw milk\u00a0can carry high levels of the H5N1 bird flu virus because the virus appears to infect cows through their udders.\u00a0It is not yet known whether people can get bird flu by drinking milk contaminated with the virus.\u00a0 However, cats living on farms with infected cows have died after consuming unpasteurized milk, and three\u00a0dairy\u00a0workers exposed to raw milk have been infected. \u201cGiven the current and potential future risks that HPAI H5N1 virus poses to our nation\u2019s public health, as well as the health of our nation\u2019s food-producing animals and wildlife, it is important to work together to minimize the additional exposure of humans and other animal species,\u201d wrote Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, who is leading the agency\u2019s H5N1 response. Beyond bird flu, the FDA says health risks of raw milk include illness, miscarriages, stillbirths, kidney failure and death. In addition to stronger warnings about the dangers of consuming raw milk, the FDA is asking states to monitor dairy cattle herds for signs of illness that would indicate infection with H5N1 bird flu virus and tell farms to safely discard milk from sick cows. Any raw milk or raw milk products from exposed cattle that are fed to calves or any other animals should be heat-treated or pasteurized, the FDA said. The FDA is also calling on states to implement surveillance testing for the presence of H5N1 virus in dairy herds that might be engaged in producing raw milk and to report their results to\u00a0state and federal regulatory agencies. The agency said it would soon share new research and data on both bird flu virus in raw milk and raw milk products.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/with-bird-flu-infecting-dairy-cattle-fda-asks-some-states-to-curb-sales-of-raw-milk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_health_internet-addiction-teen-brain-activity-wellness", "text": "Teens who spend lots of time on social media have complained of feeling like they can\u2019t pay attention to more important things like homework or time with loved ones. A new study has possibly captured that objectively, finding that for teens diagnosed with internet addiction, signaling between brain regions important for controlling attention, working memory and more was disrupted. The findings are from a review, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Mental Health, of 12 neuroimaging studies of a few hundred adolescents ages 10 to 19 between 2013 and 2022. \u201cThe behavioural addiction brought on by excessive internet use has become a rising source of concern since the last decade,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. The criteria for clinical diagnosis of internet addiction in the included studies were \u201cone\u2019s persistent preoccupation with the internet, withdrawal symptoms when away from the internet, and sacrificing relationships (for) time to spend on the internet over an extended period of time (e.g., 12 months),\u201d said Max Chang, first author of the study and outreach case manager at the nonprofit Peninsula Family Service in San Francisco, via email. \u201cThe pattern of behaviour results in significant impairment or distress in the individual\u2019s life.\u201d Given the changing state of adolescent brains compared with adults, the authors felt understanding the impacts of internet addiction on the teenage participants\u2019 brains was vital. When participants clinically diagnosed with internet addiction engaged in activities governed by the brain\u2019s executive function network \u2014 behaviors requiring attention, planning, decision-making and impulse control \u2014 those brain regions showed substantial disruption in their ability to work together, compared to those in peers without internet addiction. The authors think such signaling changes could suggest these behaviors can become more difficult to perform, potentially influencing development and well-being. \u201cWhile this paper presents a straightforward systematic review suggesting that there are associations between functional connectivity in the brain and internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 there are a number of fundamental limitations to be aware of that are critical to any interpretation,\u201d Dr. David Ellis, a behavioral scientist at the University of Bath\u2019s Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour, said in a news release. \u201cCause and effect cannot be drawn from these studies,\u201d said Ellis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cSecond, the focus on functional connectivity comes at the expense of any critique about the key measure of interest. Specifically, internet \u2018addiction,\u2019 which was initially conjured up by (psychiatrist) Ivan K. Goldberg in 1995 as a joke. \u201cToday, the conceptualisation and measurement of internet \u2018addiction\u2019 is neither universally accepted and certainly not diagnosable using the survey instruments used in the studies included as part of the review,\u201d Ellis added. \u201cSimilarly, the enormity of activities that the internet allows for immediately makes this definition somewhat redundant.\u201d In the United States, internet addiction isn\u2019t included in the DSM-V \u2014 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the US. It does, however, list internet gaming disorder. All the studies the authors reviewed were all conducted in Asia and consisted of mostly male participants. China was the first country to declare internet addiction a \u201cpublic health crisis.\u201d \u201cSuch definitions, despite being widely critiqued, also have a tendency to move the focus away from genuine online harm and towards a conclusion that suggests the removal of technology from people\u2019s lives will be helpful,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSolid evidence to suggest that removing the internet brings any tangible benefits has not been forthcoming.\u201d Additionally, all studies were conducted at one point in time, said Dr. Eva Telzer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cGiven that there are no longitudinal data,\u201d Telzer said, \u201cit is very possible that adolescents who have underlying differences in brain connectivity patterns are more vulnerable to developing internet addiction.\u201d Overcoming internet addiction If internet addiction is what caused the disruption in participants\u2019 brain signaling, the reason why may have to do with neural pathways related to addiction, said Dr. Smita Das, an addiction psychiatrist and clinical associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine in California. Das wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The functional connectivity patterns in participants\u2019 brains are, in fact, in line with those observed in people with substance addictions, said Dr. Caglar Yildirim, an associate teaching professor of computer science at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston. Yildirim wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cOverall, the mechanisms underlying internet addiction are more like an emerging pattern than a finished picture,\u201d Chang said. \u201cA lot of causality between what happens in the brain and what is displayed through behavior is still being understood. As of now, observation using biomarkers such as functional connectivity helps bridge that gap.\u201d\u00a0 If you\u2019re wondering if your teen struggles with internet addiction, behaviors such as withdrawing from relationships are a telltale sign, Chang said. \u201cSimilar to substance and gambling disorders, internet addiction rewires the brain, making it harder to resist internet related stimuli,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, unlike gambling or substance usage, the internet is an important part of our lives. Balancing the usefulness and dangers of the internet is a field that is very crucial going forward in adolescent development.\u201d Find what keeps your teen off the internet and help them do more of it, Yildirim suggested. You can also talk with your child\u2019s doctor to see if behavioral strategies can work, Das suggested. Therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness and motivational interviewing are helpful. The latter, which originated in the field of addiction treatment, is a counseling method that aims to increase a patient\u2019s motivation for, and commitment to, behavioral change by eliciting and exploring the patient\u2019s own reasons for wanting change. In severe cases, a psychiatrist may suggest medication to treat certain types of technology addiction, she added.

{"id": "2024_06_12_health_men-sexual-health-wellness", "text": "Guys, let\u2019s talk man to man. We often obsess over sex and our performance, but how many take steps to ensure we\u2019re in top shape for the long haul? If we don\u2019t take care of our health today, we won\u2019t enjoy a healthy sex life tomorrow. It\u2019s crucial to think about your sexual health to avoid regrets in the future. Future-proofing yourself is key. Sexual health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Chronic stress, poor diet, lack of exercise and other lifestyle factors can significantly affect your sexual health. If you\u2019re experiencing persistent problems, don\u2019t hesitate to speak with a doctor. Early intervention can prevent minor issues from becoming significant obstacles. Seeking help is a sign of strength, and a health care professional can provide the guidance and treatment options you need for a lifetime of good sexual function. The effects of high stress Whether as a result of personal problems or trouble at work, chronic stress is a major contributor to reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. With stress, the body produces elevated levels of cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production. Studies\u00a0have shown that men with emotional problems or stress are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction in the form of either premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction and/or low sexual desire. It\u2019s crucial to incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine: regular exercise, meditation, proper sleep and hobbies that you enjoy. Seeking professional help from a therapist can also provide effective coping strategies. What you eat Poor eating habits can lead to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular issues, all of which can adversely affect sexual function. Research indicates that men with a waist circumference over 40 inches are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome, which is linked to erectile dysfunction. Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains can make a substantial difference. Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding ultraprocessed foods can further enhance your sexual health. (To put it simply, the more fast food you eat, the faster you will lose your sex life.) How you move Lack of physical activity is detrimental to heart health, which is crucial for maintaining sexual function. Regular exercise helps improve blood flow, which is essential for achieving and maintaining an erection. Studies suggest that men who exercise regularly report improved erectile function compared with inactive men. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, along with strength training exercises, to keep your body in top shape. The more you exercise at the gym, the more exercise you will get in the bedroom. If you smoke Smoking is a leading cause of erectile dysfunction due to its negative impact on blood vessels and blood flow. The toxins in cigarettes can damage the lining of blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the penis. Research shows that men who smoke are about twice\u00a0as likely to develop erectile dysfunction as nonsmokers. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your sexual health. Consider resources such as nicotine replacement therapy, support groups and counseling to help you quit. How you sleep Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, can severely affect testosterone levels and lead to sexual dysfunction. A study found that men with severe sleep apnea had significantly lower testosterone levels compared with those without the condition. Prioritizing good sleep hygiene is essential. If you suspect a sleep disorder, consult a health care provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, which may include lifestyle changes or medical interventions. Mental health issues Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety can have a profound impact on sexual desire and performance. About 20% of patients with anxiety and up to 40% of men with depression report experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction. Mental health conditions can lead to a decrease in libido and difficulties in achieving or maintaining an erection. Seeking help from mental health professionals can be highly beneficial. Therapy and medication can significantly improve both mental health and sexual function. Hormonal imbalances Hormonal imbalances, particularly low testosterone, can negatively affect sexual health. Testosterone levels naturally decline with age, but conditions such as hypogonadism can accelerate this process. Studies suggest that about 20% of men over the age of 60 have low testosterone levels. Regular checkups with a health care provider can help monitor hormone levels. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications or hormone replacement therapy to restore balance. Side effects of certain medications Certain medications, including those for hypertension and depression, can cause sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Beta-blockers, for example, can decrease libido and lead to erectile issues. It\u2019s important to discuss potential side effects with your doctor. They may adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication that has fewer effects on sexual health. Chronic illness Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease can significantly affect sexual function. Diabetic men, for instance, are three times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction compared with nondiabetic men. Managing chronic illnesses effectively with the help of a health care provider is crucial. Doing so includes following prescribed treatments, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and monitoring yourself regularly to keep conditions under control. Relationship issues Problems within a relationship can cause stress and decreased sexual desire. Communication breakdowns, unresolved conflicts and lack of intimacy can all contribute to sexual dysfunction. Open communication with your partner is key to addressing these issues. Consider couples counseling to help resolve underlying problems and improve your relationship and sexual health.
