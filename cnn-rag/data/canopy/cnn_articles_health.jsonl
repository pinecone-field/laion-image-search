{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_fauci-testimony-house-hearing-covid-19", "text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified on Monday at a House subcommittee hearing about the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the origins of the virus. The hearing was Fauci\u2019s first public testimony on Capitol Hill since his retirement from government service. It turned contentious at times as Republicans grilled Fauci over a wide range of topics, including the basis for public health recommendations during the pandemic and email use by public health officials. Here are key takeaways from the hearing: US still needs to close communication gaps to be better prepared for next pandemic Fauci said there are still some things the US needs to work on to be more prepared for another pandemic in the aftermath of Covid-19, saying in \u201csome respects\u201d the country is better prepared to deal with a health crisis than in 2020, \u201cbut in others, I am still disappointed.\u201d One thing that he hopes the US will do better moving forward is tightening communication between the federal response and local public health officials. Fauci said there was a \u201cdisconnect between the health-care system and the public health system\u201d during Covid-19 in the US. Specifically, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not demand information from local agencies, which caused a lag in sharing data. \u201cWe were at a disadvantage,\u201d Fauci said, adding that the CDC is working on ways to fix this pain point. Republicans grill Fauci over public health official\u2019s use of email Fauci testified Monday that he has not used his personal email to conduct business, and he was not aware before a congressional investigation that a former senior adviser at the National Institutes of Health had used unofficial email. \u201cWhat you saw, I believe, with Dr. Morens was an aberrancy and an outlier,\u201d Fauci testified on Monday, referring to a former senior adviser at NIH. \u201cThe individuals at the NIH and NIAID are a very committed group of individuals and this one instance that you point out is an aberrancy and an outlier.\u201d The House Oversight select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic previously released a series of private emails that Republicans argue show that some NIH officials deleted emails and tried to get around requirements to disclose information through public records laws. In a memo published at the end of May, committee members said Dr. David Morens, a former senior adviser to Fauci, engaged in \u201cnefarious behavior.\u201d Fauci said he had worked on research publications with Morens in his role as a senior adviser, but Morens\u2019 role did not include advising Fauci on any department policy. The committee points to email that Morens sent another colleague that suggests he would send email to Fauci\u2019s private account and \u201cthere is no worry about FOIAs.\u201d FOIA is the Freedom of Information Act, the law that gives the public the right to obtain federal records, including emails sent within government agencies. Morens\u2019 email goes on to say that he can also hand information to Fauci to avoid it being a part of the public record. Fauci testifies about possible origins of virus that caused Covid-19 In Fauci\u2019s testimony, he addressed what he said were \u201ccertain issues that have been seriously distorted concerning me,\u201d particularly around the origin of the virus that led to the Covid-19 pandemic. Fauci testified that in early 2020, he was informed through phone calls with two scientists \u2014 Jeremy Farrar, then the director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK and Kristian Andersen, a scientist at Scripps Research \u2014 that they and others were concerned that the virus that causes Covid-19 could have been manipulated in the lab. The day after those calls, Fauci said he participated in a conference call with several international virologists to discuss manipulation in the lab or possible spillover from animals to humans. He characterized the discussion as \u201clively,\u201d with arguments on both sides. Fauci said he did not try to steer the discussion in any direction. Fauci said the virologists on the joint call decided to more carefully examine the genomic sequence and after further examination, and said, \u201cseveral who at first were concerned about lab manipulation became convinced that the virus was not deliberately manipulated.\u201d Scientists found the most likely scenario, Fauci said, was a virus that transferred from an animal to a human, \u201calthough they still kept an open mind.\u201d \u201cThe accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous,\u201d Fauci said, noting he had no input into the content on a paper published in March 2020 that discussed the possible origins of the virus. Some of the world\u2019s leading scientists have investigated the origins of the virus, including a committee of experts from the World Health Organization. Most scientists believe that the virus spread from animals to humans in China. Some studies have also said that the theory that the virus escaped from a Chinese lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, cannot be ruled out. Most US intelligence agencies say the virus was not genetically engineered, but it is still not totally clear how the pandemic started. A US intelligence analysis released last year said either origin was possible, and the community remains split on the issue. The US Department of Energy assessed last year that it had \u201clow confidence\u201d in the lab leak theory. No US federal agency believes that the virus that causes Covid-19 was created as a bioweapon. \u201cI cannot account nor can anyone account for other things that might be going on in China, which is the reason why I have always said and will say now, I keep an open mind as to what the origin is,\u201d Fauci said Monday. Fauci details threats he and his family have received Fauci detailed the threats he received during his time as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, describing death threats against him and threats against his wife and daughters. Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell asked Fauci to explain what some of the threats were and he replied: \u201cEverything from harassments from emails, texts, letters of myself, my wife, my three daughters. There have been credible death threats leading to the arrest of two individuals \u2013 and credible death threats means someone who clearly was on their way to kill me. And it\u2019s required my having protective services essentially all the time.\u201d Fauci said he feared that the threats against public health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic would serve as a \u201cpowerful disincentive\u201d for the best and brightest candidates to take up the profession. \u201cThey say to themselves, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go there. Why should I get involved in that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re reluctant to put themselves and their family through what they see their colleagues being put through,\u201d he testified. The 6-foot social distance guideline came from the CDC, Fauci clarifies Fauci clarified that the 6-foot guidance for social distancing given during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic did not come from him, but from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cIt actually came from the CDC. The CDC was responsible for those kinds of guidelines to schools, not me,\u201d Fauci said. Fauci, who repeated the guidance during the pandemic, once said that there was no science behind it \u2014 but he meant that there were no clinical trials to back it up. \u201cIt had little to do with me since I didn\u2019t make the recommendation and my saying \u2018there was no science behind it\u2019 meant there was no clinical trial behind that,\u201d Fauci said. He added that he believed the CDC used studies about droplets years ago as reasoning for the 6-foot guidelines. When the CDC first promoted the idea of 6-foot \u201csocial distancing\u201d for people who had to be around others during the pandemic, scientists thought that larger contaminated droplets would fall out of the air quickly and couldn\u2019t travel farther than 6 feet. At the time, the World Health Organization recommended that people keep a meter, or 3.3 feet, between them. But even as early as 2021, scientists were starting to understand that the coronavirus is airborne, meaning it could spread through droplets\u00a0and aerosols, smaller particles that could travel\u00a0even farther\u00a0and float in the air. That\u2019s in large part why public health agencies emphasized the importance of people wearing masks to reduce the number of germs that could float in the air and make people sick.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-testimony-house-hearing-covid-19/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_health_peanut-allergy-infants-adolescents-wellness", "text": "Reassuring new evidence suggests that feeding children smooth peanut butter during infancy and early childhood can help reduce their risk of developing a peanut allergy even years later. Compared with avoiding peanuts, starting peanut consumption in infancy \u2013 as early as around 4 months of age, as a soft pureed paste, for instance \u2013 and continuing regularly to around 5 years old was associated with a 71% reduced rate of peanut allergy among adolescents in the United Kingdom, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal NEJM Evidence. \u201cI was not entirely surprised because infants in Israel are exposed to peanuts very early and allergy does not appear to emerge in adolescence or adults. This suggests the protection is long-term,\u201d Gideon Lack, professor of pediatric allergy at King\u2019s College London and an author of the study, said in an email. \u201cPeanut allergy develops very early in most children between six and 12 months of life. If you want to prevent a disease this needs to be done before the disease develops,\u201d Lack said of exposing children to peanuts. \u201cThis biological\u00a0phenomenon is based on an immunological principle known as oral tolerance induction. We have known for many decades that young mice or other experimental animals who are fed foods such as egg or milk or peanut cannot develop these allergies later.\u201d Starting in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended delaying the introduction of peanuts until 3 years, but it ended that recommendation in 2008. About a decade later, in 2019, the AAP updated its guidance to say that delaying the introduction of allergenic foods doesn\u2019t prevent disease and that \u201cthere is now evidence that early introduction of peanuts may prevent peanut allergy.\u201d Food allergies have become a growing public health concern in the United States, and peanut allergy is estimated to affect about 2% of children in the United States, or nearly 1.5 million people younger than 18. Peanuts are among the food types that can cause the most serious allergic reactions, including the risk of the life-threatening reaction anaphylaxis. \u201cToday\u2019s findings should reinforce parents\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 confidence that feeding their young children peanut products beginning in infancy according to established guidelines can provide lasting protection from peanut allergy,\u201d Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a news release Tuesday. \u201cIf widely implemented, this safe, simple strategy could prevent tens of thousands of cases of peanut allergy among the 3.6 million children born in the United States each year.\u201d The new study, called the LEAP-Trio trial, included data on children in the United Kingdom who participated as babies in a peanut allergy study called the LEAP trial. That previous study included infants with eczema and egg allergy who were followed through age 5, and it found that at that age, the prevalence of peanut allergy was about 17% in the group of children who avoided peanuts, compared with about 3% in the group that ate peanut products, representing an 81% relative reduction in peanut allergy. The LEAP-Trio trial set out to examine whether that reduced risk of peanut allergy would last into adolescence. About 500 children were assessed again for the LEAP-Trio trial, which looked at the rate of peanut allergy at around age 12. At that age, peanut allergy remained \u201csignificantly more prevalent\u201d among the children who originally avoided peanuts, with about 15% having a peanut allergy. Among those who originally consumed peanuts, about 4% had a peanut allergy, the researchers found. They wrote that represents \u201ca 71% reduction in the prevalence of peanut allergy at the LEAP-Trio time point.\u201d But overall, when children started to consume peanuts in infancy and continued to around age 5, this appeared to provide \u201clasting tolerance\u201d to peanuts into adolescence, according to the researchers, based in the United Kingdom and the United States. The new findings are \u201ca great reassurance\u201d that not only did early introduction of peanuts reduce peanut allergies from developing, but the protection lasted until adolescence even when children stopped eating peanuts consistently after age 5, Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist and immunologist at NYU Langone in New York and a spokesperson for the\u00a0Allergy & Asthma Network, who was not involved in the new research, said in an email Tuesday. \u201cSo ideally if there\u2019s no other risk factors we should continue to introduce these allergens early\u00a0at 4-6\u00a0months and continue them consistently until age 5 but after that we don\u2019t need to be as consistent,\u201d Parikh said. She added that introducing peanuts for children at low risk for allergies can be done around 4 to 6 months old under the guidance of a pediatrician, but children with severe eczema and egg allergy should see an allergist before early introduction. \u201cSince babies cannot have solids yet it is recommended for it to be a thin consistency similar to breast milk or formula and can be mixed into it to avoid any choking and can start with a small amount and slowly increase as tolerated every 3-4 days,\u201d Parikh said. When introducing peanuts into an infant\u2019s diet, it\u2019s recommended to use smooth peanut butter mixed into a puree and avoid chunks of peanuts that could pose choking hazards. \u201cIt can generally be said \u2018the sooner the better\u2019 for parents, especially in babies with eczema,\u201d Lack said, adding that babies with eczema are at much higher risk of developing food allergies and develop these allergies much earlier in the first year of life. \u201cHowever, the child needs to be developmentally and neurologically ready to eat solid foods and be able to coordinate chewing and swallowing without a risk of choking. Most babies will be able to start weaning between four and six months of age but each baby is an individual and needs to be assessed individually,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the foods\u00a0should be given as a soft puree to facilitate swallowing and reduce the risk of choking.\u00a0We do not recommend introducing solids before three months of age.\u201d The finding that early peanut introduction induces tolerance has been supported by previous studies too, but introducing your child to peanuts should be a shared decision with your pediatrician, according to Dr. Daniel DiGiacomo, a pediatric immunologist at K. Hovnanian Children\u2019s Hospital at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cThe current expert opinion is to utilize a shared-decision making approach for food introduction once the infant is developmentally ready, and has tolerated a couple of other complementary foods without issue,\u201d DiGiacomo said in an email Tuesday. \u201cI usually start off slowly introducing a pea sized amount, doubling the amount every day until you get to an age appropriate serving size (or at least 2 teaspoons). Then continue this in the diet several times per week,\u201d he said. \u201cI typically have the family mix the nut butter in a tolerated puree to the correct consistency, they can also dissolve peanut puffs (if doing peanut) in water, or make a peanut sauce out of powdered peanut butter or peanut flour. Again, we review the proper consistency and start slow with instructions to stop and contact your allergist if there are any concerns.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/health/peanut-allergy-infants-adolescents-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_health_pig-kidney-transplant-removal", "text": "A genetically engineered pig kidney has been removed from a transplant patient\u00a0after it started losing function, according to a statement on Friday from NYU Langone Health. The patient, 54-year-old Lisa Pisano of New Jersey, is stable and has started dialysis, her doctors said. Pisano first received a mechanical heart pump, called an LVAD, on April 4 and then, on April 12, received a kidney and thymus gland from a gene-edited pig. Her case is the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, and it was the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the thymus. The kidney had to be removed due \u201cunique challenges in managing both her cardiovascular health and kidney function\u201d 47 days after the transplant, NYU Langone Health said. There were multiple episodes where \u201cthe blood pressure she could generate from the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was not adequate to provide optimal perfusion to the kidney, causing cumulative reduction in her kidney function,\u201d said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, in the statement. \u201cOn balance, the kidney was no longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen.\u201d There were no signs of rejection after a recent biopsy of the kidney, according to Montgomery, but there was \u201csignificant injury to the kidney from episodes of insufficient blood flow.\u201d Pisano\u2019s heart pump is continuing to function. \u201cLisa is a pioneer and a hero in the effort to create a sustainable option for people waiting for an organ transplant. Her strength and bravery in the face of adversity inspires and drives us as we continue pursuing the hope and promise of xenotransplantation,\u201d said Montgomery. The need for organs far outstrips the number available.\u00a0Every day, 17 people die in the US waiting for an organ, and kidneys are in shortest supply.\u00a0According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, roughly 27,000 kidneys were transplanted in 2023, but nearly 89,000 people were on the waiting list for those organs. Experts say xenotransplants \u2013 transplants of animal organs into people \u2013 are crucial to solving the organ shortage. Gene editing makes precise edits to a pig\u2019s DNA to help keep the human body from recognizing the animal\u2019s organs as foreign and rejecting them. Pisano\u2019s doctors received permission from the US Food and Drug Administration to do the new procedures under its expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policies, which give terminally ill patients without other options access to investigational medical products outside of clinical trials. The kidney came from a pig genetically engineered to disrupt a gene responsible for the production of a sugar, called alpha-gal. It\u2019s found on the surface of animal cells and\u00a0can be recognized and attacked by human antibodies. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed under the cover of the kidney in an attempt to help Pisano\u2019s immune system recognize the organ. While the kidney ultimately had to be removed from Pisano, Montgomery said the kidney would be studied for further insights and\ufeff stressed the importance of her contribution to the larger goal. \u201cLisa knew the world would learn a great deal through her altruism, and we will apply what she has taught us as we seek to make xenotransplantation a solution for the inadequate supply of human organs,\u201d Montgomery said in the statement.

{"id": "2024_05_30_health_menstruation-early-wellness", "text": "Younger generations are getting their first periods earlier, and the length of time it takes to become regular is changing \u2014 which could point to later health problems, according to a new study. \u201cAmong individuals born between 1950 and 2005, we found that younger generations were starting their first period (menarche) earlier, and the time it took for their periods to become regular also increased,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Zifan Wang, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an email. The study, which published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, looked at data from more than 70,000 participants who filled out surveys as part of the Apple Women\u2019s Health Study, which is a long-term research of menstrual cycles using data from the Apple Health mobile application. The data was collected digitally, relying on people to self-report the information based on their memories of early menstruation and thus limiting the results, Wang said. But other research has documented the trend in first menstrual cycles starting at earlier ages over time. In the latest study, researchers compared trends in the ages of first periods and how long it took for menstruation to become regular by age groups, Wang said. They found that the trends were even stronger in people from racial and ethnic minority groups and/or of lower socioeconomic status. \u201cThis is important because early menarche and irregular periods can signal physical and psychosocial problems later in life,\u201d Wang said, \u201cand these trends may contribute to the increase in adverse health outcomes and disparities in the US.\u201d A vital sign Menstruation is like a vital sign, said Dr. Eve Feinberg, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the research. \u201cYou want to make sure that the body is regulated,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cAnd when cycles are not regular, it\u2019s generally a sign that something else may be going on.\u201d Scientists and health care providers already know that early periods and a longer time for cycles to regulate are associated with poor effects on health, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, Wang said. The longer people have irregular menstrual cycles, the longer they may be exposed to an imbalance between two important hormones: estrogen and progesterone, Feinberg said. Estrogen signals growth, whereas progesterone signals for that growth to stop, she added. To prevent conditions\u00a0\u00a0 such as uterine cancer, you need to have the signals to both start and stop growth. Theoretically, longer exposures to estrogen without a good balance of progesterone could affect an increase in endometrial cancers and fertility problems in the future, she said. And an early period itself may pose problems, Feinberg added. For an 8-year-old to be going through puberty, there is often a disconnect between the age of the child\u2019s mind and body, she said. Where are these trends coming from? The next question is: Why are these menstrual trends changing? Earlier periods might be associated with high body mass index, or BMI, during childhood, Wang said. \u201cThis implies that childhood obesity, which has been increasing in the US, might be contributing to people getting their periods earlier,\u201d Wang added. The cause could also be other environmental factors such as nutrition or the prevalence\u00a0of microplastics, Feinberg said, adding that further investigation is needed. Additional research can help physicians counsel people better about their menstruation and recognize the impact on their patients\u2019 health, said one of the study\u2019s principal investigators, Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, assistant professor of environmental, \u00a0\u00a0reproductive and women\u2019s health at Harvard\u2019s T.H Chan School of Public Health. Physicians should evaluate children with early periods or a long duration of irregular cycles to make sure there isn\u2019t an underlying problem, Feinberg said. \u201cSometimes even using birth control pills at an earlier age to help give earlier exposure to progesterone \u2026 may give a little bit more cycle control and may possibly be protective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think the key is probably really understanding what\u2019s driving this and getting to the root cause.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/menstruation-early-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_07_02_health_tuberculosis-tb-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at Tuberculosis (also known as TB), an infection, caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that usually affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain.  About TB Two types of TB exist - Latent TB infection (non-infectious) and TB disease (infectious). Latent TB infection:- A person infected with latent TB shows no symptoms and may not feel sick.- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.- It is not possible to spread TB bacteria from the infected person to others.- Individuals with a latent TB infection may never develop the disease, as bacteria remains dormant. In other cases, especially involving people with a weak immune system, the bacteria may become active and cause TB disease.- Treatment is required to ensure the infected person does not develop active TB disease but in some cases preventative treatment may not be an option. - Without treatment, about 5-10% of individuals infected with latent TB will develop the disease.  TB disease:- Symptoms of TB of the lungs include coughing up blood and chest pain.- Other symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills and fatigue.- It is possible to spread TB bacteria from the infected person to others.- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.- Treatment typically involves a combination of drugs taken for six months. - Persons with a weak immune system, such as those with HIV or diabetes, are more prone to catching TB disease.  Facts TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings. Germs can stay in the air for hours.  In 2022, about 10.6 million people worldwide became ill with TB, and 1.3 million died (including 167,000 with HIV). In 2022, a total of 8,331 new TB cases were reported in the United States. Up to 13 million people in the United States are living with latent TB. Timeline 1546 - Italian scientist Girolamo Fracastoro hypothesizes that TB is contagious.  1679 - Dutch scientist Francis Sylvius details the impact of TB on patients.  1865 - French military doctor Jean-Antoine Villemin proves the illness can transmit from human to animal or from animal to animal.  1882 - German doctor Robert Koch identifies the bacterial strain as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 1800s - Tuberculosis causes as much as one-quarter of all deaths in Europe during the 19th century. Famous people who die from tuberculosis include John Keats, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte, Anton Chekhov and Franz Kafka.   1921 - After years of trials involving animal testing, French bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin successfully administer a vaccine called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in an infant whose mother died of TB. 1930 - In Germany, more than 70 infants who received the BCG vaccine die of TB. It is later concluded that the vaccine was contaminated in the lab.  1944 - Microbiologist Selman A. Waksman and his associates at Rutgers University report the discovery of a new antibiotic called streptomycin. 1944 - Physicians H. Corwin Hinshaw, Karl H. Pfuetze and William H. Feldman successfully use streptomycin to treat a patient with TB. 1952 - A scientific journal publishes studies heralding the success of a breakthrough treatment called isoniazid.   1985-1992 - Tuberculosis makes a resurgence. Scientists attribute this to several factors, including the spread of HIV.  1994 - The World Health Organization declares tuberculosis a global emergency.  1995 - The WHO launches Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course (DOTS). It is a treatment plan containing five components, including standardized recording and reporting.   2008 - The WHO reports the highest rates of MDR-TB worldwide.  December 8, 2010 - The WHO endorses a new test that diagnoses tuberculosis within hours instead of months. 2018 - A promising new vaccine called M72/AS01E is shown to be effective in many people already infected with TB.  2021 - A study concludes that a four-month multidrug regimen to treat TB is as effective as a six-month regimen.

{"id": "2024_05_23_health_prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness", "text": "Chemical toxins are everywhere \u2014 in our water, food, air and soil. Exposure to those toxins during pregnancy can create serious health issues in elementary school children that can affect their lives for years to come, a new study found. Children born to European mothers exposed to four families of chemicals that disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine (hormone) system had elevated levels of metabolic syndrome at ages 6 to 11. Metabolic syndrome can include obesity, elevated blood pressure, and abnormally high cholesterol and insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Within the group of children exposed to the highest levels of chemicals, 62% were overweight or obese, compared with 16% of children within the low-risk group, said first author Nuria Gu\u0308il-Oumrait, a Fulbright scholar at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cMoreover, the levels of blood insulin and triglycerides, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group,\u201d G\u00fcil-Oumrait said in an email. \u201cIn contrast, HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group.\u201d HDL cholesterol is considered a \u201cgood\u201d blood fat as it helps clear ateries. Metabolic syndrome is typically associated with adult cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, but the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has seen symptoms appearing in kids at younger and younger ages. Having metabolic syndrome as a child is highly predictive of chronic disease as an adult, experts say. \u201cThis research stands out as one of the most comprehensive endeavors delving into early-life environmental origins of metabolic risk, further bolstering prior toxicological and epidemiological evidence in this area,\u201d said Vicente Mustieles, Mariana Ferna\u0301ndez and Carmen Messerlian in an editorial published with the study that appeared Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Mustieles and Fern\u00e1ndez are investigators at the Biomedical Research Center at the University of Granada, Spain. Messerlian is an assistant professor of environmental reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. CNN reached out to the International Council for Chemical Associations for comment but did not hear back before publication. A spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, however, provided the following statement. \u201cWe will review the details of this study once it\u2019s released. ACC\u2019s members are serious about their responsibility to produce chemistries that offer important safety, product performance and durability benefits and that can be used safely. Our members undertake extensive scientific analyses to evaluate potential risk of their chemicals, from development through use and safe disposal.\u201d Dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals The research team behind the new study performed blood and urine tests on 1,134 mothers during their pregnancies and later repeated those tests on their children between the ages of 6 and 11. The tests were looking for mixtures of nine chemical classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly found in the environment. Endrocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants with the \u201cability to cross the blood-placenta barrier and interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance,\u201d the study said. These and other chemicals \u201cend up in the blood, tissue, and organs of fetuses and infants through maternal transplacental and breastfeeding pathways in a never-ending cycle,\u201d Mustieles, Fern\u00e1ndez and Messerlian wrote. The study tested for pesticides; heavy metals; flame retardants; plasticizers such as phthalates and phenols; and PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are found in surface and groundwaters around the world at levels much higher than many international regulators allow. Called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because\u00a0they fail to break down fully in the environment, PFAS have been used since the 1950s to make consumer products nonstick, oil- and water-repellent, and resistant to temperature change. Some of the most studied PFAS, such as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone disruption,\u00a0according to the EPA. Toxic heavy metals in the soil and water include lead and arsenic  \u2014 studies have found alarming levels in manufactured baby food. There is no safe level of lead, while arsenic, mercury and other heavy metals can harm the body and brain at relatively low doses, experts say. A December 2014 meta-analysis of studies on arsenic\u00a0found that a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15. Flame retardants have been linked to a 300% higher risk of cancer. These chemical toxins are the greatest contributor to intellectual disability in children worldwide, resulting in a total loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability, according to an\u00a0August 2020 study. Phthalates, found in hundreds of consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys, have been connected to premature death among people ages 55 to 64\u00a0in the United States. Prior research has connected phthalates with\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and\u00a0undescended testicles in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and testosterone levels in adult males. Phthalates are also linked in studies to\u00a0childhood obesity,\u00a0asthma,\u00a0cardiovascular issues\u00a0and\u00a0cancer. In the study, phthalates were the only group of chemicals that were associated with a lower level of metabolic syndrome. All of the other chemical families increased risk. People are exposed to a mixture of chemicals daily Chemicals may vary in their impact on the body. For example, certain PFAS compounds tend to accumulate in the liver, contributing to fatty liver disease and high cholesterol. And flame retardants and other chemicals may be stored in body fat, contributing to obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, according to the editorial. Since people are exposed to numerous types of potentially toxic substances each day, designing a study that could capture the cumulative impact on different parts of the body would provide a more realistic picture of any potential health impact. By focusing on metabolic syndrome, which combines measurements of blood sugars, lipids such as cholesterol, the existence of fat tissue and the impact on the heart, the current study was one of the first to accomplish this goal, the editorial said. \u201cWe almost always consider health risks from single chemicals, one at a time, as if we are exposed to just one chemical at a time,\u201d said Jane Houlihan, the national director of science and health for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies\u2019 exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. \u201cHere the research team shows that children\u2019s risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life can be driven by the complex mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the body at any moment and it highlights the particular risk of chemical exposures during pregnancy,\u201d she said. Healthy Babies Bright Futures\u00a0published a report in 2019\u00a0that found toxic metals in 95% of the baby foods randomly pulled off supermarket shelves, which led to the introduction of The Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, a bill that would allow the US Food and Drug Administration to set stricter standards and allow the FDA to monitor these standards through access to the records of food suppliers and manufacturers. \u201cGiven the steep rise in metabolic syndrome in the US, health officials and companies should be doing all they can to tighten safety standards and to get these chemicals out of commerce and out of our everyday products,\u201d Houlihan said. How to limit exposure There are ways to minimize exposure to plastics and other toxins, which is especially critical during pregnancy and childhood as developing fetuses and small bodies are more easily damaged, Houlihan said. Reduce rice intake for infants and children, and be sure to rinse grains well before using as this removes up to 60% of the arsenic, she said. Limit juice and be sure to carefully wash and peel vegetables and fruits, and if possible, buy organic. Stay away from stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and don\u2019t use waterproofing sprays. Check your local area for levels of PFAS and other chemicals in your drinking water. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy nonprofit, has created a national tap water database\u00a0searchable by zip code\u00a0that lists PFAS and other concerning chemicals, as well as a\u00a0national map\u00a0that illustrates where PFAS has been detected in the US. If your drinking water is of concern, consider purchasing a reverse osmosis filter, the most effective kind, EWG said. NSF, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, has\u00a0a list of recommended filters. Tap water is often a better choice than bottled water, however, which is packed with nanoplastics that can invade cells and tissues and leach toxic chemicals into the body. At home, one easy change is to use glass or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones when heating food. If possible, try to cook with ceramic, cast iron, or stainless-steel pans and avoid cookware treated with chemicals to avoid food sticking. Another good choice is to use stainless steel or glass bottles instead of plastic ones. \u201cChoose cosmetics that are free from endocrine disruptors such as parabens, benzophenone, triclosan, and phthalates,\u201d Gu\u0308il-Oumrait suggested. Consider the same for food, sunscreens, household cleaners and other everyday products encased in plastic. The EWG has several consumer databases that provides links to consumer products with fewer chemicals, including food scores, personal care products, sunscreen recommendations and a healthy living app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}

The government has instructed health officials to take all necessary actions, including applying prevention and control measures and identifying funds to manage the outbreak. The Honduran health ministry has reported 23,037 suspected cases of dengue in the first 20 weeks of the year. That\u2019s one of the highest totals in the Americas, according to data collected by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The entire region has already reported more than 8.65 million cases in the first five months of 2024 \u2013 almost twice as many as the more than 4.5 million cases reported in all of 2023, which was a record at the time. The southern cone of the Americas has accounted for most of the cases in the first half of 2024, with Brazil registering 7.2 million alone. But now, the southern region is seeing a significant decrease in infections, while Central America and the Caribbean are starting to enter their peak dengue seasons, according to PAHO. \u201cHonduras has entered the epidemic zone due to the increase in cases in all departments of the country, as well as the number of patient admissions in all hospitals in the country due to this disease,\u201d the Honduran health ministry said Friday. Honduras has reported the second-most cases in the Central American Isthmus and Mexico Subregion this year, trailing only Mexico, which has counted more than 69,000. PAHO and the World Health Organization recommend that countries in those areas \u201cadopt the necessary measures to prepare the response to the increase in dengue, including the organization of health services to ensure adequate clinical management, prevention of complications, and avoid saturation of specialized care services.\u201d Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is spread mainly through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

{"id": "2024_05_30_health_bird-flu-michigan-third-human-case", "text": "A\u00a0third person in the US\u00a0has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle, the\u00a0Michigan Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0said Thursday.\u00a0This is the second human case reported in the state and the fourth ever in the US. This time, in addition to some of the eye symptoms seen with previous H5N1 cases, the farmworker\u00a0reported a cough and other respiratory symptoms\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0more typical of human influenza infections, the health department said. \u201cThis individual had respiratory symptoms, including a cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes,\u201d Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday. \u201cWhat the respiratory symptoms tell us, more than anything, is that this virus, like many viruses, can present in more than one way, and for that reason, we should remain alert, not be alarmed,\u201d he added. Experts said that the addition of respiratory symptoms doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the virus has become more dangerous or that it may transmit more easily from person to person.\u00a0Instead, they say, the person probably developed lung symptoms because of the route of infection, perhaps by breathing in infectious aerosols in the milking parlor instead of rubbing their eyes with contaminated hands. \u201cWith the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye. With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,\u201d Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief\u00a0medical\u00a0executive for Michigan, said in a news release. \u201cNeither individual was wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.\u201d About 220 people are being monitored in Michigan because of potential exposure to the virus, Shah said. Michigan, the state with the highest number of dairy herds reported to be infected, is also beginning to conduct blood testing to see how many workers may have antibodies to the H5N1 virus, which would reflect past infections or exposures. The CDC agreed that the risk to the general public remains low. But this case highlights the elevated risk to those who work with infected animals. The CDC has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. \u201cPreviously, we focused on the importance of eye protection, given the conjunctivitis in the first two cases, but this case also underscores the importance of barrier protection, things like masks and other forms of protection for dairy workers, particularly those who are working with affected cows,\u201d Shah said. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. This is the third human infection known to be caused by this highly pathogenic form of avian influenza that\u2019s currently infecting dairy cattle in the US. None of the three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission. The other two cases involved eye infections, or conjunctivitis. The most recent worker had some mild eye symptoms but was not diagnosed with conjunctivitis. The person had direct contact with infected cattle\u00a0and notified local health officials that they were feeling sick.\u00a0Their symptoms are described as mild. The patient has been given the antiviral medication oseltamivir, the same active ingredient as Tamiflu, and they are isolating at home. Their family members have not developed symptoms, but they have also been offered antiviral medication as a precaution. None of the other workers at the dairy farm has gotten sick, and they are being monitored, the CDC said. \u201cGiven the high magnitude of interactions between people and dairy cows as well as with contaminated milking equipment, it is unsurprising that there are more human infections,\u201d said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University who is studying how the virus is transmitting in dairy barns. \u201cEvery time the virus is able to replicate in a person, there is the potential for the virus to adapt to humans and gain molecular features for replication in the respiratory tract and to spread person-to-person,\u201d Lakdawala said. Flu viruses are classified by two of the proteins that sit on their outer envelopes: H, or hemagglutinin, proteins and N, neuraminidase, proteins. CDC testing has confirmed that this third person carries a flu virus with an H5 protein, and the agency will do further sequencing to determine whether the N portion of the virus is N1, as is suspected. It expects to have those results in the next few days. The CDC confirmed Wednesday night that the person had an H5 influenza infection and forwarded the results to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that it was moving forward with a plan to repackage 4.8 million doses of a vaccine against H5N1 that is stored in bulk form in the Strategic National Stockpile. The bulk supplies would be put into multidose vials so they could be distributed and administered more easily. Officials said Thursday that before the vaccine would be given, it would need to go through certain regulatory steps. They also said there\u2019s not currently a plan to offer or recommend the doses to any specific  group of people. The fill-and-finish process to repackage the vaccines will take at least a couple of months, officials said in the news briefing. In the meantime, Michigan\u2019s health department is advising people working on poultry or dairy farms to get a seasonal flu vaccine. \u201cIt will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu viruses,\u201d the department said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/bird-flu-michigan-third-human-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_health_transgender-children-parenting-advice-wellness", "text": "Maryhope Howland gave birth to a baby she thought was a boy. But at 6 years old, the child asked her questions such as \u201cMom, am I a boy? How do you know I\u2019m a boy?\u201d \u00a0 \u201cOnce I clued in, I said, \u2018The doctors make a best guess based on your body \u2026 but only you can know, and we love you no matter what,\u2019\u201d said Howland, now co-lead for the Families United for Trans Rights, an organization of transgender kids and their loved ones. Her child\u2019s questioning didn\u2019t stop there. It marked the beginning of a yearslong evolution not just for her daughter, who came out as nonbinary at age 8 and transgender at 10. It was also a journey for Howland and her husband as they navigated what it means to be trans, ways of affirming their daughter\u2019s gender identity, their responsibilities as parents, and the grief associated with \u201cletting go of one idea of what our life is going to be,\u201d Howland said. \u201cOne of the hardest things for us to do as parents is pause when that vision gets interrupted and really listen to what our kiddos are saying to us,\u201d said Nova Bright-Williams, a trans woman who is head of internal training at the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis organization for LGBTQ+ youth. Listening to a child\u2019s experience can be difficult for many parents, regardless of their political or religious beliefs. But there\u2019s good reason to try. \u201cResearch is constantly showing that LGBTQ young people report lower rates of attempting suicide when they have access to affirming spaces, communities (and) adults,\u201d Bright-Williams said. CNN spoke with a doctor, gender rights activists and parents of trans children about what to say when a child comes out as transgender, how to address certain challenges and what receiving gender-affirming care is like. Here\u2019s what they want you to know. The coming out conversation The Rev. Rachel Cornwell\u2019s child, Evan, was assigned female at birth and had been showing aversion to the trappings of girlhood. When Cornwell asked Evan at age 4 if he were upset he was born a girl, Evan\u2019s answer shocked her: \u201cYes, Mommy. I told God when I was a star in the sky that I was a boy, but God made me a girl, and now I just have to live with it.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cIt seemed that my child knew something very deep and true about himself, and that he had an awareness of how his identity was also wrapped up in his relationship with God,\u201d Cornwell, a pastor at Dumbarton United Methodist Church in Washington, DC, and author of \u201cDaring Adventures: Helping Gender-Diverse Kids and Their Families Thrive,\u201d said via email. \u201cWe started to go to therapy as a family and just after Evan turned 6, he decided that he wanted to use male pronouns and a new name, at first just at home.\u201d Cornwell initially felt surprised, and she feared for Evan\u2019s well-being, which is common for many parents, experts said. But these discussions can also create a moment of joyful bonding for families, said Dr. Kade Goepferd, medical director of gender health at pediatric health system Children\u2019s Minnesota. It\u2019s also common for a child\u2019s revelations about gender identity to provide a sense of clarity and relief for parents who have been witnessing behavioral and mood issues for which they couldn\u2019t pinpoint a cause, Goepferd added. Other parents have always noticed their child has never quite fit into gendered expectations and feel the conversation is a confirmation. That was the case for Cornwell, whose son had preferred typical boys\u2019 clothes, hairstyles and activities since preschool. He had also started to ask when he would develop breasts and said that whenever he did, he was going to cut them off. Some parents want to support their child but worry if their gender identity is the result of a phase, or if they\u2019ll change their mind later. But the consensus of those interviewed is that even if a child changes their mind one day \u2014 which is rare \u2014 that\u2019s OK. It would be their decision resulting from the exploration of their gender identity, rather than someone trying to control it for them. \u201cThere\u2019s really no harm in ever affirming or loving our kids when they share with us who they are,\u201d Goepferd said. \u201cThe harm really can only come if we refuse to listen or acknowledge the truth that they\u2019re sharing with us and how vulnerable they\u2019re being.\u201d Rejecting them could not only cause hurt and anger but also could ruin chances of a long-term relationship. Therefore, when your child tells you they\u2019re trans, your first response should be to thank them for sharing and learning about their experience, Bright-Williams said. Say you want to get to know more about this part of who they are. Ask how long they\u2019ve known this about themselves, who else they\u2019ve shared their identity with and how you can support them. Jocelyn Rhynard\u2019s son, then 15, told his family he was nonbinary by frosting a cake he\u2019d baked with the phrase \u201cI am NB.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s awesome. Congratulations,\u2019\u201d she said. Rhyland\u2019s son later realized he is trans masculine nonbinary and uses he/him pronouns, and he\u2019s OK with Rhyland calling him her son. (Trans masculine nonbinary means someone\u2019s gender identity is nonbinary, yet they present in a typically masculine fashion with their name, style and more.) If you feel fear, concern, bias or grief, process that away from your child, said experts and parents, who also emphasized the importance of learning about transness by doing your own research. Don\u2019t rely solely on your child to guide you. Forms of gender affirmation Not every transgender person feels the need for any or all forms of changing their gender expression or their body, experts said. When older children come out, they typically already have chosen a new name, pronouns and more. But if your child isn\u2019t sure what support or changes they need, you can have conversations over time about what stylistic choices, hobbies and toys help them feel most like themselves, Bright-Williams said. Many children aren\u2019t in a rush to make these changes, experts and parents said \u2014 some experiment at home for a while before debuting a new style or name at school, for example. Once kids reach adolescence, some experience distress over their body nearing or going through pubertal changes \u2014 which can be relieved by puberty blockers that temporarily put a pause on these developments. One thing that helped Howland feel more comfortable with her daughter starting puberty blockers at age 12 was realizing that withholding them would not be a neutral decision, since puberty is permanent \u2014 which could have negative consequences for a child who doesn\u2019t identify with that body. Dealing with friends and family The response from Howland\u2019s family and friends was one of support, she said. But Rhynard, a descendant of \u201csome of the very first Mormons,\u201d didn\u2019t have that experience. \u201cIt has been difficult for our extended family, some more than others,\u201d Rhynard said. \u201cSome of the family members have been accommodating, and they have tried their best to use different pronouns, but they still get it wrong a couple years later.\u201d Rhynard and her husband have had to have some really difficult conversations in which \u201cwe\u2019ve said, \u2018Our child comes first, and we would love for you to be a part of our lives, but you can\u2019t call them by their dead name. It is too painful for them,\u2019\u201d she added. Their parenting philosophy is based on humility, learning and growing, but they realized they can\u2019t make everyone learn and grow with them. While some family relationships have become strained, Rhynard knows her responsibility is to her children. \u201cIf we centered them in the conversation about our child, we would no longer be centering our child, the most vulnerable person in our family and the person that we\u2019re lucky enough to raise,\u201d Rhynard added. For parents struggling with complicated family relationships, Goepferd recommends finding support from another parent of a transgender child, a trustworthy friend or an understanding church leader. Organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign and PFLAG have resources for how to talk about your child\u2019s identity with loved ones and their school. \u201cWe, as a society, put a lot of pressure on appearance and how other people perceive us,\u201d Bright-Williams said. But parents have the burden of shouldering that pressure so their kids don\u2019t have to. Parents have to make these sorts of decisions all the time, she added. \u201cMaybe your child is biracial and some people in your family have a problem with that,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you want them to experience that type of bias or hate, or would you protect or shelter them from that? It is up to you to create a safe and affirming space for your child.\u201d \u2018A political lightning rod\u2019 These parents have said their kids are doing well, and that their support has led to strengthened, more trustful relationships with them. Howland, Rhynard and Cornwell all said they have also changed \u2014 they\u2019re more accepting, open-minded and confident in protecting their families. \u201cShe\u2019s great,\u201d Howland said of her daughter, but \u201cwe keep waiting for the world to rear its ugly head on her. She is aware that trans people are a political lightning rod. Sometimes she says things that break my heart, like \u2018There are people who hate me,\u2019 or \u2018There are people who wish I didn\u2019t exist.\u2019\u201d Howland and her husband know they can\u2019t shield their daughter from every news story or potential bully. \u201cDesperately afraid about my child not having federal civil rights protections in this country,\u201d Howland said she even has a spreadsheet of what countries they could move to if they had to one day. To make her daughter aware and prepared, she has exposed her to the issues in as positive of a context as she can \u2014 such as the time she took her to a recent fundraiser for Sarah McBride, a Delaware-based trans woman who is the nation\u2019s first known transgender person to serve as a state senator and who is now running for Congress. \u201cI say to her that it\u2019s my job to carry that right now, not hers,\u201d Howland said. \u201cAnd that she\u2019s safe and that we will always do everything we can to protect her.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/health/transgender-children-parenting-advice-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_health_empathy-contagious-wellness", "text": "People love to categorize teens as self-centered, but in my office, they are anything but that. \u201cHow should I help my friend?\u201d I hear that question at least three times a week from teens who recognize that their friends and classmates need support. They see a friend struggling, and they want to help. That\u2019s empathy. During adolescence, the main goal of teens is to build independence to prepare to fly the nest, and they do this by building connections with their peers. Close friendships provide stability, mutual support and stress relief for teens. Though it\u2019s common for teens to hang out in packs, both in person and online, it\u2019s not always obvious that some are learning to empathize with their peers. It\u2019s worth it to help our teens learn this consideration for others. A new study that tracked 184 people (99 females and 85 males) for two decades starting at age 13 found that empathy is catching. Researchers found that empathy spans three generations and has ripple effects that transmit from mother to teen to children, according to the study, which published May 22 in the journal Child Development. The best part about the study? Modeling empathy and engaging in empathic communication were the only strategies used. Researching empathy across generations Beginning in 1998, the teens, their mothers and their closest friend were all invited into the research lab at the University of Virginia to engage in problem-solving or advice-seeking first with their mom and then with their friend. All interactions were recorded to code for maternal warmth and emotional support from mother to teen, followed by coding for similar behaviors in how teens supported their friends when the friend asked for advice. When the teens were in their 30s and had kids of their own, they were surveyed to ask about their parenting behavior and their children\u2019s empathy. Results of this long-term study showed that mothers\u2019 empathy for their teens at 13 predicted teens\u2019 empathy for their friends during the adolescent years (ages 13-19), and that the ability to show empathic support to friends in the teen years predicted more supportive parenting in adulthood and greater empathy in the next generation of kids. When we practice empathy with our teens, we literally pay it forward for the next generation. Dr. Michele Borba, educational psychologist and author of \u201cThrivers: The Surprising Reasons Why Some Kids Struggle and Others Shine,\u201d was not surprised by the results. She was not involved in the study. \u201cThe best way to show empathy is with warm relationships,\u201d she explained. \u201cThese mothers showed parental warmth with their teens, and these teens learned empathy in the moment. They brought that empathy to their peers, and it all adds up as they grow until they become more emotionally secure parents themselves.\u201d  That can be hard to do with moody teens, so I asked Borba to share her top three tips for building empathy during the teen years. Look and listen more It\u2019s OK if you\u2019re not sure how to meet your teen in these emotional moments. \u201cParents often tell me they\u2019re worried about what to say when teens come to them,\u201d Borba said. \u201cI tell parents the best thing they can do is sit with their teens, focus on them, and listen to understand where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d Are you worried about handling intense teen emotions? I encourage parents to follow the 80/20 rule: listen 80% of the time; talk 20%. Teens want to feel seen and understood, and that\u2019s best achieved by listening and watching for their cues. Handle your own stress Stress can be contagious in families, and you can\u2019t help your teens if you are feeling compromised. \u201cYour empathy goes down when you\u2019re stressed, so take a breath and do what you need to do before you tune in and try to figure out what your teen needs,\u201d Borba said. \u201cWe all have our own coping strategies, but consider taking a brisk walk, phoning a friend or drinking some ice water to cool your own stress before you deal with your teen.\u201d Talk feelings more often There are clear benefits to being open and honest about all kinds of emotions. Parents should be mindful not to dump their own stressors on their teens, but it is healthy to identify and talk about feelings. \u201cResearch shows that teens often misinterpret how parents feel,\u201d Borba said. \u201cTalk about feelings more often to help confirm emotions and move on.\u201d Using \u201cI feel\u201d statements around the house gets the whole family into the habit of talking about feelings. Borba also pointed out that literary fiction is one of the simplest ways to get families engaged in talking about feelings. Read the same books so you can talk about the characters and storylines. Watching TV together is another way to discuss experiences with a little bit of distance. Above all, what your teens need from you is uninterrupted time together to feel heard and understood.

Nordmeyer, who has ADHD, isn\u2019t necessarily using the meeting to collaborate with others \u2014 she just needs their presence as a motivator to help her get things done.  \u201cI run a business, and I have to balance lots of different areas of the business,\u201d said Nordmeyer, cofounder and managing director of the Center for Living Well with ADHD-Minnesota, an ADHD coaching group near Minneapolis serving all ages.  \u201cSome of those things come very easy \u2014 like, they\u2019re in my wheelhouse, they energize me, I can\u2019t wait to get to them,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cAnd some of those things are a little more tedious, or I have some resistance around them.\u201d  What Nordmeyer does to get through those tougher tasks is sometimes known as \u201cbody doubling,\u201d a productivity and self-help strategy that involves working with another person around to help improve motivation and focus. It has been popular for some time among people with ADHD \u2014 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \u2014 especially during the pandemic.  \u201cThe idea is that the presence of another is essentially a gentle reminder to stay on task,\u201d said Billy Roberts, clinical director of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cFor folks (with) ADHD whose minds tend to wander and get off task, the body double somehow works as an external motivator to stay on task.\u201d  Body doubling isn\u2019t just for people with ADHD, but like many \u201ccoping strategies, something that can be helpful for anybody is more central and important for folks with ADHD,\u201d said Dr. J. Russell Ramsay, founding codirector of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s ADHD Treatment and Research Program.  Why body doubling works A neurodevelopmental disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood but lasting into adulthood, ADHD stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University\u2019s Center on the Developing Child. Those skills help us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and multitask. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity \u2014 so people with this disorder might have trouble concentrating, staying organized, managing their time or controlling their impulses, which can affect both their work and personal lives, Roberts said.  If people with ADHD have no intrinsic interest in a task, Roberts said, they typically struggle with a lack of internal motivation to complete it or even to get started. Body doubling provides that motivation, experts said.  \u201cIt also draws on our social selves,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cA lot of people with ADHD will say, \u2018I have a hard time getting started on this if I\u2019m doing it for myself, but if I know somebody else is relying on me, if somebody else is waiting outside for me to show up to go for our walk, I\u2019m more likely to go and be there because I don\u2019t want to let them down.\u2019\u201d  There doesn\u2019t appear to be extensive research on body doubling for productivity, according to Roberts and other experts. \u201cBut I do know that the idea of externalizing motivation is a long-standing, evidence-based mechanism for managing ADHD,\u201d Roberts said.   In theory, the method is pretty straightforward, but there a few factors to keep in mind to make the most of it. How to use body doubling effectively Body doubling can help with pretty much any task you\u2019re having a hard time getting done \u2014 whether that\u2019s work, chores, exercise, schoolwork or paperwork. The other person doesn\u2019t have to be doing the same thing as you, unless the activity you need body doubling for \u2014 such as exercising \u2014 requires that assistance.   Be choosy about whom you ask to be your body double. The person should be as committed to you completing your work as you are, Roberts said \u2014 not distracting you with conversation or anything else. Choose someone who usually makes you feel comfortable and safe, and who can encourage you when necessary.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep a body double session focused on its purpose,\u201d Nordmeyer said. If conversations do come up, table them for later, perhaps during a break or dinner. Asking someone to be your body double might feel awkward, but Roberts said the best approach is often a straightforward one. You could say, \u201cIt\u2019s something I heard can help with productivity. Would you mind just being around me while I work on this? Maybe you have something you could work on, too.\u201d  You could also barter with them, in a sense, by making an offer such as, \u201cYou help me organize my garage on Saturday; I\u2019ll help you organize your home office on Sunday,\u201d Ramsay said.  Those small first steps of seeking a partner and setting up the session get you started and keep you going, he added. Scheduling regular body doubling sessions is one option, Nordmeyer said, or just ask whenever the need arises. How transparent you are about why you need a body double is up to you, as is whether you have more than one body double. \u201cIt depends on the individual,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf it turns into a distraction more than mindfulness, accountability or behavioral support, then you just want to rework things. You can kind of tinker with things until you find what works.\u201d  Virtual body doubling If you don\u2019t have a friend or colleague to be your body double, you aren\u2019t out of luck.  Some TikTok users, such as Allie K. Campbell, regularly go live while they\u2019re working so others can use them as a virtual body double. There are also body doubling or coworking platforms or apps such as Flown, Focusmate or Flow Club.  In virtual sessions, \u201cmost body doubles ask you to share your camera, and a lot of people are real nervous about being visible,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cThe purpose of that is to make sure you\u2019re still in your chair working. \u2026 But there might be other ways you can create that accountability through a chat feature.\u201d  The benefits of body doubling are likely why some people like working on things in coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces \u2014 which can be sources of passive body doubling if you don\u2019t have someone to ask, Roberts said. \u201cSome people work better with community support and just the awareness of other people around them,\u201d he added. \u201cYou saw that a lot with the pandemic, like people learning more about the kinds of structure they needed.  \u201cWe all think and work differently, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d Roberts said.

{"id": "2024_06_03_health_auto-brewery-syndrome-wellness", "text": "Her breath reeked of alcohol. She was dizzy, disoriented and weak, so much so that one day she passed out and hit her head on a kitchen counter while making lunch for her school-age children. Yet not a drop of liquor had passed her lips, a fact that the 50-year-old Toronto woman and her husband told doctors for two years before someone actually believed her. \u201cShe visited her family doctor again and again and went to the emergency room seven times over two years,\u201d said Dr. Rahel Zewude, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto. Doctors found the woman\u2019s alcohol levels could range between 30 millimoles per liter and 62 millimoles per liter\u00a0\u2014 below 2 millimoles per liter\u00a0is normal, Zewude said. Alcohol levels of up to 62 millimoles per liter are extraordinarily high and would be considered life-threatening, even fatal, said Barbara Cordell, president of an advocacy association called Auto-Brewery Syndrome Information and Research, which provides patient education and does research on the unusual condition. While no one she knows has had alcohol levels reach that level, many people can function at blood alcohol levels of up to 30 millimoles per liter or 40 millimoles per liter, Cordell said in an email. \u201cI know of over 300 people diagnosed with auto-brewery syndrome and we have over 800 patients and caregivers in our private Facebook support group,\u201d said Cordell, who was not involved in the new case. \u201cPart of the mystery of this syndrome is how these people can have these extremely high levels and still be walking around and talking.\u201d All of the emergency room doctors questioned the Toronto woman\u2019s drinking habits, and she was examined by three different hospital psychiatrists who concluded that she did not meet criteria for the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \u201cShe told doctors her religion does not allow drinking, and her husband verified she did not drink,\u201d said Zewude, who treated the woman and coauthored a report on the\u00a0anonymous case\u00a0that published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until the seventh visit that an emergency room doctor finally said, \u2018I think this sounds like auto-brewery syndrome,\u2019 and sent her to a specialist,\u201d Zewude said. Dr. Fahad Malik, a gastroenterologist at United Heath Services in Binghamton, New York, who currently has 30 patients with the disorder, said in an email that being treated with disbelief and ridicule is common for patients. He was not involved in the new case study. \u201cMost patients have been disregarded as \u2018closet drinkers\u2019 or with behavior conditions prior to diagnosis,\u201d said Malik, who is also a clinical assistant instructor at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University. Extremely rare and frequently unrecognized Auto-brewery syndrome, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is an extremely rare condition in which bacteria and fungus in the gastrointestinal tract turn the carbohydrates in everyday food into ethanol. The first known case occurred in 1946 in Africa, when a 5-year-old boy\u2019s stomach ruptured for no known reason. An autopsy found his abdomen filled with a \u201cfrothy\u201d fluid smelling of alcohol. Since 1974, 20 diagnosed cases of auto-brewery syndrome have been reported in English medical literature, according to an April 2021 review. Additional reports of auto-brewery symptoms have occurred in Japan, where the condition is known as meitei-sho, or \u201calcohol auto-intoxication syndrome.\u201d Auto brewery syndrome occurs when certain species of bacteria and fungi overpopulate a person\u2019s gut microbiome, basically turning the gastrointestinal tract into a still apparatus. Scientists believe the process takes place in the small bowel and is vastly different from the normal gut fermentation in the large bowel that gives our bodies energy. While a number of pathogens can contribute, most cases are due to an overgrowth of two species of fungi: Saccharomyces and Candida. Candida lives on the body and in the mouth, digestive tract and vagina, often taking over when more beneficial bacteria are killed off by a round or two of antibiotics. A July 2013 report documented the case of a 61-year-old man\u00a0who had frequent bouts of unexplained drunkenness for years before being diagnosed with an intestinal overabundance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or brewer\u2019s yeast, the same yeast used to make beer. Many people with the syndrome can function with an enormous amount of metabolically generated alcohol in their system, sometimes only realizing it when they get in trouble with the law. A North Carolina\u00a0man in his late 40s was pulled over for what cops were convinced was drunk driving. He denied drinking despite a blood alcohol level of 0.2%, the equivalent of consuming 10 drinks an hour and about 2.5 times the legal limit. \u201cIt\u2019s not as rare as we think, it\u2019s (just) rarely diagnosed,\u201d Cordell said. \u201cI believe many people may walk around feeling foggy and just think they are tired when they might be fermenting alcohol.\u201d \u2018A metabolic storm\u2019 There are risk factors for auto-brewery syndrome. Diabetes and liver disease can play a role as can gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and short gut syndrome, in which the small intestine is damaged or shortened, Zewude said. There may even be a genetic predisposition connected to how well a person metabolizes alcohol. \u201cBut all of these things have to collide at the perfect time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires multiple risk factors interacting and creating a metabolic storm for this syndrome to emerge in an individual.\u201d For Zewude\u2019s Toronto patient, that metabolic storm began in her mid 40s when she started to have concurrent urinary tract infections, each treated with a round of antibiotics. Beneficial bacteria in her intestinal tract began to die off, allowing the fungi lying in wait to take over. That much yeast needs fuel, which it gets from carbohydrates in the diet. By the time the woman was 48, her body was turning nearly every carb she ate into alcohol. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t eat many carbs, the symptoms weren\u2019t so bad,\u201d Zewude said. \u201cBut then she might have a slice of cake or another big carbohydrate meal, which led to a rapid rise in her alcohol level. These were the times where she might be getting lunch ready for her kids and just fall asleep.\u201d Treatment for auto-brewery syndrome begins with a course of fungicides prescribed after a biopsy or colonoscopy identifies the specific pathogens that have colonized the gut, Zewude said. Starting with a broad spectrum fungicide can backfire. \u201cAntimicrobial resistance is an important part of the syndrome, because part of the reason people get this is because of the frequent antibiotic use that disrupts their gut,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to start narrowly, and then if the patient becomes resistant to that fungicide, try others.\u201d In addition to killing off the yeast, patients are expected to follow an extremely restricted low-carb diet. \u201cNo carbs would be best, but it\u2019s almost impossible to do that,\u201d Zewude said. Probiotics to build back beneficial bacteria can also help, she said. Today, the woman is no longer taking antifungal medications, but she remains on a very low-carb diet after having a relapse. As each person\u2019s experience is different, it\u2019s important that patients stay in close touch with their doctors to manage their condition, Zewude said. \u201cIn this case, the woman has a very supportive husband, who called me immediately when he began to smell alcohol on her breath again,\u201d Zewude said. \u201cFor anyone dealing with the syndrome, it\u2019s important that your spouse, friend, roommate or whatever, know the signs and symptoms and connect with physicians or bring the person to the emergency department when this occurs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/health/auto-brewery-syndrome-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_health_black-bear-kabobs-trichinellosis", "text": "It was supposed to be a celebration, but one family\u2019s unique meal of black bear meat sent several members to the hospital instead. The celebration happened in summer 2022, according to the account in the latest edition of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. An extended family \u2013 unnamed in the report \u2013 came from across the country for a reunion in South Dakota. One family member, a hunter, brought some black bear meat that he had harvested in northern Saskatchewan in May 2022. The hunter said that the hunting outfitter had recommended freezing the meat to kill any potential parasites. The meat had been frozen for 45 days before it was thawed, and the family grilled it with some vegetables and served it as kebabs. Freezing can kill some parasites commonly found in black bears, but according to the World Organisation for Animal Health, some species of parasites are freeze-tolerant. Bears and other wildlife including wild boar, wolves and squirrels can often get sick with trichinellosis, a serious disease caused by parasitic roundworms of the genus Trichinella, but they will often appear perfectly healthy. When butchering the meat, it would be difficult to tell if it was contaminated because there are few signs of the parasite. Many wildlife experts tell bear hunters to consider all bear meat infected, and the CDC recommends cooking the meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill the parasites. Smoking, salting, drying and microwaving do not always kill them, experts say. The meat at the family reunion was initially served rare, but that was not the chef\u2019s intention, the CDC said. Rather, it was \u201cdifficult for the family members to visually ascertain the level of doneness\u201d because the meat was dark in color. After some of the family noticed that it was undercooked, they put it back on the grill before it was served again. It wasn\u2019t until after people had gone home that some started to get sick. The first illness was in a 29-year-old man who had to be hospitalized twice over a\u00a0three-week period. He reported symptoms of severe muscle pain and a fever, and his eyes became swollen. Blood tests showed that he had eosinophilia, a condition involving too many eosinophils in the body, a signal to doctors that someone could have allergies, cancer or parasites. It wasn\u2019t until his second trip to the hospital that doctors learned the man had eaten bear meat and suspected that he may have trichinellosis. Tests soon confirmed that that was the case, and tests were recommended for the other family members. Trichinellosis can be a light or severe infection, and the symptoms can depend on where the larvae migrate to in the body. Light infections may not have noticeable symptoms, according to the CDC. If the parasite moves into the gastrointestinal tract, it can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea or vomiting. In muscle, it can cause a fever, rashes, conjunctivitis and facial puffiness. Occasionally, there may be life-threatening symptoms including heart problems, trouble with the central nervous symptom and breathing issues. Among the eight family members whom investigators interviewed, six had symptoms that were consistent with trichinellosis. Four had eaten bear meat and vegetables, but the other two had eaten only vegetables cooked with the meat. Three family members had to be hospitalized. The hospitalized people got trichinellosis-directed treatment with albendazole, an antiparasitic drug. Those who were not hospitalized received only supportive care since their symptoms had resolved before it was determined they had the infection. Everyone has since recovered. In the course of the investigation, CDC labs received samples of the frozen bear meat and found Trichinella larvae, and the hunter was advised to discard any remaining meat. The CDC also informed the Public Health Agency of Canada about the outbreak since the bear had come from that country. The CDC says it\u2019s important that game meat \u2013 particularly wild game harvested in northern latitudes \u2013 be cooked thoroughly. Since meat that is contaminated with Trichinella can cross-contaminate other foods, raw meat should be stored and prepared separately from other foods.\u00a0The CDC also recommends that government agencies and private groups that organize or oversee hunting should educate hunters about these risks and how to protect themselves.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/black-bear-kabobs-trichinellosis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}

Symptoms of nine mental health disorders substantially improved under placebo treatment, according to a new review of 90 randomized controlled trials \u2014 known as a meta-analysis \u2014 totaling 9,985 adult participants largely in their 30s and 40s. The disorders in the review, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, included major depressive disorder, mania, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia. The placebo tablets used in the randomized controlled trials were identical in appearance and taste to the active medications but lacked the active ingredient, said Dr. Tom Bschor, first author of the study and professor of psychiatry at the University Hospital Dresden in Germany. Placebos instead contain excipients, which are the inactive ingredients in medications. In the past, subjecting participants with mental health disorders to placebo treatment has been an ethical quandary, given that researchers would be not treating someone\u2019s mental health condition and the potential exists for the symptoms of participants receiving placebo treatment to get worse, said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, the Dorothy and Marty Silverman Chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. But there are response plans in place for those situations. Since the participants on placebos in this analysis experienced benefits, the findings support the use of placebo controls in studies, said Alpert, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cOtherwise, it would be very hard to make sense of the data\u201d regarding the effects of active medication, he added. \u201cThis is the most comprehensive study of placebo effects in psychiatry.\u201d The results are also important for patient treatment, Bschor said. \u201cFirstly, the positive effect across all diagnoses shows that it can be medically and ethically justified for patients to participate in clinical trials with placebo arms in the future,\u201d Bschor said via email. \u201cClinicians can encourage their patients to participate in such trials, considering the risk of being assigned to placebo.\u201d Additionally, the study suggests that for most of the disorders, initially forgoing prescription medications could be OK if patients have mixed feelings or anxiety about starting medication and want to see if their condition improves without it, Bschor said. But for disorders that didn\u2019t see as much improvement with placebos \u2014 such as OCD or schizophrenia, which is a psychotic disorder \u2014 medication may be more necessary. Improvement in absence of medication That mental health symptoms improved with placebo treatment may be due to a few potential influences, experts said. First is \u201cthe placebo effect in the strict sense, i.e., the induction of hope and belief in an effective treatment,\u201d Bschor said via email. \u201cPlacebo is administered in randomized, double-blind studies, so participants do not know if they might receive an active drug.\u201d Secondly, the benefit of mental health professionals inquiring about a patient\u2019s condition is \u201cone of the most powerful effects in all of medicine,\u201d said Dr. Richard Keefe, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and psychology and neuroscience at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina. Belief that things can get better can be healing, added Keefe, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The findings may also reflect the natural courses of some disorders, experts said. \u201cIt is well known that mental disorders are episodic, and symptoms may fluctuate over time, and a portion of people may improve partially or completely without any treatment, placebo or intervention,\u201d said Dr. Felipe Barreto Schuch, an adjunct professor of psychiatry and mental health at Brazil\u2019s Federal University of Santa Maria, via email. \u201cThis is what we call spontaneous remission.\u201d Schuch wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The likelihood of spontaneous remission is especially true for depression and anxiety, which have the highest rates of spontaneous remission in general and were the two disorders to benefit the most from placebo treatment in this study, experts said. \u201cA major limitation is that for methodological reasons we cannot separate the three main influences mentioned above,\u201d Bschor said. \u201cIsolating the extent of the true placebo effect would require studies that include a group receiving no medication, not even a placebo, alongside the placebo arm. Such studies are virtually unavailable in the psychiatric field.\u201d Why is there a difference in the effectiveness of placebos for most disorders versus schizophrenia and OCD? Symptoms of certain disorders (such as the sadness that\u2019s the result of depression) are more responsive to attention and reassurance than schizophrenia symptoms like hallucinations are, Keefe said. Biological contributions to these disorders are another factor, Alpert said. Genetics account for 30% to 40% of the risk for developing depression or anxiety, he said. As a result, life events \u201chave a very important impact on whether they\u2019re going to develop major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder,\u201d Alpert said. \u201cDisorders like schizophrenia or OCD are more biological, (in) that 70% or 80% of the risk of developing those disorders appears to be genetic.\u201d If you have one of these disorders and are wondering which treatment, if any, would be best, know that medications still consistently outperform placebos, Alpert said. The study simply shows that if you\u2019re in a therapeutic context in which people care about you and are educating you about your condition, that\u2019s a good start, and medication adds even greater benefit, he added. If you\u2019ve never been on medication for your condition and are going without it to see if your symptoms improve over time, you should still do regular doctor visits and therapy, Bschor said. \u201cHowever, if no improvement occurs after several weeks,\u201d he added, \u201cyou should openly reconsider the necessity of medication.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/health/placebos-improve-mental-health-conditions-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2022_07_18_health_how-to-stay-cool-without-air-conditioning-wellness", "text": "Whether you\u2019re without power, enduring extreme heat or trying to save money, there are ways to feel comfortable without artificial cooling.  Heat can foster fun summer activities, but the body shouldn\u2019t be too hot for too long, as too much heat can harm your brain and other organs, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Sweating is the body\u2019s natural cooling system, but when that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s increased risk for developing the heat-related illness hyperthermia \u2014 signs of which include heat cramps, heat edema and heat stroke. Heat combined with high humidity exacerbates this risk, since the air\u2019s saturation level makes sweat accumulate on the skin, preventing the body from cooling naturally.     Staying cool can be done by using some basic supplies and knowing how to manipulate your home to control its temperatures. Here are 14 methods for doing so.   Stay hydrated When you\u2019re hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer emeritus in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.  The temperature of the water doesn\u2019t matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can\u2019t do that without enough moisture, since the body cools itself by sweating.  Take a cold shower or bath Taking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature, Porter said. For an extra cool blast, try peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that tell your body something you\u2019re eating or feeling is cold.  Use cold washrags on your neck or wrists  Place a cold washrag or ice bags (packs) on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you\u2019ll cool down more quickly.  Use box fans  Place box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you\u2019re spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.  If the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, opening the windows on both sides of the house during those times can facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. If you do this, you can opt to use or not use the fans, but the fans would help cool the house faster, Porter said. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again. Just resting near a fan would reduce your body temperature as well.  Close your curtains or blinds If you have windows that face the sun\u2019s direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to \u201ckeep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up (the) inside,\u201d Porter said.  You could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.  If you do turn the air conditioning on, don\u2019t set it below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, founder of Spaces Alive, an Australia-based design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.  \u201cIt just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,\u201d she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.  Sleep in breathable linens Cotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.  The lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That\u2019s because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.  Sleep in the basement  If you can\u2019t sleep through the night because you\u2019re too hot, try sleeping somewhere besides your bedroom, if that\u2019s an option. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.  Don\u2019t refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing  Common advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out to wear while you sleep. But this isn\u2019t a good idea, Porter said.  Because of \u201cthe amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019d have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d  Close the doors of unused rooms  If no one\u2019s using a room that doesn\u2019t have vents or registers, close the door to that area to keep the cool air confined to only occupied areas of the house.  Use the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom  Flip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.  Install energy-efficient light bulbs Incandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs, then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.  Switching light bulbs can save money but won\u2019t reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. However, if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you\u2019re sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.  Cook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside Oven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.  Enjoy frozen treats Eating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don\u2019t go overboard on the sugar if you\u2019re overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.  \u201cSugar would run your metabolism up and you\u2019d start feeling internally hot,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.\u201d  Research what your state offers If you\u2019ve tried everything and still can\u2019t beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.  Depending on your state, some cooling centers \u2014 air-conditioned public facilities where people might go for relief during extremely hot weather \u2014 may be open and taking precautions to ensure they\u2019re as safe as possible. You could start by checking with your local utility offices, as they would know who is offering certain programs, Porter recommended.

The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other. Doing so should allow the satellites to collect data about phenomena that take place on a short time scale and require frequent measurements \u2014 such as how the amount of cloud cover affects the temperature on Earth beneath it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/world/nasa-prefire-mission-launch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Two teams of scientists have discovered a theoretically habitable planet, smaller than Earth but bigger than Venus, orbiting a small star about 40 light-years away. The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said. But though the exoplanet could potentially be habitable for humans and is relatively \u201cnear\u201d our solar system in astronomical terms, it is unlikely that anyone will visit there soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not reachable, it\u2019s 12 parsecs away,\u201d said Palethorpe, adding that it would take about 225,000 years to reach Gliese 12b with the fastest spacecraft that currently exist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_health_meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness", "text": "Twenty years ago, Dan Harris appeared to have it all. He had joined ABC News in 2000 by age 29, and had covered the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, in addition to other historic events around the world. What viewers didn\u2019t see was the tumult behind the scenes: Harris experiencing depression from his time as a war correspondent and anxiety from working in a high-pressure industry. He tried to stay afloat by using cocaine, ecstasy and prescription sleeping pills. It would all come crashing down on June 7, 2004, when Harris had to sub for anchor Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. While reporting news updates, he had a nationally televised panic attack that \u201cwas the direct result of an extended run of mindlessness, a period of time during which I was focused on advancement and adventure, to the detriment of pretty much everything else,\u201d Harris wrote in his 2014 book, \u201c10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works.\u201d But this moment, though frightening, would be the catalyst for a journey that propelled him from anguish, drug abuse and being a meditation skeptic to mindfulness \u2014 and to a total occupational overhaul. Now, his career focus is meditation and happiness, and helping others struggling with the thought traps keeping them from a more mindful life. It did take a few years for him to get to meditation, after trying out different psychiatrists and therapy. Before Harris began meditating in summer 2009, \u201cI had no real understanding of it except for a baseline reflexive hostility,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was I raised by atheists, but they were also recovering hippies. They had forced me to do yoga and go to granola health food stores, and we did a lot of camping, and I just found all that sh*t very annoying.\u201d Raised by scientists, Harris was convinced by seeing the scientific research on meditation \u2014 studies that showed meditation can lower blood pressure, boost your immune system, and alleviate anxiety and depression. A regular practice can also rewire brain regions associated with stress, focus, compassion and self-awareness, science has shown. He also credits the work of Dr. Mark Epstein, a psychiatrist and Buddhist then in private practice in Manhattan, and Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, another scientist who teaches a secularized form of Buddhist meditation and is a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Masschusetts Medical School. (In the preface of the recently released 10th anniversary edition of his book, Harris acknowledges how the focus on Western scientists and gurus devalues the contributions of Asian and Asian American people, and how he has been complicit and tried to rectify these mistakes.) Harris is now a meditation expert himself. \u201cI find that I just am less yanked around by my urges and thoughts and emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I screw up, I\u2019m quicker to apologize. I\u2019m more focused on the baseline level of calm that I didn\u2019t have before.\u201d When it comes to the benefits, perfection isn\u2019t one of them, he noted. \u201cI retain the capacity to be a schmuck,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s more like you can get better with a little bit of work over time. And that work will build on itself \u2014 the 10% compounds annually.\u201d \u00a0 Harris tackled some common barriers to trying meditation for CNN and suggested how you can overcome them. Change \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll try\u2019 One of the most common excuses people have for not meditating is thinking they won\u2019t be able to focus or sit still long enough. But Harris contends that if you notice you\u2019re getting distracted while meditating, that\u2019s actually \u201cproof that you\u2019re doing it right.\u201d Distractibility is an evolutionarily beneficial aspect of the human condition, as it keeps us safe, he added. \u201cClearing your mind is impossible unless you\u2019re enlightened, or you have died.\u201d Therefore, the active \u201cseeing of the distraction is proof of success,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause what you want over time in meditation is to understand how the mind works.\u201d \u201cThe whole point of meditation is not to stop thinking \u2014 it\u2019s to focus on one thing, usually the breath coming in and going out. And then every time you get distracted, you start again and again and again,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat starting over is like a bicep curl for your brain, and that\u2019s the mechanism by which the brain changes.\u201d Getting familiar with the fact that you\u2019re thinking is key for developing the skill of recognizing thoughts or feelings and intentionally choosing what to do about them, rather than unconsciously and automatically reacting. It\u2019s similar to when you\u2019re exercising for the first time, and the first couple weeks might be challenging, Harris said. Then it can get easier, but it\u2019s not supposed to be effortless. Others feel they can\u2019t find the time or don\u2019t know where to start. But when you want to form a habit, the best move is to start small, Harris said. Start at one minute of meditation daily for a couple weeks before increasing your time, he recommends. Over time, you might notice yourself moving from extrinsic motivation \u2014 such as being advised to do it or reading the research on it \u2014 to the intrinsic motivation that helps you maintain the habit because you feel it\u2019s helping you. There are many free or inexpensive resources that can help you get started, such as those on apps, YouTube or Harris\u2019 own website, or in books, he said. And some cities have meditation or mindfulness centers where you can learn from a teacher and practice with others \u2014 another great way to maintain a habit since it keeps you accountable. The fear of being well Some people are also of the mindset that \u201cthe only way to survive is to be, like, constantly neurotic\u201d lest they lose their edge or ambition, Harris said. But consider prominent and successful advocates for meditation that include athletes, musicians, TV hosts or corporate executives, such as LeBron James, Oprah Winfrey, Arianna Huffington, Jerry Seinfeld, LinkedIn Executive Chairman Jeff Weiner and ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. \u201cDo these people seem like they\u2019ve lost their edge?\u201d Harris said. \u201cDo you think your edge will go away if you\u2019re more focused, less emotionally reactive and a little bit calmer during stressful situations? No, actually the opposite is true.\u201d READ MORE: One habit could reduce your fears of public speaking, criticism, failure and more Harris\u2019 own story is also a testament to how your relationship to work or your values can change once you have reached a healthier place \u2014 and how the success in that newfound reality can be different, but maybe even better or more fulfilling, than what you had imagined or planned. \u201cThis is not the version of success the pre-meditation version of me thought was what I wanted. I wanted to stay in network news and climb as high as I could,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut this opened up a whole new realm for me. I publish books, have my own podcasts and social media feeds, and I continue to have opportunities. I started a company, and I\u2019m exploring a new one. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more potential than I had imagined, and I am absolutely not less ambitious.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/health/meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_tattoo-lymphoma-cancer-study", "text": "A Swedish study has found a potential link between tattoos and a type of cancer called malignant lymphoma, but it ultimately calls for more research on the topic, and cancer experts say the possible link is overblown. The researchers, from Lund University, said they wanted to do the study because so little is known about the long-term health effects of tattooing, despite its continuing popularity. In the US alone, nearly a third of people have at least one tattoo, a 2023 Pew Research Center survey found. The study, published in the most recent edition of the journal eClinicalMedicine, involved nearly 12,000 people in Sweden. From population registries, researchers identified everyone diagnosed with malignant lymphoma between 2007 and 2017 \u2013 nearly 3,000 people \u2013 and matched them with a group of the same age and gender mix who didn\u2019t have cancer. Malignant lymphoma is cancer of the lymphatic system, the part of the body that helps fight off germs and disease. Known risk factors include a weakened immune system caused by illness or immune disorders like AIDS, infections such as Epstein-Barr, age and a family history of the disease. Some exposure to chemicals like pesticides and herbicides can also increase the risk of lymphoma, in addition to secondhand smoke. In 2021, the study authors sent questionnaires to the people they had identified, asking about certain lifestyle factors that may increase the risk of this kind of cancer and about whether they had any tattoos. Even after the researchers factored in things that are known to affect cancer risk like smoking and age, they found that the risk of malignant lymphoma was 21% higher among those who had at least one tattoo. The finding is only an association, not a direct link, but the study authors emphasized that more research will be needed to flesh out this conclusion. To the researchers\u2019 surprise, they found no evidence to suggest that the risk increased as the person\u2019s skin was covered in more tattoos. \u201cWe do not yet know why this was the case. One can only speculate that a tattoo, regardless of size, triggers a low-grade inflammation in the body, which in turn can trigger cancer,\u201d said co-author Christel Nielsen, an associate professor in the\u00a0Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Lund University, in a news release. \u201cThe picture is thus more complex than we initially thought.\u201d The study was not set up to determine what the link between cancer and tattoos may be, if any, but experts are skeptical. The conclusion is \u201creally overstated,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved with the research. \u201cIf I were writing that paper, if I were the editor, I would have said the conclusion is, there is no evidence for a strong association,\u201d he said. The data is solid, he said, but the main risk factors for lymphomas are not found in tattooing. \u201cI would say the message here should be, we really didn\u2019t learn a lot about whether tattoos are associated with cancer with this, and if I had to make a conclusion, I would say the data suggests there is no association,\u201d Rebbeck said, noting that a smaller 2023 study on a connection between tattooing and lymphomas or hematologic cancer also found no increased risk. The 21% estimate of added risk comes from the models in the new study, but it is not statistically significant, he said. Dr. Catherine Diefenbach, director of the Clinical Lymphoma Program at the NYU Langone Health Perlmutter Cancer Center, said some things about the study don\u2019t add up. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make sense to me is why there\u2019s no correlation with the size of the tattoo. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to me that if there is an immune or toxic response, that the bigger tattoo didn\u2019t have any impact at all on the association,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of questions I have from this study.\u201d Diefenbach said she\u2019s never been asked about a connection between tattooing and cancer, but she has seen news reports about the new research. \u201cI think people are getting very nervous about something that is an early study that has to be validated,\u201d she said. The study authors speculate that if tattoos do increase the risk of a malignant lymphoma, one reason may be because of a problem with the ink itself. Tattoo ink can often have chemicals that are considered carcinogens, including metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Earlier studies have shown that the ink can sometimes travel through the body, and tiny particles can get stuck in the lymph nodes, which could lead to health problems. Another study found that tattoo ink could slightly alter parts of blood cells that communicate with others, but it is unclear whether that has an effect on health. Even infections are rare after tattooing, studies show. In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration issued draft guidance to the makers of tattoo ink and its distributors to help them recognize when ink may be contaminated, after the agency received reports about contaminated inks and some companies recalled those inks. The FDA will log and investigate complaints against the industry, but it doesn\u2019t regulate the practice or the inks used in tattooing because it\u2019s considered a cosmetic procedure. Nielsen said her group will look into whether tattoos are associated with other types of cancer or inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, lupus, high blood pressure and heart disease. Rebbeck notes that these types of research can be tricky for the public to interpret. He helps run cancerfactfinder.org, which aims to help people understand what does and does not cause cancer. Some have asked about tattoos, but the research doesn\u2019t really show a connection, he says. \u201cI would say we really don\u2019t know very much, but there\u2019s no strong evidence that having a tattoo is going to cause cancer,\u201d Rebbeck said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/tattoo-lymphoma-cancer-study/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}

Mini cucumbers and English cucumbers are not included in the recall. The recall comes after the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture found that a sample tested positive for salmonella. The US Food and Drug Administration is conducting more testing to see whether it\u2019s related to an ongoing outbreak investigation. Fresh Start Produce notified its customers that received recalled cucumbers directly from the company about the recall and requested that their own customers be notified of the recall. The cucumbers are \u201cunlikely in the marketplace,\u201d the company said, but customers can check with retailers to determine whether recalled cucumbers were sold there. Products should be discarded or returned to the store. Symptoms of a salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that can start within hours or days of consuming the bacteria. Most people will recover with treatment but should seek immediate attention from a health-care provider if they have severe symptoms, symptoms that don\u2019t improve after a few days or signs of dehydration.

{"id": "2024_05_27_health_pregnancy-energetic-cost-wellness-scn", "text": "Having a baby is energetically much more expensive than commonly thought, according to new research. In fact, over the course of a pregnancy, creating and carrying a little one takes 49,753 dietary\u00a0calories \u2014 the equivalent of 199 Snickers candy bars each containing 250 calories, said Dr. Dustin Marshall, a coauthor of the study published May 16 in the journal Science. For the meta-analysis, Marshall, a professor of evolutionary biology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and a team of researchers used data from thousands of existing scientific articles to look at the energy cost of several species. \u201cWhile most folks probably intuit, or have actually experienced the high energy demands that come from gestating a baby, our work assigns explicit values to these costs across a wide range of species \u2014 from insects to lizards to humans,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Samuel Ginther, a postdoctoral researcher of biological sciences at Monash University, in an email. \u201cWe found that the total energy it takes to reproduce is much more substantial than previously considered.\u201d The bulk of the additional energy a pregnant person needs goes toward developing and carrying the fetus, Ginther added. \u201cMost of (the) energy that mammals put into reproduction is \u2018boiled off\u2019 as metabolic heat, only 10% ends up in the actual baby,\u201d Marshall said in an email. \u201cWhen both lactation and metabolic loads are accounted for, the baby itself represents less than 1/20th of the total reproductive investment.\u201d The research could make a big difference in perceptions of pregnancy needs, said Dr. Eve Feinberg, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the research. \u201cI think this study is groundbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cAny working pregnant woman could tell you the sheer level of exhaustion when you are pregnant \u2026 and how it consumes your life.\u201d How to break down what you need The extra calorie needs were not equal across the term of the pregnancy \u2014 you need less early on and much more as time goes on, Marshall said. A person would need about 182.48 extra calories daily over the approximately 272.65 days of their pregnancy, the researchers found. The current recommendations break down differently by trimester of the pregnancy, said dietitian Natalie Mokari. In the beginning, you may not need many more daily calories, she said. Once you get to the second trimester, you need about 350 extra calories a day, while you need 450 more calories daily in the third trimester, said Mokari, who lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. The calories recommended by dietitians add up to even more than the almost 50,000 the researchers mentioned, Mokari said. If you breastfeed after the baby is born, you will need to add 450 to 500 more calories to your prepregnancy diet, she added. You can think of it as an additional substantial snack or mini meal in your day around the second trimester, Mokari said. And by the third trimester and breastfeeding, the additional calories amount to a meal. \u201cYour body is in overdrive. Your metabolism is working hard to build another human,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty monumental.\u201d What to eat How you eat will depend on your pregnancy, Mokari said. She recommends trying to eat every three to four hours or add smaller snacks every two hours throughout the day if that works better for your pregnancy symptoms, she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be three standard meals with a few snacks in between, because sometimes you can\u2019t handle that in pregnancy if you\u2019ve got nausea or anything like that,\u201d Mokari said. Mokari stressed the importance of carbs for energy, protein and healthy fat \u2014 \u201cthose high-quality fats that are going to promote good brain health for the baby.\u201d What constitutes a healthy fat? Fatty fish such as salmon, olive oil, avocados, avocado oil, peanut butter and almond butter are all great examples, Mokari said. Milk and dairy can also provide that fat along with other vitamins, and eggs can be a good source of both protein and fat, she added. \u201cYou really want your energy to come from good, whole foods,\u201d Feinberg added. Get some sleep This study also suggests that sleep is probably especially important during pregnancy, Feinberg said. \u201cIf you feel tired, go to sleep, and really understand that you\u2019re not being a wimp, that you\u2019re exhausted in pregnancy,\u201d Feinberg said. Unfortunately, there can be a stigma around pregnant people having higher sleep needs, but the study\u2019s findings should work against that, she said. \u201cThese data really give some solid numbers to say that the exhaustion women feel is very real and probably needs to be paid more attention to,\u201d Feinberg said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/health/pregnancy-energetic-cost-wellness-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness", "text": "Knee pain is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Whether it\u2019s due to past or current injury, arthritis or simply the wear and tear of aging, the discomfort can be debilitating. In most cases, proactive ways can help you soothe and strengthen your knees. As a mobility coach, I teach people how to use movement as medicine. In the case of knee pain, there\u2019s one simple yet effective exercise I favor to help alleviate pain and strengthen the muscles around your knees: the reverse lunge. Unlike traditional lunges, the reverse lunge is gentler on your joints. This lunge variation not only has the power to strengthen your knee function but also enhances overall lower body strength and stability. Read on to learn how incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness regimen can help you move past the pain and build a stronger foundation for knee health. Understanding your knee pain Knee pain is hard to ignore as it affects your ability to perform everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs and even sitting and standing. The knee joint is a complex structure made up of bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons, all working together to provide stability and movement. When any of these components are compromised, pain can ensue. It may be experienced as a constant or intermittent ache, throbbing or even stabbing pain that may or may not come with swelling. Common causes of knee pain include: \u2022\u00a0 Osteoarthritis: a degenerative joint disease that results in the breakdown of cartilage. \u2022\u00a0 Patellar tendinitis: inflammation of the tendons connecting the kneecap to the shinbone. \u2022\u00a0 Meniscus tears: injuries to the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee. \u2022\u00a0 Ligament injuries: tears or strains to any of the four main knee ligaments (ACL, MCL, PCL and LCL). \u2022\u00a0 Bursitis: Inflammation of the bursae, small sacs of fluid that cushion the knee joint. It\u2019s important to determine the cause of your knee pain before attempting any specific rehab plan. Addressing knee pain often requires a multifaceted approach that may include physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, medication and targeted exercises such as the reverse lunge. Before adding reverse lunges to your fitness regimen or beginning any new exercises or therapies, check with your doctor or other health care professionals you are seeing for help with your knees. Benefits of the reverse lunge The reverse lunge is a basic yet powerful exercise that strengthens the muscles around your knees, improves your core strength and enhances overall lower body strength, mobility and stability. Here are some key benefits: \u2022\u00a0 Reverse lunging strengthens muscles that support your knees. Building stabilizing muscles around the knee joints improves movement quality and reduces pain and injury risk. \u2022\u00a0 The dynamic movement of reverse lunging increases joint lubrication by stimulating the production of synovial fluid. Lubricating the knee joint reduces friction and promotes smoother, pain-free motion. \u2022\u00a0 Unlike forward lunging and other forward stepping exercises, the backward motion of reverse lunges puts less strain on the knees and emphasizes more stability, making them an ideal choice for individuals with knee pain. \u2022\u00a0 Practicing reverse lunges improves balance and stability. Because reverse lunges are unilateral, they are a balance training exercise that strengthens your core and stabilizing\u00a0 muscles to reduce the risk of injury by \u201cmoving wrong.\u201d \u2022\u00a0 They enhance mobility. Regularly practicing reverse lunges improves hip, knee and ankle mobility. \u2022\u00a0 They aid in functional activities. The movement mimics everyday activities, such as kneeling down to tie your shoes or picking something up off the floor. How to perform a reverse lunge Performing a reverse lunge correctly is crucial to reaping its benefits and avoiding injury. Follow these steps for proper form: 1.\u00a0 Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, shoulders relaxed, and arms at your sides or on your hips. Engage your core to maintain balance. 2.\u00a0 Take a step backward with your right foot, landing on the ball of your foot. Your left foot should remain in place, fully connected with the floor. 3.\u00a0 Bend both knees to lower your body until your left thigh is parallel to the ground and your right knee is either lightly touching or nearly touching the floor. 4.\u00a0 Keep most of your weight in your front foot and leg and ensure that your left knee is aligned over your left ankle, not pushed too far forward beyond your toes. 5.\u00a0 Maintain good upper-body posture with your shoulders back and chest open. Avoid leaning forward. 6.\u00a0You do not need to hold the lunge position for any specified length. Go at your own pace, returning to the starting position by pushing through your left heel to lift your body back to standing. Repeat the movement with the opposite leg. Aim for two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions on each leg, depending on your fitness level. Need to modify or want to progress? The intensity of reverse lunging can be varied to accommodate different fitness levels. Beginners or anyone struggling with balance should place one hand on a stable support, such as a chair or wall. For those wanting an advanced variation, hold dumbbells at your sides or a kettlebell at your chest or in one hand at your side or overhead to add resistance and increase the intensity. Use an appropriate weight for your fitness level and goals. To get the most out of practicing reverse lunges, keep these tips in mind: Consistency is key. Regular practice yields the best results. Aim to include reverse lunges in your routine at least two to three times per week. Focus on form. Quality over quantity. Proper form maximizes effectiveness while preventing injury. Listen to your body. If you experience any painful sensation beyond normal muscle fatigue, stop and reassess your form. Consult a health care professional if necessary. Knee pain doesn\u2019t have to sideline you from staying active and enjoying life. By incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness routine, you can take proactive steps toward healthier, pain-free knees. So, step back, lunge and move forward with stronger, more resilient knees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_health_moderna-rsv-vaccine-fda-approval", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration has approved another vaccine to help protect older people from respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV. The shot, made by Moderna and sold under the name of mResvia, could be another tool in the country\u2019s RSV arsenal in the fall. Moderna\u2019s shot is the third RSV vaccine for people 60 and older that\u2019s gotten the green light from the FDA and the first mRNA vaccine among them. It\u2019s the company\u2019s second product to receive FDA approval, behind its Covid-19 vaccine. The other FDA-approved RSV vaccines are made by GSK and Pfizer. There\u2019s also an RSV vaccine for pregnant people in the US that can\u00a0protect an infant after birth and a preventive antibody that can be given to prevent serious illness in babies. The virus is ubiquitous and typically causes mild infection. Globally, about 64 million people get sick with RSV each year, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Many people who get RSV feel like they have a cold, and they will typically recover in a few weeks, but the virus can be particularly dangerous for older people, young children and people with underlying health conditions. Depending on how bad the season is, between 60,000 and 160,000 older adults are hospitalized with RSV every year, and between 6,000 and 10,000 die, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RSV symptoms can include a runny nose, cough, fever, sneezing, wheezing and a decreased appetite, but an infection can also turn into pneumonia or make underlying breathing problems like asthma or COPD worse. In a single year, millions of people are sent to the hospital with a lower respiratory tract infection that started with RSV. Seniors who have underlying heart problems or lung diseases and those with suppressed immune systems are at the highest risk that RSV could turn into pneumonia or kill them. Moderna said Friday that approval of its RSV vaccine was based on clinical trial data showing that even about four months after someone gets the shot, the vaccine had an 83.7% efficacy at preventing lower respiratory tract disease. The vaccine trials involved 37,000 adults in 22 countries. Moderna says a longer-term analysis showed that the vaccine provided continued protection nearly nine months after vaccination. The company said there were no serious safety concerns identified in the trial, and the most common problems were pain at the injection site, headache and fatigue. \u201cThe FDA approval of our second product, mRESVIA, builds on the strength and versatility of our mRNA platform,\u201d St\u00e9phane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in a news release. \u201cmRESVIA protects older adults from the severe outcomes of RSV infection, and it is the only RSV vaccine available in a pre-filled syringe designed to maximize ease of administration, saving vaccinators\u2019 time and reducing the risk of administrative errors. This approval is also the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved for a disease other than COVID-19. With mRESVIA, we continue to deliver for patients by addressing global public health threats related to infectious diseases.\u201d The CDC recommends the two other approved RSV vaccines for adults 60 and older using shared clinical decision-making, meaning seniors should discuss with their doctor whether they should get the shot. The agency\u2019s independent committee of vaccine advisers will consider at its meeting June 26 whether Moderna\u2019s vaccine should be recommended. The CDC makes the final determination on whether to recommend the vaccine and gives doctors guidance on how it should be used. Moderna said it expects that its vaccine will be available for eligible groups in the US in time for the 2024-25 RSV season, which typically starts in the fall and peaks in the winter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/moderna-rsv-vaccine-fda-approval/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_health_crecelac-baby-formula-cronobacter", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Friday about baby formula that may be contaminated with a bacteria that could be dangerous for infants. On May 24, Dairy Manufacturers Inc. recalled 12.4-ounce containers of Crecelac Infant Powdered Goat-Milk Infant Formula with Iron 0 to 12 months, Farmalac Baby Powdered Infant Formula with Iron 0 to 12 months and Farmalac Baby Powdered Infant Formula with Iron Low Lactose 0 to 12 months because the products were not in compliance with all FDA infant formula regulations, the FDA said in a news release. The company had not submitted the products for the required premarket notification before selling them in the US, the agency said. The products are sold in stores in Texas and, the FDA said, possibly in other locations in the United States. However, as part of the FDA\u2019s ongoing investigation into the products, the agency said Friday, it found Cronobacter contamination in a sample of Crecelac formula. Limited sampling of other versions of the formula included in the recall did not turn up Cronobacter. No illnesses have been reported in connection with the recall, but Cronobacter can cause serious infections of the central nervous system and the bloodstream and can lead to life-threatening conditions like sepsis and meningitis. In 2022, four cases of Cronobacter infections in infants - including two who died - triggered a large recall of infant formula that compounded a nationwide shortage. In general, infants who get sick with Cronobacter can go on to develop brain abscesses, motor development problems, developmental delays and even death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Early symptoms of infection can include jaundice, abnormal body movements, irritability, poor feeding and a change in body temperature. The FDA said it is working with Dairy Manufacturers and its distributors to make sure that the recall is carried out fully. Parents and caregivers are advised not to give these particular brands to their infants, the FDA says. Those looking for goat milk infant formulas can find options that have completed the required premarket notification process and speak with their health care providers about possible alternatives.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/crecelac-baby-formula-cronobacter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_health_alcohol-planes-heart-study-wellness", "text": "The \u201cfasten seat belt\u201d sign is off, and the time for a nap on your flight is on. You grab your neck pillow, eye mask and a glass of wine to make sure you are well-rested on the other side. That tactic isn\u2019t such a good idea, according to new research. Airplanes flying at altitudes around 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) are hypobaric, meaning the air pressure and oxygen levels are lower than typical conditions on Earth. Combine that with alcohol consumption and sleep, and it\u2019s more likely a person will experience an intensified drop in oxygen saturation in their blood, according to a study published Monday in the journal Thorax. \u201cPlease don\u2019t drink alcohol on board of airplanes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Eva-Maria Elmenhorst, deputy of the department of sleep and human factors and leader of the Working Group on Performance and Sleep at the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne, Germany, in an email. To investigate, researchers created an atmospheric environment similar to an airplane cabin in flight. Over two nights, 48 healthy adults slept for four hours in two different environments \u2014 once without alcohol and once after drinking the equivalent of two glasses of wine or cans of beer, according to the study. On the nights with alcohol, researchers saw a lowered amount of oxygen and an increased heart rate, the study showed. \u201cThe combination of alcohol intake with sleeping under hypobaric conditions poses a considerable strain on the cardiac system and might lead to exacerbation of symptoms in patients with cardiac or pulmonary diseases,\u201d the researchers said. The study is small, but it provides a starting point from which researchers should keep investigating the relationship between sleep, flight and alcohol, said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. Many people may be drinking onboard to help them get to sleep in an often uncomfortable cabin \u2014 but doing so negatively impacts both long-term health and the immediate goal of getting some rest, experts said. Alcohol gets you sleep \u2014 but not good sleep The study authors didn\u2019t just collect data on heart strain. They also took a closer look at the participants\u2019 quality of sleep. It wasn\u2019t great. Time in REM sleep \u2014 the rapid-eye movement stage that may be important to memory consolidation and brain recuperation \u2014 was shorter for people in the airplane conditions who had alcohol, the study showed. The finding isn\u2019t a surprise, Freeman said. Alcohol may help you get to sleep, but the quality isn\u2019t as good as sleep while sober, he said. \u201cMany people have witnessed when people drink heavily, their snoring and the sleep apnea is much more severe,\u201d Freeman said. The quantity of sleep under the influence also tends to be different, said Dr. Shalini Paruthi, codirector of the Sleep Medicine and Research Center at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Chesterfield, Missouri. People tend to get more fragmented sleep after drinking, meaning they wake up more in the night and tend not to sleep as long, said Paruthi, an American Academy of Sleep Medicine spokesperson. She was not involved in the research. \u2018Sometimes people will just think about the immediate effect of \u2018ooh it will make me fall asleep faster\u2019 but they forget about all the other effects of the alcohol,\u201d she said. Be especially careful not to mix sleep aids with alcohol, because both are depressants and intensify their sedative effects when taken together, Freeman said. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen \u2026 people taking sleeping pills combined with alcohol, which is a major issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, there\u2019s oftentimes a medical emergency.\u201d How to rest before your destination If possible, try to keep to your natural body cycles when flying, Freeman said \u2014 although that might not always be possible. That can look like choosing a flight that lines up with your sleep patterns so you can either land and just finish sleeping or land and start your day, he said. Avoid creating those sleep and wake cycles with too many stimulants such as coffee or energy drinks and depressants like alcohol, he added. Next, stay hydrated, because flying typically involves a dry environment and people don\u2019t always hydrate properly, Freeman said. The best thing to drink is water, he said. Foods served at airports and airplanes can lean salty, greasy and heavily processed, so Freeman recommends either packing your own or finding airport options that are lighter and largely plant-based. Exercise can also help you sleep better, so he advises avoiding the elevators and moving sidewalks to get some steps in instead. If you are on a long flight, try to get up and get some movement as well, Freeman said. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019ll point out is there\u2019s lots of evidence that suggests that the blue lights that are emitted from screens and all that interfere with our sleep patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are trying to sleep on a plane, consider getting a noise-canceling headphone and maybe not use your screens, especially while you\u2019re waiting for the flight to take off.\u201d It may be harder to keep up your healthy habits on days when you fly, but making efforts to do so can help you arrive feeling good and ready for an adventure, Freeman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/health/alcohol-planes-heart-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_health_art-live-longer-wellness", "text": "Most people don\u2019t pick up a coloring book, paintbrush, poetry collection or museum membership for the health benefits \u2014 but maybe it\u2019s time to start. Research shows that art experiences, whether as a maker or a beholder, transform our biology by rewiring our brains and triggering the release of neurochemicals, hormones and endorphins. In response to a growing body of evidence that art can radically improve both physical and mental health in effective and measurable ways, more health care practitioners are prescribing arts engagement as part of treating a wide array of conditions, including: obesity, heart disease, chronic pain, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, loneliness and depression. The power of diverse arts practices to promote healing, well-being and even longevity provides benefits that rank right up there with exercise, nutrition and sleep, argued Susan Magsamen in her bestseller, \u201cYour Brain on Art: How the Arts Transform Us,\u201d coauthored with Ivy Ross. Could this be why the arts have evolved over millennia to become central to human experience? \u201cI always thought of art as a luxury,\u201d conceded Bianca Bosker in her new book, \u201cGet the Picture: A Mind-Bending Journey among the Inspired Artists and Obsessive Art Fiends Who Taught Me How to See.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t feed you, house you or be used to kill predators.\u201d But she discovered that many scientists consider art a basic human need. \u201cArt is one of our oldest creations (humans invented paint long before the wheel), one of the earliest means of communication (we drew long, long, long,\u00a0long\u00a0before we could write), and one of our most universal urges,\u201d she wrote. Both Bosker and Magsamen recommend that everyone make art a daily practice, based on evidence and experience. Here\u2019s why they see art as anything but a luxury. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: You both argue that art is fundamental to human existence. How do you explain that to skeptics? Susan Magsamen: We are literally physiologically wired for the arts. Input from our senses builds connections among our brains\u2019 86 billion neurons. Engaging with art, whether as a spectator or creator, actually brings information into our bodies and profoundly impacts our biological circuitry. Art\u2019s simultaneous activation of multiple neurological and physiological systems \u2014 a unique evolutionary phenomenon \u2014 involves the entire brain, body and spirit. The next time you feel moved by your favorite song, consider that an artist\u2019s choices are changing you on a cellular level. Bianca Bosker: Many experts agree that art is both an innate human impulse and a biological predisposition that has helped our species survive. It\u2019s only a modern-day misconception that looking at art is purely philosophical or intellectual. At its core, art is a physical experience \u2014 and that applies not only to music \u2014 with its thrumming bass that you can feel \u2014 but also to painting and visual arts as well. For the past 100 years or so, society has focused on the ideas behind artwork \u2014 that the thought trumps the thing. But when you watch artists making art, it is a physical experience. It\u2019s practically athletic. Engaging with artwork in person, as two bodies in space, is crucial. Research shows that factors like an artwork\u2019s size, or how we move around it, can change how we value art. \u00a0You can think about connecting with art the way you do with people. Just as a virtual meeting with someone is different from sitting across the dinner table, it\u2019s very different to look at a tiny image of an artwork on Instagram than it is to be body to body with, for example, a huge Mark Rothko painting. There\u2019s fascinating anecdotal evidence of how artworks can act on people at a physical level. The term \u201cStendhal syndrome\u201d describes people going to pieces \u2014 struck with dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, fainting spells or crying \u2014 in front of pieces of art. Stories like how a woman in a museum in Houston stripped naked in front of a Cy Twombly\u00a0\u00a0 painting suggest that, on a physical level, art can move us to do some incredible things. Magsamen: Not all artworks are positive, of course. It\u2019s critical to consider the kinds of sensorial experiences you bring into your life because of their power to make you feel, change your mood and affect your body. CNN: Bianca, you discuss finding value in some art experiences that might be considered unpleasant. What are the benefits of work that confuses us or makes us uncomfortable? Bosker: The fact that art isn\u2019t always pleasant is often part of its power. Scientists have puzzled over this question of why, over the last many thousands of years, humans have continued to keep engaging with art, even when, as they put it, it can \u201churt our sense of beauty.\u201d One compelling explanation is that we\u2019re drawn to uncomfortable, confounding images and experiences because our brains love the prediction errors they offer, aka surprises. Some researchers think art helps us fight the reducing tendencies of our minds. Contrary to common assumptions, we do not see the world like a video camera, dispassionately recording what\u2019s around us. Instead, our brains evolved to compress reality, acting like trash compactors, and for good reason. Oversimplifying our view of the world enabled us to spot the lion jumping out to eat us. But that ability also comes with risks. As some scientists put it, vision is a hallucination. What we\u2019re seeing is a construction based on our own individual filters of expectation that preemptively sort, dismiss and prioritize all the raw data coming in, even before we get the full picture. Looking at art can yank off those filters, surprising us and knocking our brains off their well-worn pathways. The glitch that art introduces is a gift that opens us to experiencing more nuance and beauty in the world around us. Magsamen: Art that pushes us beyond our limits helps form new neural pathways that might not otherwise develop in our day-to-day. Exercising these through art can help build resilience to get us through the suffering and uncertainties of life. When you\u2019re in despair, entering a church or other grand building can evoke awe, wonder and the sense of something bigger than you. Similarly, art, music and design\u00a0\u00a0 can alter our moods, taking us outside of ourselves. Building that capacity is an evolutionary imperative. CNN: What physiological benefits do the arts bring? Magsamen: Pinning down a definition of art can make some of the research tricky, but what we know suggests that artworks have very real effects on our mental and physical well-being. Physicians around the world prescribe visits to museums, engagement with arts and encounters with beauty. Different art forms affect the brain and body in different ways. Just as when we are prescribed medications, (it\u2019s true that) types, doses and durations of art work differently for different people. Doctors, social workers and public health practitioners are beginning to understand enough to collaborate with their clients to personalize their recommendations of particular artistic endeavors in specific frequencies and amounts to effect beneficial outcomes. Like exercise and good nutrition, engaging in the arts routinely will support your health. CNN: How can people develop an art practice to get those benefits? Bosker: Everything you need to have a meaningful experience with art is right in front of you. You don\u2019t need to have studied art history or spent years going to art fairs. You need attention and curiosity. An artist gave me great advice on how to engage with a work\u2014just try to notice five things about a piece, either in the work or in how it makes you feel.\u00a0Like,\u00a0\u201cThis pink makes me want to lick it\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201cThis green won\u2019t let me look away.\u201d The other foundational advice I give is to slow down. Many museum\u00a0visitors spend more time reading the description of the art than looking at the art itself, with the median time we spend with a work of art, both the piece and the label, being\u00a0just 21 seconds. Try \u201cslow looking.\u201d And pay attention to the physical form. Examining the artist\u2019s decisions offers you a pathway into the piece and a way to engage with art on your own terms. I used to take a scorched-earth approach to visiting museums with the attitude that seeing every single thing was how I\u2019d get my money\u2019s worth. That\u2019s the visual equivalent of binging at an all-you-can-eat buffet and then wondering why you feel ill. Instead of racing between masterpieces, spend more time with art that surprises you. And look for art everywhere, observing the everyday with an art mindset to counteract the reductionist tendencies of our brains. CNN: Do we have to be \u201cgood\u201d at art to reap its benefits? Magsamen: No. The art you\u2019re making doesn\u2019t have to be good for it to be valuable for you. One study showed that doing just 45 minutes of any kind of art lowered the stress hormone cortisol by as much as 25%.\u00a0\u00a0 Other research suggests artmaking builds skills in executive function, decision-making and, if you\u2019re working with others, collaboration. Playing music builds cognitive skills and enhances learning. And just one art experience per month can extend your life by 10 years. The process, not the product, is what\u2019s important. Bosker: You do not need any sort of license to engage with art. Art is a choice. It\u2019s a decision to fight against complacency and forge a life that\u2019s richer, more uncomfortable, more mind-blowing, more uncertain and ultimately, more beautiful.

{"id": "2023_06_08_health_pets-air-quality-wildfire-smoke-safety-wellness-climate", "text": "More than 100 fires are burning across Canada, with some wildfires forcing evacuations and affecting air quality in Canada and the northern tier of the United States \u2014 and experts have noted that pets could be at risk, too. Dr. Gabrielle Fadl of the Bond Vet Clinic in New York City told CNN last year that her practice has had a \u201csignificant influx of calls\u201d from concerned clients seeking guidance on how to protect their animals from the poor air quality outside. It also received a few calls from patients, particularly pregnant and older people, requesting to reschedule appointments. \u201cExposure to polluted air can have a profound impact on our pets\u2019 health, leading to respiratory issues, allergies, and even exacerbating existing conditions such as asthma,\u201d Fadl said. To ensure pets\u2019 well-being, Fadl advised considering the following precautions. Limit outdoor activities Reduce the time your pets spend outdoors as much as possible, especially during periods of unhealthy air quality. Doing so can help minimize their exposure to harmful pollutants and allergens, Fadl said. You also shouldn\u2019t run with your dog outdoors, said Dr. Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the department of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIf you can, just walk a little bit more slowly so you\u2019re not breathing as deeply,\u201d he added. \u201cThat can help.\u201d Avoiding strenuous activity is important for pets as well since they can\u2019t breathe as deeply as humans, said Dr. Jessica Bell, an assistant professor in the college of veterinary medicine at Washington State University. Animals also can experience difficulty breathing, asthma-like symptoms and bronchitis. If you must take pets outside, do so when air quality is best, Bell said. \u201cThat might be early in the morning before the air quality changes with settling of moisture.\u201d New York City\u2019s Emergency Management advised wiping your pet\u2019s muzzle, feet and coat with a damp cloth after being outside. Create a safe environment indoors Even pets kept indoors can be affected by the air quality outside, Bell said, so make sure you have proper ventilation in your home. Keep the windows closed to prevent outdoor pollutants, such as fine particulate matter, from entering. These particles are the tiniest, yet most dangerous, of pollutants, and have been linked to health problems such as heart disease, asthma and other respiratory illnesses. \u201cA major difference between wildfires and, for example, a fire that you might burn in a backyard bonfire is that often there are synthetic materials being burned that produce compounds that can be dangerous like hydrogen cyanide,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Kornreich, director of the Cornell Feline Health Center in Ithaca, New York. \u201cCarbon monoxide can also get into the bloodstream, and those two interfere with the delivery of oxygen to organs,\u201d Kornreich added. \u201cIn some cases, these fires can also produce chemical irritants. So the chemicals can actually trigger inflammation in the airways.\u201d Additionally, use air purifiers or filters to improve air quality inside. When keeping pets indoors, activities for them can be important, Bell said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of puzzle games that dogs and cats can do,\u201d she said. \u201cFill the puzzles (with) their treats or their dog food and hide it in the house. They have to hunt for them or have to roll them around or they knock all the kibbles out.\u201d Also ensure pets have access to clean water both indoors and outdoors so it\u2019s not tainted with smoke, Bell added. Monitor animals\u2019 symptoms Be on the lookout for any signs of respiratory distress or discomfort in your pets such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing or trouble breathing. Pay attention to any changes to their normal behavior, such as wanting to play fetch for 10 minutes instead of an hour as usual, Bell said. \u201cThat decrease in activity \u2014 we just have to pay attention to (it) and not force them to be active when their body says not to be.\u201d Indoor cats should be monitored for these same symptoms, she added. \u201cIf you notice any concerning symptoms, seek prompt veterinary care,\u201d Fadl said. Consult with a veterinarian Reach out to a trusted veterinarian for expert guidance catered to your pet\u2019s needs. Vets can also recommend appropriate preventive measures or treatments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/06/08/health/pets-air-quality-wildfire-smoke-safety-wellness-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_07_11_health_conjoined-twins-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at conjoined twins. Conjoined twins are physically connected to one another at some point on their bodies. Conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births, according to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. About 70% of conjoined twins are female. Conjoined twins are identical - they are the same sex. According to the Mayo Clinic, conjoined twins may be joined at any of these areas: chest, abdomen, spine, pelvis, trunk or head. Scientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.    The term \u201cSiamese twins\u201d originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, a set of conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. They lived to age 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them. In 1955, neurosurgeon Dr. Harold Voris of Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful procedure separating conjoined twins.  Selected Cases Lea and Tabea BlockBorn August 9, 2003, in Lemgo, Germany, to Peter and Nelly Block. They are joined at the head. On September 16, 2004, the girls are separated.
