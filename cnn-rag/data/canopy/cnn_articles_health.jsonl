{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_childhood-obesity-recommendations-uspstf", "text": "The US Preventive Services Task Force updated its final recommendations Tuesday for how primary care clinicians can best help children with a high body mass index, the measure most practitioners use to determine whether a person has obesity. The task force suggested that extensive and intensive behavioral interventions are the best way to help a child get to a healthy weight. Recent studies have shown that popular weight-loss drugs and surgical procedures are also highly successful treatments for children, and they are recommended as viable options under American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. But neither option is part of the USPSTF\u2019s latest recommendations, and along with the large number of hours the task force recommends for behavioral interventions, it has left some doctors frustrated. Several providers characterize the new recommendations as unrealistic or problematic. What the recommendations say The latest recommendations from the task force \u2013 a volunteer panel of independent medical experts \u2013 suggest that clinicians provide intensive behavioral interventions for children who are at least 6 years old with a high BMI, or refer children for such services. A high BMI for a child is defined a little differently than it is for adults, although both use height and weight to estimate mass. A BMI of 30 or higher is within the obesity range for adults, but a child is considered to have a high BMI if they fall at or above the 95th percentile for their age and sex.\u00a0That means the child\u2019s BMI is higher than that of 95% of other kids of the same age or gender, based on growth charts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Parents can use the CDC\u2019s online calculator to estimate their child\u2019s body fat percentage. The USPSTF\u2019s recommended interventions can include self-monitoring, goal-setting, supervised physical activity, instruction in healthier eating and limits on screen time. Providers can tailor these options to fit the patient and their family, the task force says, but the interventions should involve at least 26 hours in a calendar year and include supervised physical activity. According to research that the USPSTF reviewed before making its recommendations, most children who were a part of such intensive programs experienced small weight loss and reductions in BMI after six months to a year. Those who did better spent a larger number of hours with the clinician and had physical activity as a part of their program. Why the recommendations matter A high BMI in children can lead to several significant and even life-threatening health conditions including diabetes, breathing issues, bone and joint problems, liver issues, skin problems, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which itself may lead to heart diseases. Obesity can also make a child a target of bullying, affecting their emotional well-being and self-esteem. Nearly 20% of children in the US have what\u2019s considered a high BMI. The number of children with obesity has grown significantly, tripling over the past four decades, studies show. The USPSTF recommendations help primary care providers determine what preventive care works and what doesn\u2019t, and insurance companies use them to help decide what treatments to cover. The task force gives its guidelines letter grades based on the most up-to-date science. Under the Affordable Care Act, private insurers must cover preventive services that get a grade of A or B; the new child obesity recommendations got a B grade. Some doctors say guidelines are impractical Dr. Susma Vaidya, a pediatrician who runs a weight loss clinic at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, says intensive behavioral intervention is essential and important, but she thinks the recommendation of 26 hours per year \u2013 which averages out to an hour every other week \u2013 is a nearly impossible goal. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure currently to provide this intensive behavioral therapy management,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging for providers. It\u2019s challenging for parents and for kids to be able to commit to that number of hours. And we know that the amount of BMI improvement can be fairly minimal.\u201d Dr. Mona Sharifi, an associate professor of pediatrics and biostatistics at the Yale School of Medicine, worked on the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines that came out last year on helping doctors manage patients with obesity. She was happy to see that the USPSTF recommendations reiterate the strength of the evidence around intensive behavioral treatments, she said, but the group\u2019s last two sets of recommendations on this topic \u2013 issued in 2010 and 2017 \u2013 were similar, and little has changed. \u201cHere we are 15 years later from the first version of these, and still, access to this kind of treatment is abysmal \u2013 and it might even be worse, really, post-pandemic,\u201d Sharifi said. Many programs remain inaccessible for the vast majority of children and adolescents who need them most, according to an editorial published alongside the latest guidelines Tuesday in the journal JAMA. Even the past recommendations are \u201cstill not routinely implemented in clinical practice,\u201d wrote Dr. Thomas Robinson of the Stanford Solutions Science Lab and Department of Pediatrics and Dr. Sarah Armstrong, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Health at Duke University Medical School. Several highly effective pediatric programs also shut down during the pandemic and still haven\u2019t returned, Sharifi said. Some doctors are trying to resurrect these programs, she said, but \u201cin the absence of appropriate reimbursement from insurers, it\u2019s just been really difficult.\u201d Dr. Justin Ryder, a pediatric obesity researcher with Stanley Manne Children\u2019s Research Institute at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago, said that such a high benchmark as 26 hours could also mean insurers refuse to cover programs that are less intense. \u201cI\u2019ve got huge problems with these recommendations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that these recommendations really do a disservice to kids with obesity.\u201d Twenty-six hours of intervention is \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d to achieve in the clinical setting, he said. \u201cIn a primary care setting, it\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d Lack of recommendations on surgery Some doctors are also critical of the USPSTF\u2019s decision not to recommend surgery. Although procedures such as bariatric surgeries are among the options that the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests doctors consider, the task force didn\u2019t review the latest research on the matter, saying surgery is considered \u201coutside the scope of the primary care setting.\u201d \u201cBariatric surgery has 10 years of data now in adolescents,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cIt has some of the most robust and best long-term followup, as well as outcome data, in this patient population, and to not even mention it as a potential option, it\u2019s a clear miss.\u201d Lack of recommendations on medication Some of the biggest disagreements with the recommendation involve weight-loss drugs, for which the USPSTF said \u201cthe totality of the evidence was found to be inadequate.\u201d However, the task force did examine studies involving the medications liraglutide, semaglutide, orlistat, phentermine and topiramate (sold under brand names such as Saxenda, Wegovy, Alli, Lomaira and Topamax, respectively). In most trials, the medications were\u00a0associated with larger BMI reductions than with placebos. But there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to determine what effects they could have in the long term, said task force member\u00a0Dr.\u00a0John Ruiz, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Arizona. The drugs also may come with side effects like nausea, vomiting and gallstones. \u201cThere\u2019s just such a limited set of studies done that one doesn\u2019t know if those results are reliable and to whether they are generalizable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether there\u2019s any harms that have come about, particularly, in longer-term use of those medications. That would be important to know.\u201d Vaidya says the drugs have transformed her practice in Washington. \u201cI appreciate that these are children, and we are always very cautious about using medication, but these are FDA-approved medications, and sometimes, these medications facilitate a family or child\u2019s ability to adhere to the lifestyle modifications that we also recommend,\u201d she said. Vaidya said she has seen children struggle for years to get to a healthy weight through lifestyle interventions alone before they finally get \u201cunstuck\u201d with the help of weight-loss medications. \u201cI think the role of pharmacotherapy, honestly, can\u2019t be understated,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/childhood-obesity-recommendations-uspstf/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_06_19_health_microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness", "text": "Scientists have found microplastics in human penises for the first time, as concerns over the tiny particles\u2019 proliferation and potential health effects mount. Seven different kinds of microplastics were found in four out of five samples of penis tissue taken from five different men as part of a study published in IJIR: Your Sexual Medicine Journal on Wednesday. Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. They form when larger plastics break down,\u00a0either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. Some minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, and evidence is mounting that they are increasingly present in our bodies. Study lead author Ranjith Ramasamy, an expert in reproductive urology who conducted the research while working at the University of Miami, told CNN that he used a previous study that found evidence of microplastics in the human heart as a basis for his research. Ramasamy said he wasn\u2019t surprised to find microplastics in the penis, as it is a \u201cvery vascular organ,\u201d like the heart. The samples were taken from study participants who had been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction (ED) and were in the hospital to undergo surgery for penile implants to treat the condition at the University of Miami between August and September 2023. The samples were then analyzed using chemical imaging, which revealed that four of the five men had microplastics in their penile tissue. Seven different types of microplastics were detected, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) the most prevalent, according to the study.  Now their presence has been confirmed, more research is needed to investigate potential links to conditions such as ED, Ramasamy said. \u201cWe need to identify whether microplastics are linked to ED and if there is a level beyond which it causes pathology and what types of microplastics are pathologic,\u201d he said. As for the wider implications of the findings, Ramasamy said he hoped the study would \u201ccreate more awareness about the presence of foreign bodies within human organs and foster more research surrounding this topic.\u201d Prior research has found that one liter of bottled water \u2014 the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters \u2014 contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles. \u201cI think we need to be mindful about consuming water and food from plastic bottles and containers and try and limit the use until more research is done to identify levels that could cause pathology,\u201d Ramasamy said. Toxicologist Matthew J. Campen told CNN that this is \u201can interesting study that confirms the ubiquity of plastics in the body.\u201d \u201cAs we are trying to understand the potential health effects of plastics, this is another concerning paper,\u201d said Campen,\u00a0a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cPlastics are generally non-reactive with the cells and chemicals of our bodies, but they could be physically disruptive to the many processes our bodies undertake for normal function, including functions related to erection and sperm production.\u201d Campen coauthored a study published in May that found that human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas. The study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers of males who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said at the time the study was published. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d There are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to microplastics. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an official health advisory warning about a \u201cpotential disrupted access to care among individuals taking prescription stimulant medications and possible increased risks for injury and overdose.\u201d Around the same time, the US Department of Justice announced a federal health-care fraud indictment against two executives from the digital health company Done Global, whose website describes it as \u201cmaking high quality psychiatric chronic care management more accessible and affordable for patients.\u201d The indictment\u2019s effect on patients \u201cis unknown at the time,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s advisory. \u201cPatients who rely on prescription stimulant medications to treat their ADHD and have been using this or other similar subscription-based telehealth platforms could experience a disruption to their treatment and disrupted access to care,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cA disruption involving this large telehealth company could impact as many as 30,000 to 50,000 patients ages 18 years and older across all 50 U.S. states.\u201d Ruthia He, the founder and CEO of Done Global Inc., was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday and accused of participating in a scheme to distribute Adderall over the internet, conspire to commit health-care fraud and obstruct justice, according to the Justice Department\u2019s announcement. The company\u2019s clinical president, David Brody, also was arrested in San Rafael, California. The Justice Department claims that He and Brody generated more than $100 million in revenue by arranging for the prescriptions of more than 40 million pills, targeting \u201cdrug seekers\u201d and instructing prescribers to prescribe stimulants to patients even if they didn\u2019t qualify. \u201cAs alleged, these defendants exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and carry out a $100 million scheme to defraud taxpayers and provide easy access to Adderall and other stimulants for no legitimate medical purpose,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news release. \u201cThose seeking to profit from addiction by illegally distributing controlled substances over the internet should know that they cannot hide their crimes and that the Justice Department will hold them accountable.\u201d Naomi Chung, Brody\u2019s attorney, said he had pleaded not guilty to all counts. \u201cDr. Brody worked to promote access to medical treatment for those with ADHD in the face of both widespread stigma and the unprecedented challenges of a global pandemic.\u201d Efforts to reach He or the company were not successful, and CNN has not been able to determine whether He has retained a lawyer because the case docket remains under seal. The arrests mark the Justice Department\u2019s first criminal drug distribution prosecutions related to prescribing via telemedicine through a digital health company, the agency said. If convicted, He and Brody will face a maximum penalty of two decades in prison. Last year, a CDC study found that prescriptions for stimulants often used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder surged during the pandemic, especially among adults. Between 2016 and 2020, the share of the population that had filled a prescription for a stimulant drug held relatively steady. But there was a large increase in 2021, with prescription fills jumping more than 10% across most age groups. The new CDC advisory noted that there is an ongoing prescription drug shortage in the United States involving several stimulant medications commonly prescribed to treat ADHD, a brain disorder that can make it difficult to concentrate or control impulsive behavior. It\u2019s estimated that ADHD affects about 4% of adults and about 10% of children in the US. About one-third of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the diagnosis into adulthood. \u201cPatients whose care or access to prescription stimulant medications is disrupted, and who seek medication outside of the regulated healthcare system, might significantly increase their risk of overdose due to the prevalence of\u00a0counterfeit pills\u00a0in the illegal drug market that could contain unexpected substances, including\u00a0fentanyl,\u201d according to the CDC advisory. \u201cGiven the national\u00a0drug overdose crisis\u00a0and threats associated with the illegal drug market, individuals struggling to access prescription stimulant medications are urged to avoid using medication obtained from anyone other than a licensed clinician and licensed pharmacy,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cHealth officials and healthcare providers may need to assist affected patients seeking treatment for ADHD and should communicate overdose risks associated with the current illegal drug market as well as provide overdose prevention education and mental health support.\u201d The CDC advisory also warned that without treatment, ADHD is associated with social and emotional impairment and a higher risk of drug or alcohol use disorder, unintentional injuries such as motor vehicle crashes, and suicide. \u201cAs more health care needs are met through telemedicine, we will not tolerate fraud schemes that seek to recklessly exploit digital technologies,\u201d Christi Grimm, inspector general of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in the Justice Department\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect the enrollees of federal health care programs by ensuring that requirements for the appropriate, legal prescribing of stimulants and other drugs are always met, and those who choose to violate them are held accountable.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/cdc-adhd-medication-alert/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_health_men-sexual-health-wellness", "text": "Guys, let\u2019s talk man to man. We often obsess over sex and our performance, but how many take steps to ensure we\u2019re in top shape for the long haul? If we don\u2019t take care of our health today, we won\u2019t enjoy a healthy sex life tomorrow. It\u2019s crucial to think about your sexual health to avoid regrets in the future. Future-proofing yourself is key. Sexual health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Chronic stress, poor diet, lack of exercise and other lifestyle factors can significantly affect your sexual health. If you\u2019re experiencing persistent problems, don\u2019t hesitate to speak with a doctor. Early intervention can prevent minor issues from becoming significant obstacles. Seeking help is a sign of strength, and a health care professional can provide the guidance and treatment options you need for a lifetime of good sexual function. The effects of high stress Whether as a result of personal problems or trouble at work, chronic stress is a major contributor to reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. With stress, the body produces elevated levels of cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production. Studies\u00a0have shown that men with emotional problems or stress are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction in the form of either premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction and/or low sexual desire. It\u2019s crucial to incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine: regular exercise, meditation, proper sleep and hobbies that you enjoy. Seeking professional help from a therapist can also provide effective coping strategies. What you eat Poor eating habits can lead to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular issues, all of which can adversely affect sexual function. Research indicates that men with a waist circumference over 40 inches are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome, which is linked to erectile dysfunction. Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains can make a substantial difference. Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding ultraprocessed foods can further enhance your sexual health. (To put it simply, the more fast food you eat, the faster you will lose your sex life.) How you move Lack of physical activity is detrimental to heart health, which is crucial for maintaining sexual function. Regular exercise helps improve blood flow, which is essential for achieving and maintaining an erection. Studies suggest that men who exercise regularly report improved erectile function compared with inactive men. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, along with strength training exercises, to keep your body in top shape. The more you exercise at the gym, the more exercise you will get in the bedroom. If you smoke Smoking is a leading cause of erectile dysfunction due to its negative impact on blood vessels and blood flow. The toxins in cigarettes can damage the lining of blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the penis. Research shows that men who smoke are about twice\u00a0as likely to develop erectile dysfunction as nonsmokers. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your sexual health. Consider resources such as nicotine replacement therapy, support groups and counseling to help you quit. How you sleep Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, can severely affect testosterone levels and lead to sexual dysfunction. A study found that men with severe sleep apnea had significantly lower testosterone levels compared with those without the condition. Prioritizing good sleep hygiene is essential. If you suspect a sleep disorder, consult a health care provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, which may include lifestyle changes or medical interventions. Mental health issues Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety can have a profound impact on sexual desire and performance. About 20% of patients with anxiety and up to 40% of men with depression report experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction. Mental health conditions can lead to a decrease in libido and difficulties in achieving or maintaining an erection. Seeking help from mental health professionals can be highly beneficial. Therapy and medication can significantly improve both mental health and sexual function. Hormonal imbalances Hormonal imbalances, particularly low testosterone, can negatively affect sexual health. Testosterone levels naturally decline with age, but conditions such as hypogonadism can accelerate this process. Studies suggest that about 20% of men over the age of 60 have low testosterone levels. Regular checkups with a health care provider can help monitor hormone levels. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications or hormone replacement therapy to restore balance. Side effects of certain medications Certain medications, including those for hypertension and depression, can cause sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Beta-blockers, for example, can decrease libido and lead to erectile issues. It\u2019s important to discuss potential side effects with your doctor. They may adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication that has fewer effects on sexual health. Chronic illness Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease can significantly affect sexual function. Diabetic men, for instance, are three times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction compared with nondiabetic men. Managing chronic illnesses effectively with the help of a health care provider is crucial. Doing so includes following prescribed treatments, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and monitoring yourself regularly to keep conditions under control.

{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_17_health_children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness", "text": "When her daughter was 6 years old, Kelceymarie Warner began to notice her child\u2019s hesitation before bedtime. \u201cHer body would be a little more tense, and she would hyperventilate if you pushed the subject too soon, she really needed to be slowly moved into the cycle.\u201d Warner, who is a parent to four young daughters, believes that sticking to a nightly routine is the best way for her kids to have an easy transition to bedtime. But when her 6-year-old was experiencing bedtime anxiety, Warner had to make some additions to her routine. Warner is not the only one \u2014 many parents know all too well what can be a nightly struggle to get their young children to bed. A new C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health reinforces this common difficulty, revealing that 1 in 4 parents said their child has trouble getting to sleep because they are anxious or worried. Over one-third of parents reported that their child doesn\u2019t stay asleep throughout the night and often or occasionally wakes up upset or crying. \u201cFrom 1 year of age to 6 years of age, kids change a lot. The different phases that they go to are often pretty predictable: They\u2019re scared of the dark, or as kids develop and their imagination develops \u2026 now they\u2019re scared of monsters,\u201d said Sarah Clark, Mott poll co-director and a research scientist in pediatrics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt can be all sorts of things, and so often with kids, and I would argue adults too, some of those anxieties seem to come out at night.\u201d The Mott Poll was conducted in February with 781 parents who have at least one child age 1 to 6 years old. Almost half reported their child leaving their bed and moving to the parent\u2019s bed some or most nights, while 1 in 3 parents said their child often or occasionally insists that they stay in the room until the child falls asleep. But some of these habits may be causing more trouble than the temporary relief they provide, Clark said. While a child may feel safe knowing the parent is in the room, they could later wake up and not be able to go back to sleep on their own, she added. How to help an anxious child with bedtime Warner said her child\u2019s bedtime anxiety may have been caused by the major changes that happened when her youngest daughter was in the neonatal intensive care unit for three months. \u201cMy husband and I were gone for extended periods during the day and even during the night because we wanted to be with a new baby who was born three months early \u2014 but we also needed to be there with our other children. I think she really struggled with a major change in her routine, and it just kind of triggered this very difficult time for her especially.\u201d Warner began incorporating activities into her daughter\u2019s bedtime routine that would promote relaxation and reassurance, such as drinking herbal tea after bathtime, reading a story together and saying nightly affirmations like \u201cI am loved\u201d and \u201cI am important.\u201d The new routine took longer than usual, sometimes up to an hour, but now, a little over a year later, her daughter is able to go through some parts of the routine on her own, and is able to better self-soothe, Warner said. She had posted her advice for other parents that may be facing a similar scenario\u00a0on her TikTok\u00a0account in 2023. The most important factor in getting kids to bed is consistency and sticking with a bedtime routine, Mott Poll co-director Clark said. Ninety percent of polled parents reported having an established and consistent bedtime routine. But some 27% described getting their child to bed was difficult, and those parents were more likely to not have a bedtime routine, stay in the room until the child fell asleep and keep the television or a video on. \u201cWe know that young children really resonate with consistency and routine, and getting ready for bed helps their body and their brain know that this is the time to start winding down,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Hartstein, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. She studies sleep and circadian health in early childhood and was not involved in the Mott poll. Hartstein recommends limiting media use at night, especially avoiding exciting content that could stimulate the child\u2019s brain and make it harder to wind down. A\u00a0January 2022 study\u00a0that Hartstein led found that children around this age group were more sensitive to light at night than adults are, and it could interfere with a child\u2019s production of natural melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Parents could find it beneficial to dim the lights an hour before bed, which would trigger a mental cue that it\u2019s time to get ready to sleep soon, she added. As for staying in the child\u2019s bedroom until they fall asleep, Clark recommends leaving the room and returning to check in every few minutes, which lets the child know that someone will be making sure they are safe every so often, but not staying in the room indefinitely. It\u2019s common for young children to experience sleep issues, especially as preschool-age children begin to reduce or drop naptime, Hartstein said. If parents are especially worried or see their child struggling during the day because they are sleepy, they should talk with their pediatrician, she added. Giving melatonin to young children The poll also found 1 in 5 parents often or sometimes give their child melatonin before bedtime, which came as a surprise given the younger age range of 1 to 6 years old, Clark said. \u201cClearly, this is something that people are feeling the need to try with younger kids. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a signal of how disruptive sleep problems can be for the whole family.\u201d It isn\u2019t recommended to give melatonin to children younger than age of 3, since many sleep issues with children that age are behavioral, according to\u00a0Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0If a parent is considering giving melatonin to their child, they should speak with their pediatrician first, Hartstein said. \u201c(One) concern is that what you\u2019re teaching them is that if they can\u2019t sleep, they should just take a medication, at a time when they should really be developing these healthy sleep habits that will carry them through childhood,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_health_summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness", "text": "Welcome to summer in the Northern Hemisphere, with all its fun in the sun \u2013 and little critters who want to take a bite out of you. Mosquitoes and ticks can transmit vector-borne illnesses, and they are showing up with greater frequency. What can people do to protect themselves while still enjoying all that the summer months have to offer? And what treatments are available if you or your loved ones get bit? To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN:\u00a0Let\u2019s start by talking about tick-borne diseases, specifically Lyme disease. What is Lyme, and why is this something people should pay attention to? Dr.\u00a0Leana Wen:\u00a0In the United States,\u00a0Lyme disease is the\u00a0most common vector-borne disease\u00a0and is transmitted by ticks. People who contract Lyme disease may experience temporary symptoms similar to the flu, such as muscle aches, fever and headache. They also may develop a rash and have joint pain. The concern with Lyme is that some untreated patients progress to having long-term symptoms. These can be severe and debilitating and include ongoing nerve pain, facial paralysis and abnormal heart function. CNN: When is peak season for Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0We are in peak season now. In areas where the disease is prevalent such as the eastern United States, people can be bitten by blacklegged ticks that carry Lyme disease from spring into fall, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, there were reports that Lyme diagnoses\u00a0peaked\u00a0just before the Fourth of July holiday. CNN: Has the incidence of Lyme disease increased in recent years? Wen:\u00a0Yes. The rates of Lyme diagnoses have\u00a0doubled\u00a0from 2004 to 2018, with an increase in geographic prevalence, meaning that more areas have a high incidence of this disease compared to before.\u00a0(Newer data show an even more dramatic increase, though\u00a0surveillance methodology\u00a0has improved to capture more diagnoses.)\u00a0There are a variety of theories as to why this is the case. Most are centered on the influence of climate change \u2014 for example, that warmer temperatures expanded the tick habitat and perhaps also sped up tick life cycles. This is the same with other vector-borne diseases, like those carried by mosquitoes, which are also on the rise\u00a0likely due to rising temperatures. CNN: What can people do to reduce their odds of contracting Lyme disease? Wen:\u00a0The most important step is to prevent tick bites. If you are in an area known to have Lyme, you should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when hiking. Use insect repellent that contains the ingredient DEET. After the activity, examine carefully for ticks. If you have young children and pets, take the time to examine them as well. If you find a tick, remove it, save it for identification purposes in a small jar and contact your primary care provider.\u00a0Early antibiotic therapy\u00a0can prevent you from developing Lyme disease. Also, if you end up developing symptoms, get tested right away. Antibiotic treatment can reduce the progression to chronic symptoms. CNN:\u00a0What about mosquitoes? What diseases can they carry? Wen:\u00a0Mosquitoes can transmit a lot of diseases to humans including the West Nile virus,\u00a0dengue\u00a0and malaria. West Nile\u00a0is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. While most people with the illness do not become ill, around 1 in 150 infected people develop a serious illness that can be fatal. In 2023,\u00a047 states\u00a0reported West Nile cases. In total, there were 2,406 reported instances in the US. Dengue is another virus transmitted by mosquitoes. Outbreaks are common globally, and occasionally there are cases reported in the US. Most of these cases\u00a0occur in travelers, but the types of mosquitoes that can spread dengue are found throughout many parts of the US. That means local transmission is possible. In recent years, transmission of dengue by people who have no travel history has happened in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. Another infection transmitted by mosquito that is far more common in other parts of the world is malaria. If untreated, symptoms can become severe and\u00a0progress\u00a0to kidney failure, seizures, coma and death. While most US cases involve travelers who contracted malaria from other parts of the world, locally transmitted cases have occurred, too. Last year, there were such cases reported in Florida, Texas and Maryland. CNN: You\u2019ve mentioned the US cases of malaria. What should people do who are traveling to other countries known to have these and other mosquito-borne illnesses? Wen:\u00a0I advise that people consult the\u00a0CDC\u2019s comprehensive guide, which includes recommendations for each destination country, and make an appointment with your primary care physician or travel medical clinic. Depending on where you are going, your planned activities and your personal medical history, you may be recommended to have additional vaccines or prophylactic medications. For instance, if you are going somewhere with a concern for yellow fever, you may need to get that vaccine. If you are traveling to areas with high rates of malaria, you may be recommended to start antimalarial medicines. CNN: What can everyone do to reduce their chance of getting bitten by mosquitoes? Wen:\u00a0Everyone should keep two key steps in mind. The first is to reduce bites. You can do this by covering arms and legs with clothes when possible. Clothing treated with the insecticide permethrin can provide an added layer of protection. You can also use insect repellent. Make sure to\u00a0use repellents\u00a0that are registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency. These will contain active ingredients like DEET and are safe, even for children and pregnant women. The second key step is source control \u2014 meaning to reduce the mosquitoes near you. During peak mosquito season, in the summer and early fall, use screens on windows and doors to reduce the mosquitoes in your home. In addition, it\u2019s crucial to look for standing water in your garden, as these are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Check for items around your home that could hold water \u2014 such as buckets, trash containers, tires and toys\u2014 and empty and wash them at least once a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/health/summer-lyme-ticks-mosquitos-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

Despite living in the light-filled streets of central London, my smartphone camera picked up a green haze and a pulsing sheet of purple and pink light. Capturing the moment was an unforgettable experience and one that I had thought would involve expensive travel to the northernmost reaches of our planet. The storms that create spectacular auroras such as those I witnessed originate from the sun\u2019s dynamic magnetic field, an astrophysical enigma that scientists this week came closer to unraveling. Solar update Figuring out how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works will help scientists improve the forecasting of space weather, which dazzles night sky watchers but can disrupt GPS and communication satellites. The sun\u2019s looping magnetic field lines, which form a tangled web of structures more complex than those on Earth, are difficult to study directly. To grasp what\u2019s going on, scientists create mathematical models. A new model, which took more than a decade to develop and required a NASA supercomputer to conduct the detailed calculations, found that the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated much closer to the surface than previously thought. The team believes its model is more accurate because it accounts for a unique solar feature. A long time ago A single gold earring found in the ruins of a 2,000-year-old building in the Pyrenees is a clue to how a devastating fire may have started. The inferno consumed the wooden structure, situated in an Iron Age settlement called Tossal de Baltarga, and killed six animals penned in a stable. Archaeologists believe the fire was deliberate. Had it been accidental, the building\u2019s owners likely would have released the livestock and returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden gold, which was concealed in a jar. The arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic, according to the new study. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but the excavation uncovered telling details of the lives of an Iberian people called the Cerretani. Sky watch The builders of Stonehenge placed the huge stones that make up the prehistoric monument in line with sunrise and sunset on the longest and shortest days of the year, revealing an intimate understanding of the sun that\u2019s still palpable today. But does the 4,500-year-old site in southwest England \u2014 and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world \u2014 also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge has a lunar link first gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored \u2014 until now. This summer, archaeologists are using the lunar standstill, a little-known phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years, to investigate. Across the universe Space scientists have observed the edge of a black hole \u2014 an area known as the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 for the first time. Andrew Mummery, lead author of a new study on black holes and a research fellow at the University of Oxford, compared it to \u201cthe edge of a waterfall\u201d at the end of a river, where orbiting material from nearby stars plummets into the abyss. In the plunging region, matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead hurtles into the black hole. But unlike at the black hole\u2019s event horizon, or surface, light can still escape at this point. The study\u2019s findings, which Albert Einstein predicted, could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes.

One corvid species may even be capable of something researchers refer to as \u201cmental time travel.\u201d This type of recollection enables the mind to recall a seemingly unimportant bit of information that you didn\u2019t consciously commit to memory \u2014 for instance, remembering what you had for lunch yesterday. Researchers working with Eurasian jays trained to find food hidden under cups said these birds may be capable of the feat of memory. In the experiment, which involved decorated cups, the jays were able to remember what a particular cup looked like, even after the cups were rearranged and a time delay. And in other corvid news, crows can count up to four, the latest research has found.

It\u2019s no longer able to provide abortions, but it changed its focus and stayed open. \u201cI was willing to make whatever sacrifices needed to be made to keep our head above water, just keep the doors open and the lights on, and be able to provide care to these people who desperately need our help,\u201d said clinic administrator Kathy Kleinfeld. It\u2019s one example of the shift to the the country\u2019s abortion landscape since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision ended the federal right to abortion two years ago. Since then, 14 states have near-total bans on abortion. Clinics can no longer provide abortions in more than a quarter of US states. Although the total number of facilities that provide abortions in the United States hasn\u2019t changed that much \u2013 only a couple dozen clinics have closed completely \u2013 the number of closures doesn\u2019t always capture the upheaval. States that enacted abortion bans generally had few clinics to start with. Since Dobbs, some packed up and moved to places where they can still provide care, but may require patients to travel further. Still other clinics remain open, but in a different capacity. Kleinfeld\u2019s clinic in Houston pivoted to broader reproductive health, including pre- and post-abortion care for those who travel out of state or self-manage their abortions. In the months before the Supreme Courts\u2019 Dobbs decision, there were about 3,000 abortions a month in Houston and Kleinfeld said she knew that need wouldn\u2019t stop once Texas\u2019 trigger law banned abortions. \u201cThere were a lot of different ways it could have gone; most of all would have involved closing,\u201d Kleinfeld said of her clinic in Houston. \u201cThat was just not something I was willing to do.\u201d Few clinics to start with In 2021, there were about 750 abortion clinics in the United States, according to data from the University of California San Francisco\u2019s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.\u00a0Less than a tenth \u2013 only about 60 of them \u2013 were in the 14 states that have since banned abortion. \u201cThe reason that banned states did not have many facilities to begin with is that they were hostile to abortion and put up barriers to providing abortion services even before Dobbs,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College. Her research focuses on the US abortion landscape, and she has been tracking travel distances to abortion facilities. These states were more likely to have regulations like mandatory waiting periods and parental involvement that created challenges for people seeking abortions, as well as logistical hurdles for providers, such as those in Texas. \u201cThis is basic economic theory,\u201d Myers said. Strict regulatory environments created high costs to entry for providers, leaving space for only the few that could effectively scale their services up enough to survive, she said. The Dobbs decision wasn\u2019t the first time abortion clinics in Texas confronted their fate. About half of the abortion clinics there closed in 2013 when the state legislature passed a law that required them to meet hospital-like standards. The US Supreme Court overturned those restrictions, but dozens of doors closed remained shuttered. \u201cHaving lived through that, I knew all the other clinics \u2013 the very few that were left \u2013 I knew they were going to close\u201d after the Dobbs decision, Kleinfeld said. By 2023, the total number of facilities providing abortions in the US was down to about 725, the UCSF data shows. But each clinic closure has a ripple of negative effects, experts say, especially in regions where services have already been suppressed. \u201cWe need every single abortion clinic in this country. There really aren\u2019t enough for the number of people who need care,\u201d said Nikki Madsen, executive director at Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion care providers and other stakeholders. \u201cWhen we treat abortion in an isolated way, we miss the broader cost of closing a clinic.\u201d About two-thirds of the clinics in states with bans have stayed open in some capacity, the UCSF data shows. Clinics often provide other reproductive health-care services and are sometimes the only touchpoint that people have with the health-care system. \u201cIndependent clinics have always been based in their communities. They really understand the communities where they\u2019re located and the people that they serve in those communities,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cSo over this time, the clinics have been really working to figure out how they can continue to serve the same communities that they were serving pre-Dobbs in an increasingly hostile environment.\u201d Clinics move to the front lines While some clinics have held their ground with a shift in focus, a handful of others have relocated into key access states or opened new locations. \u201cProviders are going to locations that place them as close as possible to the places where people are coming out of banned states in search of abortion,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThey are primarily locating in places that put them on the front lines to receive patients, very strategically in southern Illinois, in New Mexico, in Virginia.\u201d The number of abortion clinics in New Mexico more than doubled post-Dobbs, rising from five in 2021 to 11 in 2023, according to the UCSF data. And the number of abortion providers in Illinois grew from 27 to 36 in that time frame. Among the new additions is CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, which relocated its abortion clinic from Memphis, where abortion is banned, about 200 miles north to Carbondale, a small city in southern Illinois. It still has a location in Tennessee that offers other services including birth control consultations and STI testing. Red River Women\u2019s Clinic had a much less distant \u2013 but no less significant \u2013 move. It popped just a couple miles away from its original location in Fargo, North Dakota, over the border into Minnesota. \u201cWe were the only abortion clinic in North Dakota for over 20 years,\u201d said Tammi Kromenaker, the clinic director. \u201cWe knew that if we didn\u2019t do something, those patients who already drive three, four, five hours one way just to get to our clinic would face even bigger hurdles.\u201d Kromenaker says she had been exploring options to move the clinic out of North Dakota years before the Dobbs decision as a conservative state legislature threatened the clinic\u2019s work, but options felt out of reach, mainly because they were too expensive. But when the Dobbs decision leaked a month before it was handed down, the need to act instantly outweighed those concerns. \u201cIt just was just this thing, like, \u2018we just have to do this. We have to, no matter the obstacles,\u2019\u201d Kromenaker said, and she was thankful for a fundraising campaign that buoyed the clinic in that leap. Struggle for solid financial footing As clinics weigh their options in a post-Dobbs world, finances are the greatest determining factor. \u201cIt costs money to close the clinic. It costs money to reopen the clinic. If patients have never gone to you for prenatal care before, it\u2019s going to take time to develop a patient population who comes to you for prenatal care,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cAll of these shifts really require community support and financial support from the community to continue to keep these clinics open.\u201d And constant changes to the abortion landscape in the US exacerbate clinics\u2019 struggle for solid footing. \u201cI would have expected to see providers open in North Florida and North Carolina, which were both geographically important destinations after Dobbs, except for the fact that both states are fairly hostile to abortion,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe future there was so uncertain, and I think it was too risky to open.\u201d Before Dobbs, a 100-mile increase in distance to the nearest clinic could prevent about 1 in 5 people who wanted an abortion from being able to reach a facility to get one, her research shows. Travel distance to abortion clinics continues to be a critical barrier to access, but a surge in virtual clinics has helped fill some of that gap. In the last few months of 2023, about 1 in 5 abortions in the US were telehealth abortions, where medication abortions pills were mailed to a patient after a remote consultation with a clinician, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning. By December, nearly a tenth of all abortions in the US \u2013 about 8,000 a month \u2013 were telehealth abortions provided under shield laws, which allow providers in some states where abortion remains legal to prescribe medication abortion drugs via telehealth to people living in states with bans or restrictions. \u201cSome people have resources to travel, but the pressure on brick-and-mortar clinics continues to build,\u201d said Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project. \u201cNow, patients can get their medications sooner because they don\u2019t have to wait for a spot to open up in a clinic or find a way to get there. It\u2019s vital.\u201d A Supreme Court ruling last week maintained broad access to medication abortion, but other ongoing legal challenges and ballot measures that will be on the table in a few states during this year\u2019s election leave policies and planning very much in flux. Although Red River has moved all of its staff and services to the Minnesota, Kromenaker has kept the address in Fargo to maintain standing in ongoing legal battles with the state. \u201cIt would have been easy to just walk away and say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to sell this building. We\u2019re done with North Dakota. We\u2019re out,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe have fought so long and so hard, we just didn\u2019t want to give up. We\u2019re just one little clinic, but downtown Fargo is still, technically, our corporate address so that we can maintain that standing in North Dakota and continue to fight for those patients we\u2019ve served for \u2026 26 years in July.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/abortion-clinics-in-banned-states-pivot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_older-americans-healthcare-affordability-kff-partner-wellness", "text": "What weighs most heavily on older adults\u2019 minds when it comes to health care? The cost of services and therapies, and their ability to pay. \u201cIt\u2019s on our minds a whole lot because of our age and because everything keeps getting more expensive,\u201d said Connie Colyer, 68, of Pleasureville, Kentucky. She\u2019s a retired forklift operator who has lung disease and high blood pressure. Her husband, James, 70, drives a dump truck and has a potentially dangerous irregular heart rhythm. Tens of millions of seniors are similarly anxious about being able to afford health care because of its expense and rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. A new wave of research highlights the reach of these anxieties. When the University of Michigan\u2019s National Poll on Healthy Aging asked people 50 and older about 26 health-related issues, their top three areas of concern had to do with costs: of medical care in general, of long-term care, and of prescription drugs. More than half of 3,300 people surveyed in February and March reported being \u201cvery concerned\u201d about these issues. In fact, five of the top 10 issues identified as very concerning were cost-related. Beyond the top three, people cited the cost of health insurance and Medicare (52%), and the cost of dental care (45%). Financial scams and fraud came in fourth place (53% very concerned). Of much less concern were issues that receive considerable attention, including social isolation, obesity and age discrimination. In an election year, \u201cour poll sends a very clear message that older adults are worried about the cost of health care and will be looking to candidates to discuss what they have done or plan to do to contain those costs,\u201d said John Ayanian, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation. Health care costs are impacting wallets Older adults have good reason to worry. One in 10 seniors (about 6 million people) have incomes below the federal poverty level. About one in four rely exclusively on Social Security payments, which average $1,913 a month per person. Even though inflation has moderated since its 2022 peak, prices haven\u2019t come down, putting a strain on seniors living on fixed incomes. Meanwhile, traditional Medicare doesn\u2019t cover several services that millions of older adults need, such as dental care, vision care or help at home from aides. While private Medicare Advantage plans offer some coverage for these services, benefits are frequently limited. All of this contributes to a health care affordability squeeze for older adults. Recently published research from the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s 2023 Health Care Affordability Survey found that nearly a third of people 65 or older reported difficulty paying for health care expenses, including premiums for Medicare, medications, and expenses associated with receiving medical services. One in seven older adults reported spending a quarter or more of their average monthly budget on health care; 44% spent between 10% and 24%. Seventeen percent said they or a family member had forgone needed care in the past year for financial reasons. The Colyers in Pleasureville are among them. Both need new dentures and eyeglasses, but they can\u2019t afford to pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket, Connie said. \u201cAs the cost of living rises for basic necessities, it\u2019s more difficult for lower-income and middle-income Medicare beneficiaries to afford the health care they need,\u201d said Gretchen Jacobson, vice president of the Medicare program at the Commonwealth Fund. Similarly, \u201cwhen health care costs rise, it\u2019s more difficult to afford basic necessities.\u201d This is especially worrisome because older adults are more prone to illness and disability than younger adults, resulting in a greater need for care and higher expenses. In 2022, seniors on Medicare spent $7,000 on medical services, compared with $4,900 for people without Medicare. Not included in this figure is the cost of assisted living or long-term stays in nursing homes, which Medicare also doesn\u2019t cover. According to Genworth\u2019s latest survey, the median annual cost of a semiprivate room in a nursing home was $104,000 in 2023, while assisted living came to $64,200, and a week\u2019s worth of services from home-health aides averaged $75,500. Many older adults simply can\u2019t afford to pay for these long-term care options or other major medical expenses out-of-pocket. \u201cSeventeen million older adults have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Program on Medicare Policy for KFF. (That\u2019s $30,120 for a single-person household in 2024; $40,880 for a two-person household.) \u201cFor people living on that income, the risk of a major expense is very scary.\u201d Planning for the future is challenging How to deal with unanticipated expenses in the future is a question that haunts Connie Colyer. Her monthly premiums for Medicare Parts B and D, and a Medigap supplemental policy come to nearly $468, or 42% of her $1,121 monthly income from Social Security. With a home mortgage of $523 a month, and more than $150 in monthly copayments for her inhalers and her husband\u2019s heart medications, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t make it if my husband wasn\u2019t still working,\u201d she told me. (James\u2019 monthly Social Security payment is $1,378. His premiums are similar to Connie\u2019s and his income fluctuates based on the weather. In the first five months of this year, it approached $10,000, Connie told me.) The couple makes too much to qualify for programs that help older adults afford Medicare out-of-pocket costs. As many as 6 million people are eligible but not enrolled in these Medicare Savings Programs. Those with very low incomes may also qualify for dual coverage by Medicaid and Medicare or other types of assistance with household costs, such as food stamps. Older adults can check their eligibility for these and other programs by contacting their local Area Agency on Agency, State Health Insurance Assistance Program or benefits enrollment center. Enter your ZIP code at the Eldercare Locator and these and other organizations helping seniors locally will come up. Persuading older adults to step forward and ask for help often isn\u2019t easy. Angela Zeek, health and government benefits manager at Legal Aid of the Bluegrass in Kentucky, said many seniors in her area don\u2019t want to be considered poor or unable to pay their bills, a blow to their pride. \u201cWhat we try to say is, \u2018You\u2019ve worked hard all your life, you\u2019ve paid your taxes. You\u2019ve given back to this government so there\u2019s nothing wrong with the government helping you out a bit.\u2019\u201d And the unfortunate truth is there\u2019s very little, if any, help available for seniors who aren\u2019t poor but have modest financial resources. While the need for new dental, vision and long-term care benefits for older adults is widely acknowledged, \u201cthe question is always how to pay for it,\u201d said Neuman of KFF. This will become an even bigger issue in the coming years because of the burgeoning aging population. There is some relief on the horizon, however: Assistance with Medicare drug costs is available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, although many older adults don\u2019t realize it yet. The act allows Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs for the first time. This year, out-of-pocket costs for medications will be limited to a maximum $3,800 for most beneficiaries. Next year, a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket drug costs will take effect. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing people who\u2019ve had very high drug costs in the past save thousands of dollars this year,\u201d said Frederic Riccardi, president of the Medicare Rights Center. \u201cAnd next year, it\u2019s going to get even better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/older-americans-healthcare-affordability-kff-partner-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_health_dengue-paris-olympics", "text": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of\u00a0The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. In September 2023, several people came down with\u00a0dengue\u00a0fever in Paris, France. The presence of this mosquito-borne disease was notable for two reasons. It was the most northerly outbreak ever recorded, and none of the people had travelled recently. This demonstrated it is now possible for dengue to be transmitted locally in northern Europe. These facts are important in 2024 because of the Olympics. France waits in anticipation of more than\u00a010 million\u00a0athletes, spectators, officials and tourists descending on the city for the event. The French government knows there is a risk of dengue. In Paris,\u00a0hundreds of sites\u00a0are being regularly checked for the presence of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes. Will this be enough? The concept of the\u00a0super-spreader\u00a0in infection epidemiology is not new. In essence, it means that a small fraction of a population, maybe just one person, is responsible for most of the cases. A famous historical super-spreader was\u00a0\u201ctyphoid Mary\u201d. Mary Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid who may have infected over 100 people. READ MORE: Dengue: Brazilian single-dose vaccine could help turn tide in the fight against fever A study published in the journal\u00a0Nature\u00a0suggests that about 15% of people were responsible for 85% of cases of COVID in Hunan Province, China. In terms of dengue,\u00a0one analysis from Peru\u00a0of super-spreading suggests 8% of human-occupied spaces are responsible for over half of cases. (It should be noted that dengue cannot be caught directly from another human, only from the bite of a dengue-carrying mosquito.) This is not the first time the Olympics has been identified as a risk factor for viral epidemics. The 2016 Olympics in Brazil\u00a0were almost postponed\u00a0because of fears about Zika - another virus transmitted by the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquito. READ MORE: More dengue fever and less malaria \u2013 mosquito control strategies may need to shift as Africa heats up In the end, any worries were put to bed, because there were\u00a0no reported cases. Fear about COVID spreading via the Tokyo Olympics brought about drastic measures to limit transmission. At that event, few infections occurred inside the Olympic bubble, but there was an\u00a0increase in cases\u00a0among the general population. So what is different about Paris? Aedes\u00a0has spread considerably further than in 2016, and the number of dengue cases worldwide has increased dramatically in the same period. In 2016 there were 5.2 million cases reported worldwide. Halfway through 2024, there have already been\u00a07.6 million cases. READ MORE: Viruses can change your scent to make you more attractive to mosquitoes, new research in mice finds Visitors from more than 200 countries are expected in France for the Olympics. Many of those countries are already experiencing dengue this year. For the Paris Olympics to become a\u00a0super-spreader event, several factors must overlap. There needs to be enough mosquitoes, enough susceptible\u00a0and\u00a0already-infected people, enough time and enough mosquito bites. Perfectly adapted The tiger mosquito is perfectly adapted to the urban Paris environment. It needs just the smallest amount of water in a small container to lay its eggs. It preferentially feeds on humans, at dawn and dusk. The eggs themselves can withstand dry conditions for months. Once wet again, the eggs will hatch. READ MORE: Dengue in France: tropical diseases in Europe may not be that rare for much longer What makes this situation potentially dangerous for Paris is that some of these mosquitoes may have dengue already inside them,\u00a0passed down from their mother. This could significantly reduce the number of bites needed to start an epidemic. Within the time frame of the Olympics, an infected athlete or spectator could be bitten once by a mosquito and seed an epidemic in a week or so. Each female mosquito can lay up to 200 eggs at a time. Most dengue cases are asymptomatic. People infected before or during the Olympics may have no idea they are carrying the virus. They might take the virus back home and seed an epidemic there without ever knowing it. Whether people get sick or not, they are carrying the virus and can transmit the infection onwards if they get bitten by an\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquito. At the Rio Carnival this year, a dengue outbreak just days before the event led to a\u00a0public health emergency being called, but the event wasn\u2019t cancelled. There will be no public health emergency in Paris because the event itself is the risk factor. Anyone living, working, visiting, competing, volunteering or even just passing through Paris during the Olympic period is going to be part of a huge\u00a0natural experiment\u00a0\u2013 whether they know it or not.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/health/dengue-paris-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_bird-flu-risk-opinion-frieden", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, is president and chief executive of\u00a0Resolve to Save Lives\u00a0and senior fellow for global health at the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations. The United States\u2019 response to H5N1 \u2013 \u201cbird flu\u201d \u2013 has taken too long, showing how risky gaps in coordination and trust can be. With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters in cattle herds from Michigan to Texas, Idaho to North Carolina, it\u2019s clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right. We\u2019ve seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Although the challenge was smaller because of it size, Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, among a half dozen outbreaks that never made headlines, is featured in our new\u00a0Epidemics That Didn\u2019t Happen\u00a0report. The U.S. has done a lot, including scaling up test production, evaluating vaccines, tracking wastewater for related viruses, and providing information about efforts. Finland did three things particularly well; all are relevant to the U.S. response to the virus. Rapid response.\u00a0Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was known to be circulating among birds in Finland, just at the virus has been circulating among birds in the U.S. for the past two years. Human and animal health specialists worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk workers on farms with infected animals. In the United States, H5N1 has been spreading among cattle since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn\u2019t know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The\u00a07-1-7 target for outbreak detection\u00a0and response should be our guiding principle: seven days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, one day to notify public health authorities, and seven days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland\u2019s response met this target. In the U.S., instead of 7 days, the time from emergence of H5N1 in cattle to detection was more like 100 days, and it\u2019s not clear we\u2019ve met the 7-day target for initial response even months into the outbreak. Doing so requires communication and public health measures in the affected communities and an effective coordination mechanism. We must improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health. Trust.\u00a0Farmers already had a high level of trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs, and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals.\u00a0Farmers were immediately reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust of the government in the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland\u2019s\u00a0next move: vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so. Trust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are on the front line of these outbreaks.\u00a0In May, the US Department of Agriculture announced\u00a0payments to farms\u00a0to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including\u00a0covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1,\u00a0compensating farms that\u00a0supply personal protective equipment to their workers, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies.\u00a0We may need to do more to protect our nation\u2019s agricultural sector. Coordinated government response.\u00a0Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. The joint response strengthened detection, collaboration of industry groups, and protection of workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure it had the authority to implement effective control measures. In the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. There are multiple agencies involved: USDA monitors cattle health, US Food and Drug Administration monitors milk safety and the CDC monitors diseases in humans, including from animal exposure. Coordination seems to be improving, but any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country\u2019s size and diversity. We have a lot to learn, and no time to lose.\u00a0First, localities,\u00a0states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies \u2013 including CDC, USDA, FDA \u2013 and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public.\u00a0Second,\u00a0Congress needs to provide resources to prevent and respond to pandemic risks, including for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we\u2019re prepared to stop new events before they become epidemics. Third and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing their questions and concerns. If one country responds to H5N1 well, that\u2019s not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country \u2013 including the United States \u2013 needs an effective response.

There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That\u2019s a death rate of 0.0005%.

Risk of death by taking Viagra \u2014 used to treat erectile dysfunction \u2014 is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA. \u201c[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIts safety is very well established.\u201d Weighing medication abortion against the alternatives Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion. \u201cIt reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,\u201d she said. It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications \u2014 like hemorrhages or infections \u2014 for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a\u00a02015 study\u00a0conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications. The likelihood of\u00a0serious complications via procedural abortion\u00a0\u2014 performed second-trimester or later \u2014 is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And\u00a0childbirth\u00a0by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%. Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said. In a\u00a0study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol. Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen. \u201cIt\u2019s clear people can use these medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, at home even without the help of a medical professional very safely,\u201d said Aiken. Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it\u2019s readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN in April. However, a lesser-effective method means more people will likely have unsuccessful abortions. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that it might not work for some people, and it will prolong their abortions,\u201d said Upadhyay. \u201cThen by the time they get back to the clinic, they\u2019re seeking abortion later in pregnancy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/health/abortion-pill-safety-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and the (levels of xylitol) went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d as the xylitol levels did, said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products. The February 2023 erythritol in study found the risk of heart attack and stroke nearly doubled within three years when people had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood. For the new study on xylitol, the results were basically the same \u2014 people with the highest levels of xylitol compared to those with the lowest levels had nearly twice the risk of heart attack, stroke and death, Hazen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a receptor on our platelets, which we as yet don\u2019t understand, that is recognizing this molecule and signaling to the platelet to be more prone to clot,\u201d he said. \u201cOur tastebuds can\u2019t tell the difference in the structures between sugar and these other sweeteners, but clearly our platelets can.\u201d The World Health Organization warned consumers in 2023 to avoid artificial sweeteners for weight loss, and has called for additional research on the long-term toxicity of low- and no-calorie sweeteners, the study said. \u201cThrough their work, the investigators have shined a light on the safety of sugar substitutes. There is more to learn,\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s Tomey said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is worth remembering that sugar substitutes are no substitute for a sincere commitment to the several elements of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_health_sedentary-tv-aging-wellness", "text": "Swapping out time in front of the TV for physical activity might not sound like the most fun trade, but it is associated with significantly better chances of healthy aging, according to a new study. \u201cOur take-home message is that replacing TV time with light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and sleep (for participants with inadequate sleep) is beneficial to healthy aging,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Molin Wang, associate professor of medicine in the department of epidemiology at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The results are not surprising, as many studies show that sedentary behaviors have significant impacts on health, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Freeman was not involved in this study. For this study, researchers analyzed data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study of more than 45,000 people age 50 or older in 1992 who were also free of chronic disease, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Researchers followed up for 20 years for information on people\u2019s time sitting at work, home and watching television and their hours standing or walking at home and work. That data was analyzed with data on their aging. Healthy aging was defined as living to at least 70 years old and maintaining at least four healthy domains \u2014 such as no major chronic disease and no impairment in subjective memory, physical health and mental health, the study said. Each additional two hours of sitting to watch TV was associated with a 12% decrease in the chances of aging in a healthy way, the study showed. On the other hand, adding two hours of light physical activity at work added a 6% increase in the odds of healthy aging. Replacing one hour of sitting to watch TV with light physical activity at home or work was associated with better chances of healthy aging, the study showed. \u201cVegging out in front of the television, seems to always be associated with worse outcomes,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cOf course, it makes physiologic sense that human beings were never meant to sit in front of a screen all day long.\u201d \u201cThe more we sit, the more problems we get, particularly as we get older,\u201d he added. Why is sitting so bad? A 2017 study showed a relationship between time spent sitting and early death from any cause. And sedentary time as a kid may increase the risk of heart disease later in life, according to 2023 research. The problem is particularly bad when eating a very large amount of salt, which is typical in an American diet, without getting enough movement to circulate fluid, he added. These often unhealthy habits go together. \u201cWhen people sit in front of TV, it usually brings all these other comorbid activities, like eating junk food, TV dinners, failing to connect with others, and it even can interrupt sleep,\u201d Freeman said. Time spent seated at a desk or on the living room couch also takes away opportunities to get out and be active. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on all that physical activity, which is truly an unbelievable way to reduce cardiovascular risk and blood pressure,\u201d Freeman said. How to kick out the sedentary behavior If you work eight, 10 or even 12 hours a day in an office, it might feel difficult to get more movement into your day. \u201cMy very strong suggestion is you should consider at work getting a standing desk if you can, or even a treadmill desk if you\u2019re able and you have the space,\u201d Freeman said. If that is not a possibility, things like getting up often or having walking meetings can help, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting down for more than 30 minutes at a time, in my book, that\u2019s probably too long, and you really want to try to move a little bit,\u201d Freeman added. You don\u2019t have to outlaw sitting or watching TV, however. Maybe try pairing TV with healthy behaviors such as watching while moving or eating a nutritious snack, he said. Or better yet, set limits for yourself. \u201cThere are all these great tools and apps available \u2026 and a lot of people see those as tools for kids, but the truth is, they\u2019re just as good as for adults,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIt lets you keep track of how much screen time you have and then how much activity you have all on the same device, which is kind of neat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/health/sedentary-tv-aging-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_03_25_health_mifepristone-abortion-pill-explained", "text": "Mifepristone can continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit with a doctor after the US Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit that challenged regulation of the abortion pill. Mifepristone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration decades ago and has been shown to be safe and effective. Anti-abortion advocates have claimed that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn\u2019t study it enough to approve it. A lawsuit was brought by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations alleged that the FDA violated the law in\u00a0how it regulated mifepristone. If a 5th\u00a0Circuit ruling had been upheld, it could have ended availability of mifepristone for medication abortion via telehealth, which would have affected abortion access \u2014 even in states where it\u2019s legal. The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. The court\u2019s reasoning could still allow other mifepristone challenges in the future. How mifepristone works Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery. Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it\u2019s sometimes known as RU-486. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period. This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show. How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country\u2019s most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, that signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the FDA. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone\u2019s safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show. Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra \u2013 used to treat erectile dysfunction \u2013 is nearly 10 times higher. Side effects of mifepristone Mifepristone usually doesn\u2019t have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA. Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are \u201cexceedingly rare,\u201d happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations\u2019 amicus brief. How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, shows that this option has become steadily more common over the two decades it\u2019s been available, rising from less than 10% of all abortions in the US in 2001 to 53% in 2020 and 63% in 2023. Misoprostol on its own No matter the status of mifepristone,\u00a0misoprostol would still be available\u00a0and could be used for a medication abortion on its own. The only use of misoprostol that\u2019s approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it \u201coff-label\u201d by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor. Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a \u201creasonable\u201d option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective. This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization. People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, previously told CNN. \u201cMisoprostol still works very well and is very safe,\u201d Wong said. \u201cMifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.\u201d CNN\u2019s Devan Cole and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/25/health/mifepristone-abortion-pill-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_low-back-pain-walking-wellness", "text": "Low back pain affects at least 619 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to increase to 843 million people by 2050, according to research estimates. Unfortunately, nearly 70% of people who recover from an episode of low back pain have a recurrence within a year, experts say. In addition to acute physical discomfort and lost time at work, treatment often requires education, physical therapy and exercises such as Pilates that may require fees or specialized equipment. Yet there is an easy, free way to prevent low back pain, at least for a while, according to a new randomized clinical trial. People in the study who walked regularly after having at least one episode of low back pain were pain free nearly twice as long as those who did not. \u201cThe intervention group had fewer occurrences of activity-limiting pain compared to the control group, and a longer average period before they had a recurrence, with a median of 208 days compared to 112 days,\u201d said senior author Mark Hancock, a professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University in Sydney. \u201cWalking is a low-cost, widely accessible and simple exercise that almost anyone can engage in, regardless of geographic location, age or socio-economic status,\u201d Hancock said in a statement. Walking for at least 30 minutes The study, published Wednesday in The Lancet journal, followed 701 Australian adults, mostly women in their 50s, who had recently recovered from an episode of low back pain that derailed their ability to perform daily activities. Each person was randomly assigned to a control group with no intervention or an individualized walking and educational program. Those in the intervention group were asked to build up to 30 minutes of walking five times a week over a six-month period at speeds adjusted for age, physical capacity and individual preferences. Jogging was also allowed. \u201cAfter three months, most of the people who took part were walking three to five days a week for an average of 130 minutes in total,\u201d Hancock told CNN via email. Participants were asked to wear pedometers to track their daily steps and keep a walking diary. At three months into the program, they also wore an accelerometer that objectively measured daily step count and the amount of brisk walking or other physical activity. The program also provided six physiotherapist-guided education sessions over six months, a more cost-effective model than typical treatment, Hancock said. \u201cWe included 3 standard sessions with a physiotherapist and 3 brief phone catch ups,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn the few previous studies of prevention exercise programs for back pain the intervention included approximately 20 group classes. \u201cWe also discussed simple strategies to reduce the risk of a recurrence of low back pain and instructions on how to self-manage any minor recurrences. The education was embedded in the same sessions as the walking prescription.\u201d Cost-effective intervention In addition to providing participants with longer pain-free periods, the walking program reduced the amount of time taken off work and medical visits by half, said lead study author\u00a0Natasha Pocovi, a postdoctoral fellow at Macquarie. \u201cThe exercise-based interventions to prevent back pain that have been explored previously are typically group-based and need close clinical supervision and expensive equipment, so they are much less accessible to the majority of patients,\u201d Pocovi said in a statement. \u201cOur study has shown that this effective and accessible means of exercise has the potential to be successfully implemented at a much larger scale than other forms of exercise.\u201d Due to the structure of the study, it was not possible to determine how much of the benefit was due to walking or the educational program provided by physiotherapists, Hancock said. \u201cWe believe it is likely the two components complement each other, with education helping to overcome avoidance and fear of movement, while the health coaching and walking program resulted in behavior change,\u201d he said. However, because the intervention appeared to be behavioral coaching, and not actual physical therapy, the act of walking may indeed have been the key reason for improvement, said A. Lynn Millar, a retired physical therapist\u00a0and former professor at Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was not involved in the study. \u201cThis is important, as many studies have shown that pain response is partially a behavioral response,\u201d Millar said in an email. \u201cThe coaching was limited in duration, thus they can suggest that the primary intervention of walking was the major contributor to the long term response.\u201d What walking does for the body What is it about walking that is so helpful for lower back pain? For one, exercise is good for every part of the body. \u201cFirst, the person is sitting less, and sitting is not the best posture for the back,\u201d Millar said. \u201cSecond, walking will improve general circulation,\u00a0and will improve blood circulation to the\u00a0muscles of the back that\u00a0are\u00a0actively supporting the individual during the motion. Movement of a joint also helps circulate the\u00a0joint fluids,\u00a0thus the\u00a0joints of the\u00a0spine may be benefiting from the motion.\u201d Walking improves metabolism and the amount of calories burned, experts say. Lower weight can ease the load on the back and legs, ensuring better spinal health. Taking a brisk stroll also improves the strength of core muscles around the spine and in the legs, all of which can improve posture and provide better support to the spine. Walking also increases muscle endurance, assuring muscles are less susceptible to fatigue and injury. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking increase bone density, protecting against injury while stimulating the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good hormones that reduce pain and stress. When starting a walking program, good shoes and arch supports are necessary,\u00a0and potential problems may be offset by exercise programs such as resistance training and stretching, Millar said. \u201cI also think it is important to have varied paces and distances throughout the week. Some problems are caused by progressing too rapidly, and not paying attention to initial\u00a0aches,\u201d she said. \u201cI also used to see people that were walking in shoes that did not have good support, or they had become so worn, the support was gone,\u201d she added. If your \u201cback goes out\u201d during walking, activity modification such as cycling or swimming may be necessary, Millar said.\u00a0 Taking a day or two off from walking and doing some back exercises and stretching can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/low-back-pain-walking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}

The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks\u2019 gestation, which is \u201c70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,\u201d according to the US Food and Drug Administration. In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.  Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. \u201cSome people do this because they cannot access a clinic \u2014 particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion \u2014 or because they have a preference for self-care,\u201d said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman\u2019s health. What happens in a medication abortion What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.  CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences? Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation. An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there\u2019s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo. The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes. Then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.  A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration. Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.  In fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled. The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.  CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion? Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed. Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.  Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription. Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator,  helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That\u2019s something people could get without a prescription. Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we\u2019re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we\u2019ve been doing more research on people\u2019s experiences with medication abortion, it\u2019s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.  CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise? Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It\u2019s rare, happening in about 2 out of every 100 pregnancies \u2014 and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion. People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization. If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill. Anyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful. People with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates.  CNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion? Grossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever \u2014 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider. Heavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well. One of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it\u2019s wise to be on the lookout. We usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends. Most people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream.  If someone still feels pregnant, isn\u2019t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician. People should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_crows-can-count-study-scn", "text": "Perhaps \u201cbirdbrained\u201d isn\u2019t such an insult after all \u2013\u2013 crows, the ubiquitous urban bird, can vocally count up to four, the latest research has found. Not only can the inquisitive creatures count, but they can match the number of calls they make when shown a numeral, according to a new study, led by a team of researchers with the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2019s animal physiology lab in Germany. The way the birds recognize and react to numbers is similar to a process we humans use, both to learn to count as toddlers and quickly recognize how many objects we\u2019re looking at. The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, deepen our growing understanding of crow intelligence. \u201cHumans do not have a monopoly on skills such as numerical thinking, abstraction, tool manufacture, and planning ahead,\u201d said animal cognition expert Heather Williams via email. \u201cNo one should be surprised that crows are \u2018smart.\u2019\u201d Williams, a professor of biology at Williams College in Massachusetts, was not involved in the study. In the animal kingdom, counting isn\u2019t limited to crows. Chimpanzees have been taught to count in numerical order and understand the value of numerals, much like young children. In attempting to woo mates, some male frogs count the number of calls from competing males to match or even one-up that number when it\u2019s their turn to croak at a female. Scientists have even theorized that ants retrace their paths back to their colonies by counting their steps, though the method isn\u2019t always accurate. What this latest study showed is that crows, like young humans, can learn to associate numerals with values \u2013\u2013 and count out loud accordingly. Can crows count much like toddlers do? The research was inspired by toddlers learning to count, said lead study author Diana Liao, a neurobiologist and senior researcher at the T\u00fcbingen lab. Toddlers use the words of numbers to tally the number of objects in front of them: If they see three toys in front of them, their counting could sound like \u201cone, two, three\u201d or \u201cone, one, one.\u201d Maybe crows could do the same, Liao thought. She was inspired, too, by a June 2005 study on chickadees tailoring their alarm calls to a predator\u2019s size. The larger a predator\u2019s wingspan or body length, the fewer \u201cdee\u201d sounds the chickadees used in their alarm call, the study found. The opposite was true for smaller predators \u2013\u2013 the songbirds would use more \u201cdee\u201d sounds if they encountered a smaller bird, which could be greater threats to chickadees since they are more agile, Liao said. The authors of the chickadee study couldn\u2019t confirm whether the small songbirds had control over the number of sounds they made or if the number of sounds were an involuntary response. But the possibility piqued Liao\u2019s curiosity \u2013\u2013 could crows, whose intelligence has been well-documented over decades of research, show control over their ability to produce a certain number of sounds, effectively \u201ccounting\u201d like toddlers do? The crows planned their number of caws Liao and her colleagues trained three carrion crows, a European species closely related to the American crow, over more than 160 sessions. During the trainings, the birds had to learn associations between a series of visual and auditory cues from 1 to 4 and produce the corresponding number of caws. In the example researchers provided, a visual cue might look like a bright blue numeral, and its corresponding audio could be the half-second song of a drumroll. The crows were expected to perform the same number of caws as the number represented by the cue \u2013\u2013 three caws for the cue with the numeral 3 \u2013\u2013 within 10 seconds of seeing and hearing the cue. When the birds had stopped counting and cawing, they would peck at an \u201center\u201d key on the touchscreen that presented their cues to confirm that they were done. If the birds had counted correctly, they\u2019d receive a treat. It appeared that as the cues continued, the crows took longer to react to each cue. Their reaction times grew as \u201cmore vocalizations were impending,\u201d Liao wrote, suggesting that the crows planned the number of caws they were going to make before they opened their beaks. The researchers could even tell how many calls the birds planned to make by the way their first call sounded \u2013\u2013 subtle acoustic differences that showed that the crows knew how many numbers they were looking at and had synthesized the information. \u201cThey understand abstract numbers \u2026 and then plan ahead as they match their behavior to match that number,\u201d Williams said. Even the mistakes the crows made were somewhat advanced: If the crows had cawed one too many times, stuttered over the same number or submitted their responses with their beak prematurely, Liao and her researchers could detect from the sound of the first call where they went wrong. These are the \u201csame kinds of errors humans make,\u201d Williams said. We\u2019re still learning how smart crows are Birds and many other animals were previously thought to make only on-the-spot decisions based on stimuli in their immediate environments, a theory popularized by the 20th century animal behaviorist B.F. Skinner. But the latest research by Liao and her colleagues provides more evidence about crows\u2019 ability to synthesize numbers to produce a sound and suggests that the skill is within their control. The study team\u2019s findings are highly specific but still significant \u2013\u2013 they challenge the once common belief that all animals are merely stimulus-response machines, said Kevin McGowan, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, who has spent more than two decades studying wild crows in their habitats. McGowan wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study, McGowan told CNN, demonstrated that \u201ccrows aren\u2019t just simple nonthinking machines out there reacting to their environment \u2013\u2013 they\u2019re actually thinking ahead and have the ability to communicate in a structured, preplanned way. It\u2019s sort of a necessary precursor for having a language.\u201d Crow intelligence has been studied for decades. Scientists have investigated New Caledonian crows creating their own compound tools to access food. The birds appear to establish rules, according to a November 2013 study coauthored by the University of T\u00fcbingen lab\u2019s lead researcher, Andreas Nieder. Crow language has confounded scientists for decades, too, with its widely varying tones and expressions, McGowan said. The study by Liao and her colleagues isn\u2019t even the first to consider whether crows can count. That research began with Nicholas Thompson in 1968, animal cognition expert Irene Pepperberg noted. A research professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Pepperberg is best known for her work with an African grey parrot named Alex. Thompson hypothesized that crows could count based on their caws, the duration and number of which the birds appeared to control in a given burst of sound. The crows\u2019 counting abilities \u201cseem to exceed the demands which survival makes for such abilities,\u201d he wrote. Another University of T\u00fcbingen study on crows\u2019 counting abilities from September 2015 trained the birds to recognize groupings of dots and recorded the activity of neurons in the part of the crows\u2019 brains that receives and makes sense of visual stimuli. The researchers found that the crows\u2019 neurons \u201cignore the dots\u2019 size, shape and arrangement and only extract their number,\u201d the university said in a statement at the time. \u201cSo, crows\u2019 brains can represent different quantities, and crows can quickly learn to match Arabic numerals to those quantities \u2013\u2013 something humans usually explicitly teach their children,\u201d Williams said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/crows-can-count-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_health_eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness", "text": "While holidays are often marked by parties, shared meals, gift-giving and special outfits, experts say there\u2019s health benefits to remembering the meaning behind the celebration. The three-day holiday of Eid-al-Adha commemorates the story in the Quran of God appearing to Ibrahim, or Abraham, in a dream and commanding him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. The holiday, which starts on Sunday this year, is determined by the lunar calendar, and Saudi Arabia announces the dates according to its time zone. Muslims believe that as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, an angel of God stopped him and gave him a ram to sacrifice in place of his son. A version of the story also appears in both Christian and Jewish scriptures. Many people kick off the holiday by calling and texting Muslims they know throughout the world with \u201cEid Mubarak,\u201d which means blessed feast or festival. Families typically attend a special morning prayer at the local mosque and then gather with loved ones to feast over a holiday meal and exchange money or gifts. Others may make a obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca \u2014 the Hajj pilgrimage \u2014 to visit the holiest sites in Islam, including the mountainous region where Abraham\u2019s feted act took place. Muslims also honor Abraham\u2019s sacrifice with udhiya or qurbani \u2014 sacrificing a cow, sheep or goat and then sharing the meat with friends and family and offering it to those in need. Many people also send donations to or place qurbani orders in Muslim countries to feed disadvantaged people. These traditions are reminders that letting go, having faith and doing good deeds will be rewarded, said Dr. Yasmine Saad, a clinical psychologist and author in New York City. This message and the pious and social acts of Eid, such as celebrating with friends and family and spreading acts of charity exemplify mindfulness and can be helpful when implemented regularly. \u201cEid is a reminder that we should strive to add more of this balance in our day-to-day,\u201d said Dr. Rania Awaad, clinical professor of psychiatry and director of the Stanford Muslim Mental Health & Islamic Psychology lab. Here are some mindful takeaways from the Eid holiday that you can include in your routine \u2013 no matter what you believe in. At its core, mindfulness is staying in the present, focusing on one\u2019s thoughts, feelings and surroundings without judgment. The practice of mindfulness carries multiple health and wellness benefits such as decreasing pain, reducing stress and easing feelings of depression. Stay hopeful and look for silver linings The story of Abraham is not easily transferable to everyday life as it was an example of an extreme hurdle, but the lesson of pushing through a hardship and carrying on with resilience is relatable.\u00a0 \u201cIslam really develops this notion of faithfulness and patience in the face of a trial,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Reynolds, professor of Islamic Studies and Theology at University of Notre Dame. In Islamic spirituality, this mindset \u201cbecomes a real important way for Muslims to carry on through trials, suffering, oppression, evil that they suffer in life.\u201d Reynolds describes this mindset as a \u201csustaining force\u201d for Muslims. And it\u2019s not limited to Islam \u2014 anyone can reflect on one\u2019s current circumstances and look for positivity as a way to get through the hard parts. Do your part and trust the process During Abraham\u2019s challenging ordeal, his wife was also being tested. According to Islamic narrative, she was left alone in the desert in present-day Mecca with their son so that Abraham could follow God\u2019s command. In this story, the baby was in desperate need of nourishment, so the mother ran between two hills seven times to try to procure water for the baby. Eventually water \u2014 of which the well has become the source of holy water for Muslims \u2014 sprung up from the ground where the baby\u2019s feet lay. It sounds like a miraculous happening, but when applied to daily life, one can view it as doing one\u2019s work and trusting that things fall into place. Abraham\u2019s wife did her part by trying her best to search for nourishment for her child. Feeding others \u2018feeds the soul\u2019 Muslims commemorate the day with the sacrifice of an animal, and they take it a step further by making a meal of it for their own families and for people less fortunate. In this way they venerate Abraham while underscoring sharing and giving. At the root of qurbani is creating a shared experience while giving to others. \u201cA lot of people are feeling purposeless, and they feel that what they do in their life doesn\u2019t hit home,\u201d Saad said. \u201cGiving to others, giving to poor (people), sharing, making an impact in other people\u2019s lives always feeds the soul.\u201d You can make cooking for others, volunteering at a soup kitchen and donating your money, time or goods a regular \u2014 but impactful \u2014 part of your routine. Giving can \u201crealign people so their mind will be different, they will think more positive thoughts, their bodies will feel better, they will have a smile on their face,\u201d Saad said. By stepping out of one\u2019s routine and giving to others, it can help make \u201cyou feel you have an impact, you help, you have significance.\u201d This sense of purpose and meaning contributes to living a happier and longer life, according to an expert. In a larger sense, kindness contributes to one\u2019s sense of community and belonging, and donating to others has proven to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health, according to studies. It takes a village Humans are inherently social creatures, and loneliness and social isolationa are not good for one\u2019s brain, body or spirit, according to research. Even the size of a person\u2019s social network can impact health. Smaller networks are linked to larger feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can impact disease and death rates. Further, more positive experiences in social relationships is generally linked to better coping and lower stress. Because Eid is celebrated over a period of three days, the holiday emphasizes socializing and connecting with others for longer than just an afternoon or a day. These kinds of \u201csocial ceremonies\u201d can be helpful, said Dr. David Spiegel, psychiatrist and director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford Medicine. People have survived because \u201cwe\u2019ve formed communities, and support one another, and protect one another,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a community act that gives you a sense of doing something and doing something together with other people does help people to manage stress better.\u201d Connecting with one\u2019s community and expanding that circle, or even in smaller ways such as making time for a friend can be healthy. Fill your cup While going on the Hajj pilgrimage might be spiritually fulfilling for some Muslims, it may not be practical for everyone to take that journey. But creating space that brings in any sort of fulfillment can usher in new, exciting energy. Whether it\u2019s reading a good book or going on a yoga retreat for example, it can be something you do for your growth and gratification. Even a hike can do it for some, Awaad explained. \u201cIt could be something that just fills your cup to where you\u2019re able to then ground yourself and be much more attuned to the people around you and to the work that you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/health/eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_fauci-memoir-gupta-interview", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards wear you down.\u201d That phrase, instilled in Dr. Anthony Fauci when he was a student at the Jesuit-run Regis High School in New York City, might as well be the motto of his professional life. Even though he chose a career centered in science, medicine and public health, controversy has always had a way of finding him, even as he tried to make it constructive. Fauci chronicles many such moments in his new memoir, \u201cOn Call: A Doctor\u2019s Journey in Public Service.\u201d Fauci was in the public eye for decades as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, but he became a veritable household name at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was charged with monitoring and mitigating the spread of the virus. Fauci spoke frequently to the worried and bewildered American public at government news conferences, giving status updates and offering guidance on face masks, social distancing, school closures, hospitalization rates and, eventually, vaccines. Many credit him with helping the country navigate the uncharted waters of the coronavirus crisis with his medical expertise, calm demeanor and signature Brooklyn-tinged gravelly voice. At the same time, Fauci was navigating his own political headwinds \u2013 some from his boss, former President Donald Trump, who tried to play down the threat of SARS-CoV-2 even as he initiated Operation Warp Speed, the $10 billion-plus public-private partnership focused on rapidly developing vaccines as well as therapeutics. Speaking to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Fauci described how \u201cpainful\u201d it was at one point to correct Trump about hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19 during a news conference early in the pandemic, a move that upset some of the President\u2019s aides. But Trump\u2019s attention was elsewhere, Fauci said: When he called the doctor to his office, the President surprised him by talking about how many people were watching the news conferences. As the pandemic continued, many coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and antivaxxers blamed Fauci personally for struggles with school closures, mask mandates and vaccine recommendations. Even now, Fauci recently testified, he still faces death threats. The pandemic was not the first time Fauci found himself in the center of a political and medical maelstrom. He was in the hot seat during the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s, when his agency spearheaded the effort to fight the widening epidemic. HIV/AIDS activists called him and the entire medical establishment out for not doing enough or moving quickly enough to help people infected with the virus. Yet throughout his career, Fauci seems to have taken public criticism in stride and used it, even, to build something better. It was an attitude he learned in childhood. \u201cThe Jesuit priests, when you thought that all of a sudden the whole world was pounding on you, they would say \u2018Illegitimi non carborundum,\u2019 which means \u2018don\u2019t let the bastards wear you down,\u2019 which \u2026 lately, that is a very relevant and appropriate saying,\u201d Fauci told Gupta. \u201cThey don\u2019t get me down to the point of interfering with what my work is, but it does wear and tear on you,\u201d he added. Fauci recently sat down for a conversation with Gupta \u2014 one of the many they have shared over the years \u2014 to discuss his life\u2019s work and his legacy. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. (Listen to more of the conversation on the podcast \u201cChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\u201d here.) Dr. Sanjay Gupta: You talk about this interesting press briefing that you did. This is in March of 2020.\u00a0And you had to correct the record, even if the President was talking. How challenging is that? Dr. Anthony Fauci: I said to myself, \u201cI have a responsibility to preserve my own personal integrity and a responsibility to the American public.\u201d\u00a0\u2026 So when I walked up to the podium, I said, \u201cHere it goes!\u201d That was painful to me, to have to do that, but there was no doubt that I had to do it. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cWell, maybe you should, and maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d There was no doubt that I had to do it, because I would actually be just relinquishing my responsibility. And what happened is that the President was less upset about that than the people around him, who really got upset. But then he called me in his office once when he wanted to ask me another question, and he was looking at three different televisions, and he says, \u201cMy God, these ratings are amazing. They\u2019re better than cable; they\u2019re better than network.\u201d The President \u2014 it\u2019s no secret. I\u2019m not divulging a secret about the President \u2014 he was very, very fixated on image and ratings. And he thought that the amount of attention that was given to the press briefings was really terrific. And his comment was, \u201cWow, do you see those ratings?\u201d And my feeling was, \u201cThe ratings are in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d Gupta: I want to talk about the 54 years of public service \u2014 almost 40 years, as you say, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Go back to June 5, 1981. That was a date you really talked a lot about in the book. What\u2019s the significance of that? Fauci: I was in my office in the clinical center at the NIH, and I read the June 5 [issue of the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which described five cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among five gay men in LA] and I looked at it and I said, \u201cGosh, what a curiosity. This is strange that they\u2019re all gay men.\u201d But maybe there was talk about using poppers or drugs to enhance your sexual experience that maybe somehow had the collateral effect of suppressing their immune system. But it bothered me. Boy, you really have got to suppress the immune system a lot to get pneumocystis [a serious lung infection caused by a common fungus]. \u2026 So I put it aside, saying \u201cit\u2019s probably a fluke, and it\u2019s just going to disappear.\u201d The real transforming thing came one month later, in July of 1981, when the second MMWR came; this time, 26 \u2014 curiously \u2014 all young, otherwise healthy gay men, not only from L.A. but from San Francisco and New York City, who presented not only with pneumocystis but with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and multiple other opportunistic infections. I can say \u2014 retrospectively, when you try to evaluate the different landmarks in your life, in your career \u2014 reading that MMWR totally transformed my professional career because I made the decision right there, even though I had a very successful career up to that point \u2026 I said, \u201cthis is a brand new disease. \u00a0And even though I don\u2019t know what it is, there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s an infection. \u2026 And it seems to be destroying the immune system.\u201d And here I am: boards in internal medicine, boards in infectious diseases, boards in clinical immunology. I said, \u201cIf there\u2019s one disease that I have to study, is this disease.\u201d Gupta: I don\u2019t think many people who sort of know you from Covid realize that in many ways, you went through some of these same challenges before with HIV/AIDS. Not just new disease, trying to find new therapeutics, but the activists. What was that part of your life like? Fauci: Well, naturally, people ask about the difference or similarity between the pushing back against me and the government in HIV and pushing back against the government and me as the face of Covid. \u2026 It is as different as peanuts and watermelons. It just is very different because the [HIV/AIDS] activists were trying to get the attention of the authorities, the scientific authorities and the regulatory authorities, that the time-proven way of approaching the development of interventions for a new disease doesn\u2019t work well for a disease that\u2019s rapidly killing themselves and their friends and their loved ones. So they wanted a seat at the table. \u2026 So their confrontation to us was based on a good thing. I think back to John Lewis\u2019 \u201cgood trouble\u201d versus bad trouble. They made good trouble for us because they wanted us to just put ourselves in their shoes. \u2026 Again, one of the best things I did in my career was to, instead of running away from them the way most of the scientific community did \u2026 I said to myself, \u201cThis can\u2019t work, so let me put aside the theatrics and the disruption and listen to what they have to say.\u201d And what they had to say made absolutely perfect sense to me. And I said to myself, \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I would be doing exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d That\u2019s when I invited them in to sit down with us and said \u201clet\u2019s start talking.\u201d \u2026 It became such that they became an important part of the community scientific effort to address HIV with therapeutics, with prevention, with regulation, to the point now where they\u2019re on all of our advisory committees. They\u2019re part of the discussion. And quite frankly, many of them turned out to be some of my closest friends. Gupta: But just to punctuate this point, though, at that time, going back 40 years, did you feel that way, the way you\u2019re describing it now? I mean, this idea that, \u201cHey, look, there might be something to be gained from these confrontations\u201d? Fauci: The thing that drove me was empathy, which has been something that has driven my motivation about medicine and about anything that I\u2019ve done, that goes back to my family, that I describe in the book: my parents and my training in the Jesuit schools. There\u2019s empathy for people who are in trouble and people who are suffering. When you combine empathy with listening to them \u2014 just forget the screaming and the yelling. Just listen to what they\u2019re saying. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, it just made perfect sense to me. So my interaction and my response to them, as I often get asked, is dramatically different than someone, on the basis of no evidence, accuses you of killing people or that scene of Marjorie Taylor Greene at the hearing. I mean, come on. That is nothing like what the [HIV] activists were doing. Gupta: What do you want your legacy to be? How do you want people to reflect on Dr. Anthony Fauci? Fauci: I\u2019ve thought about that, and when I think about legacies \u2014 I really, honestly mean this \u2014 I will leave that to other people to decide. I know what I\u2019ve done \u2026 with the development of drugs for HIV, with the development of the vaccine for Covid. I know that, but that\u2019s not [for me to] say, \u201cI want my legacy to be this,\u201d because people are going to have different interpretations of that \u2026 But what I would want my legacy to be, something that I am certain of, is that I have given it 100% every single day. And in the sports analogy, I can say I always left it on the field or left it on the court \u2026 I never held back. I just gave everything I could for the discipline I\u2019m in, which is science, medicine and public health. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like my legacy to be.

{"id": "2024_06_17_media_surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label", "text": "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the threat social media poses to children requires urgent action, and he demanded Congress to put a label on the apps as it does with cigarettes and alcohol. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in the New York Times Monday. Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, \u201cnearly universal.\u201d But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps \u2014 that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill. \u201cI put forward this call for a warning because I think it\u2019s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,\u201d Murthy told CNN. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in America over the past several decades. Congress has long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Murthy argued that it\u2019s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children\u2019s use of social media. \u201cUntil that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future\u2026 parents deserve to be warned. That\u2019s where the label comes in,\u201d Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media as soon as possible. \u201cI think this is an urgent issue.\u201d An escalating battle Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. But Monday\u2019s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. In May 2023, Murthy issued an advisory that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use, saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I\u2019m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,\u201d Murthy told CNN in May 2023. \u201cFor too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cChasing Life\u201d podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta in June 2023, Murthy outlined some steps parents can take to rein in their children\u2019s social media usage, including partnering with other parents to make sure kids lack the \u201cI\u2019m the only one without social media\u201d excuse. More action needed A warning label, if Congress passes legislation requiring one, would be insufficient to fix the problem, Murthy acknowledged. He suggested schools become phone-free environments for children, as should dinner time and other family events. And Murthy urged parents to restrict children\u2019s use of social media until they graduate from middle school. Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would prohibit children under 14 from obtaining their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would ban social media from using algorithms in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18. \u201cThis is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,\u201d Murthy wrote in the New York Times. On Monday, Murthy confirmed to CNN that alcohol and cigarettes are currently the only two products with surgeon general warning labels but that the overall health risk of social media is \u201cjust as profound.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mental health and wellbeing of kids,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_metformin-preconception-pregnancy-birth-defects-risks", "text": "Some studies have raised concerns about a potential link between the widely used type 2 diabetes drug metformin and an increased risk of conceiving a baby with birth defects. But new research now suggests that the use of the medication among men planning to conceive or women in early pregnancy does not appear to be linked with an increased risk of major birth defects for their children. The two studies, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, contradict a 2022 study that linked metformin use by men in the three months before they conceived a baby to a 40% increased risk of birth defects in their offspring. The findings provide \u201cassurance\u201d for parents, said Dr. Ran Rotem, an author of the new study on the paternal use of metformin and a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cConventionally and traditionally, the mother has been the focus when it comes to pregnancy and when it comes to fetal health and the health of the newborn. What we are increasingly finding is that the father is also important,\u201d he said. He added that the increased risk of birth defects seen in previous research could be associated with the disease of diabetes or with related comorbidities, and not so much the medication itself. \u201cWhen we think about a medication, we also have to think about the underlying conditions in which the medication is usually prescribed,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cWe know that diabetes itself is tricky when it comes to both fertility and potential complications in pregnancy and in newborns.\u201d Metformin is a first-line medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and has been widely used to help control blood sugar levels since the 1960s. The medication is now the most commonly prescribed oral drug for type 2 diabetes, and, before taking metformin, people are recommended to tell their doctor if they plan to become pregnant, are pregnant or are breastfeeding. \u2018Health of the father seems to be important\u2019 For the study on paternal use of metformin, researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Kahn-Sagol-Maccabi Research and Innovation Center of Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel analyzed data from birth records and medical records on nearly 400,000 babies born in Israel between 1999 and 2020. They compared that data with information on the babies\u2019 fathers, such as their ages, laboratory test results and medication records, including data on metformin prescriptions. Although the researchers didn\u2019t specifically look at how long the men had been on the medication, \u201cwe did have many people who have been on the medication for a long time, and the results were pretty consistent for those individuals, too,\u201d Rotem said. The researchers found that the prevalence of major birth defects was 4.7% in children of fathers not exposed to diabetes medications in the months leading up to conception, compared with 6.2% in children of fathers exposed to metformin before conceiving. When the researchers adjusted their data for factors such as the fathers\u2019 other underlying health conditions and whether the mother also had diabetes or related comorbidities, they found no increased risk of major birth defects in children exposed to paternal metformin. Men who used diabetes medications during the sperm developmental period, leading up to conceiving, tended to be older in age, had a higher prevalence of underlying health conditions and were more likely to have fertility problems and a history of smoking compared with fathers not exposed to diabetes medications. \u201cWe find that paternal use of metformin in the sperm development period is not associated with excess risk of malformation in newborns, proving assurance that fathers planning to start a family can continue using the drug to control their diabetes,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cMore broadly, our study also suggests that maintaining a good cardiometabolic health profile is important for both partners.\u201d A higher prevalence of underlying health conditions as well as fertility problems was also seen among the mothers of children whose fathers used metformin, compared with the mothers of children with no paternal diabetes medication exposures. \u201cIf the father is on diabetes medication, the mother is much more likely to be on diabetes medication too or have other metabolic comorbidities,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cWe know that diabetes itself is not good when it is in the mother, and we are finding evidence that it\u2019s also tricky for the fathers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can manage diabetes with just changing your lifestyle \u2013 doing more exercise, watching your diet \u2013 that\u2019s probably good, and that\u2019s helpful anyways. But if you have to be medicated, it seems like metformin is a safe choice for both.\u201d The data also showed that risk of a birth defect was higher when the father used metformin along with other medications, described as a polytherapy. Paternal use of metformin alone, known as monotherapy, did not appear to increase the risk for birth defects. \u201cWhen we examined specific treatment regimens, modestly elevated excess risks were still observed, specifically among children of fathers who used metformin in tandem with some other diabetes medication,\u201d Rotem said. \u201cBut we also observed that fathers who took multiple medications had more poorly controlled diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis again indicates that the modestly elevated risk seen for diabetes polytherapies was likely not caused by the medications themselves, but rather by the worse cardiometabolic health profile of the fathers.\u201d \u2018Poor blood sugar control is a risk factor\u2019 The other study that was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine had somewhat similar findings for mothers. Women who continued using metformin\u00a0and added insulin as a treatment\u00a0in their first trimester of pregnancy\u00a0showed little to no increased risk of giving birth to a baby with major birth defects compared with women who discontinued metformin and switched to insulin, according to the study. The researchers, also from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studied data on more than 12,000 women with type 2 diabetes and their pregnancies. The data came from the US Medicaid health care administration\u2019s database from 2000 to 2018. The analysis showed that the estimated risk for giving birth to a baby with birth defects was about 6% when the mother received insulin plus metformin,\u00a0versus\u00a08% when the mother received insulin alone. \u201cWe were not surprised by our findings. Although metformin may cross the placenta, potentially affecting the fetus, metformin can help with blood sugar control which may lower the risk of birth defects,\u201d Dr. Yu-Han Chiu,\u00a0the lead\u00a0author of the study and a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u00a0and Penn State College of Medicine,\u00a0said in an email. \u201cPoor blood sugar control is a risk factor for birth defects. Insulin in combination with metformin may result in better\u00a0blood sugar\u00a0control than using insulin alone. This may explain why we\u00a0observed a slightly lower risk of\u00a0live birth with congenital malformations when comparing with using insulin alone,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cFor women with type 2 diabetes and currently taking metformin and planning to conceive, our study suggests continuing metformin had no or little increased risk for birth defects compared to switching to insulin.\u201d A \u2018complex picture\u2019 The two new studies are \u201cwell done,\u201d Dr. Meleen Chuang, medical director of women\u2019s health at the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, said in an email. \u201cI would not change the way metformin is prescribed for parents trying to conceive,\u201d said Chuang, who was not involved in the new studies and serves as ob-gyn chief of service for NYU Langone Brooklyn. \u201cI would encourage weight loss, diet, exercise as a part of their preconception care for both parents,\u201d she added. \u201cReducing modifiable risk factors such as decreasing weight, smoking, alcohol, substance use are some ways to improve health and fertility.\u201d The possible risks that may come with the paternal and maternal use of metformin remain a \u201ccomplex picture,\u201d but the new studies help make that evolving picture clearer, Dr. Sarah Martins da Silva, of the University of Dundee in the United Kingdom, wrote in an editorial published alongside the two studies Monday. \u201cClearly, individual risks and benefits should be carefully considered and results should be interpreted with caution since studies lack information on glycemic control,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNonetheless, these recent analyses suggest that metformin is a safe and effective treatment option for [type 2 diabetes] for men and women trying to conceive as well as managing hyperglycemia in pregnant women in the first trimester,\u201d she added, \u201cand it may be time to reconsider current prenatal care guidelines that advocate switching to insulin therapy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/metformin-preconception-pregnancy-birth-defects-risks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "health"}}
