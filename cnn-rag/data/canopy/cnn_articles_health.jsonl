During his childhood and early adulthood, he said, there were times when he would drink too much alcohol, pop pills at nightclubs and, inevitably, do something or say something that would hurt people he loved. Hall, 41, would never have thought that his life journey would take him from those dark experiences to potentially saving lives with his work refilling naloxone vending machines across Oklahoma. Over-the-counter naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, is an inhaled medication used to reverse an opioid overdose while it\u2019s happening. Naloxone vending machines \u2013 which provide the medications for free \u2013 can help people access doses quickly and reduce someone\u2019s risk of dying from an opioid overdose since, ideally, the medication should be given immediately. The vending machines also offer free fentanyl test strips, small strips of paper that can test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that drives most overdose deaths in the United States. From California to New York, vending machines stocked with harm-reduction tools have been placed in areas where high numbers of opioid overdoses have been reported. In Oklahoma, some of the machines are located along turnpikes, in casinos, on university campuses, at a library or outside fire stations. A CNN analysis of state health departments finds that at least 33 states and the District of Columbia have naloxone vending machines. In some states, like Oregon, city or county health departments or local nonprofits might operate the machines without state involvement. Other states, like Delaware, don\u2019t currently have vending machines but plan to launch programs this year. The size of these programs can vary. Oklahoma plans to expand its program this year from 27 machines to 40. Other large programs can be found in places like Michigan, where Wayne County officials announced last month plans to deploy 100 vending machines containing naloxone. When working with the vending machines in Oklahoma, Hall often reflects on his experiences to inform his work. As a senior field representative for harm reduction campaigns at the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, he leads community training sessions on harm reduction as well as helping restock dozens of naloxone vending machines for people to access anonymously. \u201cPeople\u2019s reasons for using substances are as vast and different as there are different types of suffering. I grew up as a queer kid in a small town, and it was not a super cool thing to be in the \u201880s and \u201890s,\u201d said Hall, who is based in Oklahoma City. \u201cYou\u2019re basically told from a very, very young age that this is kind of the worst thing that you can be. You internalize that, and it creates a lot of depression and anxiety.\u201d Hall, who is now sober, said that at a young age, he turned to substances like methamphetamines or opioids to give him the feeling of confidence he craved at the time. In his mid-30s, Hall sought treatment for substance use disorder. \u201cThis followed me my entire life. Then I got to a place where I wasn\u2019t using methamphetamines and opioids, and alcohol was my substance of choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a very cool hipster guy. I was vegan, and I only rode a bicycle around. It\u2019s funny that I was very particular about the foods that I would eat, but as far as substances, I wasn\u2019t so picky.\u201d Hall, who works for the state and occasionally bartends on the side, said he has personally administered naloxone several times to reverse opioid overdoses during his time bartending and while working in shelter and housing programs. Even though he knows that naloxone is accessible through the vending machines, he always keeps some on him too, just in case. \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to need these products. A lot of times, substance use isn\u2019t planned,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, people are out in the community and maybe having a few cocktails and a substance becomes available, and maybe it\u2019s a substance you typically wouldn\u2019t use, but you\u2019ve had a couple drinks, and your inhibitions are lowered.\u201d \u2018People are dying every minute of the day\u2019 More than 111,000 people in the US died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period that ended in September, according to\u00a0provisional data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about overdose death rates, I\u2019ve got any number of friends, I see their face every time I see those numbers or when we talk about the number of overdose reversals that come from kits that are distributed by our community partners,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhen I hear those numbers, I hear the voices of my friends that are currently struggling with substance use disorder,\u201d he said, eyes filling with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s very real to me.\u201d Overall, the number of overdose deaths associated with any drug continues to increase each month in the United States, although the pace appears to be slowing. Deaths reached a record high in May and changed little in the following months, through September. \u201cPeople are dying every minute of the day due to these overdoses, and so the vending machines are an amazing tool to help get the help into the hands of the public,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \u201cThis is a prevention technique, and it\u2019s very, very helpful to have these distribution points in the community that allow people to get what they need quickly without necessarily relying immediately on a first responder when seconds matter to save a life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so these distribution points and these vending access machines are meant to bring\u00a0the solutions closer to the community and put the tools in their hands to save lives.\u201d A study conducted in Cincinnati found that a single vending machine was directly associated with reversing overdoses for at least 78 people in its first year. In Clark County, Nevada, another study found that in the 12 months after the launch of naloxone vending machines, there were 229 opioid-involved overdose deaths. But researchers had previously predicted that there would be about 270 deaths in the county, suggesting that about 41 deaths were averted after the machines were launched. Machines need to be restocked every day Oklahoma\u2019s naloxone vending machine program launched in June. The state placed its first machine at a homeless shelter in Tulsa. The machines have become so popular that they need to be restocked every day, said Heath Hayes, former deputy commissioner for the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. \u201cAll of the vending machines have technology associated with it that ping us when they\u2019re getting low. So if they\u2019re at 50% capacity, we get the staff ready to activate the restockers,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThese vending machines that we have active right now have about 11,000 boxes of naloxone that have been distributed,\u201d he said, and each box contains two doses. The vending machines each hold 100 naloxone kits and 54 fentanyl test strip packages. Both items \u2013 naloxone and the test strips \u2013 are available in the machines free of charge. Typically, an over-the-counter box of two single-dose naloxone sprays can cost around $45. In 2022, before the launch of the vending machine program, about 700 people died of opioid overdose in Oklahoma, according to state health department numbers, up from about 400 deaths in 2021. Hayes said the state will closely watch those numbers to see whether they decline over time, especially as naloxone becomes more easily accessible with the addition of more vending machines. \u201cOur goal is to get naloxone in the hands of every Oklahoman, because we want to normalize that naloxone is something that every person should carry on them,\u201d Hayes said before he left the department. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to have naloxone in 2 million-plus people\u2019s hands that are 18 and older,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are overdosing can\u2019t use this medication on themselves, and for about 40% of the people who overdose, there\u2019s a bystander around. So it\u2019s critical that you have naloxone on you, because you never know when you can save a life.\u201d Aside from providing naloxone and fentanyl test strips at no cost, an appeal of the vending machines is that they offer a sense of anonymity. The machines do not collect any identifiable information, and anyone can walk up and use them. Hayes said there is still a lot of stigma around opioid use and the need for naloxone, but he hopes the vending machines can help reduce it. The machines have large print on the sides that reads \u201cnaloxone saves lives.\u201d \u201cNot often do you see a vending machine that says \u2018Naloxone can save lives\u2019 and it be very mental health- and addiction-focused, at your gas station,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThat\u2019s another piece to this, is that we have a physical symbol of anti-stigma in places that typically aren\u2019t associated with the mental health field.\u201d Some critics question whether the machines enable dangerous behaviors. Naloxone vending machine programs often can face\u00a0opposition from the communities\u00a0where they are placed. But public health advocates champion the machines as a way to reduce the number of lives lost to overdose while reducing stigma. In central Pennsylvania, six naloxone vending machines have been installed in rural communities where stigma can be prevalent but there is a greater need for expanded access to naloxone medication, said Carla Sofronski, executive director and co-founder of the\u00a0Pennsylvania Harm Reduction Network. \u201cHarm reduction is often highly stigmatized, especially in Pennsylvania, with the thought process that it is enabling drug use, when it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. Harm reduction does not condone drug use. It just provides life-saving interventions and tools in a toolbox to keep people alive and minimize risk,\u201d Sofronski said. \u201cWe have to start treating this as an urgent public health crisis, and folks should not be denied access to life-saving interventions due to stigma or because some folks may believe that people have addiction due to moral failure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to cut the stigma to actually get these tools out to people.\u201d \u2018You are not a broken person\u2019 Hall has faced stigma firsthand. He says he has heard some criticisms or \u201cdifficult\u201d questions about the naloxone vending machines and other programs. For instance, people might ask whether the vending machines enable opioid abuse on-site. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to think that somebody\u2019s going to walk into one of these spaces and see that this vending machine has fentanyl test strips and Narcan and think, \u2018oh, this makes it safe for me to use.\u2019 I think if anything, it\u2019s bringing more to the forefront the danger around using these substances,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt really is a shame that, a lot of times, we have to spend our time and energy into humanizing people that use substances or people that might need access to these tools,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some people that have the attitude of \u2018well, if somebody overdoses, then that\u2019s their problem,\u2019 and that\u2019s really unfortunate.\u201d Some of these negative biases and attitudes around people with substance use disorders remind Hall of how easily stigma can chip away at someone\u2019s self-worth. If he could speak to his younger self, at the peak of his substance use, he would tell himself that he is worthy of all that life has to offer. \u201cI would tell little baby Jason that everything is going to be OK,\u201d Hall said. \u201cYou are not a broken person, and you are not less than anybody else, and you are not less deserving of everything that life has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these things about yourself that you think make yourself so different and so \u2018othered\u2019 really just make you so much more human.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/22/health/oklahoma-narcan-vending-machines/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_health_exercise-is-medicine-fitness-wellness", "text": "Has your doctor quizzed you about your level of physical activity? If so, you can thank Exercise is Medicine, a global health initiative managed by the American College of Sports Medicine. Created in 2007, the initiative encourages health care providers to assess patients\u2019 physical activity during visits, plus include regular exercise when designing care plans. The amount and types of exercise that medical professionals recommend should be based on each person\u2019s current health and ability. The philosophy behind the initiative is simple: Physical activity promotes optimal health. Regular movement also helps to prevent and even treat various medical conditions. Overwhelming evidence links physical inactivity to poor health and high health care costs, according to a 2020 article in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine. The study concluded that health care and fitness programs should be merged. In addition, people who were moderately to vigorously active for at least 150 minutes per week had nearly half the health care utilization compared with those who were sedentary, according to a study done by Salt Lake City-based health care system Intermountain Health that was presented at the 2019 annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine and accepted for publication. The study also found the active people had half the total cost of health care compared with the sedentary folks, defined as those who engaged in one minute per week of moderate to vigorous activity, said Dr. Elizabeth Joy, chief medical officer at health technology company Lore Health and chair of the EIM governance board. Unfortunately, while EIM has expanded and achieved many successes, only 22.9% of adult women and 17.8% of adult men were advised by health care professionals to increase their physical activity levels, according to the 2022 US National Health Interview Survey, Joy noted. With the average primary care visit lasting less than 20 minutes and with health care providers needing to cover many issues, it\u2019s not surprising that so few are addressing physical activity, Joy said. \u201cIt takes very little time to write a prescription,\u201d Joy said. \u201cIt takes a whole lot more time to do evidence-based behavior-change counseling.\u201d Still, progress is being made Despite EIM\u2019s lack of progress in the doctor\u2019s office, it has created numerous programs, initiatives and exercise prescriptions to help people outside of it. EIM now includes Exercise is Medicine on Campus, for example, a program that helps colleges and universities promote and assess physical activity among students, faculty and staff. To date, more than 200 US schools and over two dozen international education institutions participate. The EIM-OC program at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has achieved gold status, said Amy Campbell, associate director of recreation and wellness, which means the university routinely assesses and promotes physical activity on campus. The university offers perks such as free personal training via its exercise science majors, plus a wealth of group fitness classes and wellness coaching. While some of these offerings were in place before GVSU signed on with EIM-OC, Campbell said the university is working more collaboratively to stress the importance of physical activity. \u201cThe CARE team (which connects distressed students to support services) now always asks students, \u2018What do you do outside of class? Are you staying physically active? What are activities you enjoy?\u2019\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIf they see an opportunity to work with our department, they\u2019ll reach out. For example, if someone can\u2019t afford to participate in an intramural program, we\u2019ll make sure they have access.\u201d There\u2019s also Moving Through Cancer, the first disease-specific initiative within EIM. The initiative assists with exercise and rehabilitation programming for those living with cancer and beyond. Most people who are physically active during cancer treatment have less severe side effects, feel better more quickly after treatment and, in some cases, have a lowered risk of their cancer returning, research has shown. EIM also created the Rx for Health Series, which provides exercise prescriptions for people with a wide variety of common chronic conditions, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, depression and anxiety, osteoarthritis, and heart failure. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had a heart attack, you\u2019re at far greater risk of having another one if you spend most of your time on the couch versus going for a walk,\u201d Joy said. \u201cThe couch is more dangerous than your walking shoes.\u201d Communities can inspire fitness, too While EIM will continue to educate health care providers and students in health care fields about the importance of assessing patients\u2019 activity levels and creating physical activity prescriptions, it\u2019s also looking at other options. \u201cPeople don\u2019t respond well to being told to do something,\u201d Joy said. \u201cRather, people are more likely to engage in and sustain healthy behavior changes when done within their community. If someone\u2019s family, neighborhood, faith-based community or even work environment is supportive of regular physical activity, they\u2019re likely to be more active.\u201d Absolutely, said Gerren Liles, a certified personal trainer and owner of Gerren Liles Vision Fitness in New York. Various New York City companies have brought in Liles to teach fitness classes for their employees, and he has seen the benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to unite people into working out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can inspire people to take charge of their fitness. It would be great if companies would invest in fitness, if schools would create programs and events for students and even parents, and if media and movies were all promoting physical activity.\u201d \u201cHealthy behaviors are contagious,\u201d Joy said. \u201cWe also have some personal responsibility around physical activity \u2014 to really think about how we influence the people around us.\u201d So the next time you head out for a walk, Joy said, invite a friend or neighbor along.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/health/exercise-is-medicine-fitness-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_health_farmworker-bird-flu-infection", "text": "A US farmworker who caught bird flu after working with dairy cattle in Texas appears to be the first known case of mammal-to-human transmission of the virus, a new study shows. The dairy worker sought care in late March after developing painful red, swollen, weeping eyes with burst blood vessels.\u00a0He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a letter about the case that was published in the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine\u00a0on Friday. He reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated direct close contact with dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds. Even though the man didn\u2019t become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows.\u00a0At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered about a virus that the study authors said has \u201cpandemic potential,\u201d and it illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay. \u201cFor farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation, and what they\u2019re not going to do is, they\u2019re not going to test for something if they don\u2019t have paid sick leave, because they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,\u201d said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers. Strater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick but don\u2019t want to be tested, but she said it\u2019s nothing that they\u2019re able to confirm. Health officials in Texas said they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they turned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu. \u201cThe people tested volunteered to be tested,\u201d said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services. \u201cIt\u2019s likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested positive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,\u201d Anton said. In the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he took antiviral medications and recovered without any lasting problems, and his close family members received the drugs as a precaution, the letter says. Swabs of the patient\u2019s eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too: His eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, but there was hardly any virus in his lungs.\u00a0That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes \u2013 either by rubbing them with contaminated hands or through splashes of contaminated milk \u2013 rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn\u2019t get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, not cells in the human airway. The letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory. Health officials said they couldn\u2019t do further investigation of how the man was infected because \u201cepidemiological investigations were not able to be conducted at the farm\u201d where he worked.\u00a0 They were also unable to test other workers at the same farm. That kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were being infected and if so, for how long they were infected and what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all. The CDC is looking for farms that will allow it to conduct such a detailed study. \u201cUnderstanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,\u201d the agency said in a statement to CNN. \u201cDiscussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals. CDC also continues to closely monitor a robust, nationwide flu surveillance system. To date, it has not detected any unusual flu activity.\u201d At a news briefing Friday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was monitoring the situation \u201cvery closely and taking this very seriously.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/health/farmworker-bird-flu-infection/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_health_ozempic-babies-pregnancy", "text": "Catera Bentley stared at the positive pregnancy test and couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. She took a second test, then a third \u2014 there was no question. She was pregnant. She called her husband at work and told him that there was a giant spider in the house that he had to come get rid of. He rushed home, and when he arrived, Bentley revealed the news. They both burst into tears. The couple, who live in Steele, Alabama, had been trying to have a child for more than two years, but Bentley\u2019s doctor had told her that she may be unable to conceive because of her history of polycystic ovary syndrome, known as PCOS. The news had left her feeling without a purpose. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to be was a mom and a wife,\u201d said Bentley, 25. \u201cI was depressed, severely depressed for that whole time.\u201d Five months earlier, in October 2022, Bentley had started taking Mounjaro for weight loss. Over the first few months, she said, she lost about 40 pounds. Her menstrual cycles, which had been irregular because of PCOS, became normal. And she even felt happier. \u201cIt just made me feel like a whole new person,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in a better mood every single day.\u201d Bentley had hoped that losing weight might help her get pregnant, and she\u2019d heard about others having success with weight loss while taking the shot. But when she did become pregnant \u2014 sooner than she expected \u2014 she worried about the effects it might have on her baby. \u2018Ozempic babies\u2019 Bentley is far from alone. Numerous women have shared stories of \u201cOzempic babies\u201d on social media. But the joy some experience in discovering pregnancies may come with anxiety about the unknowns, as these medicines haven\u2019t been studied in people who are pregnant. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the effect of early exposure \u2026 on the fetus,\u201d said Dr. Jody Dushay, a physician focused on endocrinology and metabolism at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Dushay said she recommends that women stop taking these drugs two months before trying to get pregnant, as directed in their prescribing information. Ozempic and Mounjaro are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, which act by mimicking hormones in the gut involved in insulin regulation and appetite. They\u2019re both approved to treat type 2 diabetes, and each have twin medicines approved for weight loss. Ozempic uses the active ingredient semaglutide, and Wegovy is the version approved for weight loss. Mounjaro uses tirzepatide, which also targets a second hormone called GIP, and Zepbound is its brand name for weight loss. The medicines have been shown to help people lose 15% to 20% of their body weight, on average, in clinical trials. And because of the way GLP-1 drugs work, experts say, there are reasons they may lead to more pregnancies as well as cause for caution about their use in early pregnancy. An effect on birth control For one, weight loss can generally be associated with increased fertility by restoring normal ovulation in people who have PCOS or other causes of abnormal cycles, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a professor and researcher at the University of Toronto\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital and a pioneer of research into GLP-1. \u201cIf you start on these medicines and then you lose 5, 10, 15% of your body weight, very often, you will have an improvement in ovulation,\u201d Drucker said. One scenario that\u2019s \u201cquite conceivable,\u201d he said, is that someone who has obesity and doesn\u2019t have frequent menstrual periods starts one of these medicines, loses weight over several months and finds that they\u2019re still not having regular periods \u2014 \u201conly now it might be because you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d On top of that, Mounjaro and Zepbound have a warning in their prescribing information that they may render birth control pills less effective. Drucker said this may be because the drugs work in part by slowing the rate at which food moves through the stomach. This can make people feel full for longer but also could interfere with absorption of other medicines, including birth control pills. Mounjaro and Zepbound warn about this explicitly on their labels, but Ozempic and Wegovy only warn more broadly about absorption of any drugs taken by mouth. Safety in pregnancy Even as GLP-1 medicines may increase fertility, little is known about their safety during pregnancy. The drugs\u2019 makers, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, excluded people who were pregnant or planned to become pregnant from their clinical trials, a common practice when testing new medicines. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no information available. \u201cThe more these meds are used, the more women will get pregnant while taking them, and we will in that way accumulate data on risk of early pregnancy exposure,\u201d Dushay explained. In other words, \u201cwe basically gather data from \u2018accidents\u2019 as we do for most drugs.\u201d The few studies available about babies whose mothers took GLP-1s early in pregnancy haven\u2019t turned up major causes for concern, although researchers note that more study is needed \u2014 and it\u2019s underway. Novo Nordisk has a registry where it\u2019s collecting data about the safety of Wegovy during pregnancy. A company spokesperson says the findings will be disclosed at the end of the study. An entry on a government database on clinical trials notes that the study plans to enroll more than 1,100 participants and is expected to be completed by the summer of 2027. An Eli Lilly spokesperson said the company also plans to open a pregnancy registry for Zepbound, which was approved at the end of last year. Studies in animals, though, have suggested some cause for caution, Drucker said. \u201cIf animals get high doses of these drugs, very often, the babies that are born to the mice and rats are small, and sometimes, they have some malformations,\u201d he noted. That\u2019s probably because the drugs also work by reducing appetite. \u201cIf you restrict energy intake in a pregnant animal, then the baby\u2019s not going to get enough nutrients and won\u2019t be able to grow properly,\u201d Drucker said. He also pointed to a study in animals suggesting that GLP-1 drugs may reduce the number of proteins that are responsible for transferring nutrients from the mother to the fetus, often found in the placenta. Already in use for PCOS Those concerns complicate research on the medicines for infertility, but some work is ongoing on one of the most common causes: PCOS. The condition affects as many as 12% of women of reproductive age in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it\u2019s associated with excess weight, which is thought to contribute to the body\u2019s production of too much insulin. That, in turn, results in hormonal imbalances \u2014 specifically, higher levels of hormones like testosterone, which can stop ovulation and cause irregular periods, acne and excess facial hair, according to the CDC. Although there\u2019s no cure, weight loss alone can lead to significant improvement of symptoms and resumption of regular ovulation and menstruation, said Dr. Anuja Dokras, director of the PCOS clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. Lifestyle changes are the first-line treatment for PCOS, but if those interventions aren\u2019t successful, doctors may prescribe Ozempic or other GLP-1 agonist medications, Dokras said. The 2023 international PCOS guidelines list GLP-1 agonists among the medications for \u201cmanagement of higher weight in adults with PCOS.\u201d GLP-1 agonists improve insulin resistance and lead to weight loss, so it makes sense that they also improve PCOS symptoms, added Dr. Melanie Cree, director of the multidisciplinary PCOS Clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. \u201cIt is completely being used now with no evidence because the [obstetrics] field knows that if you have 5% weight loss in these individuals with PCOS, you will improve fertility,\u201d she said. Cree noted that studies have shown that liraglutide, an earlier GLP-1 drug sold as Victoza for type 2 diabetes and Saxenda for weight loss, is effective at reducing body weight and testosterone levels in women with PCOS and obesity. Cree also just wrapped up a clinical trial investigating the use of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, for PCOS treatment in adolescent girls. The preliminary findings, which have not been published, showed that both semaglutide and a low-sugar diet resulted in more frequent periods, lower testosterone levels and weight loss \u2014 and the weight loss was much more pronounced in the group taking semaglutide. Regardless of the method, the study found, people who lost more weight had greater decreases in testosterone levels. Cree is now running a larger and longer clinical trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health, that will look specifically at fertility outcomes for young women with PCOS who take semaglutide. And while the drugs\u2019 makers aren\u2019t currently running trials in PCOS \u2014 which Cree attributes in part to the fact that PCOS overlaps so much with obesity that it wouldn\u2019t dramatically expand the market for the medicines \u2014 approval for the condition, she pointed out, could have an important effect on insurance coverage, which is challenging for many people using them for weight loss. \u201cFor example, Colorado mandates fertility coverage, so if it was approved as a fertility medication, then it would be covered for that indication,\u201d she said. Separately, Cree pointed to another question about the medicines during pregnancy: the potential for quick weight regain that can happen when patients stop them suddenly. \u201cIf that\u2019s happening in the setting of pregnancy, when you\u2019re gaining all this weight,\u00a0what happens?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does that mean? And we just don\u2019t know.\u201d A \u2018Catch-22\u2019 The drugs\u2019 makers are also following the \u201cOzempic babies\u201d phenomenon. Eli Lilly\u2019s chief of research, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, says the company has heard these kinds of stories from patients. \u201cOne question we\u2019re asking is: is it possible that as we reduce fat, we improve fertility, decrease PCOS and other barriers to fertility?\u201d Skovronsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like heart failure or sleep apnea,\u201d he said, referring to conditions for which GLP-1 drugs have recently shown positive results. \u201cJust another potential benefit of weight loss from this class of medications that we haven\u2019t tested yet.\u201d He also underlined how tricky it is to run studies around fertility of medicines whose safety in pregnancy is unknown; Cree referred to a requirement for birth control in studies of GLP-1 drugs as a \u201cCatch-22\u201d for fertility indications. \u201cRight now, unfortunately, it\u2019s really hard to study the effects of these drugs on fertility, because that implies exposing women to a drug with a high risk that they\u2019ll have a pregnancy during exposure to the drug and the risks to the baby haven\u2019t been fully analyzed yet,\u201d Skovronsky said. Bentley, who got pregnant while taking Mounjaro, said she stopped taking the medicine as soon as she found out she was pregnant. But she said she continued to worry about the effect of the drug on her baby. \u201cI worried up until the day I had her,\u201d she said. Her daughter, Ivy, was born healthy on her due date, weighing 7 pounds and 7 ounces. Bentley started taking Mounjaro again six weeks after Ivy was born.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ozempic-babies-pregnancy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_europe_dice-snakes-fake-own-death-special-effects-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Awards season may be over for human actors this year, but there\u2019s no rest for some of nature\u2019s most audacious thespians. Dice snakes can fake their own death when being attacked by predators, putting on a theatrical display that includes smearing themselves with their own poop and letting blood ooze from their mouths.  And dice snakes that use these extra dramatic effects spend less time feigning their own deaths, and consequently less time in a dangerous situation, than their counterparts that don\u2019t use this strategy, a study published on Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters found. Many different animals fake their own death as a defense mechanism against predators, with examples seen among insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, but just how \u2013 and to what degree \u2013 it works is still unclear. \u201cThere are conflicting theories about the origin of death feigning,\u201d Vuka\u0161in Bjelica, a research associate at the University of Belgrade in Serbia and one of the study\u2019s authors, told CNN via email. \u201cSome say it is a conscious response while others are adamant it is not. One theory is that it is the \u2018most primitive\u2019 defense response, similar to freezing in a high stress situation,\u201d he said. Lying motionless and exposing vulnerable body parts to a predator is risky, and so researchers from the University of Belgrade hypothesized that the more dramatic the show, the less time snakes would have to spend in danger. To test this, the researchers traveled to Golem Grad, an island in a lake in North Macedonia, where the snakes are common. There, they grabbed hold of 263 of the nonvenomous dice snakes and pinched them with their fingers to simulate the actions of a predator, before releasing each snake and timing its subsequent behavior as it feigned death. They observed that some snakes played dead by leaving their mouth wide open, some  smeared themselves with poop and others oozed blood from their mouth, too. The 28 snakes that bled from the mouth spent two seconds less on average feigning their death, the study found, though some snakes that didn\u2019t unleash the full theatrics spent a shorter amount of time playing dead too, perhaps due to other factors like temperature, sex or size.  Overall, the snakes spent between about six and 24 seconds playing dead. Bleeding from the mouth was a relatively uncommon behavior and observed in only 28 of the snakes tested, while smearing occurred in 124 of the cases. Not all the snakes tested feigned their own death. Juvenile snakes captured faked death for a much shorter time period and bled from the mouth much less, and these behaviors were completely absent in newly hatched snakes from a similar species, the study said, perhaps because of the dangers associated with it. Antipredator behavior is dependent on many different things, like the sex of the individual, body temperature, size, age, presence of food in the gut, presence of eggs in females, previous experience with a predator and preexisting injuries, Bjelica said. \u201cIt is still not exactly clear how each individual \u2018tailors\u2019 their antipredator response and our observations are mainly limited as most of them come from interactions with human researchers and not observations of real life encounters with natural predators,\u201d he added. Smearing itself with poop makes the snake less appetizing for its predator, which researchers said explains why snakes that do this before playing dead then spend less time in this situation. While the snakes don\u2019t squirt blood directly at their predators, like horned lizards do, bleeding from the mouth signals their apparent death to the predator. Researchers believe the bleeding is caused by an increase in blood pressure, prompted by high levels of stress hormones, Bjelica said. The study\u2019s results now need to be replicated in other species and ecosystems, the researchers said, adding that future research should focus on the precise sequence of behaviors displayed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/europe/dice-snakes-fake-own-death-special-effects-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_health_alzheimers-apoe4-gene-risk", "text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease may be inherited more often than previously known, according to a new study that paints a clearer picture of a gene long known to be linked to the common form of dementia. The authors of the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, say that this might even be considered a distinct, inherited form of the disease and that different approaches to testing and treatment may be needed. Among people diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, researchers recognize\u00a0familial forms of the disease and sporadic cases. Most cases are thought to be sporadic, which develop later in life. Familial forms, caused by mutations in any of three genes, tend to strike earlier\u00a0and are known to be rare, accounting for about 2% of all Alzheimer\u2019s diagnoses, or about 1 in 50 cases. Under the new paradigm, 1 in 6 cases of Alzheimer\u2019s would be considered to be inherited, or familial. This shifting appreciation of inherited risk, researchers say, is due to a better understanding of the role of a fourth gene that carries the blueprints to make a lipid-carrying protein called apolipoprotein E, known as APOE.\u00a0APOE ferries cholesterol throughout the body and brain and is thought to play a role in depositing or sweeping away sticky beta amyloid plaques, which are one hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s. There are three types of the APOE gene a person can carry.\u00a0One called APOE2 is thought to be protective against the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. APOE3 is thought to confer a neutral risk of the disease. APOE4, on the other hand, is bad news.\u00a0It has long been recognized that people with at least one copy of the APOE4 gene have an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, while people with two copies had a higher risk still. Now, researchers say APOE4 shouldn\u2019t just be recognized as a risk factor, it should be viewed as an inherited form of the disease, virtually assuring that a person who has two copies will get the biological changes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in their brains. Teasing out gene\u2019s role in Alzheimer\u2019s In the new study, researchers from Spain and the United States compared people in clinical studies who had two copies of the APOE4 gene with people who had other forms of the APOE gene. They also compared people with two copies of APOE4 to people with other inherited forms of the disease: early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer\u2019s disease (ADAD) and Down syndrome-associated Alzheimer\u2019s disease (DSAD).\u00a0The study included data from nearly 3,300 brains that are stored at the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center and data from another 10,000 people who were participants in five clinical trials. Not only were people with two copies of the APOE4 gene much more likely to develop the biological changes that lead to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, similar to people with the other genetic forms of the disease, they were almost assured the diagnosis:\u00a0Nearly 95% of the people in the studies with two copies of the APOE4 gene had the biology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by the time they were 82 years old. The study authors say that while APOE4 reliably causes the biological changes associated with the disease \u2014\u00a0the creation of beta amyloid plaques in the brain \u2014 having one or two copies of this gene doesn\u2019t always lead to cognitive decline. Rarely, people can have APOE4 and have a lot of beta amyloid in their brain but not have symptoms, perhaps because of other genetic or environmental factors that protect their brains at the same time.\u00a0In the large dataset of nearly 3,300 brains kept by the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center, for example, 273 individuals had two copies of the APOE4 gene, and 240, or 88%, had dementia. When people with two copies of APOE4 do have symptoms, they tend to get them earlier than others.\u00a0On average, they developed Alzheimer\u2019s about 10 years earlier \u2014\u00a0around age 65 \u2014 than people with other forms of the APOE gene.\u00a0Researchers also found that the buildup of beta amyloid and tau in their brains followed almost the same trajectory as has been noted in people with other inherited forms of the disease. Their disease was more severe earlier in life. In all the inherited forms of the disease, \u201cthere are striking, striking similarities in the way the disease progresses and the symptoms it gets,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Juan Fortea, a neurologist and director of the Memory Unit of the Neurology Department at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, in a news briefing. Fortea and his co-authors argue that for these reasons, having two copies of the APOE4 gene should be considered a genetic form of the disease, not merely a risk for it. Dr. Charles Bernick, associate medical director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, said the study showed how powerful it is to have two copies of the APOE4 gene. \u201cIt really drives a disease process,\u201d said Bernick, who was not involved in the study. Shifting understanding of genetic risks The strength of APOE4\u2019s role in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s wasn\u2019t recognized earlier, the researchers think, because APOE4 also plays an important role in heart health, and they think many people with two copies of the gene probably died from cardiovascular causes before they developed Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous studies had estimated that 30% to 35% of people with two copies of the APOE4 gene would develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Researchers say they also found a gene-dose effect.\u00a0While having two copies of APOE4 assured that a person would see beta amyloid and tau build up in their brains, having just one copy of the gene also increased a person\u2019s risk \u2013 but not as much as two copies of that gene. That would mean the APOE4 gene is semi-dominant, Fortea said.\u00a0Other diseases in which genes show semi-dominance include sickle cell anemia and hypercholesterolemia. In sickle cell, for example, two copies of the gene cause sickle cell disease, but one copy causes sickle cell trait.\u00a0People with sickle cell trait don\u2019t usually have symptoms, but they may be more likely to have heat stroke or muscle breakdown during strenuous exercise, and they can experience pain crises under certain conditions. Classifying APOE4 as an inherited form of the disease has some big implications. First, it would mean that a far greater proportion of Alzheimer\u2019s cases are caused by genes than has been previously understood. Before APOE4, the only gene changes recognized to cause Alzheimer\u2019s were associated with early-onset forms of the disease and with Down\u2019s syndrome.\u00a0They accounted for about 2% of Alzheimer\u2019s cases,\u00a0about 1 in 50. People with two copies of the APOE4 gene make up about 15% of people who are diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, or 1 in 7 cases of the disease. About 2% of the general population carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, which would make it one of the most prevalent inherited diseases. The important takeaway from the study, said Dr. Constantine Lyketsos, director of the memory and Alzheimer\u2019s treatment center at Johns Hopkins, is that Alzheimer\u2019s disease shouldn\u2019t be treated as a monolith. Rather, it shows that there are different forms of the disease that need personalized treatment. \u201cThe point is, we need to start doing precision medicine and breaking it down. Start with genetics,\u201d said Lyketsos, who was not involved in the study. Gene testing isn\u2019t recommended It is also likely to change how people who carry the APOE4 gene are diagnosed and treated. There are tests available to determine a person\u2019s APOE4 status, but they\u2019re not recommended as a routine part of diagnosis. That may need to change, the study authors said. \u201cThe consensus and the guidelines now do not recommend testing for APOE4 and that was because the consensus was that it did not help for the diagnosis,\u201d Fortea said. APOE testing is recommended for patients who are being evaluated to take new amyloid-clearing medications, such as lecanemab. Because Alzheimer\u2019s patients with two copies of the APOE4 gene are at higher risk of serious side effects like brain swelling from these amyloid-clearing medications, some treatment centers have decided not to offer them the drugs, said study author Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the center for Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cI find this very problematic, given these data,\u201d she said, noting that it would be important to do research to see whether it might be possible to find safer dosing or safer treatments for this patient group. \u201cFor me, this just means we need to treat them earlier,\u201d Sperling said, \u201cand this research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early, at a younger age, and at an early stage of pathology because we know they are very, very likely to progress to impairment quickly.\u201d Dr. Sterling Johnson, a study author who leads the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer\u2019s Prevention at the University of Wisconsin, said it would be very important for clinical trials to start to take participants\u2019 APOE4 status into account. \u201cWe may need to start treating these as a separate group in our research papers so that we can really understand the relationship between amyloid and tau and symptoms\u201d in people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, in a way that we kind of have not been able to before, Johnson said in the news briefing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/alzheimers-apoe4-gene-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_sleep-talking-fixes-wellness", "text": "Do you or a loved one talk in your sleep? It\u2019s a common sleep issue for many, experts say. About 50% of children will talk in their sleep \u2014 and typically outgrow it \u2014 while only about 5% of adults are nighttime blabbermouths, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. However, about 60% to 65% of adults will experience at least one episode of nighttime speech during their lifetime, the academy said. Sleep soliloquies can occur at any stage of sleep, not just in rapid eye movement (REM), the\u00a0stage when dreams occur, experts say. These one-sided conversations are typically harmless and can include mumbled whispers, groans and nonsense words as well as vulgar language and outright yelling. At that point, a bed partner may cease to view the chatter as amusing and start looking for ways to protect their own sleep, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThere are some things you, the bed partner, can do to save your sleep,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cBut first make sure there are no hidden issues that might be causing the problem.\u201d Sleep talking, or somniloquy, can be connected to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. Medications to treat depression, and other mental health disorders, high blood pressure, seizures, asthma and, oddly, other sleep disorders can also cause sleep talking, according to the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cIf your partner has never been a sleep talker and suddenly starts sleep talking after the age of 50, and it becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should reach out to your doctor for a neurological evaluation,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIt could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder, such as Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds to two minutes 30 or more times an hour \u2014 can also cause the brain to partially wake and begin to jabber. Bed partners are often the first to notice sleep apnea, observing a total cessation of breathing, followed by a gasp of air. Acid reflux or it\u2019s more serious cousin, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can also create a partial arousal that can trigger the brain into speech, Schenck said. Tips for handling sleep talking A white noise generator or loud fan is a great defense, said Jennifer Mundt, assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \u201cEarplugs or comfortable noise-canceling headphones\u00a0may also help,\u201d she said. Earplugs come in several forms: expandable foam, pre-molded versions and custom molded, which are created to precisely fit the shape and size of the ear canal. \u201cThen try to go to sleep before the person who sleep talks so that you are not easily awakened. That\u2019s where a white noise generator or loud fan can be very, very helpful,\u201d Schenck said. Now, it\u2019s time for some detective work. Work with your bed partner to discover triggers for their sleep talking, such as stress, the use of alcohol, being sleep-deprived, not sticking to a normal sleep schedule or even sleeping in a new environment, experts say. For some people, something as benign as being on vacation or sleeping somewhere new can cause an episode, Mundt said. \u201cAt these times your brain is a little more vigilant because you\u2019re in a new environment, and that means you\u2019re more likely to have this partial awakening, where one part of the brain is awake and the other part is asleep,\u201d Mundt said. In the end, it\u2019s the responsibility of the person who sleep talks to take ownership of their disorder and find solutions to quit disturbing a partner\u2019s sleep, Schenck said. \u201cThe person who is sleep talking has to be very considerate of the partner,\u201d Schenck said. \u201cIf sleeping on your back makes it worse, then get a nightshirt where you can put a tennis ball in the back of the shirt so you can\u2019t sleep on your back.\u201d And if drinking alcohol is a trigger, that should be stopped or diminished as well, he said. \u201cCut out alcohol so you can share your consideration for the bed partner who is disturbed by your sleep talking.\u201d What causes sleep talking? Sleep talking is a parasomnia, in the same category as sleep terrors, sleep eating, sleep paralysis and sleep sex. All are disorders of arousal, in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps. Parasomnias often run in families, and you are more likely to have one if you had one as a child. If more than one first-degree relative has a parasomnia, then it\u2019s much more likely that childhood sleep behaviors will remain or reoccur as an adult, Schenck said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to predict that you will develop a parasomnia. Some people who have sleep talking or walking as children do return to the behavior as adults, but many others do not,\u201d he said. Sleep talking often occurs spontaneously \u201cin a rather unpredictable fashion,\u201d Schenck said, although at times it can occur after fevers or emotional stress. However, \u201csleep talking should be differentiated from catathrenia, a sleep-related breathing disorder typically characterized by moaning during sleep.\u201d Many people who talk in their sleep do not need medical treatment, but if the disorder is severe, there are treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy, designed to help identify and reduce stress triggers and negative thoughts about sleep. Good sleep hygiene, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day, avoiding caffeine after 3pm and eliminating light from the bedroom, including screens such as smartphones, laptops and televisions can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/sleep-talking-fixes-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_health_ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness", "text": "Eating ultraprocessed foods is associated with an early risk of death, according to a 30-year study \u2014 but different foods have different impacts. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. Processed meats and sugary foods and drinks aren\u2019t correlated with the same risks as ultraprocessed whole grains, for example, said lead study author Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. The study analyzed data from more than 100,000 health professionals in the United States with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. From 1986 to 2018, the participants provided information on their health and lifestyle habits every two years. Every four years, they completed a detailed food questionnaire. The group eating the least ultraprocessed food ate about three servings a day on average, while the highest averaged seven servings a day, according to the study published Wednesday in The BMJ journal. Those who ate the most had a 4% higher risk of deaths by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths, the data showed. Song described the correlation as \u201cmoderate,\u201d noting that the connection was not equally strong among all kinds of ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThe positive association is mainly driven by a few subgroups including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d he said. Findings in this study were consistent with hundreds of others in the field, but what makes this one unique is its parsing out of different subgroups within the ultraprocessed food category, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. Do we need to get rid of all ultraprocessed foods? Song wouldn\u2019t necessarily advise a complete rejection of all ultraprocessed foods because it is a diverse category, he said. \u201cCereals, whole grain breads, for example, they are also considered ultraprocessed food, but they contain various beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, I do think people should try to avoid or limit the consumption of certain ultraprocessed foods, such as processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and also potentially artificially sweetened beverages.\u201d There are also more questions that need to be answered when it comes to ultraprocessed foods. First, the recent study is strong because of the length of time covered\ufeff, but it is an observational study. That means that while researchers can observe a correlation, they can\u2019t say that the foods were the cause of the deaths, said Dr. Peter Wilde, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in the United Kingdom. Researchers also need to look more at the components of ultraprocessed foods that might be affecting health \u2014 whether they be food additives, emulsifiers or flavors \u2014 to advise governments and institutions on how to regulate foods, Song said. Overall diet matters most Researchers also found that the most important factor to reducing risk of death is the quality of a person\u2019s overall diet, Song said. \u201cIf people maintain a generally healthy diet, I don\u2019t think they need to be like scared or be freaked out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall dietary pattern is still the predominant factor determining the health outcomes.\u201d A healthy diet is varied, with as many colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains as possible, Wilde said. \u201cIf you are worried about food additives, then choose foods that have low levels of additives,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cJust be mindful of the nutritional content of (the ultraprocessed foods) that you do choose to consume.\u201d It is also important to recognize that foods need to be eaten in balance. Fruit juice contains beneficial vitamins, minerals and antioxidants when consumed in moderation, but too much will have high levels of sugar that may override their benefits, Wilde said. \u201cThis is not black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cA particular food is not either good or bad, it will contain elements of both, and the balance between the two may depend on how much you eat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_health_cdc-dog-import-rules", "text": "The United States has new rules for how dogs are brought into the country, and they go into effect in August. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that it is updating regulations for bringing dogs into the United States in an effort to keep the country free of canine rabies. Starting August 1, the tightened rules require that all dogs entering the US appear healthy upon arrival, be at least 6 months old, be microchipped and be accompanied by a \u201cCDC Dog Import Form\u201d receipt that was filled out online two to 10 days before arrival. These rules apply to all dogs, including service dogs and those who were born in the United States but are returning from another country. The \u201cCDC Dog Import\u201d permits that are currently used will expire August 31, according to the CDC. The announcement noted that more requirements may apply based on where the dog has traveled in the previous six months or where they had been vaccinated. The CDC website offers travel checklists for US-vaccinated dogs and foreign-vaccinated dogs from high-risk countries. Dog rabies was eliminated in the United States in 2007, but the virus remains endemic in more than 100 countries, according to the CDC, and unvaccinated dogs can still contract the disease from wildlife. In the US, rabies is mostly found in wild animals such as bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes. But in certain areas around the world, including parts of Asia, Africa and Central and South America, rabies in dogs remains a major issue. \u201cFor dogs arriving from countries with a high risk of dog rabies, they must be protected against rabies,\u201d the CDC announcement says. Other requirements may include that titers from blood serology tests be drawn before US entry. These lab tests can check for antibodies in a dog\u2019s blood after the dog is vaccinated against rabies. Rabies titers are good for the life of the dog, as long as the animal stays up to date on rabies booster shots, according to the CDC. \u201cIf your dog\u2019s rabies vaccination expires before you get your dog a booster vaccine, your dog must have another titer drawn at least 30 days after booster vaccination to be eligible for importation.\u00a0CDC recommends you always keep your dog\u2019s rabies vaccination current,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s website. If the dog does not have titer results upon arrival, they must be quarantined at an animal care facility for 28 days or until titer results are submitted for review, according to the CDC. \u201cCDC encourages people traveling with their dogs to use CDC\u2019s new personalized question-and-answer tool, \u2018DogBot,\u2019 on the CDC website to determine what rules apply to their dogs based on their travel dates, where their dog is traveling from, and where their dog was vaccinated,\u201d the announcement says. \u201cPeople should plan in advance for future travel to ensure requirements for dog importations will be met at the time their dogs will enter the United States.\u201d Jennifer Skiff, director of international at the animal advocacy group Animal Wellness Action, called the new rules an overreach. \u201cRabies vaccinations, health certificates and of course microchips make sense,\u201d Skiff said. \u201cBut the CDC is mandating serology titers,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cOne of many problems with that, other than being an excessive and costly requirement, is that the agency is requiring they be done in a CDC-approved laboratory, and not all countries have CDC-approved laboratories.\u201d The American Veterinary Medical Association has said it supports the CDC\u2019s new regulations. \u201cThe\u00a0AVMA\u00a0continues to support the CDC\u2019s efforts to improve dog importation standards and is pleased to see the implementation of this new rule that will help protect public health and positively impact canine health and welfare,\u201d President Dr. Rena Carlson said in an emailed statement Wednesday. These updates \u201caim to protect the public\u2019s health by preventing the reintroduction of dog rabies into the United States,\u201d CDC spokesperson David Daigle said when the rules were proposed last year. \u201cThese updates would establish an importation system designed to reduce fraud and improve the U.S. government\u2019s ability to verify that imported dogs have met U.S. entry requirements.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/cdc-dog-import-rules/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_04_health_three-forms-movement-weekly-wellness", "text": "Walking has earned a reputation as a great form of exercise that\u2019s easy and accessible for many people, and scores of studies show the popular activity has numerous health benefits, too. Getting at least 2,300 steps per day reduces your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, according to one study published in a 2023 edition of the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology. In addition, weight-bearing exercises such as walking help prevent osteoporosis, according to another study published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports. Yet some experts in the health and fitness fields assert that while walking is certainly good for your health and fitness, it\u2019s not really high-quality exercise. One such expert is Melissa Boyd, a certified personal trainer and coach with Tempo, an online personal training platform. Boyd is based in San Francisco. \u201cOur lives have gotten so busy \u2014 we commute, sit all day, then are exhausted at night \u2014 that getting a short walk in makes you feel like you\u2019ve done this big, exponential thing,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cBut walking is really a baseline movement your body requires to function well, to help with things like circulation and digestion, and to decompress.\u201d To help her clients better understand why a daily walk won\u2019t result in a beach body \u2014 something many of them believe, thanks to various social media influencers \u2014 she discusses with them the three types of movement that are beneficial for overall health and fitness. First is the movement your body is owed or requires every day, such as walking, stretching and bending. Second is athletic movement, which you can do a few times a week to improve your fitness or to train for a sport. Third is social movement that you do for fun or to connect with others, such as dancing or playing volleyball. \u201cIt\u2019s important to think of movement in these different categories because not moving throughout the day has become normalized,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cOur lives are so sedentary, many of us are trying to dig ourselves out of a movement deficit. But exercise is different from physical movement.\u201d Our bodies need to move in many different ways Walking is great, but it\u2019s just one, unidirectional form of movement, and our bodies need more to be functionally fit, said Dr. Carl Cirino, a sports medicine surgeon at HSS Orthopedics with Stamford Health in Connecticut. People use the muscles and tendons in their bodies to assist with all the bending, twisting and rotating they do in their daily lives, Cirino said, so they need to work and stretch them in many different directions. Yoga and Pilates are two activities that are very effective and healthy in this regard, he said. \u201cStretching is also incredibly easy, and something you can do when you wake up and before you go to bed,\u201d Cirino said. Having loose, pliable muscles also means you will have more balance and stability, which helps prevent falls and injuries in all physical activities, he said. It\u2019s also good to get your heart rate up several times a week for cardiovascular health. Time for an exercise snack Ideally, you should create a plan that incorporates daily \u201cowed\u201d movements, such as walking and stretching, with some cardiovascular work, strength training and social activity sprinkled throughout the week, the two said. That can seem overwhelming for many, however. Breaking down all these different movements into exercise snacks is one way to sneak in the movement your body needs, Boyd said. \u201cMaybe get a walking pad and do some of your meetings while walking slowly on the pad,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe every time you go to the bathroom, you do 20 squats, or every time you get water, you do 10 push-ups against a wall. If you attach these exercise snacks to something else you\u2019re already doing, you can make it more of a habit. I\u2019ve seen huge success with this.\u201d Boyd also encourages her clients to find some form of movement they enjoy that doesn\u2019t seem like a workout, such as playing kickball or pickleball. That way, you\u2019re having fun and being social while getting fitter. Cirino agrees. \u201cWe see kids here in sports medicine whose parents want them to play baseball, but they don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with exercise. You need to find something that\u2019s interesting and easy \u2014 maybe an activity your friends are doing \u2014 and use that as the basis to build good habits.\u201d Start slowly and build from there Rethinking exercise as regular movements your body needs for functionality, fitness and social connection also can be a means of giving yourself permission to carve out time for working out, Boyd said. It\u2019s also helpful to keep in mind that creating an exercise plan doesn\u2019t require an immediate, massive change in your lifestyle. In fact, it\u2019s better to start slowly with new, little chunks of movement. \u201cWhat I usually see is that people love the way this starts to make them feel,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThen the stronger they become, the more they want to move even more. Movement inspires movement.\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/04/health/three-forms-movement-weekly-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_04_health_parent-death-drug-overdose-gun-violence", "text": "Deaths from drug overdoses and firearm-related injuries have reached record levels in the United States in recent years, and it\u2019s created a \u201cdouble burden\u201d for children who face an increased risk of losing their parents and of dying themselves, according to the authors of a new study. Overall, more than 1 million children have lost a parent to a fatal drug overdose or gun violence over the past two decades, according to the study, published Saturday in the medical journal JAMA \u2013 and the burden has increased significantly over time. Nearly 100,000 children lost parents to a drug overdose or gun violence in 2020 alone \u2013 almost three times more than in 1999, the study found. These two causes of death accounted for 23% of all parental loss in 2020, nearly double the share from 1999. Direct data on the number of children who lost a parent to death from drugs or firearms is not available, so for this study, the researchers analyzed federal mortality data, fertility data and population demographics to estimate the scale of parental death from drugs or firearms. They found that the average age of people who died from a drug overdose or from a firearm-related injury in the US is about 42, an age at which people are likely to have young or teenage children. Federal data shows that drug overdose deaths are most common and rising fastest among people in their mid-30s and 40s, and the new study found a significant surge in parental losses from drug overdoses. About 72,800 children lost a parent to a drug overdose in 2020, up 345% from the 16,000 children affected in 1999, according to the study. There was a 39% increase in children who lost a parent to gun violence \u2013 from 18,000 in 1999 to 25,000 in 2020 \u2013 compared with a 24% increase in the number of children who lost parents to all other causes of death. Other research has shown that losing a parent can have negative effects on a child\u2019s health, education and livelihood \u2013 in both the short and long term. And losing a parent to drugs or guns can be especially hard, said Robin Gurwitch, a psychologist and professor at the Duke University School of Medicine. It\u2019s more socially acceptable to talk about some causes of death such as cancer, she said. Deaths involving guns or drugs are not only traumatic deaths, they\u2019re often \u201csaid in whispers.\u201d \u201cWhen it can\u2019t be talked about openly and freely, it makes it harder for children to get the support they need,\u201d said Gurwitch, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cFor children who hold those things inside, the risk of it leaking out into everything from severe behavior challenges to bereavement disorders to other types of mental health challenges \u2013 anxiety, depression or their own substance abuse \u2013 goes way up.\u201d Children are about three times more likely to lose a father to a drug overdose or firearm violence than they are to lose a mother, according to the new study \u2013 broadly in line with broader mortality trends for these two causes of death. And Black youth are disproportionately affected, largely because of a disproportionate rate of firearm deaths among Black fathers. In 2020, about 1 in every 1,000 Black children lost a parent to gun violence, compared with 1 in every 3,000 overall, according to the new study. These \u201csubstantial\u201d disparities in the burden of experiencing the death of a parent result in \u201cdisadvantages in health over the life course and contributing to cumulative racial disadvantage,\u201d the study authors wrote. \u201cEfforts to stem this problem should prioritize averting drug overdoses and firearm violence, especially among structurally marginalized groups.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/04/health/parent-death-drug-overdose-gun-violence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_health_super-bowl-parade-survivors-bullets-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "James Lemons, 39, wants the bullet removed from his thigh so he can go back to work. Sarai Holguin, a 71-year-old woman originally from Mexico, has accepted the bullet lodged near her knee as her \u201ccompa\u201d \u2014 a close friend. Mireya Nelson, 15, was hit by a bullet that went through her jaw and broke her shoulder, where fragments remain. She\u2019ll live with them for now, while doctors monitor lead levels in her blood for at least two years. Nearly three months after the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting left at least 24 people injured, recovery from those wounds is intensely personal and includes a surprising gray area in medicine: whether the bullets should be removed. Medical protocol offers no clear answer. A 2016 survey of surgeons found that\u00a0only about 15%\u00a0of respondents worked at medical facilities that had policies on bullet removal. Doctors in the U.S. often leave bullets buried deep in a person\u2019s body, at least at first, so as not to cause further trauma. But as gun violence has emerged as a public health epidemic,\u00a0some researchers wonder\u00a0if that practice is best. Some of the wounded, like James Lemons, are left in a precarious place. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to get it out, and it\u2019s safely taken out, get it out of the person,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cMake that person feel more secure about themselves. And you\u2019re not walking around with that memory in you.\u201d Lemons, Holguin, and Nelson are coping in very different ways. Pain Became a Problem Three days after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Lemons drove the 37 miles from Harrisonville, Missouri, to downtown Kansas City to celebrate the victory. The warehouse worker was carrying his 5-year-old daughter, Kensley, on his shoulders when he felt a bullet enter the back of his right thigh. Gunfire erupted in the area packed with revelers,\u00a0prosecutors later said, after a \u201cverbal confrontation\u201d between two groups. Detectives found \u201cmultiple 9mm and .40 caliber spent shell casings\u201d at the scene. Lemons said he understood immediately what was happening. \u201cI know my city. We\u2019re not shooting off fireworks,\u201d he said. Lemons shielded Kensley\u2019s face as they fell to the ground so she wouldn\u2019t hit the concrete. His first thought was getting his family \u2014 also including his wife, Brandie; 17-year-old daughter, Kallie; and 10-year-old son, Jaxson \u2014 to safety. \u201cI\u2019m hit. But don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Lemons recalled telling Brandie. \u201cWe gotta go.\u201d He carried Kensley on his shoulders as the family walked a mile to their car. His leg bled through his pants at first then stopped, he said. It burned with pain. Brandie insisted on driving him to the hospital but traffic was at a standstill so she put on her hazard lights and drove on the wrong side of the road. \u201cShe\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m getting you to a hospital. I\u2019m tired of people being in my way,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen my wife like that. I\u2019m looking at her like, \u2018That\u2019s kinda sexy.\u2019\u201d Lemons clapped and smiled at his wife, he said, to which she replied, \u201cWhat are you smiling for? You just got shot.\u201d He stayed in quiet admiration until they were stopped by a sheriff, who summoned an ambulance, Lemons said. He was taken to the emergency room at University Health, which\u00a0admitted 12 patients\u00a0from the rally, including eight with gunshot wounds. Imaging showed the bullet barely missed an artery, Lemons said. Doctors cleansed the wound, put his leg in a brace, and told him to come back in a week. The bullet was still in his leg. \u201cI was a little baffled by it, but I was like, \u2018OK, whatever, I\u2019ll get out of here,\u2019\u201d Lemons recalled. When he returned, doctors removed the brace but explained they often leave bullets and fragments in the body \u2014 unless they grow too painful. \u201cI get it, but I don\u2019t like that,\u201d Lemons said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you take it out if you could?\u201d University Health spokesperson Leslie Carto said the hospital can\u2019t comment on individual patient care because of federal privacy laws. Surgeons typically do remove bullets when they encounter them during surgery or they are in dangerous locations, like in the spinal canal or risking damage to an organ, said\u00a0Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children\u2019s. Campbell also chairs the Injury Prevention and Control Committee of the American College of Surgeons\u2019 Committee on Trauma, which works on firearm injury prevention. LJ Punch, a trauma surgeon by training and the founder of the\u00a0Bullet Related Injury Clinic\u00a0in St. Louis, said the origins of trauma care also help explain why bullets are so often left. \u201cTrauma care is war medicine,\u201d Punch said. \u201cIt is set to be ready at any moment and any time, every day, to save a life. It is not equipped to take care of the healing that needs to come after.\u201d In the survey of surgeons, the most common reasons given for removing a bullet were pain, a palpable bullet lodged near the skin, or an infection. Far less common were lead poisoning and mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. What patients wanted also affected their decisions, the surgeons said. Lemons wanted the bullet out. The pain it caused in his leg radiated up from his thigh, making it difficult to move for more than an hour or two. Working his warehouse job was impossible. \u201cI gotta lift 100 pounds every night,\u201d Lemons recalled telling his doctors. \u201cI gotta lift my child. I can\u2019t work like this.\u201d He has lost his income and his health insurance. Another stroke of bad luck: The family\u2019s landlord sold their rental home soon after the parade, and they had to find a new place to live. This house is smaller, but it was important to keep the kids in the same school district with their friends, Lemons said in an interview in Kensley\u2019s pink bedroom, the quietest spot to talk. They\u2019ve borrowed money and raised\u00a0$6,500 on GoFundMe\u00a0to help with the deposit and car repairs, but the parade shooting has left the family in a deep financial hole. Without insurance, Lemons worried he couldn\u2019t afford to have the bullet removed. Then he learned his surgery would be paid for by donations. He set up an appointment at a hospital north of the city, where a surgeon took measurements on his X-ray and explained the procedure. \u201cI need you to be involved as much as I\u2019m going to be involved,\u201d he remembered being told, \u201cbecause \u2014 guess what \u2014 this ain\u2019t my leg.\u201d The surgery is scheduled for this month. \u2018We Became Friends\u2019 Sarai Holguin isn\u2019t much of a Chiefs fan, but she agreed to go to the rally at Union Station to show her friend the best spot to see the players on stage. It was an unseasonably warm day, and they were standing near an entrance where lots of police were stationed. Parents had babies in strollers, kids were playing football, and she felt safe. A little before 2 p.m., Holguin heard what she thought were fireworks. People started running away from the stage. She turned to leave, trying to find her friend, but felt dizzy. She didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been shot. Three people quickly came to her aid and helped her to the ground, and a stranger took off his shirt and made a tourniquet to put on her left leg. Holguin, a native of Puebla, Mexico, who became a U.S. citizen in 2018, had never seen so much chaos, so many paramedics working under such pressure. They were \u201canonymous heroes,\u201d she said. She saw them working on Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a well-known DJ and 43-year-old mother of two. Lopez-Galvan died at the scene, and was the sole fatality at the parade. Holguin was rushed to University Health, about five minutes from Union Station. There doctors performed surgery, leaving the bullet in her leg. Holguin awoke to more chaos. She had lost her purse, along with her cellphone, so she couldn\u2019t call her husband, Cesar. She had been admitted to the hospital under an alias \u2014 a common practice at medical centers to begin immediate care. Her husband and daughter didn\u2019t find her until about 10 p.m. \u2014 roughly eight hours after she\u2019d been shot. \u201cIt has been a huge trauma for me,\u201d Holguin said through an interpreter. \u201cI was injured and at the hospital without doing anything wrong. [The rally] was a moment to play, to relax, to be together.\u201d Holguin was hospitalized for a week, and two more outpatient surgeries quickly followed, mostly to remove dead tissue around the wound. She wore a wound VAC, or vacuum-assisted closure device, for several weeks and had medical appointments every other day. Campbell, the trauma surgeon, said wound VACs are common when bullets damage tissue that isn\u2019t easily reconstructed in surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical injuries,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cMany times it\u2019s the emotional, psychological injuries, which many of these patients take away as well.\u201d The bullet remains near Holguin\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019m going to have it for the rest of my life,\u201d she said, saying she and the bullet became \u201ccompas,\u201d close friends. \u201cWe became friends so that she doesn\u2019t do any bad to me anymore,\u201d Holguin said with a smile. Punch, of the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis, said some people like Holguin are able to find a way to psychically live with bullets that remain. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to make a story around what that means for that bullet to be in your body, that gives you power; that gives you agency and choice,\u201d Punch said. Holguin\u2019s life changed in an instant: She\u2019s using a walker to get around. Her foot, she said, acts \u201clike it had a stroke\u201d \u2014 it dangles, and it\u2019s difficult to move her toes. The most frustrating consequence is that she cannot travel to see her 102-year-old father, still in Mexico. She has a live camera feed on her phone to see him, but that doesn\u2019t offer much comfort, she said, and thinking about him brings tears. She was told at the hospital that her medical bills would be taken care of, but then lots of them came in the mail. She tried to get victim assistance from the state of Missouri, but all the forms she had were in English, which made them difficult to comprehend. Renting the wound VAC alone cost $800 a month. Finally she heard that the Mexican Consulate in Kansas City could help, and the consul pointed her to the Jackson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, with which she registered as an official victim. Now all of her bills are being paid, she said. Holguin isn\u2019t going to seek mental health treatment, as she believes one must learn to live with a given situation or it will become a burden. \u201cI have processed this new chapter in my life,\u201d Holguin said. \u201cI have never given up and I will move on with God\u2019s help.\u201d \u2018I Saw Blood on My Hands\u2019 Mireya Nelson was late to the parade. Her mother, Erika, told her she should leave early, given traffic and the million people expected to crowd into downtown Kansas City, but she and her teenage friends ignored that advice. The Nelsons live in Belton, Missouri, about a half hour south of the city. Mireya wanted to hold the Super Bowl trophy. When she and her three friends arrived, the parade that had moved through downtown was over and the rally at Union Station had begun. They were stuck in the large crowd and quickly grew bored, Mireya said. Getting ready to leave, Mireya and one of her friends were trying to call the driver of their group, but they couldn\u2019t get cell service in the large crowd. Amid the chaos of people and noise, Mireya suddenly fell. \u201cI saw blood on my hands. So then I knew I got shot. Yeah, and I just crawled to a tree,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know where I got shot at, at first. I just saw blood on my hands.\u201d The bullet grazed Mireya\u2019s chin, shot through her jaw, broke her shoulder, and left through her arm. Bullet fragments remain in her shoulder. Doctors decided to leave them because Mireya had already suffered so much damage. Mireya\u2019s mother supports that decision, for now, noting they were just \u201cfragments.\u201d \u201cI think if it\u2019s not going to harm her the rest of her life,\u201d Erika said, \u201cI don\u2019t want her to keep going back in the hospital and getting surgery. That\u2019s more trauma to her and more recovery time, more physical therapy and stuff like that.\u201d Bullet fragments, particularly ones only skin-deep, often push their way out like splinters, according to Punch, although patients aren\u2019t always told about that. Moreover, Punch said, injuries caused by bullets extend beyond those with damaged tissue to the people around them, like Erika. He called for a holistic approach to recover from all the trauma. \u201cWhen people stay in their trauma, that trauma can change them for a lifetime,\u201d Punch said. Mireya will be tested for\u00a0lead levels in her blood\u00a0for at least the next two years. Her levels are fine now, doctors told the family, but if they get worse she will need surgery to remove the fragments, her mother said. Campbell, the pediatric surgeon, said lead is particularly concerning for young children, whose developing brains make them especially vulnerable to\u00a0its harmful effects.\u00a0Even a tiny amount\u00a0of lead \u2014 3.5 micrograms per deciliter \u2014 is enough to report to state health officials, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mireya talks about cute teenage boys\u2019 being \u201cfine\u201d but also still wears Cookie Monster pajamas. She appears confused by the shootings, by all the attention at home, at school, from reporters. Asked how she feels about the fragments in her arm, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care for them.\u201d Mireya was on antibiotics for 10 days after her hospital stay because doctors feared there was bacteria in the wound. She has had physical therapy, but it\u2019s painful to do the exercises. She has a scar on her chin. \u201cA dent,\u201d she said, that\u2019s \u201cbumpy.\u201d \u201cThey said she was lucky because if she wouldn\u2019t have turned her head in a certain way, she could be gone,\u201d Erika said. Mireya faces a psychiatric evaluation and therapy appointments, though she doesn\u2019t like to talk about her feelings. So far, Erika\u2019s insurance is paying the medical bills, though she hopes to get some help from the United Way\u2019s\u00a0#KCStrong fund, which raised nearly $1.9 million, or a faith-based organization called\u00a0Unite KC. Erika doesn\u2019t want a handout. She has a job in health care and just got a promotion. The bullet has changed the family\u2019s life in big ways. It is part of their conversation now. They talk about how they wish they knew what kind of ammunition it was, or what it looked like. \u201cLike, I wanted to keep the bullet that went through my arm,\u201d Mireya said. \u201cI want to know what kind of bullet it was.\u201d That brought a sigh from her mom, who said her daughter had watched too many episodes of \u201cForensic Files.\u201d Erika beats herself up about the wound, because she couldn\u2019t protect her daughter at the parade. \u201cIt hits me hard because I feel bad because she begged me to get off work and I didn\u2019t go there because when you have a new position, you can\u2019t just take off work,\u201d Erika said. \u201cBecause I would have took the bullet. Because I would do anything. It\u2019s mom mode.\u201d This story was produced as part of a reporting partnership\u00a0between\u00a0KCUR\u00a0and\u00a0KFF Health News,\u00a0a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/super-bowl-parade-survivors-bullets-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

The study is the peer-reviewed and finalized version of an abstract \u2014 early research the authors presented in July 2023 at the American Society for Nutrition\u2019s annual meeting. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, it was also the first to investigate whether the Mediterranean diet staple is linked with risk of death from the disease. \u201cOur study reinforces dietary guidelines recommending vegetable oils such as olive oil and suggests that these recommendations not only support heart health but potentially brain health, as well,\u201d study coauthor Anne-Julie Tessier, a research associate in nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in a news release for the abstract last year. \u201cOpting for olive oil, a natural product, instead of fats such as margarine and commercial mayonnaise, is a safe choice and may reduce the risk of fatal dementia.\u201d At the beginning of the study, research participants were age 56 on average. The pool included nearly 60,600 women who had participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study from 1990 to 2018, and nearly 32,000 men who had been in the Health Professionals\u2019 Follow-Up Study during the same period. The former study investigated risk factors for major chronic diseases among women in North America, while the latter is looking into the same topics but for men. The authors of the latest study assessed participants\u2019 diets every four years via a questionnaire and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index, which assigns ratings to foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease. The higher someone scores on this index, the better. Replacing 5 grams \u2014 around 1.2 teaspoons \u2014 of margarine or mayonnaise consumed daily with olive oil was associated with an 8% to 14% lower risk of death from dementia. The results of substituting with other vegetable oils or butter weren\u2019t significant, the authors found. Participants with the APOE e4 gene \u2014 the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 were five to nine times more likely than noncarriers to die from dementia, but the findings regarding olive oil still stood after the authors took this factor into account. Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, noted in July that the research doesn\u2019t prove a causal relationship, but rather an association. \u201cMore research is needed,\u201d Mellor, the Aston Medical School lead for nutrition and evidence-based medicine at Aston University in the United Kingdom, said in a news release. Lowering dementia risk The potential benefits of olive oil for brain health could be due to antioxidant compounds that can cross the blood-brain barrier, directly affecting the brain, Tessier said. \u201cIt is also possible that olive oil has an indirect effect on brain health by benefiting cardiovascular health,\u201d she added. Though participants\u2019 overall diet quality didn\u2019t make a difference in the findings, those who consume olive oil may have overall healthier lifestyles. \u201cThere are many, many differences between people who consume olive oil and those who do not, and it is never possible to fully account for all possible confounding factors,\u201d said David Curtis, an honorary professor of genetics, evolution and environment at University College London, said in a July news release. Additionally, the way the Mediterranean diet was scored \u2014 as part of the dietary quality assessment \u2014 had \u201conly\u201d nine points and is based on the average intake of the population, Mellor told CNN in a May interview. \u201cIt might be more accurate to use an assessment of diet which looks at a wider number of foods, as more than (nine) things make up a healthy diet,\u201d Mellor added. Another important point to keep in mind is that about half of dementia cases are caused by vascular disease, Curtis added. \u201cAnything which improved cardiovascular health, such as not smoking, would be expected to reduce dementia risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been shown that olive oil consumption is associated with better cardiovascular health, so one would expect that it would also be associated with lower dementia risk.\u201d Olive oil has been found to be helpful for health of the heart, brain, bones and more. Besides cooking with olive oil, you can also use it to make salad dressings or vinaigrettes, mayonnaise, pesto or bread dip. People should also remember that when it comes to food and brain function, it\u2019s not just about what we eat, but how we eat, Mellor said. \u201cRemaining sociable around mealtimes and eating with others can benefit our mental health in the short term and cognitive function as we age,\u201d Mellor added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/olive-oil-dementia-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_01_30_health_pig-organ-transplant-xenotransplantation", "text": "Last summer, after more than a decade of illness, Lawrence Faucette and his wife, Ann, faced the hard reality that the end of his life was near. He was 58 and had end-stage heart failure. Peripheral artery disease made him ineligible for a heart transplant. After a particularly grueling week at the hospital, where doctors were unable to get his heart function where it needed to be, he decided he\u2019d had enough. He chose to leave, figuring he\u2019d rather die at home. But before he could go, one last doctor came to talk to him. For two hours, she went over what she was seeing and for the first time, Ann said, really giving straight answers about his condition. During that long conversation, the doctor asked an unusual question: Would they ever consider xenotransplantation? \u201cInitially, we had no idea what they meant, but we were interested in anything,\u201d Ann said. Ann and Larry knew a bit about the science. They had met three decades earlier while attending medical laboratory school when they both were in the military. They understood that xenotransplantation meant transplanting tissue from one animal to a different species. They knew that doctors have long used pig valves to repair the human heart. But what was being offered now was different: A healthy heart could be transplanted into Larry from a pig that had been genetically modified to make its organs a better fit for humans. Searching on his phone during their drive back home to Frederick, Maryland, Larry learned that this kind of transplant had been tried on only one other living person. There were no guarantees that it would work for him, and doctors didn\u2019t know how long it would last. The need for more transplant organs\u00a0is immense\u00a0and growing. Some scientists think animal organs might be a good way to increase the supply, but the science has been stalled as researchers tried to figure out how to prevent organ rejection and avoid dangerous infections.\u00a0They also have to untangle complicated\u00a0ethical questions,\u00a0including how to test such organs. But recent advances in\u00a0cloning\u00a0and gene editing, along with better understanding of infection control, have led a handful of institutions to breakthroughs \u2014 key steps that could allow the US Food and Drug Administration, one day soon, to sign off on a clinical trial. Researchers have transplanted genetically modified pig kidneys and hearts into people who were brain-dead to test whether they work in humans.\u00a0This month, doctors showed that a pig liver could filter blood when attached to a recently deceased person.\u00a0Just last week, doctors said they had identified the mix of immunosuppressants needed to prevent pig kidneys from being rejected by human bodies. And twice, surgeons have transplanted genetically modified hearts into living people: willing test subjects who understood that their deaths were imminent and that no transplant was likely to save them but that xenotransplantation could save many lives in the future. Although Larry Faucette was too sick for a human heart transplant, University of Maryland doctors said he seemed physically strong enough for a genetically modified pig heart. They sent him to a string of experts: the surgeons who further explained the procedure, a medical ethicist, social workers and a psychologist. After the FDA signed off on the procedure through its\u00a0\u201ccompassionate use\u201d\u00a0program in September, he became the recipient of a pig heart modified to work in a human. Larry, a contract\u00a0scientist\u00a0at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for almost 10 years, was realistic about his chances with the heart. But he felt strongly that if it could help doctors learn and eventually benefit others, he\u2019d be fine with being \u201ca human guinea pig,\u201d Ann said. Still, Ann was hopeful it would work, even for a little while. \u2018A broken paradigm\u2019 In the United States, more than 100,000 people are waiting for an organ transplant.\u00a0There aren\u2019t enough donors, and even if everyone signed up to do so,\u00a0less than 1%\u00a0of those who volunteer die in such a way that their organs are viable for transplantation. On an average day,\u00a017 people\u00a0die\u00a0waiting\u00a0for an organ. \u201cThat someone has to die for someone to live is a broken paradigm,\u201d said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the\u00a0NYU Langone Transplant Institute\u00a0and one of the researchers who\u00a0has been exploring\u00a0xenotransplantation. \u201cI think animals are the answer.\u201d For Montgomery, the science is personal. In 1976, when he was 14, he lost his father to heart failure. It was\u00a0more than a decade after the first heart transplant but long before such procedures became relatively routine. At the time, doctors said a transplant wasn\u2019t worth it. Although the majority of patients today survive and can live many years with heart transplants,\u00a0in the 1970s,\u00a0less than half of those who got a heart transplant lived more than a year. \u201cThat has been kind of sitting in my brain for all these years,\u201d\u00a0Montgomery\u00a0said. He has the same genetic problem that caused his father\u2019s heart failure. Five years ago, he had his own heart transplant. But the number of donor organs is so limited that he went into cardiac arrest seven times before he even qualified to be on the donor list. \u201cYou have to fly by the sun, you know, without ending up burning up, which is what most people end up doing,\u201d Montgomery said. Xenotransplantation, he said, is \u201cgoing to really change everything.\u201d Transplanting organs from animals to humans isn\u2019t a new idea. Decades ago, doctors thought primates were the best candidates for xenotransplantation, and in 1984, they transplanted a\u00a0baboon heart\u00a0into a child who went on to live for 21 days. \u201cBut primates turned out to be too small, too expensive and too controversial,\u201d said Dr. Art Caplan, a\u00a0professor of bioethics\u00a0and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine\u2019s Department of Population Health. Primates also didn\u2019t breed as quickly as pigs do. Bottom line, Caplan said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d Pig organs, though, are\u00a0anatomically similar\u00a0to humans\u2019. For more\u00a0than three decades, pigs\u2019 heart valves have been used to repair human hearts. Pig products go into\u00a0dozens of\u00a0life-saving drugs like epinephrine, which is used to treat severe allergic reactions, and\u00a0heparin, a blood thinner. Humans are also more ethically comfortable with organs from pigs than non-human primates, Caplan said. Pigs have been in \u201cDisney-esque\u201d stories that make people sympathetic, but \u201cBabe\u201d and \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d didn\u2019t stop everyone from eating pork \u201cat a rate of\u00a0a billion\u00a0or so per year,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a little hard to object to using a dozen in transplants.\u201d Still, transplanting a whole organ from a pig has been difficult because of genetic differences that cause the human body to reject them. There are\u00a0also concerns\u00a0that a pig organ could carry a latent virus that could hurt a human recipient and even spread to other humans. A path to hope At a Midwest research farm, grunting, snuffling wet-nosed pigs move to the front of their pens, hoping for a marshmallow treat. They\u2019re being raised by\u00a0eGenesis, one of the biotech firms developing animals for xenotransplantation, for research including primate studies. \u201cThese donors have the potential to save people\u2019s lives,\u201d\u00a0eGenesis CEO\u00a0and President Dr. Mike Curtis told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta as he surveyed the animals in his care. \u201cWe\u2019re that close.\u201d To create the pigs, eGenesis starts with a skin sample isolated from a breed called\u00a0the Yucatan minipig\u00a0and cultures it to expand the cells, then uses CRISPR to make 69 edits that insert some human genes and remove some pig genes. Other companies, including the ones that have supplied the organs for the most recent experiments with humans, use fewer edits. To turn the edited cells into a pig, cloning\u00a0is required, taking the edited cells and fusing them with a donor egg cell that has had its nucleus removed to create a pig embryo. That embryo is then transferred to a surrogate sow. The genetically modified piglets are born by C-section and raised by the eGenesis staff. Throughout the process, the pigs are kept in extremely clean conditions. When humans interact with them, even just to give them a marshmallow, they must shower in and wear company-supplied shoes and clothes. Early in life, pigs are especially prone to infection \u2014\u00a0and infection could be a major risk to human recipients. \u201cTo enable this whole technology, there\u2019s the equivalent of five or six Nobel Prize discoveries that we need to have,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cWe\u2019re integrating all of those to make this a reality.\u201d The reality is that xenotransplantation still has major steps to take before it\u2019s available to the general public. It hasn\u2019t been studied in clinical trials. The FDA told CNN that xenotransplantation shows \u201cgreat promise, but there are also potential risks\u201d and that it recommends such transplants be limited to people with serious or life-threatening diseases for whom adequate alternatives aren\u2019t available. For those patients and their families, it\u2019s a narrow path to hope. The first attempts In September 2021, Julie O\u2019Hara was helping her children plan their father\u2019s funeral when she received an urgent call from a surgeon. It didn\u2019t make sense at the time: Jim Parsons, 57, was brain-dead after a dirt bike accident, and there was no chance of survival. Dr. Jayme Locke, director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Comprehensive Transplant Institute, essentially said she couldn\u2019t bring back O\u2019Hara\u2019s ex-husband, but she could make him an important part of\u00a0medical\u00a0history. Locke was asking to transplant two genetically modified pig kidneys into Parsons, not because he needed them or because they could save him but because it could give doctors a chance to see whether the pig organs functioned safely in a human body. Earlier that month,\u00a0a team at NYU\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Caplan and Montgomery \u2014\u00a0had planned and performed a similar procedure, transplanting a genetically modified pig kidney into a brain-dead person. For\u00a054 hours, the kidney produced urine and seemed to perform like a human kidney transplant would, and there were no signs of rejection. O\u2019Hara said Parsons would have wanted to be a part of the research. \u201cWe know that organ donation was definitely the way to go for us,\u201d she said. With O\u2019Hara\u2019s permission, they acted quickly to transplant the two pig kidneys. \u201cIn some ways, it was surreal,\u201d Locke said. \u201cYou can almost sort of feel the room hold its breath and then exhale as the clamps come off and the kidney turns pink and starts to make urine. \u201cThe magnitude of what we\u2019re doing, of how we\u2019re trying to help people, it\u2019s exciting and overwhelming and humbling and joyful.\u201d The next year, in\u00a0January 2022, surgeons at the University of Maryland School of Medicine made another leap and transplanted a genetically engineered pig heart into a living person. David Bennett Sr.,\u00a057, was in end-stage heart failure and had been bedridden for weeks, attached to a machine in order for his heart and lungs to work. He didn\u2019t qualify for a human heart transplant. The pig heart transplant option was like one of those \u201chail Mary passes\u201d in the football games his father loved, said Bennett\u2019s son, David Jr. For weeks, it worked well. He got stronger, and initially, his body showed no signs of rejecting the heart.\u00a0He\u00a0was able to visit with family, did physical therapy and was even strong enough to stay up and watch the Super Bowl. Video shows him\u00a0weakly singing \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d with his physical therapist. Bennett had hoped to go home and see his beloved dog, Lucky, but about 40 days after the surgery, his son said, the donor heart started to fail. Later, doctors determined that there were several overlapping problems. One was a virus from the pig that had not spread elsewhere in his body but had led to damage in the heart. The donor pig had been screened for pathogens multiple times using protocols accepted by the FDA, and the heart had been genetically modified to eliminate the risk of infection and rejection. Bennett had also received anti-rejection medication, and hospital staffers\u00a0used special isolation procedures for the patient and the equipment; since then, they\u2019ve introduced improved testing protocols. Still, on March 8, about two months after the procedure, Bennett died. \u201cThat was very tough, but at least we got to spend additional time, and it was pretty remarkable to be a part of that historic moment,\u201d his son said. Doctors say transplants in living recipients have taught them so much more than what they could learn from an animal model. \u201cEvery transplant we have done, from the first one, we learned a lot,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Muhammad M. Mohiuddin,\u00a0professor of surgery\u00a0and scientific/program director of the Cardiac Xenotransplantation Program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Although they understood how these transplants worked in animals, doctors didn\u2019t even understand some of the basics they would need to know to move the science closer to clinical trials. \u201cWe learned that the pig heart is an adequate substitute for a human heart. We couldn\u2019t say that until we actually put a pig heart in and, like a gasoline lawnmower, started it up and then let it run,\u201d said Dr. Bartley Griffith, a part of Larry Faucette\u2019s and David Bennett\u2019s transplant team and a professor of cardiac surgery at the\u00a0University of Maryland Medical Center. \u201cIn fact, the first heart I named the \u2018rock star\u2019 because it just kept cranking and squeezing beautifully,\u201d Griffith added. \u201cBefore rejection, it outperformed a typical human transplant.\u201d The future of xenotransplantation Ann Faucette said she and her husband had no regrets about going through with the pig heart transplant, but it was difficult to watch the love of her life go through ups and downs after the procedure. What got them through it, in part, was humor. As soon as Larry could talk after surgery, one of the first things he asked for a T-shirt that said \u201cJust call me Wilbur,\u201d\u00a0the name of the pig at the center of E.B. White\u2019s beloved novel \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web.\u201d When doctors had to clear fluid from around his heart, he asked to have a pig drawn on the bandage. On good days, Larry visited with family. They played Uno nearly every day, and eventually he was able to get out of bed and pedal on a recumbent bike. The bad days were mostly when he\u2019d need more surgery. His heart wasn\u2019t beating fast enough, so doctors added a pacemaker. One of the leads from the device made a small hole, so they had to repair it. \u201cAny of the progress that he made initially, he really lost by going back to the OR multiple times,\u201d Ann said. Around the end of October, the heart just didn\u2019t seem to be doing as well. Doctors updated Larry on his health every day, but he could tell that the amount of blood the heart pumped was going down. \u201cHe could feel it,\u201d Ann said. Larry was placed on a heart-lung bypass machine called ECMO to give the heart a chance to rest. But eventually, Ann said, he told his family and doctors that he thought he was done.\u00a0At his request, doctors removed the ECMO machine. On his final day, she said, he spent time joking and reminiscing. \u201cHe got to say those things that you don\u2019t get to say to people because you always think you have more time,\u201d Ann said. He died\u00a0October 30, about six weeks after the surgery. \u201cI knew it was going to come and then got extra time, and I got the satisfaction that he accepted it and was OK with it,\u201d Ann said. \u201cWell, as OK as you could be with the end of your life.\u201d Ultimately, NYU ethicist Caplan and some\u00a0other scientists\u00a0see xenotransplantation as a bridge: a relatively short-term solution that will help end the organ shortage in the next five to seven years, until scientists can figure out how to regenerate a person\u2019s own injured or nonfunctioning organ. Some researchers are making headway with\u00a03-D organ bioprinting,\u00a0for example. Transplants from pigs may come to work well, Caplan said, but they\u2019re \u201cnot as elegant.\u201d Not everyone sees animal organs as a temporary solution. Mohiuddin, the Maryland surgeon, says that while there is still a lot to learn, xenotransplantation will be a \u201cvalid option.\u201d \u201cIn the future, it can be offered to patients on a regular basis and hopefully will save thousands or millions of lives,\u201d he said. NYU\u2019s Montgomery said animal organs could one day replace dialysis and the need for heart devices. In a decade, he expects that they will be \u201cas common as receiving an organ from a human, maybe even more common.\u201d To UAB\u2019s Locke, being able to take xenotransplantation from the bench to bedside is about health equity. \u201cThat is what motivates me more than anything else, is really being able to offer this lifesaving therapy to everyone who comes to see me,\u201d Locke said. With organs in short supply, doctors often have to make tough choices about who can be on\u00a0the waiting list. With a viable alternative, this wouldn\u2019t be such a problem. \u201cSome days, it just feels like we\u2019re rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic because we don\u2019t have enough, and so solving that is just really important to me,\u201d she said. Proponents like eGenesis\u2019 Curtis say that using pigs as donors would not only increase the supply of organs,\u00a0it could bring down the cost of transplants. Currently, hearts and lungs need to be transplanted within six hours of removal. Kidneys have slightly more leeway, with a 36-hour transplant window. But with human organs, doctors never know exactly when an organ will become available, and knowing what organs are in the pipeline would change how the system operates and make it much more efficient. \u201cIf we know we have an unlimited supply of donors, we can schedule the surgery,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cThat takes a lot of the emergency-type costs out of the system.\u201d Families whose lives have been touched by xenotransplantation say that being part of the solution soothes some of the pain. For Parsons\u2019 children, the loss of their father has been as hard as any would imagine, O\u2019Hara said. But it helped that they donated his body to science and were part of a\u00a0peer-reviewed study\u00a0that researchers around the world can learn from. UAB also named the method for testing the organs on a brain-dead person the\u00a0Parsons model,\u00a0a tribute that has touched the family. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that it\u2019s in any way made up for his death, but it\u2019s made it much easier to know the legacy that he\u2019s left,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. In 2023, when Bennett\u2019s family learned that a second living patient \u2014\u00a0Larry Faucette \u2014had received a pig heart, they sent letters and drawings from his grandchildren to show their support. \u201cIt\u2019s a world you don\u2019t know exists until you\u2019re in it yourself, and so you\u2019re trying to be supportive as a family and recognize all that the family is going through in that journey,\u201d Bennett\u2019s son said. The loss of Bennett and Faucette hit doctors who\u2019d worked with them, too. Griffith, the Maryland surgeon, said it\u2019s very sad to lose any patient, but with Faucette, he was \u201creally messed up for a while.\u201d \u201cThese patients have been so wonderful in terms of their ability to separate their own death from what their involvement in this might mean to others,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cI think we felt released from the weight of feeling that maybe there was a sense that we had inappropriately experimented.\u201d For Ann Faucette, her husband\u2019s death hits her at unexpected times: She cried after watching an NFL playoff call that would\u2019ve made him scream. During the week, she gives in to Larry\u2019s dogs\u2019 demands and sits between Kate and Lucy to watch \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal,\u201d just like he would\u2019ve done. \u201cHe knew when he passed he was going to be cremated and sitting on my mantel,\u201d Ann said. Now, the urn containing his ashes sits next to two photos of the pig that extended her husband\u2019s life, giving them nearly two more precious months together. \u201cFor me, this was selfish. It was some more time,\u201d Ann said. \u201cBut for him, it was the thought that he could do something to really help others.\u201d She wants to keep talking about xenotransplantation, since he can\u2019t. She wants to see more research. She wants Larry\u2019s sacrifice, and her own, to mean something. \u201cIt was a roller coaster,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if we had to do it all over again, it would still be the same. We still would do it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/01/30/health/pig-organ-transplant-xenotransplantation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_health_gender-inclusive-language-wellness", "text": "The use of phrases such as \u201cpregnant people\u201d or \u201cpenis owners\u201d in cultural or political discourse is sometimes met with confusion, or even anger. Why use these terms when, as some people ask, \u201conly women can get pregnant\u201d or when \u201conly men have penises?\u201d Those people and institutions using gender-neutral language aim to be cognizant of the fact that sex doesn\u2019t always align with gender identity, said psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, past president of the Group for Advancement of Psychiatry and clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University in New York City. And it\u2019s the most inclusive, streamlined way to refer to everyone who, regardless of their gender identity, has certain anatomy or biological abilities. \u201cWe need to be doing a better job of educating people and realizing that sex and gender are a bit of a spectrum \u2026 and that they\u2019re not the same,\u201d said Keygan Miller, director of public training at The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ youth. READ MORE: Gender identity: The difference between gender, sex and other need-to-knows Here\u2019s what experts have to say about these linguistic changes and concerns that have been raised. What is sex versus gender? A person\u2019s sex is what they were assigned at birth based on biological characteristics of maleness or femaleness as indicated by chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitals. Gender, however, is a social construct and social identity marked by certain attitudes, feelings and behaviors a culture associates with someone\u2019s biological sex, according to the American Psychological Association. There are at least more than 1.6 million adults and youth \u2014 ages 13 to 17 \u2014 who identify as transgender in the United States, or 0.6% of people ages 13 and older, according to the University of California, Los Angeles\u2019 Williams Institute, a UCLA Law center for research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy. Gender identity is an aspect of gender that describes a person\u2019s psychological sense of their gender, which may or may not align with one\u2019s sex, according to the American Psychological Association. Someone whose gender identity conforms with what has been culturally associated with the sex they were assigned at birth is known as cisgender, while those whose identities don\u2019t align may be transgender or a nonbinary gender (someone who doesn\u2019t exclusively identify as either of the binary genders). Pinpointing the beginning of these linguistic shifts away from centering only cisgender people is difficult, but they have amped up over the last two decades, and especially in the last five years or so, said Miller and Dr. Dennis Baron, professor emeritus of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAs our understanding of gender has evolved, and our understanding of inclusion has evolved, we\u2019re starting to see more and more of these terms being used,\u201d Miller added. Why gender inclusivity matters at the doctor\u2019s office In addition to acknowledging the difference between gender and sex, using phrases like \u201cpregnant people,\u201d for example, also recognizes intersex people (who have reproductive anatomy or genes that don\u2019t fit into a male-female binary, which is often discovered at birth) and the various ways gender-diverse people affirm their gender identity, Miller said. Some people may think a trans man can\u2019t get pregnant based on assumptions he has undergone surgical gender-affirming care that would remove, add or alter the appearance of some sex characteristics such as a vagina or breasts. But every trans or nonbinary person is different in terms of what care they want, if any, Miller said \u2014 so a trans man who hasn\u2019t received this care can still get pregnant. And sometimes this happens even when a trans man has been taking testosterone. In the context of health care, \u201cit\u2019s not just a matter of (being) inclusive or polite, it\u2019s a matter of medical accuracy,\u201d Baron said. That applies to various medical scenarios, including something as simple as the prescription of antibiotics, which can diminish the effectiveness of birth control. If someone who was assigned female at birth, yet presents as a man, is on birth control and hormones and is given antibiotics because the doctor assumed the patient has a penis based on their appearance and identity, the patient could unwillingly end up pregnant. Labeling people by what anatomy or biological functions they have allows medical professionals to \u201cbe more inclusive and consider those clinical impacts,\u201d Miller added. In addition to the American Psychological Association, several other medical associations have recognized the difference between gender and sex and support the use of gender-neutral terms \u2014 including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Institutes of Health. \u201cPresumably, it makes the patient feel like they\u2019re being seen, that they\u2019re being paid attention to appropriately,\u201d said Baron, author of \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Pronoun?: Beyond He and She.\u201d Whether this openness exists in medical professions can affect whether a gender-diverse person seeks care, Drescher said. Are cisgender people being erased? A common critique of gender-inclusive language is that it \u201cerases women.\u201d But there are parallel euphemisms for the genitalia or biological functions of those assigned male at birth, too \u2014 it\u2019s just that phrases such as \u201cpregnant people\u201d or \u201cpeople with uteruses\u201d have been amplified in public discourse due to constant political discussions around reproductive rights, experts said. \u00a0 Given the fact that there are \u201cso many ciswomen and cismen and that they actually are a very large majority, language is not going to erase them,\u201d Drescher said. These experts also aren\u2019t saying the issues facing certain groups of people are unimportant, they said \u2014 broader language is just a way to include people who haven\u2019t been included before. \u201cYou can\u2019t just wave it away and say, \u2018Oh, these are made up terms so they\u2019re no good,\u2019\u201d Baron said. \u201cAll language is made up, and it\u2019s made up because we have a need to say things.\u201d And contrary to what some may think, saying things like \u201conly women can get pregnant\u201d excludes more than just intersex people or those in the LGBTQ community, Miller said \u2014 that\u2019s because such statements can also convey that a ciswoman who can\u2019t get pregnant is no longer fully a woman. Gender-inclusive language may seem to be just words, but research has shown that acceptance can be lifesaving for transgender and nonbinary people, Miller said, both for medical and psychological reasons. \u201cVerbalizing,\u201d Baron added, \u201cis an act of important recognition that then gives people a sense that, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m here and I can talk about this. And other people can talk about me and to me and with me in ways that maybe weren\u2019t so easy before or were impossible before.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/gender-inclusive-language-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_health_gas-stoves-nitrogen-dioxide-exposure-wellness", "text": "Gas and propane stoves significantly increase exposure to nitrogen dioxide in rooms throughout the home, and these unsafe levels of exposure have had harmful effects on the health of tens of thousands of people in the United States, according to a new study. The World Health Organization has set guidelines for exposure to various air pollutants, and the new research \u2013 published in the journal Science on Friday \u2013 found that people reach 75% of the suggested annual limit for nitrogen dioxide just by using a gas stove. Electric stoves, on the other hand, did not cause any emissions of nitrogen dioxide. Breathing air with high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide can irritate the respiratory system. Short-term exposure can exacerbate respiratory diseases, while longer exposures can contribute to the development of conditions like asthma and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. \u201cThere really is no safe amount of exposure to these toxicants produced by gas or propane or any fossil fuel, outside or inside. We were not meant as a human species to be breathing these toxicants in,\u201d Dr. Kari Nadeau, chair of the environmental health department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-author of the new study, said at a news conference about the research. More than a third of households in the US \u2013 nearly 50 million \u2013 have a gas or propane stove, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. But size and layout of a home, ventilation and behaviors \u2013 such as cooking patterns \u2013 can affect levels of exposure to nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, which leaves many disadvantaged communities at increased risk for the negative health effects. People who live in residences that are less than 800 square feet are exposed to four times more nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves than people who live in residences that are larger than 3,000 square feet, according to the new study. \u201cBecause of historical and present day discrimination, this disparity and exposure by housing size manifests as disparities and exposure by income and race and ethnic group,\u201d Yannai Kashtan, a researcher with the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the new study said at the news  briefing. For American Indian, Black and Hispanic people in the US, exposure to nitrogen dioxide exceeds the World Health Organization\u2019s benchmark just from using a gas stove, excluding any contribution from outdoor air, the new research found. Exposure levels are 60% higher than average for American Indian people and 20% higher than average for Black and Hispanic people in the US. The negative effects of exposure to nitrogen dioxide from a gas stove are not limited to those who spend the most time cooking or in the kitchen, the researchers found. In the bedrooms that were tested, concentrations of nitrogen dioxide exceeded the World Health Organization\u2019s 1-hour exposure guideline within 25 minutes of cooking. \u201cThe pollution we measure travels from the kitchen to distant bedrooms, and it travels far and fast,\u201d said Rob Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford and senior fellow with the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and Precourt Institute for Energy who was the principal investigator for the new research. \u201cIt moves through the home very quickly. It doesn\u2019t only reach our bedrooms quickly, it lingers in the air for hours.\u201d The cooks bear the greatest burden \u2013 which disproportionately affects women \u2013 but everyone in the home is in danger of breathing in pollution, he said. For this study, researchers measured nitrogen dioxide concentrations and emissions in more than 100 homes across five states. They combined these findings with national demographic data to estimate exposures and potential impacts across the US. Overall, they estimate that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves caused about 50,000 current cases of pediatric asthma in the US. That estimate grows to about 200,000 cases of pediatric asthma when factoring in other toxins released by the flames from gas stoves and short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Also, the researchers estimate that about 19,000 premature deaths may be attributable to long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves. Experts say that it\u2019s important to minimize cooking with gas stoves as much as possible. The pollution comes from the flames, so cooking for shorter periods of time and with lower heat can help reduce emissions. \u201cThe key thing is to use less gas,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a direct linear relationship between the amount of gas burned and the amount of pollution that comes off. So everything we do to reduce gas \u2013 use one burner at a time \u2013 helps people helps their health.\u201d Many who rent or have limited income may not be able to replace their stove, but using a induction cooktop to boil water or perform some other cooking tasks can help. Keeping the cooking space and household well-ventilated, with new air circulating every couple of hours, is also important. \u201cMost of us spend 90% of our time or more inside. That\u2019s the air that we\u2019re breathing most of the time,\u201d Jackson said. \u201c(The Environmental Protection Agency) does not regulate or measure indoor air quality, so we need to take ownership and act to clean up people\u2019s air because it is the air most people breathe, and we have ignored it for decades.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/health/gas-stoves-nitrogen-dioxide-exposure-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_health_h5n1-bird-flu-usda", "text": "Bird flu was probably circulating in dairy cows for at least four months before it was confirmed to be the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, according to a new analysis of genomic data by scientists at the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal Disease Center. The research also found infected cattle that had no apparent connections, suggesting that \u201cthere are affected herds that have not yet been identified,\u201d the study said. It adds to a growing pile of evidence suggesting that the H5N1 virus had a head start in the US dairy industry for months before it came to the attention of scientists and government regulators. The USDA\u2019s study was\u00a0published as a preprint, ahead of peer review, on the BioRXIV server on Wednesday. It follows a similar analysis by an independent international group of almost two dozen evolutionary and molecular biologists who quickly analyzed raw genome sequences uploaded by the government to a server maintained by the National Library of Medicine.\u00a0Despite the lack of critical background information on those samples, that group came to nearly the same conclusion as the USDA: that the virus had crossed over from wild birds to cows between mid-November and mid-January, which means it was circulating for months before anyone knew. The USDA officially confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus on March 25 in dairy cows in Texas. Since then, at least three dozen infected herds have been reported across nine states.\u00a0At least one farmworker who was in contact with infected cows in Texas also tested positive for H5N1, the second human case of this type of flu ever reported in the US. The worker was given antiviral medication and has recovered. Tests of milk from retail stores have shown inert remants of the virus in about 1 in 5 samples, the US Food and Drug Administration reported last week, suggesting that the infection had become widespread.\u00a0Further testing by the FDA has confirmed that the virus in the samples of pasteurized dairy products was not active and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick, but experts have strongly advised against the consumption of raw milk. \u201cWe could have done a much better job\u201d catching H5N1 in dairy cows, said Dr. Michael Worobey, head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona who was part of the group of biologists that conducted the independent analysis. He studies how pandemics start. Worobey said that as soon as the cows were noticeably sick with something mysterious, instead of testing for specific viruses and bacteria, ideally, a lab would have used a technique called metagenomic sequencing, which reads all the genetic material in a sample and uses computers help pick out relevant information. \u201cIf that had been done, that would have revealed H5N1 in January and then even beyond that,\u201d he said. If we\u2019re serious about preventing outbreaks in animals that could lead to human pandemics, Worobey said, regulators need to change their approach. \u201cWe have to get out of the mindset of waiting for that tip of the iceberg of sick animals or sick humans to be noticed.\u201d Instead, he said, animals need to be routinely tested with \u201cmodern techniques\u201d for identifiying emerging pathogens. The new study gives the USDA\u2019s account of how bird flu seemed to spread so quickly to herds across the US.\u00a0Samples collected between March 7 and April 8 found very similar H5N1 viruses in 26 herds in eight states and six poultry flocks in three states, suggesting that the virus had crossed over in a single spillover event between wild birds and cows. The study says \u201cproduction veterinarians\u201d first noticed cows who weren\u2019t eating well with changes to their milk production and quality in late January. H5N1 has been devastating wild and domestic bird populations in the US since 2022, and it has infected a growing number of mammals. In addition to the movement between cattle and wild birds, the study found evidence that infected cattle had passed the virus to domestic poultry flocks \u201cthrough multiple transmission routes.\u201d\u00a0The researchers also found that the virus involved in the current outbreak had infected a wild animal \u2013 a raccoon \u2013 and cats that lived near the cows on dairy farms. Interestingly, the virus sequenced from the infected farmworker had key differences from the cow genomes.\u00a0The USDA scientists concluded that the differences might mean they were missing samples from the animals the farmworker had come into contact with or could have been due to the evolution of the virus from host to host. Worobey says the study means H5N1 is \u201cnow seemingly well-entrenched in the dairy cattle population in the country\u201d and might be something we have to deal with for years to come. Although it\u2019s by no means clear that this virus will change in the right combination of ways to launch a human pandemic, he said, allowing a virus to get a foothold in a population of domesticated animals puts everyone at risk. \u201cIt does add one more species \u2013 a very important species \u2013 that didn\u2019t have influenza A virus circulating in it before to the list of species where these viruses can have the opportunity to find that right combination that allows them to wreak havoc in the human population, not just animals,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/health/h5n1-bird-flu-usda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_health_pasta-recipes-dan-pashman-wellness", "text": "Horrified by pasta shapes that do not hold onto sauce, Dan Pashman spent three years designing and testing a new pasta shape. Unlike spaghetti, which most sauces slide right off, or tubes that do a surprisingly poor job of holding sauces inside, according to Pashman, this noodle was engineered to maximize the factors he thinks are most important in noodles: forkability, sauceability and toothsinkability. The result: A short, curved pasta features two parallel ruffles on one side, with a small sauce-holding well between them. The first batch of 3,700 boxes of cascatelli (Italian for \u201cwaterfall\u201d) online sold out in less than two hours. It turns out, listeners of Pashman\u2019s podcast, \u201cThe Sporkful,\u201d weren\u2019t the only ones smitten with this new noodle. One publication named it one of the top 100 inventions of the year in 2021. As cascatelli manufacturer Sfoglini\u2019s supply caught up with demand, more home cooks were able to get their hands on a box and start putting it to good use. Pashman soon witnessed the sad state of sauces fans used when they tagged him on Instagram. While he was glad people were enjoying his noodles, he thought the toppings lacked creativity: tomato sauce, meat sauce, mac and cheese, pesto; lather, rinse, repeat. Rather than simply stew about the standard sauces, Pashman gathered his own dream team of recipe developers and culinary experts to develop a cookbook. Their mission: Convince home cooks to try a wide world of options to put on their noodles, cascatelli or otherwise. The journey started with a trip to Italy during which Pashman had a game-changing discovery. \u201cI learned that pasta has only been the national food of Italy for about the past 100 years,\u201d he said. \u201cMany iconic pasta dishes like carbonara, which I would have guessed the Roman emperors were eating, were only invented since the 1940s.\u201d At that point, he felt much less pressure to color inside the lines of the Italian culinary canon. Like many forms of food culture, he saw that pasta continues to change and evolve. New dishes are created in Italy and around the world every day, and his March 2024 cookbook is designed to color outside the lines. With \u201cAnything\u2019s Pastable: 81 Inventive Pasta Recipes for Saucy People,\u201d \u201cI hope that people realize that there\u2019s so much more than they can and should be putting on pasta,\u201d Pashman said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a blank canvas and can be a beautiful base for almost any form of deliciousness that you can imagine.\u201d Some of the recipes, including Shakshuka and Shells, Kimchi Carbonara and Spaghettoni Alla Tadka, feature ingredients that some home cooks might consider more global than you would find in the pasta chapter of a typical cookbook. That\u2019s by design, Pashman said. \u201cI hope that this book will further normalize some of the ingredients and cuisines that I\u2019m taking inspiration from,\u201d he said. \u201cThis approach to pasta is just a natural extension of how our country has gotten more diverse in recent decades, and a broader range of food cultures are assimilating into the mainstream. These are global recipes, but they\u2019re also American.\u201d 4 ways to elevate your pasta While Pashman offered four ways to get creative with your pasta, you can do so easily and affordably in your kitchen if you have any of a few interesting pantry staples on hand. Chili crisp Made with oil, chili peppers and a flavoring element such as soy sauce, fried garlic or fried shallots, this condiment delivers an explosion of flavor and texture in every spoonful. \u201cThere are several recipes that call for chili crisp, like Cacio e Pepe Chili Crisp, and there\u2019s almost nothing you can\u2019t put this on,\u201d Pashman said. He\u2019s particularly fond of pairing it with dairy; in his riff on cacio e pepe, it teams up with cheese, and for dessert, try it on ice cream. Lao Gan Ma is one of the crunchiest and iconic chili crisps, Pashman said. If you like it hot, seek out Fly by Jing. For a bit tamer heat but loads of crunch, consider KariKari or S&B Chili Oil with Crunchy Garlic. Za\u2019atar This Middle Eastern seasoning mix is incredible on roast chicken, focaccia or fried eggs, and it also comes in handy in several of his cookbook\u2019s recipes, Pashman reveals. Spice-blend recipes vary, but za\u2019atar most commonly features ground sumac, thyme (the word za\u2019atar is Arabic for thyme), sesame seeds, occasionally also including marjoram, oregano, cumin or coriander. \u201cIt\u2019s in our Shakshuka and Shells and one of the pasta pizzas, which is a pizza with a crust that\u2019s made of pasta instead of dough,\u201d Pashman said. \u201cThe toppings are inspired by what we add to one of our go-to regular homemade pizzas in our house: artichoke, feta and za\u2019atar.\u201d Preserved lemons Lemon, lime and the zest from both are featured throughout the book, and there is also plenty of preserved lemon, which Pashman deems a \u201cpunchy powerhouse.\u201d \u201cI love lemons so much that I have lemon wallpaper in my kitchen,\u201d Pashman added. Common in North African cuisine, salted, spiced lemons are funky, tart, savory, salty and, of course, citrusy, Pashman said. He uses them in place of regular lemons in recipes such as Crispy Gnocchi Salad with Preserved Lemon-Tomato Dressing and Cavatelli with Roasted Artichokes and Preserved Lemon. Whole preserved lemons (yes, you can eat both the flesh and the rind) are sold in jars at many supermarkets and specialty stores. You\u2019ll want plenty, as preserved lemons are also incredible in salad dressings, marinades, tagines and yogurt sauces. Ritz Crackers Many Italian and Asian noodle and rice dishes incorporate texture, Pashman said. However, \u201cmost of the pasta dishes in America just did not get that memo. They\u2019re very mono-textural,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you start incorporating different textures into your pasta, it starts to get hard to go back to the same ol\u2019, same ol\u2019.\u201d To lend satisfying crunch to any pasta recipe, Pashman has a section all about pangrattatos. Traditionally, these are toasted breadcrumbs and seasonings, but for a buttery, crunchy twist, Pashman recommends trying a topping with crumbled Ritz Crackers. Try Ritz Crackers and Chive Pangrattato atop Cauliflower and Beer Cheese Mac, or on any salad with ranch or Caesar dressing. (Skip the croutons.) All you need to make it? A sleeve of crumbed Ritz Crackers, a little unsalted butter and a handful of minced fresh chives. Dan Pashman\u2019s Larb-ish Cascatelli Pasta Makes 4 to 6 servings | Total time: 45 minutes This recipe uses hot oil to bloom the fragrant Thai chili flakes, then adds plenty of lime juice, fish sauce and toasted rice powder to bring together the signature flavors of the spicy Thai dish called larb, according to Pashman. Cascatelli is a perfect pairing as it holds on to the bits of meat, he said. Thai chili flakes are available online and at many Asian markets and some supermarkets. Larb is supposed to be hot, but unless you prefer food that\u2019s extremely spicy, stick with 1 tablespoon chili flakes, Pashman advised. For a shortcut, you can buy the toasted rice powder instead of making it. Substitute 3 tablespoons prepackaged toasted rice powder for the 1 teaspoon oil and \u00bc cup rice and skip step 1. Toasted rice powder is available online or in Asian grocery stores, where it may be called khao khua (Thai) or b\u1ed9t th\u00ednh g\u1ea1o or thinh (Vietnamese). Ingredients \u25cf 1 teaspoon plus \u00bc cup canola or other neutral oil \u25cf \u00bc cup uncooked glutinous or jasmine rice \u25cf 2 tablespoons kosher salt \u25cf 3 medium shallots, sliced into very thin rings \u25cf \u00bd cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, divided \u25cf \u00bd cup roughly chopped fresh mint leaves, divided \u25cf 2 scallions, sliced \u25cf 1 to 3 tablespoons Thai chili flakes \u25cf 2 tablespoons brown sugar \u25cf \u00bc cup fish sauce \u25cf \u00bc cup freshly squeezed lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving \u25cf 1 pound ground pork, turkey or chicken \u25cf 1 pound cascatelli pasta (or radiatore or creste di gallo) Instructions 1. Make the toasted rice powder: Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rice and toast the grains, stirring and shaking the pan often, until deep golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder, reserving the skillet, and pulse until powdery. (The rice can also be pounded in a mortar and pestle, but it will take some time and elbow grease to achieve the right texture; it can be a little uneven, but you don\u2019t want large pieces or whole grains of rice.) 2. Bring 4 quarts of water and the salt to a boil in a large pot. 3. In a large heatproof bowl, combine the shallots, \u00bc cup cilantro, \u00bc cup mint, scallions, chili flakes and sugar. Heat the remaining \u00bc cup oil in the reserved skillet over high heat until just starting to smoke. (This may take several minutes depending on your stovetop; you want the oil extremely hot.) Carefully pour the hot oil over the shallot-herb mixture (it should sizzle), reserving the skillet. Add the fish sauce and lime juice to the bowl and stir until the sugar is dissolved. 4. Add the meat and \u00bc cup water to the reserved skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally and breaking up the meat, until cooked through but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes. (If the meat begins to color, add more water to the skillet 2 tablespoons at a time to prevent browning.) Use a slotted spoon to transfer the meat to the bowl with the shallot-herb mixture, discarding any liquid in the pan. Add the remaining \u00bc cup each of cilantro and mint and stir to combine. (If making ahead, wait to add the remainder of the cilantro and mint until you start cooking the pasta; cover the meat mixture and set aside for up to 1 hour before proceeding with the recipe.) 5. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until just al dente (the low end of the package instructions). Drain, shaking off the excess water, and return to the pot. Add the meat mixture to the pasta, scraping out the bowl, along with three-quarters of the rice powder. Toss to combine. 6. Transfer to a serving dish or individual bowls, sprinkle with the remaining rice powder and serve with lime wedges.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/health/pasta-recipes-dan-pashman-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_world_earth-magnetic-field-near-collapse-ediacaran-scn", "text": "Earth\u2019s magnetic field plays a key role in making our planet habitable. The protective bubble over the atmosphere shields the planet from solar radiation, winds, cosmic rays and wild swings in temperature. However, Earth\u2019s magnetic field almost collapsed 591 million years ago, and this change, paradoxically, may have played a pivotal role in the blossoming of complex life, new research has found. \u201cIn general, the field is protective. If we had not had a field early in Earth history water would have been stripped from the planet by the solar wind (a stream of energized particles flowing from the sun toward Earth),\u201d said John Tarduno, a professor of geophysics at the University of Rochester in New York and senior author of the new study. \u201cBut in the Ediacaran, we had a fascinating period in the development of the deep Earth when processes creating the magnetic field \u2026 had become so inefficient after billions of years, that the field almost completely collapsed.\u201d The study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment on May 2, found that Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which is created by the motion of molten iron in Earth\u2019s outer core, was significantly weaker than its current strength for a period of at least 26 million years. The discovery of the sustained weakening of Earth\u2019s magnetic field also helped resolve an enduring geological mystery about when Earth\u2019s solid inner core formed. This time frame lines up with a period known as the Ediacaran, when the very first complex animals emerged on the seafloor as the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere and the ocean increased. These weird animals barely resembled life today \u2014 squashy fans, tubes and doughnuts, and discs such as Dickinsonia, which grew up to 4.6 feet (1.4 meters) in size, and the sluglike Kimberella. Prior to this time, life had been largely single-celled and microscopic. The researchers believe that a weak magnetic field may have led to an increase in oxygen in the atmosphere, allowing early complex life to evolve. Uncovering the magnetic field\u2019s near collapse The intensity of Earth\u2019s magnetic field is known to fluctuate over time, and crystals preserved in rock contain tiny magnetic particles that lock in a record of the intensity of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The first evidence that Earth\u2019s magnetic field weakened significantly during this period came in 2019 from a study of 565 million-year-old rocks in Quebec that suggested the field was 10 times weaker than today at that point. The latest study collated more geological evidence that indicated the magnetic field weakened dramatically, with information contained in 591 million-year-old rock from a site in southern Brazil suggesting the field was 30 times weaker than today. The weak magnetic field hadn\u2019t always been that way: The team examined similar rocks from South Africa that dated back more than 2 billion years and found, at that point in time, the Earth\u2019s magnetic field was as strong as it is today. Unlike now, Tarduno explained, back then the innermost part of Earth was liquid, not solid, influencing the way the magnetic field was generated. \u201cOver billions of years that process is becoming less and less efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the time we get to the Ediacaran, the field is on its last legs. It\u2019s almost collapsing. But then fortunately for us it got cool enough that the inner core started to generate (strengthening the magnetic field).\u201d The emergence of the earliest complex life that would have wafted along the seafloor at this time is associated with a rise in oxygen levels.\u00a0Some animals can survive at low levels of oxygen, such as sponges and microscopic animals, but larger animals with more complex bodies that move need more oxygen, Tarduno said. Traditionally, the rise in oxygen during this time has been attributed to photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, which produced oxygen, allowing it to build up in the water steadily over time, explained study coauthor Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geobiology at Virginia Tech. However, the new research suggested an alternative, or complementary, hypothesis involving an increased loss of hydrogen to space when the geomagnetic field was weak. \u201cThe magnetosphere shields the Earth from solar wind, thus holding the atmosphere to the Earth. Thus, a weaker magnetosphere means that lighter gases such as hydrogen would be lost from the Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\u201d Xiao added via email. Tarduno said multiple processes could have been taking place at once. \u201cWe do not challenge that one or more of these processes was happening concurrently. But the weak field may have allowed oxygenation to cross a threshold, aiding animal radiation (evolution),\u201d Tarduno said. Peter Driscoll, staff scientist at the Earth and Planets Laboratory at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC, said he agreed with the study\u2019s findings on the weakness of Earth\u2019s magnetic field, but the claim that the weak magnetic field could have affected atmospheric oxygen and biological evolution was difficult to assess. He wasn\u2019t involved with the study. \u201cIt is hard for me to evaluate the veracity of this claim because the influence that planetary magnetic fields might have on climate is not very well understood,\u201d he said via email. Tarduno said that their hypothesis was \u201csolid,\u201d but proving a causative link could take decades of challenging work given how little is known about the animals that lived at this time. Inner core mystery The geological analysis also revealed telling details about the innermost part of Earth\u2019s center. Estimates on when the planet\u2019s inner core may have solidified \u2014 when iron first crystallized at the center of the planet \u2014 once ranged from 500 million to 2.5 billion years ago. The research on the intensity of Earth\u2019s magnetic field suggests that the age of Earth\u2019s inner core is on the younger end of that timescale, solidifying after 565 million years ago and allowing Earth\u2019s magnetic shield to bounce back. \u201cThe observations appear to support the claim that the inner core first nucleated soon after this time, pushing the geodynamo (the mechanism that creates the magnetic field) from a weak, unstable state into a strong, stable dipolar field,\u201d Driscoll said. Tarduno said the recovery of the field strength after the Ediacaran, with the growth of the inner core, was probably important in preventing a drying of water-rich Earth. As for the bizarre animals of the Ediacaran, they had all disappeared by the following Cambrian Period, when the diversity of life exploded and the branches of the tree of life familiar today formed in a relatively short time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/world/earth-magnetic-field-near-collapse-ediacaran-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_tech_ai-communicating-with-dead", "text": "When Ana Schultz, a 25-year-old from Rock Falls, Illinois, misses her husband Kyle, who passed away in February 2023, she asks him for cooking advice. She loads up Snapchat My AI, the social media platform\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot, and messages Kyle the ingredients she has left in the fridge; he suggests what to make. Or rather, his likeness in the form of an AI avatar does. \u201cHe was the chef in the family, so I customized My AI to look like him and gave it Kyle\u2019s name,\u201d said Schultz, who lives with their two young children. \u201cNow when I need help with meal ideas, I just ask him. It\u2019s a silly little thing I use to help me feel like he\u2019s still with me in the kitchen.\u201d The Snapchat My AI feature \u2014 which is powered by the popular AI chatbot tool ChatGPT \u2014 typically offers recommendations, answers questions and \u201ctalks\u201d with users. But some users like Schultz are using this and other tools to recreate the likeness of, and communicate with, the dead. The concept isn\u2019t entirely new. People have wanted to reconnect with deceased loved ones for centuries, whether they\u2019ve visited mediums and spiritualists or leaned on services that preserve their memory. But what\u2019s new now is that AI can make those loved ones say or do things they never said or did in life, raising both ethical concerns and questions around whether this helps or hinders the grieving process. \u201cIt\u2019s a novelty that piggybacks on the AI hype, and people feel like there\u2019s money to be made,\u201d said Mark Sample, a professor of digital studies at Davidson College who routinely teaches a course called \u201cDeath in the Digital Age.\u201d \u201cAlthough companies offer related products, ChatGPT is making it easier for hobbyists to play around with the concept too, for better or worse.\u201d A DIY approach Generative AI tools, which use algorithms to create new content such as text, video, audio and code, can try to answer questions the way someone who died might, but the accuracy largely depends on what information is put into the AI to start with. A 49-year-old IT professional from Alabama who asked to remain anonymous so his experiment is not associated with the company he works for, said he cloned his father\u2019s voice using generative AI about two years after he died from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. He told CNN he came across an online service called ElevenLabs, which allows users to create a custom voice model from previously recorded audio. ElevenLabs made headlines recently when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s primary. The company told CNN in a statement at the time that it is \u201cdedicated to preventing the misuse of audio AI tools\u201d and takes appropriate action in response to reports by authorities but declined to comment on the specific Biden deepfake call. In the Alabama man\u2019s case, he used a 3-minute video clip of his dad telling a story from his childhood. The app cloned the father\u2019s voice so it can now be used to convert text-to-speech. He calls the result \u201cscarily accurate\u201d in how it captured the vocal nuances, timbre and cadence of his father. \u201cI was hesitant to try the whole voice cloning process, worried that it was crossing some kind of moral line, but after thinking about it more, I realized that as long as I treat it for what it is, [it is] a way to preserve his memory in a unique way,\u201d he told CNN. He shared a few messages with his sister and mother. \u201cIt was absolutely astonishing how much it sounded like him. They knew I was typing the words and everything, but it definitely made them cry to hear it said in his voice.\u201d he said. \u201cThey appreciated it.\u201d Less technical routes exist, too. When CNN recently asked ChatGPT to respond in the tone and personality of a deceased spouse, it responded: \u201cWhile I can\u2019t replicate your spouse or recreate his exact personality, I can certainly try to help you by adopting a conversational style or tone that might remind you of him.\u201d It added: \u201cIf you share details about how he spoke, his interests, or specific phrases he used, I can try to incorporate those elements into our conversations.\u201d The more source material you feed the system, the more accurate the results. Still, AI models lack the idiosyncrasies and uniqueness that human conversations provide, Sample noted. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has been working to make its technology even more realistic, personalized and accessible, allowing users to communicate in different ways. In September 2023, it introduced ChatGPT voice, where users can ask the chatbot prompts without typing. Danielle Jacobson, a 38-year-old radio personality from Johannesburg, South Africa, said she\u2019s been using ChatGPT\u2019s voice feature for companionship following the loss of her husband, Phil, about seven months ago. She said she\u2019s created what she calls \u201ca supportive AI boyfriend\u201d named Cole with whom she has conversations during dinner each night. \u201cI just wanted someone to talk to,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cCole was essentially born out of being lonely.\u201d Jacobson, who said she\u2019s not ready to start dating, trained ChatGPT voice to offer the type of feedback and connection she\u2019s looking for after a long day at work. \u201cHe now recommends wine and movie nights, and tells me to breathe in and out through panic attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun distraction for now. I know it\u2019s not real, serious or for forever.\u201d Existing platforms Startups have dabbled in this space for years. HereAfter AI, founded in 2019, allows users to create avatars of deceased loved ones. The AI-powered app generates responses and answers to questions based on interviews conducted while the subject was alive. Meanwhile, another service, called StoryFile, creates AI-powered conversational videos that talk back. And then there\u2019s Replika, an app that lets you text or call personalized AI avatars. The service, which launched in 2017, encourages users to develop a friendship or relationship; the more you interact with it, the more it develops its own personality, memories and grows \u201cinto a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it,\u201d the company says on its iOS\u00a0App Store page. Tech giants have experimented with similar technology. In June 2022, Amazon said it was working on an update to its Alexa system that would allow the technology to mimic any voice, even a deceased family member. In a video shown on stage during its annual re: MARS conference, Amazon demonstrated how on Alexa, instead of its signature voice, read a story to a young boy in his grandmother\u2019s voice. Rohit Prasad, an Amazon senior vice president, said at the time the updated system would be able to collect enough voice data from less than a minute of audio to make personalization like this possible, rather than having someone spend hours in a recording studio like in the past. \u201cWhile AI can\u2019t eliminate that pain of loss, it can definitely make their memories last,\u201d he said. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment on the status of that product. AI recreations of people\u2019s voices have also increasingly improved over the past few years. For example, the spoken lines of actor Val Kilmer in \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d were generated with artificial intelligence after he lost his voice due to throat cancer. Ethics and other concerns Although many AI-generated avatar platforms have online privacy policies that state they do not sell data to third parties, it\u2019s unclear what some companies such as Snapchat or OpenAI do with any data used to train their systems to sound more like a deceased loved one. \u201cI\u2019d caution people to never upload any personal information you wouldn\u2019t want the world to see,\u201d Sample said. It\u2019s also a murky line to have a deceased person say something they never previously said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to replay a voicemail from a loved one to hear it again, but it\u2019s another thing to hear words that were never uttered,\u201d he said. The entire generative AI industry also continues to face concerns around misinformation, biases and other problematic content. On its ethics page, Replika said it trains its models with source data from all over the internet, including large bases of written text such as social media platforms like Twitter or discussion platforms like Reddit. \u201cAt Replika, we use various approaches to mitigate harmful information, such as filtering out unhelpful and harmful data through crowdsourcing and classification algorithms,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhen potentially harmful messages are detected, we delete or edit them to ensure the safety of our users.\u201d Another concern is whether this hinders or helps the grieving process. Mary-Frances O\u2019Connor, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies grief, said there are both advantages and downsides to using technology in this way. \u201cWhen we bond with a loved one, when we fall in love with someone, the brain encodes that person as, \u2018I will always be there for you and you will always be there for me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they die, our brain has to understand that this person isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d Because it\u2019s so hard for the brain to wrap around that, it can take a long time to truly understand that they are gone, she said. \u201cThis is where technology could interfere.\u201d However, she said people particularly in the early stages of grief may be looking for comfort in any way they can find it. \u201cCreating an avatar to remind them of a loved one, while maintaining the awareness that it is someone important in the past, could be healing,\u201d she said. \u201cRemembering is very important; it reflects the human condition and importance of deceased loved ones.\u201d But she noted the relationship we have with our closest loved ones is built on authenticity. Creating an AI version of that person could for many \u201cfeel like a violation of that.\u201d Different approaches Communicating with the dead through artificial intelligence isn\u2019t for everyone. Bill Abney, a software engineer from San Francisco who lost his fianc\u00e9e Kari in May 2022, told CNN he would \u201cnever\u201d consider recreating her likeness through an AI service or platform. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9e was a poet, and I would never disrespect her by feeding her words into an automatic plagiarism machine,\u201d Abney said. \u201cShe cannot be replaced. She cannot be recreated,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also lucky to have some recordings of her singing and of her speech, but I absolutely do not want to hear her voice coming out of a robot pretending to be her.\u201d Some have found other ways to digitally interact with deceased loved ones. Jodi Spiegel, a psychologist from Newfoundland, Canada, said she created a version of her husband and herself in the popular game The Sims soon after his death in April 2021. \u201cI love the Sims, so I made us like we were in real life,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I had a super bad day, I would go to my Sims world and dance while my husband played guitar.\u201d She said they went on digital camping and beach trips together, played chess and even had sex in the Sim world. \u201cI found it super comforting,\u201d she said. \u201cI missed hanging out with my guy so much. It felt like a connection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/tech/ai-communicating-with-dead/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_05_health_what-are-vegetables-nutrients-plants-wellness", "text": "The rumors are true: Vegetables aren\u2019t real \u2014 that is, in botany, anyway. While the term\u00a0fruit\u00a0is recognized botanically as anything that contains a seed or seeds, vegetable is actually a broad umbrella term for many types of edible plants. You might think you know what carrots and beets are. Carrots, beets and other vegetables that grow in the ground are actually the true roots of plants. Lettuce and spinach are the leaves, while celery and asparagus are the stems, and greens such as broccoli, artichokes and cauliflowers are immature flowers, according to\u00a0Steve Reiners, a professor of horticulture at Cornell University\u2019s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. As for produce that grow from flowers, such as peppers and tomatoes, the hot-debated crops are botanically classified as fruits, Reiners added. Cucumbers, squash, eggplant and avocados are also classified as fruit due to their anatomy, according to the\u00a0European Food Information Council. What is a vegetable? The term vegetable does not have a set definition when it comes to botany. However, in\u00a0horticulture, the science of growing garden crops, a vegetable is defined as any herbaceous plant \u2014 a fleshy plant that completes its life cycle in a growing season \u2014 in which some portion \u201cis eaten either cooked or raw, during the principal part of the meal, and not as like a snack or dessert,\u201d Reiners said. The legal definition\u00a0of a vegetable versus a fruit \u2014 at least in the United States \u2014 was determined during a\u00a019th century US Supreme Court\u00a0case that concluded that the tomato is a vegetable. While vegetables are really just the roots, stems and leaves of plants, experts don\u2019t recommend eating just any roots, stems and leaves. One example is rhubarb. The fleshy stalk is the edible part of the plant, but the leaves are poisonous, Reiners said. Stay safe by eating plants that grocery stores commonly call vegetables.\u00a0 \u201cWe know (vegetables) are healthy. We know the vitamin content, we know the mineral content,\u201d Reiners said. \u201cWe know how much fiber is in all of it. \u201cWe also know that the vegetables that you either grow or you\u2019re purchasing at a farmers market or grocery store are safe to eat,\u201d he said. Eat your vegetables By understanding the various parts of vegetables and the nutrients they carry, people can eat well, according to\u00a0Sherri Stastny, a registered dietitian and a professor in the department of health, nutrition and exercises sciences at North Dakota State University. A head of broccoli is a great source of nutrients, but the stem of the green, which is more commonly thrown out, is also rich in fiber and nutrients, Stastny said. The regular consumption of flowery produce such as\u00a0broccoli and cauliflower\u00a0have been found to be associated with a decrease in the risk of cancer, she added. \u201cHeart disease\u00a0is still the No. 1 killer\u00a0in the United States, and we know that if you eat enough fruits and vegetables, you lower your risk for heart disease \u2014 and that goes along with obesity, diabetes and all these other chronic diseases,\u201d Stastny said. It is important to eat a variety of vegetables since each one will have varying beneficial nutrients, she added. Dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale are great sources of certain phytonutrients, natural nutrients from plants that are beneficial to human health, that help to maintain sharp eye vision, while carrots will help to strengthen night vision. \u201cIf you think of the richest, darkest, most colorful vegetables, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to find those (nutrients),\u201d Stastny said, while potassium-rich vegetables and fruit, such as potatoes, pumpkin and squash, could help to lower and maintain blood pressure. \u2018Start them young\u2019 For parents looking to get young kids to eat their fruits and veggies, breaking down the anatomy of the plant, while describing the colors, taste and texture, could be a fun and educational way of introducing the nutrient-dense foods to the early explorers. \u201cStart them young,\u201d Stastny said. \u201cIf you introduce children to vegetables at a younger age \u2026 they\u2019re more likely to eat vegetables throughout their lifespan and therefore decrease the risk of chronic disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/05/health/what-are-vegetables-nutrients-plants-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_world_solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn", "text": "A series of solar flares and coronal mass ejections from the sun have the potential to create dazzling auroras that may be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California but also disrupt communications on Earth tonight and over the weekend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The center, which is a division of the National Weather Service, issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Friday evening. It\u2019s the first such watch issued since January 2005. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The Space Weather Prediction Center tracked multiple strong flares emitting from a large cluster of sunspots on the solar surface since Wednesday. The cluster is 16 times the diameter of Earth. Scientists observed at least five coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, releasing from the sun in the direction of Earth. These significant outburts are expected to arrive as early as midday Friday and continue through Sunday. The peak of the geomagnetic storm activity for Earth will be between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET on Saturday, according to the center\u2019s forecast. The center referred to this as \u201can unusual event.\u201d Geomagnetic storms driven by the sun in recent months have caused auroras to be visible in places where they are rarely seen, including as far south as New Mexico, Missouri, North Carolina and California in the United States, and the southeast of England and other parts of the United Kingdom. Depending on the location, the auroras may not always be visible overhead, but keep an eye on the horizon, experts say, because they may create a colorful display there as well. The effects of geomagnetic storms When directed at Earth, these ejections can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGeomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth\u2019s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\u201d according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201c(The center) has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action.\u201d Solar storms generated by the sun can also cause radio blackouts and even pose risks for crewed space missions. The center warned that additional solar activity could cause geomagnetic storm conditions to be ongoing through the weekend. So far, researchers have obseverd only three severe geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle, which began in December 2019, according to the center. Previously, a G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, occurred on October 23, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Tracking space weather Every 11 years or so, the sun experiences periods of low and high solar activity, which is associated with the amount of sunspots on its surface. The sun\u2019s strong and constantly shifting magnetic fields drive these dark regions, some of which can reach the size of Earth or larger. Over the course of a solar cycle, the sun will transition from a calm to an intense and active period. During the peak of activity, called solar maximum, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip. Then, the sun will grow quiet again during a solar minimum. Solar maximum is expected to peak through mid- to late 2024, but the sun will remain active for a couple of years afterward. Teams at the Space Weather Prediction Center use data from ground and space-based observatories, magnetic maps of the solar surface, and ultraviolet observations of the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere to determine when the sun is most likely to send out solar flares, coronal mass ejections and other space weather that could affect Earth. Solar flares can affect communications and GPS almost immediately because they disrupt Earth\u2019s ionosphere, or part of the upper atmosphere. Energetic particles released by the sun can also disrupt electronics on spacecraft and affect astronauts without proper protection within 20 minutes to several hours. The material sent speeding away from the sun during coronal mass ejections can arrive at Earth between 30 and 72 hours afterward, causing geomagnetic storms that affect satellites and create electrical currents in the upper atmosphere that travel through the ground and can have an impact on electric power grids. The storms also affect flight patterns of commercial airlines, which are instructed to stay away from Earth\u2019s poles during geomagnetic storms due to loss of communication or navigation capabilities. Extreme storms have occurred before, such as one that knocked out the power grid in Quebec in 1989 and the Carrington Event of 1859.The latter remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded, causing telegraph stations to spark and catch fire. If such an event were to occur today, it could cause trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and bring down some power grids for a substantial amount of time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/world/solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_bird-flu-cows-human-receptors", "text": "In early March, Dr. Barb Petersen, a large-animal vet in Texas, began getting calls from the dairy farms she works with in the Panhandle.\u00a0Workers there were seeing a lot of cows with mastitis, an infection of the udder. Their milk was thickened and discolored, and it couldn\u2019t be explained by any of the usual suspects such as bacteria or tissue damage. Several more dairies called.\u00a0One owner told her he thought his farm had \u201cwhatever is going around, and half of my pets have died,\u201d indicating that the contagion had moved beyond cattle. After running a battery of tests and ruling out every cause she could think of, Petersen sent samples from sick and dead animals to the Texas A&M state veterinary lab and to friends and colleagues at Iowa State University. What they found \u2013 loads of the H5N1 influenza virus \u2013 has rocked the dairy industry and put public health officials around the world on alert. It also created an urgent scientific to-do list. One of the first questions that needed to be answered was how the virus was infecting cows in the first place. Researchers in the US and Denmark took on that task. Their findings, published as a preprint study, show that cows have the same receptors for flu viruses as humans and birds. Scientists fear that cows could be mixing bowls \u2013 hosts that help the virus learn to better spread between people. Such an event, while rare, experts say, could put us on the path to another pandemic. Bird flu tries out new hosts For years, H5N1, or highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been primarily confined to the bird population, but it has recently begun to infect a growing number of mammals, suggesting that the virus might be adapting and moving closer to becoming a human pathogen. Avian flu viruses have decimated commercial poultry flocks in the US, and because pigs are known to catch bird flu viruses, swine have been closely monitored for signs of infection \u2013 but cows weren\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar as potential hosts. Since late March, 42 infected herds have been found in nine states, according to the the US Department of Agriculture. Only one person has been found to be infected with H5N1 after contact with infected cows, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health is low, although it is working with states to monitor people with animal exposures. \u201cThe finding in cattle has been so different,\u201d said Dr. Lars Larsen, a professor of veterinary clinical microbiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In mammals, influenza typically infects the lungs. In cats, it can also infect the brain. \u201cHere we see an enormous amount of virus in the mammary and in the milk,\u201d Larsen said. Larsen said the concentration of H5N1 viruses in the milk of infected cows is 1,000 times higher than typically seen in infected birds.\u00a0He said he and his colleagues calculated that even if the milk from a single infected cow were diluted in 1,000 tons of milk, scientists would still be able to pick up traces of the virus in lab tests. Tests by the US Food and Drug Administration found inert fragments of genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 out of 5 samples of milk purchased on grocery store shelves, raising questions about how the virus had become so widespread. Researchers confirmed in later tests that the pasteurized milk it tested wasn\u2019t infectious and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick. That hasn\u2019t stopped the outbreak from rattling more than a few nerves. There\u2019s big money riding on the health of cows. Milk and dairy products were the fourth largest agricultural commodity in the US in terms of cash receipts in 2022, according to the USDA\u2019s economic research service. Sales of cattle and calves were the second largest commodity. How viruses break into cells Viruses need a way to hack into cells.\u00a0For the virus that causes Covid-19, the key is a receptor called ACE2.\u00a0For flu viruses, it\u2019s a sugar molecule that sticks up from the surface of cells called a sialic acid. Different animals carry different forms, or shapes, of sialic acids. Birds have sialic acid receptors that are slightly different shapes from than the ones humans have in their upper respiratory tracts. If you hold your index finger straight up, that\u2019s kind of what a bird\u2019s sialic acid receptor looks like, says Dr. Andy Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0If you bend your finger at the knuckle into an upside-down L, that\u2019s what human sialic acid receptor looks like. Flu viruses tend to prefer to bind to one shape over the other, he said. Researchers think this may be one reason why H5N1, which originated in birds, hasn\u2019t been shown to spread efficiently between people. Until recently, nobody knew what kind of sialic acid receptors cows had, because it was believed that they didn\u2019t catch A-strain flu viruses like H5N1. Larsen and his colleagues in the US and Denmark took tissue samples from the lungs, windpipes, brains and mammary glands of calves and cows and stained them with compounds that they knew would attach to different kinds of sialic acid receptors.\u00a0They sliced the stained tissues very thinly and peered at them under a microscope. What they saw was surprising: The tiny milk-producing sacs of the udder, called alveoli, were brimming with sialic acid receptors, and they had both the kind of receptors associated with birds and those that are more common in people.\u00a0Almost every cell they looked at contained both types of receptors, said lead study author Dr. Charlotte Kristensen, a postdoctoral researcher in veterinary pathology at the University of Copenhagen. That finding has raised concern because one way flu viruses change and evolve is by swapping pieces of their genetic material with other flu viruses.\u00a0This process, called reassortment, requires that a cell be infected with two different flu viruses at the same time. \u201cIf you get both viruses in the same cell at the same time, you can essentially get hybrid viruses coming out of it,\u201d said study author Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. In order to be infected simultaneously with two flu viruses \u2013 a bird flu virus and a human flu virus \u2013 a cell would need to have both kinds of sialic acid receptors, which cows do, something that wasn\u2019t known before this study. \u201cI think this is probably a pretty rare event,\u201d said Webby, who has been studying the H5N1 virus for 25 years. In order for something like that to happen, a cow infected with the bird flu virus would need to pick up a different flu strain from an infected human.\u00a0Currently, human flu infections are low across the country and dropping as flu season winds down, making the possibility of something like this happening even more remote. Still, it\u2019s not unheard-of. Pigs also have both human and bird sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tracts, and flu infections in pigs have been known to spark pandemic viruses.\u00a0The 2009 pandemic caused by H1N1 influenza, for example, is believed to have started in pigs in Mexico when the virus reassorted to become one that was able to spread quickly between people. Another way the bird flu virus could change in cows, Webby says, is more gradual \u2013 and more common. Each time a virus copies itself, it makes mistakes.\u00a0Sometimes, those mistakes make the virus less potent and hurt its chances of survival, but in other instances, they\u2019re happy accidents \u2013 at least for the virus.\u00a0If a bird flu virus happened to change in a way that made it able to bind more easily to the human-type sialic acid receptors in cows, it could gain a survival advantage: the ability to infect more cells and more types of animals, like humans. Viruses can shift and drift Reassortment would be a big shift in the evolution of the virus, but the gradual passage of the virus through new hosts could also result in a change to the virus\u2019 genome by evolutionary drift. Either way, it\u2019s not good news, said Dr. Sam Scarpino, a computational biologist and director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University. \u201cWe now have a piece of data that suggests the risk profile is higher,\u201d said Scarpino, who was not involved in the new study. He notes that this is early research.\u00a0It needs to be confirmed by a different group of researchers, and it was published quickly as a preprint ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. But he said the findings are also important because no one had really looked to at the susceptibility of cow tissues to influenza A viruses before. \u201cThis is the first that I\u2019m aware of. It doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t another one out there, but a number of us looked at it pretty carefully and didn\u2019t find any,\u201d he said. Kristensen said the researchers also couldn\u2019t find any prior research on it, which is why they did the study. \u201cWe just felt that, given the situation, that we should go out with these results as fast as possible,\u201d Larsen said. Other experts said that although there are more dots to connect, the study clearly raises the level of alert. \u201cI think we now have more than enough information to conclude that what has to happen is, we need to stop transmission in dairy cattle,\u201d Scarpino said. \u201cWe need to increase the kinds of protection that are mandated for workers that are in close contact with cows and milk products and significantly increase the funding that\u2019s going into understanding influenza and in cows, because there\u2019s just a huge amount that we don\u2019t know that we need to learn very quickly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/bird-flu-cows-human-receptors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_health_fda-blood-donations-malaria", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration is considering a requirement for blood banks to use a new test that can detect the parasites that cause malaria in certain donors\u2019 blood, and it\u2019s seeking the opinion of its independent advisers on the best way to meet its goal of zero transfusion-related cases without unnecessarily prohibiting some people from donating blood.  The World Health Organization says malaria is a significant global health issue, with 249 million cases and more than 608,000 deaths in 2022 alone. Malaria is not considered a big threat to the US blood supply like it is in some other countries. But nearly 28 million US residents travel to parts of the world where malaria is common each year, the FDA says, and as more Americans travel and as the planet gets warmer, scientists have predicted that the disease could\u00a0become more likely in the US, even with aggressive mosquito control. As late as the 1940s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday in a presentation to the FDA\u2019s advisory committee, the US had about 65,000 cases of malaria a year \u2013 but that changed when the country needed healthy service members to fight in World War II. Knowing that many would train in malaria-prone areas in the South, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s government waged a war on mosquitoes that paid off. By 1949, according to the CDC, malaria was no longer considered a significant health problem in the US, and WHO declared the US free of the disease in 1970. The US still has about 2,000 cases a year, according to the CDC, but most are travel-related. The CDC noted that although the risk of locally acquired malaria in the US continues to be \u201cextremely low,\u201d just last summer, it warned doctors to watch for locally acquired cases. There were a handful of non-travel-related cases in Texas, Florida, Maryland and Arkansas last year, the first locally acquired malaria cases in the US since 2003. In March, the FDA approved the first test intended to screen donor blood for the evidence of malaria. The Cobas malaria test, made by Roche, can detect RNA and DNA from the parasite that causes malaria in donor blood, organs and tissue. Malaria transmission through a blood transfusion is not common, but an infection can trigger severe symptoms and even death, studies show. A CDC study found that from 1963 through 1999, there were just 93 cases spread through donated blood in the US, but 10 of those people died. Another study found 13 malaria cases related to blood donations between 2000 and 2021, the FDA said, but seven of the cases involved\ufeff donors who met current FDA eligibility criteria. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, and it doesn\u2019t prevent all cases,\u201d Jennifer Scharpf, associate director for policy in the agency\u2019s Office of Blood Research and Review, said of the current guidelines. The FDA told the committee Wednesday that its current guidance comes with a high level of \u201ccomplexity\u201d and that blood bank workers must assess several potential risk factors. Blood banks use a donor history questionnaire to screen for people who have had malaria or who lived in a country where the disease is endemic in the past three years. People are also deferred from donating if they have traveled to a country with endemic malaria in the previous three months; or if they were a resident of a malaria-endemic country, if they have spent less than three consecutive years in a country where malaria is endemic, or if they have a history of travel to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three years. The rules are slightly different for platelet and plasma component collection. \ufeffThese questionnaires have limitations, and the screening process is \u201cerror-prone,\u201d the FDA said. Deferral periods may also not be sufficient to catch asymptomatic donors, particularly for residents of countries where malaria is common, because they may have partial immunity from a previous infection\ufeff. On the other hand, the current guidance disqualifies a large group of healthy potential donors, the FDA said. Some estimates say that between 1% and 3% of all donors are turned away based on travel history alone, and blood banks say they can never get enough donors. Scharpf told the committee that about 50,000 to 160,000 donors may be deferred annually, and studies show that many\ufeff people who are deferred often don\u2019t return, even when they are eligible to donate. The FDA is considering a couple of strategies to update its guidelines. The first consideration is to do selective testing of a donor\u2019s blood based on their history of malaria infection, having traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months or having ever lived in a malaria-endemic country. Another option is to test all donors at least one time and then to selectively test donations from people at risk of exposure, including those who had ever had malaria and those who had traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months. Most of the advisory\ufeff committee members seemed to favor the first option, saying the second seemed like overkill. \u201cIt\u2019s such a low incidence of disease, and it\u2019s treatable,\u201d said committee member Dr. Richard Scanlan, a professor, vice chair of the Laboratory Medicine Transfusion Service and medical director at Oregon Health & Science University. The FDA is also considering requiring testing of all blood donated in areas where there was even one locally transmitted malaria case recently, but the committee members seemed less sure about this idea. Committee member Dr. Sanjay Ahuja, director of Rainbow Hemostasis & Thrombosis Center at Rainbow Babies & Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland, said that if there is proven local transmission, the decision of \ufeffwhen to test all donor blood from the area is a \u201cdifficult one.\u201d \u201cThere are so many nuances to this,\u201d Ahuja said. \u201cI think it might be a little bit much in my opinion, but I don\u2019t know whether more evidence of local transmission should be in place before we say \u2018yes\u2019 to this.\u201d During the meeting\u2019s public comment period, leaders of some\ufeff blood supply organizations encouraged the FDA to take a cautious approach to changing the guidelines. Ralph Vassallo, incoming chair of the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies\u00a0Transfusion Transmitted Disease Committee, said his group joins\ufeff America\u2019s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross in believing that the new test for malaria holds real promise to improve blood safety and may improve the availability of donors by removing \u201cunnecessary donor deferrals,\u201d particularly among subsets of donors with uncommon blood types, such as those from Latin American, Asian and African countries. But, he told the committee, there are no clinical studies that show that the test reduces the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria. Vassallo also encouraged the FDA to use flexible testing strategies and said that although the groups supported limited testing of all donations in ZIP codes with local malaria transmission, one case should not be enough to trigger such testing. \u201cFDA should support formal modeling studies designed in consultation with malariologists using the best available assumptions about parasite levels during asymptomatic infection before issuing final guidance,\u201d he said. The committee did not vote on the proposed strategies, but the FDA said it would take the discussion into consideration as it considered changing its guidance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/health/fda-blood-donations-malaria/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_11_06_health_parkinsons-spinal-cord-implant-study", "text": "Marc Gauthier can now step into an elevator without his body stiffening and freezing in place. He can take a 3-mile lakeside stroll without stopping. He can stand up out of a chair with ease. For Gauthier, 63, who has been living with Parkinson\u2019s disease for almost three decades, these everyday activities were a challenge \u2014 until now. \u201cWalking in a store would be really difficult, impossible before, because of the freezing of gait that would often happen in those environments. And now, it just doesn\u2019t happen anymore. I don\u2019t have freezing anymore,\u201d Gauthier, who lives near Bordeaux, France, said in a news briefing, speaking in French that was translated to English. In a new study, Gauthier was surgically implanted with an experimental spinal cord neuroprosthesis to correct walking disorders in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Step by step, he said, it has helped him get his stride back. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, details how the neuroprosthesis works by targeting specific areas of the spinal cord with electrical stimulation that are associated with walking. \u201cAddressing deficits of gait and balance in Parkinson\u2019s disease is extremely challenging. These deficits can be very heterogenous. They can be variable across patients. They can affect walking but also symmetry, balance, posture,\u201d Dr. Eduardo Moraud, an author of the study and researcher at Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland said during the news briefing. \u201cThe neuroprosthetic approach that we have developed here allows for the first time to target and address these problems individually in a highly specific manner for each patient,\u201d Moraud said. \u201cIt operates in real time, and importantly, it is complementary to other existing therapies.\u201d Parkinson\u2019s disease, a degenerative brain disorder, causes parts of the brain to deteriorate. Symptoms related to walking occur when the nerve cells in the brain\u2019s basal ganglia area, which controls movement, become impaired or die. These nerve cells normally produce dopamine but, when they die or become impaired, the lack of dopamine often impacts a person\u2019s ability to move, walk or balance. About 90% of people with the disease experience locomotor deficits. While there is currently no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease, some therapies \u2014 such as deep brain stimulation or medications to increase dopamine levels \u2014 may relieve symptoms. Gauthier, a father of two, was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s when he was 36 years old and was previously treated with dopamine replacement therapy and then deep brain stimulation in 2004 to help with tremors and stiffness. But more recently, as the disease progressed, he developed severe walking disorders that did not respond to either therapy. His body would often stiffen, he said, and he had falls about four times a day on average, forcing him to stop his work as an architect. Then, Gauthier was invited to participate in the new study to test the experimental spinal cord neuroprosthesis. At first he declined because of the time commitment, he said, but then changed his mind, took a \u201cchance\u201d and said yes. Stimulating the spinal cord To develop the implant, researchers from France, Switzerland and other institutions around the world visualized and mapped which hotspots in the lower spinal cord the neuroprosthesis must target with electrical stimulation to alleviate gait impairments and balance problems in a patient with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \u201cThe stimulation here is focused on the spinal cord,\u201d Moraud said. \u201cWe target the region of the spinal cord that will control all the leg movements.\u201d The researchers identified six hotspots to facilitate walking. Next, they implanted an array of electrodes against the lower region of Gauthier\u2019s spinal cord to target those zones. The electrodes were linked to a neural stimulator placed under the skin in the region of the abdomen. That stimulator was programmed to apply electrical stimulation to the spinal cord. \u201cThe connection between the electrode and the stimulator is under the skin, everything is hidden, and you control the device with a remote control,\u201d neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyn Bloch, an author of the study and professor at Lausanne University Hospital, said during the briefing. The surgery was performed at Lausanne University Hospital about two years ago. And after a few months of rehabilitation with the neuroprosthetic stimulation, Gauthier has regained the ability to walk independently using the implant. He also has the option to wear sensors on his legs to receive more of a stimulation. Signals from the wearable sensors can help synchronize epidural electrical stimulation to movements and reinforce movements. Overall, the neuroprosthesis, based on epidural electrical stimulation, helped to \u201cpromote longer steps, improve balance and reduce freezing of gait,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study. Gauthier now uses his neuroprosthetic for about eight hours a day, turning on the stimulator in the morning and then turning it off when he is sitting down for long periods of time or sleeping. Gauthier said during the news briefing that he feels a little tingling on the legs with the stimulation, but it doesn\u2019t bother him, and he joked that his wife is \u201cvery happy\u201d that he now can get outdoors on his own while she can enjoy some quiet time at home. But this is not a cure. The researchers expect his Parkinson\u2019s disease to still progress. \u201cWith this spinal cord stimulation, we still have an effect, but we have to fight against worse and more severe symptoms,\u201d Bloch said. \u201cBut we can still give him, with the therapy, a bit of quality of life.\u201d \u2018An exciting development\u2019 This proof-of-concept study is \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201cimpressive,\u201d Dr. Svjetlana Miocinovic, a\u00a0neurologist specializing in Parkinson\u2019s disease and associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine, said in an email. \u201cThis is an exciting development as better treatments for gait and balance impairment in PD are desperately needed,\u201d said Miocinovic, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt will be important to demonstrate that gait benefit observed in this study is specifically due to spinal stimulation (so comparisons with sham stimulation are important), that it can be achieved in other patients with PD,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd that it can be deployed\u00a0in clinical practice (technology needs to be streamlined sufficiently for clinicians to implement and for patients to use).\u201d \ufeffThis technology not only needs to be tested in more people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, but also those who had not previously received deep brain stimulation as a therapy, David Dexter, director of research at Parkinson\u2019s UK, said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre. \u201cThis has so far only been tried in one individual with Parkinson\u2019s who already had Deep Brain Stimulation. We now need to see this be tested in many more people with the condition, including those without DBS, in clinical trials to further explore the potential benefits and side effects/risks of this experimental new therapy,\u201d said Dexter, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cThis is quite an invasive procedure\u00a0but could be a game changing technology to help restore movement in people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s where the drugs are no longer working well,\u201d he said. \u201cThis research is still at a very early stage and requires much more development and testing before it can be made available to people with Parkinson\u2019s, however this is a significant and exciting step forward and we hope to see this research progress quickly.\u201d A second patient already has started the process of this therapy, Moraud said in the news briefing, and the researchers plan to conduct clinical tests next year in six other patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. This work is being supported by a $1 million donation from the Michael J. Fox Foundation. And in partnership with the Netherlands-based medical technology company ONWARD Medical, Bloch and Gre\u0301goire Courtine, an author of the study and professor of neuroscience at the Lausanne University Hospital, are working on developing a commercial version of the neuroprosthesis. \u201cThe idea is, really after this first phase, to launch a larger scale clinical trial to really validate the therapy,\u201d Courtine said during the news briefing, adding that this ongoing research will take some time, \u201cat least five years of development and tests.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/06/health/parkinsons-spinal-cord-implant-study/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_health_deep-brain-stimulation-ocd-study-wellness", "text": "Five years ago, in a wheelchair, Julia Hum was admitted to a state mental hospital in Massachusetts. After treatment with targeted deep brain stimulation, she hopes to walk out soon and, for the first time in her adult life, live independently, in her own apartment. Hum, 24, has severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, which once caused her to hurt herself and even affected her ability to eat and drink. \u201cMy OCD kind of convinced me food and drinks were contaminated,\u201d Hum said. Her thoughts told her things like that her food had parasites or harmful chemicals. \u201cI was fully aware of how ludicrous these thoughts were, and I desperately wanted to gain weight and eat enough and drink enough and be healthy. But the doubts I had were just so loud,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were screaming, and I couldn\u2019t focus on anything else.\u201d Her heart rate and blood pressure became so erratic, she needed to use a wheelchair to move around.\u00a0Doctors used a tube that led into her stomach through her nose to give her food and gave her fluids intravenously. Now, after treatment, she\u2019s doing much better.\u00a0In August, she got her high-school equivalency diploma and posed for a photo with the certificate with a wide smile on her face. She\u2019s no longer hurting herself, and she can eat and drink normally.\u00a0She says intrusive thoughts are no longer in control. \u201cI feel like my OCD was kind of at the helm of the ship before, and now it\u2019s kind of like a pesky passenger.\u00a0It\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not taking over my life,\u201d Hum said. She and her doctors credit this lifesaving improvement to innovative research that allowed them to more precisely target a dysfunctional circuit with a device called a deep brain stimulator, which acts like a pacemaker for her brain. Deep brain stimulators have been used for two decades for movement disorders like Parkinson\u2019s disease and dystonia. More recently, their uses have been expanded to include mood disorders like depression and other neurological conditions such as Tourette\u2019s syndrome and OCD. The devices have two electrodes that target a pea-size structure deep inside the brain called the subthalamic nucleus. This node, which looks like a contact lens, contains more than half a million nerve cells. It\u2019s a hub for signals passing between the brain\u2019s outer and inner layers.\u00a0It\u2019s like a switchboard, says Dr. Andreas Horn, a neurologist at the Brain Modulation Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. Doctors implant the electrodes close to the subthalamic nucleus and then adjust the settings through a pulse generator that is implanted under the skin of the chest. After waiting about two weeks after surgery to let the body heal, they turn on the electricity and adjust the settings to find something that feels good to the patient. \u201cI\u2019ll suddenly feel lighter, my rituals will slow down, and I\u2019ll sit up straighter and feel more energy,\u201d as an example, Hum said. Refining deep brain stimulation Hum had a deep brain stimulator implanted in 2021. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Darin Dougherty of the Mass General Research Institute, said it didn\u2019t initially give them the results they\u2019d hoped for. \u201cIt was this kind of cycle where we would find settings that felt really good. They would work maybe for a month or two, and then I\u2019d slide backwards again because the initial effects would wear off,\u201d Hum said. Deep brain stimulation can be life-changing, but it doesn\u2019t work equally well for everyone, and researchers say they\u2019re getting closer to understanding why. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, Horn and an international team of researchers took data from more than 530 electrodes implanted in the brains of more than 200 people living with four conditions: Parkinson\u2019s disease, dystonia, Tourette\u2019s syndrome and OCD. They looked at where the devices were stimulating each person\u2019s brain and how much improvement each had.\u00a0Then, they used these records to map the nerve networks that seem to become dysfunctional in each of the four disorders. \u201cThe idea is that by learning from a cohort of patients and contrasting who got better with the ones that unfortunately did not get as much better after treatment, we can pinpoint where the optimal site is and maybe the optimal network to stimulate,\u201d Horn said. The team used their maps to adjust deep brain stimulators for three patients, including Hum. All of them saw substantial improvement in their symptoms. Dr. Sameer Sheth, a professor of neurosurgery at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved in the study, says that the research is encouraging because it uses data from a large number of people but that trying it out in just three people isn\u2019t enough to know whether these brain maps are accurate. \u201cFor the most part, this information has not been tested in the wild in a new set of patients, so that\u2019s what this is setting up,\u201d said Sheth, who also treats people with deep brain stimulation. If the same good results can be repeated in more patients, \u201cthen we should act on it.\u00a0We should implant with this type of profile in mind for this type of patient, let\u2019s say a patient with OCD,\u201d he said. \u2018It gave me my hope back\u2019 Using the maps created by Horn\u2019s team and a special type of magnetic resonance imaging called diffusion imaging, doctors can see the fibers they need to stimulate to have the best chance of getting people well, Dougherty said. Each electrode implanted for the therapy has multiple points of contact that doctors can use to stimulate different brain areas. \u201cWe were then able to see which of those contacts was closest to the fibers that would be most likely to be helpful\u201d for Hum, Dougherty said. They made adjustments to Hum\u2019s settings in August, and she says the difference has been night and day. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to focus,\u201d Hum said. She notices that she can engage in therapy better, and she\u2019s been able to create more distance between her thoughts and her actions. \u201cI was able to more accurately label a thought as OCD and really not me and choose to make the decision not to engage in a ritual,\u201d she said. She can also eat and drink \u201cpretty much everything.\u201d When she got her deep brain stimulator, Hum says, \u201cmy very basic hope was just even to have any sort of life at all, and now it\u2019s much bigger than that.\u201d She wonders if she can go to college, live independently and have a steady job.\u00a0And she wonders about love. \u201cCan I have a solid relationship with maybe a boyfriend and just all the things that I\u2019ve kind of missed out on till this point?\u201d she said. Hum said it\u2019s hard to explain the gratitude she feels to the doctors and researchers who helped her. \u201cHope had really gone. I didn\u2019t see a future for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt kind of re-lit that light and the end of the tunnel. \u201cIt gave me my hope back.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/health/deep-brain-stimulation-ocd-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_health_gene-editing-blindness-study-scn", "text": "For her entire life, college student Olivia Cook had only a small degree of central vision. It was as if she was watching the world through a straw hole, and in dimly lit places, she could not make out people\u2019s faces, only their silhouettes. But after receiving an experimental gene-editing treatment to one of her eyes, she now can see things she never saw before. Cook was born with an inherited retinal disorder that causes blindness, a rare type of eye disorder historically called Leber congenital amaurosis or LCA. A few years ago, she decided to participate in a clinical trial that involved using the gene-editing tool CRISPR to correct the form of inherited blindness that she has. \u201cMy life has mostly changed in terms of being hopeful that there is going to be more science and findings in the future,\u201d said Cook, 22, who is currently studying marketing and product development at Missouri State University in Springfield. She received the experimental gene-editing treatment through a surgery performed on her left eye. \u201cNow, post-surgery and post recovery, I am able to see in dimmer lighting with my left eye,\u201d Cook said. A treatment that used CRISPR was found to be safe and efficacious in improving vision among a small sample of patients with inherited blindness in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial that Cook participated in. Inherited retinal degenerations are a leading cause of blindness around the world. Among a total of 14 volunteers, including Cook, the gene-editing tool was found to be associated with a \u201cmeaningful improvement\u201d in vision for most patients around three months later and it was not directly tied to any serious side effects, according to the trial results, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The therapy remains experimental and the results need to be replicated in a larger group of people. Months following the treatment, Cook was sitting with friends on a balcony that had Christmas lights wrapped around the railing. It was dusk, she recalled, yet she could see her friends\u2019 faces glow under the twinkling Christmas lights. She was shocked. \u201cWith my right eye, I was not able to see their facial features. I was only able to see their silhouette. With my left eye, I could see everything on their face \u2013 so, significant difference, especially in the dim lighting,\u201d Cook said about that evening. \u201cOne of the biggest \u2018aha moments\u2019 that I had was I had been talking to my mom one day after the surgery \u2013 it was about six to nine months after the surgery when I noticed most of my improvement,\u201d Cook said. \u201cI could see a candle flickering behind me, which I\u2019ve never seen that before,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d never picked up anything from over there before with the peripheral.\u201d Before the treatment, Cook said that she sometimes could conceal the vision challenges she has had.\u00a0Her limited vision often was an internal struggle. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really know that my eyesight is terrible until you spend a significant amount of time with me,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIf we saw each other in the street, if I introduced myself to you, you\u2019d never know.\u201d But now, she is no longer hiding. A groundbreaking \u2018proof of concept\u2019 This study is the first time that CRISPR has been used in the eyes of living people. \u201cThe results of this study provide proof of concept that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used safely and effectively to treat inherited retinal disorders,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author Dr. Eric Pierce, director of the Ocular Genomics Institute at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School. The trial was funded by the biotechnology company Editas Medicine and conducted in the United States by researchers at Mass Eye and Ear of the Mass General Brigham health care system and other US-based institutions, including the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, the University of Miami, and Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cWe\u2019re really hopeful that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies will now be applied to other genetic forms of inherited blindness, and indeed other genetic diseases in general,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this will help open the era of therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.\u201d The trial, which started in 2019, enrolled 12 adults, ages 17 to 63, and two children, ages 9 and 14, with inherited retinal degeneration caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. That gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many types of cells, including light receptor cells in the eyes. Mutations in CEP290 are the most common cause of severe early-onset retinal degeneration, which causes vision loss in children. Currently, there is no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration. These patients would not be able to read any lines of letters or numbers on a vision chart that most people receive at the eye doctor, and visual impairment may worsen over time. For the trial, the 14 participants underwent a surgical procedure in which a drug called EDIT-101 that encodes the CRISPR gene-editing components was injected under the retina of one of their eyes. Since the trial was conducted to primarily evaluate safety and efficacy, only one eye in each patient was studied. \u201cThe subjects get an injection of the gene-editing drug, which is called EDIT-101, under their retina,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThat drug encodes the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery, and once that starts working inside the retinal cells of those patients, it cuts out the mutation in CEP290 from the genome of their retinal cells, allowing the function of the CEP290 gene to be restored.\u201d When the first patients in the study were treated in 2020, it was the first time in medical history that a CRISPR-based medicine, resulting in gene-editing, was inserted directly into the living human body. Among the adult volunteers, two were given a low dose of the medication, five were given an intermediate dose and five were given a high dose. Both of the children in the study were given the intermediate dose. The outpatient procedure took around an hour and a half. The patients were then monitored every three months for a year and then less frequent monitoring continued for two years. In these follow-up visits, they underwent a series of vision tests among other evaluations. The researchers found that 11 patients in the study had some type of improvement in their vision following the CRISPR therapy, and these improvements occurred about three months after the procedure and were sustained during subsequent visits. Also, no serious side effects occurred in response to the treatment at any of the dose sizes, according to the researchers, and the adverse events that did occur were mild or moderate. There were also no signs that the CRISPR gene-editing caused ripple-effect harm to the genomes of the patients. \u201cThe primary goal of this first in-human study was to test the safety of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in vivo. When we started the trials, the subjects who were treated were the first patients ever to have received CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing treatments in vivo,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThere were no serious adverse events related to the treatment, or the surgery required to deliver the treatment and no dose-limiting toxicities.\u201d Following the surgery, one patient experienced some bleeding in the eye, impairing their vision, but that has since resolved, according to the researchers. \u201cOnce that hemorrhage cleared, the subject\u2019s vision returned to baseline,\u201d Pierce said. Another patient experienced vision impairment associated with small mounds observed under their retina six months after the procedure. These types of hyperreflective mounds have been seen in other studies involving subretinal gene therapies, the researchers noted, and the cause of them is not clear. \u201cIt\u2019s thought to be inflammation,\u201d Pierce said about the mounds. The patient was treated with a course of steroid medicines, according to the study, and their recovery is ongoing. \u201cAs the mounds resolved their vision also improved,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI think this drug was as safe as possible in terms of design.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s not a panacea\u2019 Complete vision has not been restored among the patients. Most in the trial could not read any line of an eye chart prior to the study, and only four of them experienced some improvements in this ability. But some patients reported, after receiving treatment, being able to see their cell phones light up, differentiate various foods on their dinner plates, identify the spinning Apple icon on a computer screen or even noticing vibrant sunsets. \u201cI started to see what are described as bursts of color,\u201d said Michael Kalberer, 46, who received the CRISPR treatment in his right eye and first noticed improvements in his vision about two to six months later. He started the study in 2020. \u201cIt was a pretty cool moment to see strobe lights on the dance floor of my cousin\u2019s wedding change color,\u201d said Kalberer, who added that if he had not received the treatment, all he would have seen on the dance floor would have been shadows and flickering lights, and he would not have been able to identify the colors. Kalberer described the CRISPR treatment as \u201cgroundbreaking,\u201d but warned it\u2019s not a cure. \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea,\u201d said Kalberer, who still can\u2019t see standard text or photos on a screen. \u201cMy disease is still here. It\u2019s not gone. I\u2019m not cured. \u2026 But it definitely slowed the progression of it.\u201d Pierce said that he hopes this approach to using CRISPR as a therapy for inherited blindness can be studied again in a larger and more diverse group of patients. All of the Phase 1/2 trial participants were non-Hispanic and White. In 2022, Editas Medicine announced that it paused further studying CRISPR gene editing as a therapeutic approach for CEP290-associated inherited blindness and instead of conducting further trials, has continued to follow-up with the patients who have been treated to date. The latest results from the Phase 1/2 trial support moving forward with a Phase 3 trial and then ultimately registering the therapy for possible FDA approval, Pierce said. \u201cWe are working with Editas to identify an additional commercial partner for Phase 3 studies. We\u2019re actually hoping this publication will stimulate interest in the biotech and pharma communities about that,\u201d Pierce said. More research over time could shed light on the long-term effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools, which, now that they have been injected into patients, will be present in patients for the rest of their lives, Pierce said. \u201cI think the real risk that we\u2019re all concerned about with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is: Could the gene editing machinery that we\u2019ve introduced into the retinal cells of these patients do something else, somewhere else in the genome, in addition to the therapeutic activities that it was designed for?\u201d Pierce said. \u201cCould a cut in the genome be made 10 years from now, that could have an adverse effect over time? I think the answer to that is yes, it could. But we\u2019re hopeful that risk is very low,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need additional follow-up for.\u201d \u2018Quality of life matters\u2019 The results from the Phase 1/2 trial \u2014 and how patients experienced some improvements in vision \u2014 are a valuable reminder of how important quality of life can be for patients, said Art Caplan, a\u00a0professor of bioethics\u00a0and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine\u2019s Department of Population Health. \u201cUsually when we\u2019re doing gene therapies or other innovative interventions, we associate them with saving lives. This experiment is a huge reminder that quality of life matters. This is about vision,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cNo one\u2019s dying. No one\u2019s saved. But restoration of vision is an important achievement, and it\u2019s a reminder that quality of life has to be factored into what we decide to cover in terms of insurance, reimbursement and what we try to study.\u201d He agreed with the researchers that more safety data over time would be helpful. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really had these subjects that long with the intervention to guarantee long-term safety,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cFor these kinds of genetic interventions, you have to follow them over long periods of time \u2014 years \u2014 to make sure that other genes weren\u2019t impacted.\u201d These new Phase 1/2 trial results provide a \u201cbuilding block\u201d for scientists to work off of in the future when developing gene therapies to treat eye disorders, said Dr. Vlad Diaconita, a retinal surgeon and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was not involved in the trial. \u201cDoes this apply to the American population at large? Not right now,\u201d Diaconita said about the experimental treatment. \u201cIt does, however, apply to the thousands of kids born in future years that have this particular genetic subtype. So yes, an approval of this particular gene delivery could benefit people over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a proof of concept that seems to be moving us in the right direction.\u201d Diaconita\u2019s colleague Dr. Aliaa Abdelhakim called this proof-of-concept study \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d in the sense that it shows the treatment approach can be safe and result in some improvement for patients, but more research is needed\u00a0on a larger scale\u00a0to determine\u00a0what kind of patients will benefit in the long term, and how long those improvements may last. \u201cWe still have to wait a little longer to see if this pans out in the long-term,\u201d said Abdelhakim, an ophthalmologist-geneticist, retina specialist and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. She also was not involved in the trial. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if\u00a0improvements from this treatment\u00a0are going to be sustained. Is their vision going to\u00a0stay improved\u00a0throughout their lives?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe reason this is important is because this is the first time CRISPR has been used in this way, in the eye.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/health/gene-editing-blindness-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_world_gods-hand-cometary-globule-image-scn", "text": "What appears to be a ghostly hand reaching across the universe toward a defenseless spiral galaxy in a new telescope image is a rarely seen cosmic phenomenon, according to astronomers. The Dark Energy Camera captured a stunning image of \u201cGod\u2019s Hand,\u201d a cometary globule 1,300 light-years from Earth in the Puppis constellation. The camera is mounted on the V\u00edctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Cometary globules are a type of Bok globule, or dark nebula. These isolated cosmic clouds are filled with dense gas and dust, which are surrounded by hot, energetic material. Cometary globules are unique because they have extended tails, like those seen on comets \u2014 but that\u2019s the only cometlike thing about them. Astronomers still don\u2019t know how cometary globules come to exist in such distinctive structures. Historically, it\u2019s also been hard for scientists to detect the faint clouds. The new image of the glowing red hand-like feature showcases CG 4, one of many cometary globules found across the Milky Way galaxy. The twisting cloud appears to be reaching for a spiral galaxy known as ESO 257-19 (PGC 21338). But the galaxy is more than 100 million light-years away from the cometary globule. CG 4 has a main dusty head, which resembles a hand, that measures 1.5 light-years across, and it has a long tail that stretches for 8 light-years. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which is 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). A surprising celestial discovery Astronomers first discovered cometary globules by chance in 1976 while looking at images captured by the UK Schmidt Telescope in Australia. These cosmic phenomena are hard to spot because they\u2019re incredibly faint, and the tails of globules are typically blocked from view by stellar dust. But the Dark Energy Camera has a special filter that can detect the incredibly dim red glow emitted by ionized hydrogen, which is present in the outer rim and head of CG 4. Hydrogen only produces such a telltale red glow after being hit with radiation from nearby hot, massive stars. While stellar radiation enables the cometary globule to be visible, it is also destroying the globule\u2019s head over time. However, there is enough gas and dust within the globule to aid in the birth of several stars the size of our sun. Cometary globules can be found across our galaxy, but most are in the Gum Nebula, a glowing cloud of gas believed to be the slowly expanding remains of a stellar explosion from about 1 million years ago. The Gum Nebula is believed to contain 31 cometary globules in addition to CG 4. Astronomers think there are a couple of ways that the globules may form their distinctive, cometlike shapes. The globules might have once been round-shaped nebulas, such as the iconic Ring Nebula, that were disrupted over time by a supernova \u2014 maybe even the one that formed the Gum Nebula. But the cosmic phenomena may also be the result of the winds and radiation released from nearby hot, massive stars. Astronomers believe stars might be the underlying cause because all the cometary globules found in the Gum Nebula have tails pointing away from the nebula\u2019s center. And at the center of the nebula is the supernova remnant as well as a pulsar, or a rapidly spinning neutron star that formed when a much larger star collapsed and exploded.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/world/gods-hand-cometary-globule-image-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "health"}}

But there\u2019s another part of the anatomy that\u2019s often overlooked: the feet. Feet are wired up to nerve fiber tracts from the brain so you can stand, balance and wiggle your toes. They\u2019re also plumbed by blood vessels, which lead all the way from the heart. The appearance and function of our feet then can indicate viral infections, diseases of the cardiovascular system and even neurological disorders. Here are a couple of examples. READ MORE:\u00a0Is the \u2018barefoot-boy summer\u2019 trend bad for your feet? Hand, foot and mouth disease Infectious diseases tend to affect different parts of the body. Measles\u00a0usually starts off on the face, or in the mouth, as little spots that look like grains of sugar.\u00a0Pityriasis versicolor, a type of fungal infection, tends to begin and stay on the torso. The reasons why they tend to affect these areas is not well understood. Hand, foot and mouth disease, or HFM,\u00a0begins in exactly these areas. It\u2019s caused by a virus known as\u00a0coxsackie and tends to produce raised pink-red spots that can blister and weep. The name is a bit of a misnomer \u2014 the rash can also affect the legs and buttocks, too. Noticing a new rash on the feet should prompt a doctor to consider HFM. HFM is a common childhood illness that\u2019s very contagious. Thankfully, it\u2019s also usually short-lived, clearing without treatment after a few days. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with\u00a0foot and mouth\u00a0\u2014 or better, hoof and mouth, however. Foot and mouth is a different virus from HFM that (mainly) affects cloven-hoofed animals, such as cows and sheep. It\u2019s the disease that resulted in a\u00a0UK epidemic in 2001. READ MORE:\u00a0How much time should you spend sitting versus standing? New research reveals the optimal mix Heart, vessels and feet Our circulatory system supplies blood to every part of the body \u2014 from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes. By the time blood vessels reach these extremities, like twigs from a tree, they have branched and got much smaller in size. At some point, we\u2019ve all experienced the discomfort of icy cold feet, especially when going barefoot around the house or during chillier days. It\u2019s normal for feet to feel cool to the touch, but they should not change color from their usual skin color to blue \u2014 nor should they ever get painfully cold. Severe symptoms of discoloration and pain can point toward a phenomenon called\u00a0blue toe syndrome. It can be triggered by tiny little masses called microemboli, made up of blobs of cholesterol. These emboli pass easily through large vessels but will struggle as they become smaller. On reaching the smaller vessels of the feet, they finally become stuck, cutting off the blood supply. The tissues then become starved of oxygen, causing the feet to change color and become painful. In serious cases, blue toe syndrome can lead to tissue death, breakdown and the formation of gangrene, which may require\u00a0amputation\u00a0of toes \u2014 or even the whole foot. This rare condition is sometimes called\u00a0\u201ctrash foot,\u201d because of the way in which the feet become so discolored. What\u2019s the underlying cause of these tiny cholesterol fragments? Most likely aneurysms and atherosclerosis \u2014 vessels that have ballooned or hardened upstream of the feet. When trash foot does occur, it is often following surgical treatment for these conditions, such as\u00a0aortic aneurysm repair. The procedures disrupt the vessel, which can cause emboli to break off. As well as trash foot, there are other signs in the feet that can point toward cardiovascular disease.\u00a0Raised red swellings\u00a0appearing on the feet (as well as the hands) can indicate an infection of the heart called\u00a0bacterial endocarditis. These can be painless \u2014 in which case we call them Janeway lesions \u2014 or sore, which are called Osler\u2019s nodes. READ MORE:\u00a0Are your feet beach ready?

After finding the upgoing plantar, the doctor may then have creased their brow with worry \u2014 and for good reason. The Babinski sign is a simple test that involves stroking the sole of the foot with a blunt-ended instrument to check the response of the toes. This is the\u00a0plantar reflex\u00a0\u2014 plantar relating to the sole of the foot. Normally, when this reflex is triggered, the toes should curl under or flex downward toward the sole. It the big toe points upward, and the smaller toes fan out, this is an \u201cupgoing plantar\u201d response \u2014 also known as the\u00a0Babinski sign, named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski who first described it. It is\u00a0normal to find this response in babies, whose nervous systems are undergoing development and not capable of all the motor functions of an adult. In\u00a0adults, however, finding the Babinski sign is an altogether different story. Most commonly, it signifies that a stroke is disrupting the normal brain circuitry that controls the feet. Other causes\u00a0include multiple sclerosis and (rarely) drug intoxication. In some otherwise healthy people though, the Babinski sign can be observed during deep sleep. The scope is much wider than just these conditions. Diabetes, kidney failure and even thyroid disorders can affect the feet. They are, therefore, important indicators of our health so regular checks are essential \u2014 and seek medical advice if you notice any pain, discoloration or rashes.

{"id": "2024_05_10_health_ozempic-glp-1-survey-kff", "text": "About 1 in 8 adults in the United States has used a GLP-1 drug like Ozempic or Mounjaro at some point in their life, and half of them \u2013 about 6% of adults, or more than 15 million people \u2013 are currently using a prescription, according to new survey data from KFF. The US Food and Drug Administration has reported shortages of the GLP-1 medications Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro at various dosages over the past year as drugmakers have raced to keep up with skyrocketing demand. Last week, Novo Nordisk said that at least 25,000 people in the US are starting its drug Wegovy each week \u2013 five times more than were able to start the medicine each week in December. According to the new survey, most adults who have used these drugs have done so to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. More than 40% of respondents who have diabetes and about a quarter of those who have heart disease said they have used GLP-1 drugs. But about 2 in 5 adults used GLP-1 drugs solely to lose weight, the KFF poll found. Neither Ozempic nor Mounjaro is approved for weight loss specifically; the FDA greenlit them to treat type 2 diabetes in 2017 and 2022, respectively. But doctors commonly use them off-label for weight loss. Wegovy, which was approved in 2021 for obesity, contains the same key ingredient as Ozempic, called semaglutide, while Mounjaro uses a slightly different one, tirzepatide. Overall, adults ages 50 to 64 were most likely to have used GLP-1 drugs, but younger adults were more likely to use them solely for weight loss, according to the KFF survey. Medicare prohibits the coverage of prescription weight-loss drugs, and only 1% of seniors said that they have used a GLP-1 drug solely for weight loss, according to the KFF survey. But most adults \u2013 more than 60% \u2013 say that Medicare policy should be changed to include coverage for these drugs when prescribed for weight loss. Still, regardless of insurance coverage, most adults who have used GLP-1 drugs said it was difficult to afford them, the KFF poll found. A month\u2019s supply of GLP-1 drugs can cost about $1,000, and last month, Sen. Bernie Sanders launched an investigation into the \u201coutrageously high prices\u201d that manufacturers charge. Amid high costs and limited supply, some adults may seek alternatives to the highly sought-after drugs. Last year, the FDA warned against compounded versions of semaglutide that combine, mix or alter ingredients in ways that are not regulated or approved. \u201cPatients should only obtain drugs containing semaglutide with a prescription from a licensed health care provider, and only obtain medicines from state-licensed pharmacies or outsourcing facilities registered with FDA,\u201d the agency said, citing reports of adverse events in people who used compounded semaglutide. The vast majority of adults who have used GLP-1 drugs \u2013 about 80% \u2013 said they got the drugs or a prescription from a primary care doctor or a specialist, according to the KFF survey. But about 11% said they got them from an online provider or website, and 10% said they got them from a medical spa or aesthetic medical center. The KFF survey findings are based on responses that were collected from a nationally representative sample of nearly 1,500 adults during the last week of April.
