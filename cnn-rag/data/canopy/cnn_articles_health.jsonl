An umbrella review looks at existing metanalyses of large numbers of studies, providing a high-level view of existing research on a topic. In addition to lowering cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, the umbrella analysis found a \u201cprotective effect\u201d for specific cancers, including \u201cliver, colon, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, melanoma, kidney and non-Hodgkin lymphoma,\u201d said lead author Dr. Angelo Capodici, a graduate student in health science, technology and management at Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna in Pisa, Italy. Vegetarians don\u2019t eat any animal flesh, while the lacto-ovo version of vegetarianism allows dairy products and eggs while excluding all meat, poultry and fish. Veganism, the stricter form of vegetarianism, bans any food products made from meat, poultry and seafood as well as any animal by-products such as gelatin. However, the protective nature of the diets could be sabotaged if poor dietary choices were made, the study authors said via email. \u201cDiets that emphasize consumption of unhealthy plant foods, such as fruit juices, refined grains, potato chips, and even sodas\u201d might counter the positives of a plant-based diet for health, said study coauthor Dr. Federica Guaraldi, medical director of the pituitary unit at the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna in Italy. Fruit juices, which are \u201cfull of sugars or sweetener,\u201d Guaraldi said, \u201c(were) recently demonstrated to have detrimental impact on metabolism as much as or even more than white sugar.\u201d Results may be affected by other lifestyle factors Researchers have long known that people who follow plant-based diets often live healthier lives full of exercise and an avoidance of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains, snacks, alcohol and tobacco, the study said. \u201cWhat is attributed to diet here may be in part due to other lifestyle practices,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThat is a minor concern, however,\u201d Katz said in an email. \u201cThe net effect of plant-predominant dietary patterns is clearly favorable to crucial health outcomes even if some of the observed benefit is attributable to other lifestyle practices.\u201d In fact, adopting a plant-based diet, even without additional exercise, could still yield health benefits, according to a November study on twins by Christopher Gardner, one of the coauthors of the umbrella analysis published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. In the 2023 study, healthy twins who ate a vegan diet for eight weeks had lower \u201cbad\u201d\u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, better\u00a0blood sugar levels and\u00a0greater weight loss\u00a0than siblings who ate a diet of meat and vegetables, according to Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in Palo Alto, California. \u201cThere was a 10% to 15% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 25% drop in insulin, and a 3% drop in body weight in just eight weeks, all by eating real food without animal products,\u201d Gardner told CNN at the time. One reason for that may be the nutritional boost that plants provide, including high levels of vitamins, minerals and other substances with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, while also reducing the inflammatory impact of meat and processed food, the authors said. \u201cPlants have more fiber (animal foods have zero), less saturated fat and zero cholesterol (all animal foods have cholesterol),\u201d Gardner said in an email. \u201cAn entirely separate category is phytochemicals (literally, \u2018plant chemicals\u2019) such as antioxidants. By definition there are no phytochemicals in animal foods.\u201d No meat, poultry or seafood, but dairy and eggs are OK The new review analyzed 48 metanalyses that had investigated the impact of eating a vegetarian or vegan diet on the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease and early death. \u201cWe analyzed reviews considering\u00a0vegan and vegetarian diets that completely exclude(ed) meat, poultry and seafood,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Davide Gori, an associate professor of biomedical and neuromotor sciences at the University of Bologna in Italy. \u201cTo be more precise regarding vegetarian diets, lacto-vegetarian (allowing certain dairy products such as yogurt, cheese and milk), ovo-vegetarian (allowing whole eggs, egg whites and egg-containing foods such as mayonnaise, egg noodles and certain baked goods), (and) lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets were included,\u201d Gori said in an email. However, vegetarian diets limiting but not completely excluding certain types of meat and fish, such as pesco- or pollo-vegetarian diets, were excluded, he said. The review found eating these plant-based diets reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and inflammation by affecting risk factors such as body mass index, fasting glucose and other measures of blood sugar control, and the systolic (top) and diastolic (bottom) measurements of blood pressure. The diets also significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and \u201cC-reactive protein \u2014 an index of inflammation that is typically higher in cardiovascular and metabolic disease,\u201d Gori said. Metabolic disease is a constellation of symptoms such as obesity, high blood pressure and poor control of cholesterol and blood sugars that can all lead to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. However, there was no benefit in eating plants for pregnant women, an \u201cintriguing finding\u201d that needs further research, said Guaraldi of the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences. It\u2019s also possible that the hormones of pregnancy might affect findings, and \u201cwe cannot rule out that participants have taken supplements during the study period that could have altered the impact of diet on the considered parameters.\u201d Special considerations of plant-based diets Because certain vitamin and minerals are more easily found and absorbed from meat, dairy or fish, vegetarians and vegans must take extra precautions to add those into their diets, experts say. Unless the diet is carefully optimized, additional sources of B12, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin D may be needed to avoid a deficiency, according to the Mayo Clinic. \u201cStrictly vegan diets can be deficient in vitamin B12,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThis is easily resolved by consuming foods fortified with (vitamin) B12 \u2014 easy to do because the recommended daily allowance for B12 is lower than any other vitamin or mineral. \u201cIron is another nutrient that is harder to get from a fully vegan diet,\u201d Gardner added. \u201cMany plant foods are relatively high in iron (beans/legumes). Again, supplements can be helpful.\u201d Protein is also a challenge, but good sources in plants include legumes such as lentils, chickpeas and beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains and soy products such as edamame, tempeh and tofu. Processed meat substitutes are options as well, experts say, but due to the processing can be packed with sodium, so read labels carefully.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/vegetarian-vegan-cancer-heart-disease-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness", "text": "Eating enough healthy fats is great for brain and heart health, but new research has possibly provided even more evidence for adding them \u2014 particularly omega-3s \u2014 to your diet. \u201cWe found that a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is associated with a greater risk of dying,\u201d said Yuchen Zhang, lead author of the April study published in the journal eLife, in a news release. Zhang is a doctoral student in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia\u2019s College of Public Health. Omega-3 fatty acids are naturally found in foods including fish \u2014 especially fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines \u2014 as well as flaxseed, walnuts, chia seeds and in dietary supplements such as fish oil. The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA; eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA; and docosahexaenoic acid, known as DHA, according to the National Institutes of Health. The body must obtain all three from foods, and omega-3s contribute to the health of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system and endocrine system. Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, on the other hand, include nuts, seeds, corn and soy \u2014 and the oils and preservatives produced from these foods, the authors said. Linoleic acid is the most common omega-6 fatty acid.\u00a0 \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that the high omega-6 to omega-3 fats ratio typical of Western diets \u2014 20:1 or even higher, compared to an estimated 1:1 during most of human evolution \u2014 contributes to many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and autoimmune disorders,\u201d Zhang said. But the results of past studies have been mixed, she added, and few have investigated the role of an imbalance in mortality. Also, accurately measuring fatty acid intake is difficult, partly due to reliance on participants\u2019 own recollections of their dietary intake. Zhang and the other researchers looked into the associations between the omega-3/omega-6 ratio in blood plasma \u2014 a more objective measure \u2014 and death from any cause and specifically from cancer or cardiovascular disease, the top two leading causes of death worldwide. They used data from 85,425 people who had participated in the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than half a million people between ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom for at least a decade. Participants, whose plasma samples were collected between 2007 and 2010, had answered questionnaires about their diet, including whether they took fish oil supplements. After nearly 13 years of follow-up, the authors found participants with the highest ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 were 26% more likely to die early from any cause, 14% more likely to die from cancer and 31% more likely to die from heart disease than those with the lowest ratios. Considered individually, both high levels of omega-6 and omega-3 were linked with a lower risk of premature death. But the protective effects of omega-3 were greater, likely explaining \u201cwhy having a high ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s was linked to harm,\u201d the authors said. Despite the findings, the study is \u201conly one \u2018snapshot\u2019 in time of biomarkers and dietary intake of omega 3s and 6s. This is correlation, not causation,\u201d said Dr. Lauren R. Sastre, director of the Farm to Clinic Program and assistant professor in the department of nutrition science at East Carolina University, via email. Sastre wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cAnd even that relationship cannot be strongly supported due to methodological flaws in not considering other dietary components to the overall health/clinical outcomes,\u201d Sastre added. \u201cThere are many anti-inflammatory food components (nutrients, phytochemicals, etc.) that are associated with reducing all-cause, cancer and (cardiovascular disease) mortality, and to only evaluate omega 3s and 6s \u2014 strong confounders may be present that would bias the results.\u201d Managing healthy fat intake If the omega-6/omega-3 balance actually does have more to do with premature death risk than the study has the capacity to prove, it could be due to the possible function of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of \u201cRegenerative Health: Discover Your Metabolic Type and Renew Your Liver for Life.\u201d Arachidonic acid is what the body converts from linoleic acid. It\u2019s a \u201cbuilding block for molecules that can promote inflammation, blood clotting, and the constriction of blood vessels,\u201d according to Harvard Health. But this fatty acid can also be converted into molecules that fight inflammation and blood clots. Omega-6s aren\u2019t inherently bad, but having too many may offset the anti-inflammatory factors associated with omega-3, Kirkpatrick said, so \u201ca more balanced approach \u2026 may be favorable.\u201d \u201cThe source of the omega 6s may also be a factor in offsetting the balance as well,\u201d she added via email. \u201cProcessed seed oils may also contain high amounts of omega 6s for example.\u201d Focusing on this balance and increasing your intake of foods rich in omega-3s can be more important than simply limiting those high in omega-6s, Kirkpatrick said. \u201cI would also look at the quality of the omega 6 foods in the diet,\u201d she added, \u201caiming for whole foods \u2026 rather than more processed products that may contain large amounts via the addition of seed oils.\u201d If you\u2019re curious what your blood plasma ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is, ask your physician about testing for it. In Kirkpatrick\u2019s practice, she often works with her patients\u2019 doctors for this purpose. Some patients request it with the goal of improving their mental health, heart health or risk of dementia, she said. Overall, \u201cit\u2019s important to note that an unbalanced ratio is only one chapter in our story of better or worse health span,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cGetting a variety of fiber-rich foods (beneficial to the microbiome) and other nutrient-dense foods, as well as adequate, good-quality sleep, stress management and physical activity play a large role in how long we will enjoy good health within our lifetime.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/health/omega-3-omega-6-death-risk-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_health_genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Even if your genetics put you at greater risk for early death, a healthy lifestyle could help you significantly combat it, according to a new study. That risk could be mitigated by about 62% in people with a genetic predisposition, said lead author Dr. Xifeng Wu, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejiang Univeristy School of Medicine in China. Many studies have shown the connection between a healthy lifestyle and longevity and others have underscored the genetic component in lifespan, but the report published Monday in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine explored how the two come together. With data from more than 350,000 people and information on their genetics, education, socioeconomic status and disease history, this study had strong methodology, said Dr. Aladdin Shadyab, associate professor of public health and medicine at University of California San Diego. He was not involved in the research. The sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added. The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan. Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed. And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Wu, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University. Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed. \u201cAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,\u201d Wu said. The factors that made a difference The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan. But researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death. \u201cThe study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors \u2014 no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet \u2014 that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,\u201d Wu said. Adequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults. Moderate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Making lifestyle changes Building a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there. There are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking. A CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Committing to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of \u201cMindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,\u201d said in a previous CNN article. For a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly. When it comes to catching enough z\u2019s, if you can\u2019t seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you can\u2019t sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics. And if you\u2019ve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/genetic-risk-early-death-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_overdose-deaths-decrease-2023", "text": "After a steep rise during the Covid-19 pandemic, preliminary data shows that drug overdose deaths in the United States ticked down in 2023 for the first time in five years. About 107,500 people died from a drug overdose in 2023, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics \u2014 about 3,500 fewer than in 2022. Last year\u2019s decrease is the first since 2018, but the 3% drop is far less substantial than the surges that pushed overdose deaths to record levels in recent years. Overdose deaths\u00a0spiked\u00a030% between 2019 and 2020 and rose another 15% between 2020 and 2021, CDC data shows. Preliminary data is subject to change as death certificates are reviewed and records are assessed, but estimates suggest that, despite the decline, overdose deaths in 2023 were still almost twice as high as they were five years ago, according to the CDC data. \u201cIt is a hopeful trend in some ways,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Keyes, a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health whose research focuses on substance use epidemiology. \u201cWe know that this drug epidemic is dynamic and changes quite quickly, so any time you see a leveling off or a slight decrease, it is promising. It is certainly not a sign that we need to take the foot off the gas of overdose prevention.\u201d The US Department of Health and Human Services launched a coordinated national strategy to prevent overdoses two years ago. \u201cThis progress over the last 12 months should make us want to reinvigorate our efforts knowing that our strategies are making a difference,\u201d CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry\u00a0said in a statement, but \u201cthere are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses at staggering numbers.\u201d \u201cOur thoughts remain with those who have lost loved ones and those who are struggling with addiction or know someone who is.\u00a0Our country is committed to ending this epidemic and preventing unnecessary death and suffering,\u201d she said. Fentanyl has been driving the latest wave of overdose deaths, with synthetic opioids involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths. These highly potent narcotics continue to play an outsized role: they were involved in nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023. However, there were about 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023 than in 2022, the new data shows. Still, the deadly threat of fentanyl \u2014 which is about 50 times more potent than heroin \u2014 remains. In one indicator of its pervasiveness, a study published Monday shows that law enforcement seizures of illicit fentanyl have surged in recent years. More than 115 million pills containing illicit fentanyl were seized by law enforcement in 2023, compared with about 71 million in 2022 and less than 50,000 in 2017. \u201cFentanyl has continued to infiltrate the drug supply in communities across the United States and it is a very dangerous time to use drugs, even just occasionally,\u201d Dr. Nora Volkow, director of National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a statement. She was not directly involved in the new study, but the research was funded by the federal agency. \u201cIllicit pills are made to look identical to real prescription pills, but can actually contain fentanyl. It is urgently important that people know that any pills given to someone by a friend, purchased on social media, or received from any source other than a pharmacy could be potentially deadly \u2014 even after a single ingestion.\u201d The number of deaths due to fentanyl remains \u201calarmingly high,\u201d Keyes said. But the more promising trends reflect significant, multi-pronged efforts from many different sectors, she said, including use of treatments for opioid use disorder, expanded access to naloxone and other harm reduction programs and reducing opioid prescribing. \u201cI think that has been a real success story for public health,\u201d she said. While overdose deaths involving opioids declined, those involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamine increased, according to the preliminary data from the CDC. There were more than 36,000 deaths involving psychostimulants in 2023, a 2% increase from the year before. And deaths involving cocaine rose 5%, to nearly 30,000. About a third of all overdose deaths in 2023 involved psychostimulants, and cocaine was involved in more than a quarter. Much of this increase is likely due to the proliferation of fentanyl throughout the drug supply, Keyes said. \u201cWe know that when stimulants mix with opioids, it\u2019s particularly lethal,\u201d she said. But expanded surveillance can help those who are working to address the overdose crisis understand its rapidly changing epidemiology and adapt their efforts in real-time. Vast disparities in overdose deaths remain, including state-level differences; the latest CDC data shows \u201cnotable\u201d increases in some Western states such as Washington and Oregon, with overdose deaths increasing at least 27% year-over-year. In other states, including Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana and Maine, overdose deaths dropped by at least 15%. \u201cState-to-state differences point to the need for continued expansion of these efforts,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cBut I think the trends you see nationally are indicative of how it can work. We can address the opioid epidemic. This is not inevitable.\u201d For many state and local governments, funds from opioid settlements have been \u201cinstrumental\u201d to overdose prevention efforts and increased access to treatment and recovery support, Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, jurisdictions will continue to prioritize investments in harm reduction, prevention, and addressing the social determinants of health across communities that have been hardest hit by the overdose crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, state and territorial health agencies will continue to coordinate with partners to build a comprehensive response to this complex public health issue. Lastly, jurisdictions will continue to monitor and prepare to respond to changes in overdose rates and emerging threats within the drug supply.\u201d Recent surveys suggest that drug use among teens in the US has been relatively low and trending down. But overdose deaths have been rising in this age group and millions of adults and adolescents have a drug use disorder. \u201cResearch has shown that delaying the start of substance use among young people, even by one year, can decrease substance use for the rest of their lives. We may be seeing this play out in real time,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cThis trend is reassuring. Though, it remains crucial to continue to educate young people about the risks and harms of substance use in an open and honest way, emphasizing that illicit pills and other substances may contain deadly fentanyl.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/overdose-deaths-decrease-2023/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta", "text": "I\u2019ve been reporting on Alzheimer\u2019s disease for more than two decades, and any progress in the field has seemed incremental at best, leaving most patients and their loved ones with few options. But in the process of filming a new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I met with people all across the country who had been diagnosed with or who are at high risk of the disease. With lifestyle changes alone, I saw levels of amyloid plaque decrease in their brains, their cognition improve and even signs of reversal of the disease. It was extraordinary and it also made me start to think about my own brain, because I have a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. So with some trepidation, I decided to learn more about my risk for dementia. It was one of the most personal and revealing\u00a0experiences I have ever gone through. To start, I underwent an intensive exploration of my brain, far deeper than I even thought possible. This wasn\u2019t a simple look at the anatomy or even the genetics that might predispose me to a particular type of dementia. The goal was to obtain a complete story of my brain, from my earliest days through my education and formative years to now: a man in his mid-50s. Most importantly, the in-depth testing could give me a clearer idea of where I was headed and how to steer my path in the most favorable direction. Even as a brain surgeon myself, I was surprised at how well the health of your brain can be measured. With the heart, it is pretty well-accepted that a battery of tests can help give us a clear idea of how to predict, prevent and treat heart disease. Until recently, however, we really could not say the same about the brain. Many brain doctors still struggle even to define the criteria for a healthy brain. The general consensus was that the \u201cblack box\u201d in your skull was pretty fixed and that there was little you could do to assess it, let alone optimize it. Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist, convinced me otherwise, and it led to one of the most fascinating \u2014 and somewhat frightening \u2014 days I have had in my life. I\u2019ve known Richard for a long time, and we are friends. We have had great conversations about our shared love for the brain, and I often turn to him to get his thoughts on neurological developments in the news. What has always struck me about Richard is that he is consistently unwilling to accept the status quo in medicine, almost more as a matter of justice rather than scientific pursuit, although he is that rare individual who is stellar at making a difference in both. So I immediately thought of him when considering the idea of a preventive neurology visit. To be clear, I wasn\u2019t going to Richard because I thought I had any sort of problem. But that is the point: When people refer to the US medical field as a \u201csick-care\u201d system instead of a health-care system, this is what I think they mean. Richard would certainly see me if I were sick, but he preferred to see me now, while I was healthy, fully believing he could help me maintain my brain, reduce my chance of dementia and even optimize my function, as he described in a 2018 study. I flew into Boca Raton, Florida, to see Richard at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases of Florida clinic on a beautiful day in March. He had advised me ahead of time to not exercise or eat that morning and to prepare for a day of intense mental gymnastics. Although this wasn\u2019t an IQ test, he said, in some ways, it would be far more personal. I must say that it felt very meta to get an assessment of my own brain and find out whether it was functioning as it should or if there were problems I had not yet noticed. Was I getting rusty? Maybe I was making errors that my family, friends and colleagues were too polite to tell me about. If there were gaps in processing speed or executive judgment, they might now be uncovered and unmasked. When I got to the clinic, I first underwent a battery of blood tests, checking my phosphorylated tau ratio, better known as the Alzheimer\u2019s blood test, and measures of my lipids, inflammation and glucose levels, to name just a few. I was also tested for my genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. If I was a carrier of the APOE4 gene, it could carry significant higher risk of the disease. I spit into a tube to check my oral health. After that, I stepped on a body composition scale to figure out where and how much bone, fat and muscle I had in my body. I was a little surprised to catch Richard in the corner, looking at the readout and saying, \u201cInteresting \u2026\u201d while stroking his chin. Nobody likes to see their doctors do that. Not even doctors like to see other doctors do that. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked across the room. \u201cOh,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably fine.\u201d He later told me that he saw evidence of an old left arm injury and accurately predicted that I had had an intense leg workout the day before. It was a real reminder of how clearly the body keeps score. Even though I hadn\u2019t thought about that injury in years, it had clearly left its mark on my body and still triggered a finding on this test. After that came the cognitive testing. This was perhaps the most surprising. At first, I was told to relax and listen to the detailed short story of an Atlanta football team captain, a quarterback who had injured his finger on a fishing trip before the big game. I thought I had been paying attention but suddenly realized I probably wasn\u2019t as engaged as I thought. \u201cWhat day did he injure himself, and how many stitches did he need? What was the player\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked 15 minutes later. Could I even be certain if it was his thumb or left ring finger? Quick: Recite as many words as you can starting with the letter \u201cG\u201d and then immediately rattle off as many animal names as possible, both in one-minute increments. The longer the words and the more unusual the animals, the better. There were lists of words to remember, three-dimensional cubes and clocks to be drawn, and dozens of faces to match with their names. I had to scratch and sniff 50 different smells and determine, in one instance, if something smelled more like gasoline, acetone or a forest fire. In another instance, it was lavender or lilac. I found myself suddenly being unsure and trying to summon up a memory of that smell to try to answer correctly. I felt like my brain was being cross-examined by a very skilled prosecutor. It wasn\u2019t just about the number of errors I made but the types of errors, how long I took to respond and whether I simply lost my attention. There are obvious red flags that pop up if someone draws a clock backward or if they have lost their ability to distinguish certain smells. The more subtle concerns were around visual-spatial construction or an ability to ignore incongruent stimuli in the Stroop Color and Word Test, such as identifying the color red, even if that word appears in purple on the screen. Although I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with dyslexia, Richard thinks it might be something I have. \u201cDo you count on your fingers?\u201d he asked me. I have always done that and never considered it to be notable or suggestive of something significant. Turns out I was less likely to remember words with lots of Bs and Ds in them because I may have always shied away from letters I more easily confused. These types of insights about my own brain, big and small, were all so fascinating (and a bit unsettling) to me. For Richard, however, they represented opportunities for early intervention, some of which are remarkably simple. \u201cMost doctors would look at your results and say you are doing fine,\u201d Richard explained before he showed me the results of my lab testing. \u201cBut what they are really saying is that you are probably fine \u2013 for the next few years. I am playing the long game here, and I think you are going to see a lot of areas we can start to address now, today.\u201d I am a pretty competitive guy, so I am used to having all \u201cgreens\u201d pop up when I review my lab testing results. After all, I take great pride in my health and approach it with the same rigor that I approached my grades in medical school. I wanted to do really well, certainly as well as I could possibly do. So when Richard flipped over my lab results and showed me a page that had not only a considerable amount of yellow but even a few reds, my heart dropped. My homocysteine level was elevated, but my B12 level was low. That wasn\u2019t surprising to Richard, because he had also found a mutation in my MTHFR gene, which meant that I probably didn\u2019t process homocysteine well. My omega-3 levels were all right, but not when you compared them with my omega-6 levels. My DHEA levels were a little low, which might partly explain why I have had more trouble putting on muscle than I did a decade ago. And I was surprised to learn that I was carrying more inflammation in my body than I expected, especially given that I felt fine. What was most revealing to me was how clearly these blood test abnormalities could be associated with neurological function. Richard told me that issues of metabolism, such as even slight insulin resistance, can accelerate amyloid deposition, which can lead to amyloid plaques, those telltale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, down the line. He also said that, in his experience, cholesterol and lipid abnormalities can be associated with problems with executive function and speed of processing. He added that he associates depression with lower attention and slower processing speeds. I\u2019ve been practicing neurosurgery for 30 years, and I had never heard of this. Richard was able to draw a link between very functional aspects of the brain to very specific problems in the body. And, more important, he has presented scientific evidence showing that optimizing those physical targets is associated with improved cognitive function. Richard also wanted to address an activity I did on a daily basis: my neighborhood walk with my three dogs. \u201cKeep doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now with a weighted vest.\u201d Why? Not having enough lean muscle mass is problematic. He told me people typically do a good job addressing their arms and legs, but loading the spine with additional weight helps activate core muscles, such as abdominals and obliques, as well as stimulating the growth of new bone cells. This could lead to a critical redistribution of the fat, muscle and bone in my body and help drive down any insulin resistance that I may be genetically predisposed to and eventually lower my risk of developing amyloid in the brain. On Richard\u2019s advice, I started to make a few changes to my nutrition and day-to-day routine. Over the years, I had gone back and forth on fish oil, not overly impressed with the data on heart health and finding it challenging to keep the pills refrigerated, especially when I was on the road. For Richard, though, it was clear. As healthy as my diet is, he had no doubt that I needed to take the extra steps to supplement with omega-3 fatty acids to help my omega-3/omega-6 ratio in the pursuit of better brain health. This would also help with the absorption of B vitamins, he added. Those needed to be supplemented as well, and Richard was very specific about this. \u201cMake sure to get the bottle with 1,000 micrograms of B12 and 400 micrograms of methylfolate along with 1.5 milligrams of B6.\u201d Those fairly straightforward recommendations to improve my fatty acids could probably make an impact with my executive function, he told me. In the recommendation about brain health, I did not expect an intervention involving my feet, but the nerves that run to the feet are the longest in our body. When you don\u2019t move your toes and feet regularly and freely, Richard says, you can lose sensory awareness, also known as proprioception, leading to a \u201csensory paralysis.\u201d Over time, the nerve connections that run from your feet to your brain start to disappear. Once your feet are weak, your weight will be unevenly distributed when walking and exercising. The better your feet can tolerate a load evenly, the more options they have for movement, the better and more cooperative things will be up the chain, including your knees, hips and lower back. Consider wearing toe spacers occasionally, he told me. Start with 10 minutes a day every few days, and increase the time as you get used to them. Some of the recommendations were more sophisticated. For example, Richard would ideally want even more testing. He\u2019d like to get a detailed DEXA scan of my entire body, not just for bone health but to get a clear look at how much visceral fat I am carrying. Visceral fat is not the subcutaneous fat that you can pinch between your thumb and your forefinger. Rather, it\u2019s the problematic stuff that chokes off the internal organs in your belly. Because visceral fat is so buried and woven into your internal organs, it\u2019s actually quite hard to assess how much someone has. A person could be skinny and still have a lot of visceral fat. Because I had some inflammatory elevations, he worried that I might be one of those people. He also suggested a brain MRI. He was worried that there might be cerebral blood vessel injury because of a slightly elevated fibrinogen level, a protein that can help the blood clot. The concern was that I might be making more frequent micro clots, which could put me at increased risk of vascular dementia later in life. And finally, a coronary calcium CT scan to detect coronary artery disease at its earliest stages, because as a general rule, what is bad for the heart is also bad for the brain. To be clear, most of these tests aren\u2019t part of routine care, and I struggle with the cost of it all. They can be expensive and probably wouldn\u2019t be covered by a person\u2019s insurance, especially if they aren\u2019t showing symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia or mild cognitive impairment. That is why Richard is also working to make much of it available for free at home. Nearly all the cognitive testing could be available in the future through a free app. Even the blood work could be done via finger-prick testing, if all goes as expected with Richard\u2019s research trial. Although a complete DEXA scan requires a facility, there are home scales that do a reasonably good job at measuring overall body composition, not just weight, and can help follow those trends over time. When I first visited with Richard after all my testing, I honestly expected to be told I was doing fine \u2013 even excellent. That is what every doctor had told me before. But the evidence is clear that when it comes to your brain, prevention and even optimization are possible. We know that in so many areas of medicine, there is a very large white space between being totally healthy and being sick. And it\u2019s an area that a sick-care system would not spend much time addressing, especially if the recommendations are as simple and wildly effective as a few vitamins, toe spacers and a rucksack. Going through this experience for \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient\u201d was more revealing and jarring than I could have imagined. After all, nobody wants bad news from a doctor, especially when it comes to your brain. But I can take comfort in knowing these tests aren\u2019t laying out a certain future or preparing me for inevitable catastrophe but rather giving me the personalized knowledge that I can use to take action toward a longer, healthier life and a sharper, healthier brain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/alzheimers-risk-test-sanjay-gupta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_gene-test-success-weight-loss-medications", "text": "One of the big mysteries with popular GLP-1 medications for weight loss is why some people will lose 20% or more of their starting body weight on the drugs while for others, the scale will barely budge. One study found that about 1 in 7 people who used semaglutide \u2013 which is approved for weight loss under the brand name Wegovy \u2013 for more than a year didn\u2019t lose at least 5% of their starting weight, indicating that the drug didn\u2019t work well for them. Now, research suggests that the answer may lie in a person\u2019s genes. The study shows that a new test that assigns a genetic risk score may be able to help people figure out whether they are likely to be successful on injected weight loss medications. \u201cWe think that the test will be able to explain who will be able to lose weight, and we can predict with 95% accuracy who will lose more than 5% with this genetic test,\u201d said Dr. Andres Acosta, a gastroenterologist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic who helped develop the test. Acosta points out that these medications aren\u2019t cheap.\u00a0They\u2019re not always covered by insurance, and if they are, they may come with a high copay. Being able to predict whether the drugs will work could save people a lot of frustration and money. The test, MyPhenome, was developed by researchers at the Mayo Clinic and was licensed last year by a company called Phenomic Sciences.\u00a0It costs $350 and must be ordered by a health care provider.  It looks for 6,000 changes in 22 genes that lie in the signaling pathway for the GLP-1 hormone, and it uses the results to assign each person a risk score that classifies them as either \u201chungry gut\u201d-positive or \u201chungry gut\u201d-negative. People who are hungry gut-positive have normal responses to hormone signaling in the brain, whereas people who are hungry gut-negative don\u2019t seem to respond as well to hormonal signals from the stomach that tell the brain to stop eating.\u00a0Acosta says the test classifies those people as having a hungry brain, and they may need different types of interventions to lose weight, such as bariatric surgery. In a recent small study of 84 people enrolled in a weight loss registry at the Mayo Clinic, researchers ran the test on stored blood or saliva samples. After nine months on semaglutide, people who were classified as hungry gut-positive had lost significantly more weight than those were hungry gut-negative. After a year, people classified as hungry gut-positive had lost an average of 19% of their starting weight, or nearly twice as much, on average, as the 10% of total body weight lost by people who were classified by the test as hungry-gut negative. The study is slated to be presented Monday at the Digestive Disease Week conference in Washington, DC.\u00a0It has not been scrutinized by outside experts or published in a medical journal, so its conclusions are considered preliminary. \u201cWe do need to test these in a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial that we have done for other medications. That\u2019s the highest gold standard,\u201d Acosta said.  \u201cBut at this point, we can say that these outcomes were in patients who were blinded to the results as well as the investigation,\u201d he added, meaning they didn\u2019t know whether they were hungry gut-positive or -negative while they were using the drug.

{"id": "2024_05_11_health_alternatives-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness", "text": "Many people love their ultraprocessed foods. Sodas, chips, ice cream, lunch meat and other prepared foods are staples of the American diet. They are hard to avoid, too. More than\u00a070% of the US food supply\u00a0is made of ultraprocessed food. But a diet heavy in ultraprocessed food isn\u2019t good for us, science has shown. Eating\u00a0ultraprocessed foods\u00a0raises the risk of developing or dying from dozens of health conditions, according to a February review covering nearly 10 million people. Science has also shown that when you eat Mediterranean meals, which focus on vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and fish, you can reduce the risk of some\u00a0cancers,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0heart disease, high cholesterol\u00a0and stroke. Adopting this approach to eating can\u00a0also improve brain health, strengthen bones and ward off depression and dementia. Hot dogs and cookies are delicious, though. So, what to do? Spot the troublesome ingredients Many ultraprocessed foods have very long lists of ingredients and include additives, according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. If you can\u2019t pronounce the names in your food\u2019s ingredient list, that\u2019s a warning sign. The list may include preservatives designed to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing. All are signs that the food is ultraprocessed. Skip eating out when you can\u2019t tell what ingredients are in your food, and note that many items on fast-food restaurant menus can be ultraprocessed (such as hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets and fries). Start with breakfast Breakfast may be the easiest meal to change. Instead of sugar-fortified cereal or toaster waffles,\u00a0have some warm and filling ancient grains such as quinoa, sorghum or wheat berries cooked with milk, honey, nuts and fruits. No time in the morning to prepare breakfast? Prep these overnight oats the night before. Or have a simple small bowl of plain Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of sliced nuts to go. How processed is your lunch? Instead of a loaded deli sandwich or slices of pizza every day, try to bring your own plant-based lunch once or twice per week. I love adding roast chicken leftovers to this kale ricotta salad (sub in feta if you can\u2019t find the ricotta). Or make this dish by registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, founder of\u00a0Olive Tree Nutrition. She created her Warm Farro Grain Salad With Pomegranate for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better newsletter. Need more ideas? Check out CNN contributor Casey Barber\u2019s ideas for school lunch. Try our interactive to help you buy the least ultraprocessed lunch you can. Is it time for a snack? Snacks can be tricky. The no-fly list of ultraprocessed food is loaded with store-bought chips, sugar-packed yogurts and candy-filled trail mix. Instead, think about apples, oranges, bananas, carrot sticks, and other fruits and veggies. Protein-packed nuts and seeds are filling while also providing a brain boost and heart-healthy fats. If you want to get fancy, Al Bochi created this\u00a0roasted almond snack for CNN that features the Mediterranean spice blend za\u2019atar. Suzy Karadsheh\u2019s avocado salsa dip is also amazing for movie nights, the big game and parties (whichever one you choose). Dinner during the week With dinner a rushed affair for many overscheduled families, it can be impossible to cook during the week. Try to avoid fast-food burgers and chicken nuggets when you can.  Instead, consider grilling chicken or cooking ground turkey on the weekend for easy-assemble Tuesday taco night. Karadsheh also has a Mediterranean twist on tuna salad that will convert even the most anti-tuna eaters (which once included me). May I have dessert, please? Baked goods and ice cream are fine for special occasions, but for an everyday dessert that\u2019s not highly processed,\u00a0Al Bochi\u2019s recipe for Strawberry Ricotta Granola Parfaits is next level. For something grown-up, try poaching pears with\u00a0pomegranate juice\u00a0or port and serve them over yogurt or bake pears and other fruits in parchment. Does this still sound too hard? Ultraprocessed foods are designed to be fun and taste good. Reducing your reliance on them can be hard. Try one suggestion at a time, for a week at a time.

{"id": "2024_05_15_health_internet-greater-well-being-study-wellness", "text": "The internet is ruining our lives, right? Not necessarily, according to a new study. \u201cNearly everyone seems to think that internet-powered technologies are driving an epidemic of ill-being and mental health problems,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Matti Vuorre, assistant professor of social psychology at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, in an email. \u201cOur study of over two million individuals from 160+ countries runs contrary to this idea.\u201d People with access to home internet and/or mobile internet and actively use internet report greater well-being across eight different categories \u2014 including life satisfaction and social life, according to a study published Monday in the journal Technology, Mind, and Behavior. Researchers analyzed data from nearly 2.5 million people across 168 countries using the annual Gallup World Poll, trying to answer the following question: Do individuals who have access and actively use the internet report greater or lower levels of well-being than those who do not? \u201cBecause even such a simple question can be statistically answered in many different ways, we analyzed the data in tens of thousands of different ways,\u201d he added. Across all those ways of crunching the numbers, about 85% showed that those who have and use the internet report greater well-being that those who do not, according to the research. The global perspective is useful, and the data analysis of the research is strong, said Dr. Markus Appel, professor of the psychology of communication and new media at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany. He was not involved in the research. Other research has shown that the connection between mobile internet use and well-being is complex and varies among individuals, he added. \u201cThe internet is neither a curse (nor) a blessing for people\u2019s well-being,\u201d Appel said. \u201cIt depends on what people do with it.\u201d Online users report greater well-being This study was observational, meaning that the data doesn\u2019t show that the internet access necessarily caused the better well-being \u2014 there might be other factors responsible for the association. \u201cOur results might then simply indicate that individuals with more money, access to healthcare, etc, report greater well-being,\u201d Vuorre said in an email. The researchers accounted for that in their data and tried to adjust for factors such as income levels and still found that internet users reported greater well-being than those non-internet users, Vuorre said. Cut the internet or keep scrolling? The internet is used for a wide variety of things \u2014 including online banking, shopping, finding services, reading the news and cyberbullying \u2014 and those different uses will have different effects on well-being, Vuorre said. Much of life has moved online very quickly, and it hasn\u2019t left much time to investigate all the impacts of the internet, he added. \u201cWe as a society and/or academic scientists don\u2019t have time to sufficiently learn and develop methodology to address each panic carefully and therefore do not learn sufficiently to be able to inform policy and make conclusions with confidence,\u201d Vuorre said. \u201cCaution is warranted on all sides.\u201d Many studies have shown concerning connections between social media use and mental health, particularly among younger people. Scrolling through images of other people\u2019s lives and comparing them with your own has been associated with a poor effect on mood, for example. Before institutions advise harsh limitations on computers and mobile phones, more research is needed on both the potential harms and benefits, Vuorre said. \u201cAlthough prominent narratives and the cautionary principle might suggest draconian limitations to technology use, ours and many other findings provide a much more nuanced and mixed view,\u201d he added. To get the best out of your internet use, Appel recommends being mindful of your own experience. \u201cIf you sense that some activity on the internet makes you feel sad or envious \u2014 stop it. Look out for something else,\u201d Appel added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/health/internet-greater-well-being-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_01_11_health_short-attention-span-wellness", "text": "I\u2019ve been working steadily for hours but feel as if I haven\u2019t even started. My attention is being pulled from my assigned task \u2014 writing this story \u2014 by a myriad of what I believe are necessary work interruptions. (OK, a couple were from my cat, who also firmly believes in their necessity.)   My kids and I call days like this \u201csquirrel days\u201d in honor of Dug, the talking dog in (squirrel !!) the 2009 Pixar movie \u201cUp,\u201d who (squirrel !!) was constantly distracted by well, just about (squirrel !!) \u2026 Unfortunately, all too many of us are having \u201csquirrel\u201d days, according to Dr. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who studies how digital media affects our lives. In her book \u201cAttention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity,\u201d Mark explains how decades of research have tracked the decline of the ability to focus. \u201cIn 2004, we measured the average attention on a screen to be 2\u00bd minutes,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSome years later, we found attention spans to be about 75 seconds. Now we find people can only pay attention to one screen for an average of 47 seconds.\u201d Not only do people concentrate for less than a minute on any one screen, Mark said, but when attention is diverted from an active work project, they take about 25 minutes to refocus on that task. (Wait, what??) \u201cIn fact, our research shows it takes 25 minutes, 26 seconds, before we go back to the original working sphere or project,\u201d Mark said. Why you have a short attention span How can that be? \u201cIf we look at work in terms of switching projects, as opposed to the micro view of switching screens, we find people spend about 10\u00bd  minutes in any work project before being interrupted \u2014 internally or by someone else \u2014 and then switch to another work project,\u201d Mark said. Yes, but then we go back to the original work, right? Wrong, Mark said. Instead, when we are interrupted on project two, we switch yet again to a different task \u2014 call it project three. Unbelievably, her research has shown we are also interrupted on project three and move on to project four.   \u201cAnd then you go back and pick up the original interrupted project,\u201d Mark said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019re interrupted and you do nothing. For over 25 minutes, you\u2019re actually working on other things.\u201d  (At least I can tell my boss that when I miss my deadline.) \u201cHowever, there\u2019s also a switch cost,\u201d Mark added. \u201cA switch cost is the time it takes you to reorient back to your work: \u2018Where was I? What was I thinking of?\u2019 That additional effort can also lead to errors and stress.\u201d How to focus Why is all of this a problem? After all, it\u2019s called multitasking, thought by many to be a highly prized skill for coping with the demands of the information age.  \u201cWith the exception of a few rare individuals, there is no such thing as multitasking,\u201d Mark said. \u201cUnless one of the tasks is automatic, like chewing gum or walking, you cannot do two effortful things at the same time.\u201d For example, she said, you can\u2019t read email and be in a video meeting. When you focus on one thing, you lose the other. \u201cYou\u2019re actually switching your attention very quickly between the two,\u201d Mark said. \u201cAnd when you switch your attention fast, it\u2019s correlated with stress.\u201d  Blood pressure rises. Heart rate speeds up. Psychological measures of stress also show negative outcomes, she said, such as more fatigue and mistakes and less productivity: \u201cThe more people multitask, the more errors they make.\u201d  Who did this to us? We did, of course, with the help of tech culprits such as social media, tablets and television. But Mark blames email the most.    \u201cTo me, email is probably the worst because it\u2019s become a symbol of work,\u201d she said, adding that her research has found a direct correlation between email and more stress. \u201cWe cut off email for some workers in an organization for one workweek,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing heart rate monitors, we found that they became significantly less stressed and were able to focus significantly longer.\u201d  (I find myself pausing to look up flights to Bora Bora. Oh, right. They have email there, too.) \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a person can just completely cut off from technology and work in today\u2019s world,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSo let\u2019s learn how to live with it in a way that maintains our positive well-being.\u201d How to increase your attention span Regaining your focus requires you to be mindful of how you are using technology, Mark said, a daunting task if you consider the average American spends at least 10 hours a day on screens. Paradoxically, you can use technology to help, she said. Schedule rote work for the first part of the day when you\u2019re not fully alert, then use technology to block distractions when you\u2019re at your mental best. At night, offload tasks from your brain by writing them down and then put the list away. Distracted by social media sites?

{"id": "2024_05_17_world_ancient-arachnid-spiny-legs-intl-scli-scn", "text": "The idea of coming face to face with a spider-like creature unexpectedly is enough to fill any arachnophobe with horror, let alone encountering one with large, spiky legs. But that is exactly what roamed around what\u2019s currently northeast Illinois in the late Carboniferous Period about 300 million to 320 million years ago, according to a study published Friday in the Journal of Paleontology. The newly discovered long-extinct species is described as a \u201clarge spider-like arachnid\u201d with \u201cdistinctive large spines on the legs\u201d by the study\u2019s authors. They were unable to place the creature within any known arachnid order due to the specimen\u2019s lack of mouthparts, which scientists use to classify them.  \u201cYou see sort of spiny legs in some arachnids, but we\u2019ve never seen one that really has these big spines all the way along, at least the first parts of the legs. It\u2019s very, very striking,\u201d Dr. Jason Dunlop, a curator of arachnids and myriapods at Berlin\u2019s Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde and the study\u2019s coauthor, told CNN on Friday. \u201cWe looked at it twice and said, \u2018What are we looking at here?\u2019\u201d Expert fossil preparator Bob Masek first discovered the specimen in the 1980s in the fossil deposits preserved at Illinois\u2019 Mazon Creek Lagerst\u00e4tte. (The German word is a term paleontologists use to describe an exceptional site with many perfectly preserved fossils.) \ufeffHowever, it wasn\u2019t until 2023 that it became apparent the specimen was a newfound species and fossil collector David Douglass, who had acquired it from Masek, donated it for research. Researchers then examined and photographed the fossil using a camera attached to a microscope. They found that the creature was \u201cevidently something very different from any previously described arachnid,\u201d with spiny legs that resemble some modern harvestmen arachnids but with a different type of body. The creature likely used its spines for defensive purposes rather than to attack other animals, similar to a hedgehog\u2019s spines today, Dunlop said. \u201cIt means if something tries to bite it, it catches the spines in its mouth. \u2026 We talk about handling time, which means if you want to eat something spiny, it takes longer because you\u2019ve got to break the spines off or bite the bits that haven\u2019t got spines on it,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can guess there were scorpions and other spiders around,\u201d Dunlop said, as well as primitive lizardlike animals or large amphibians that would have hunted these arachnids, but it isn\u2019t possible to know for certain. Without the mouthparts, researchers cannot pinpoint its closest relative, but they hypothesize it could belong to a wider group including spiders, whip spiders and whip scorpions. Paleontologists have only found this particular species in North America so far, but it could \u201cturn up somewhere else\u201d in Northern Europe too, Dunlop said. \u201cA huge area across a lot of what\u2019s now Europe and North America was probably a kind of giant tropical rainforest and wherever coal is found today, you\u2019ve got a reasonable chance of finding these fossils (of arachnids, plants and insects),\u201d he added. Ultimately, researchers named the species Douglassarachne acanthopoda. The genus name honors the Douglass family, who donated the specimen to Chicago\u2019s Field Museum of Natural History, and the species name references the spines that make this arachnid so distinctive.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/ancient-arachnid-spiny-legs-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_health_alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness", "text": "Preventive neurologist Dr Richard Isaacson stared at the numbers on the fax in astonishment. Blood biomarkers of telltale signs of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the brain of his patient, 55-year-old entrepreneur Simon Nicholls, had all but disappeared in a mere 14 months. \u201cI had to catch my breath. It was a complete shock: The blood tests on his brain had normalized,\u201d said Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. Was this stunning result the work of some new miracle drug designed to combat dementia? Not at all. This is a story of old-fashioned grit and determination. \u201cSimon was on a mission, as if the Grim Reaper was peering over his shoulder. He was going to kick ass and take names,\u201d Isaacson said. Nicholls reduced his risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle changes recommended by Isaacson, including diet, exercise, reducing stress and optimizing sleep, along with a few strategically chosen supplements and medications prescribed by his cardiologist. \u201cI was very worried,\u201d Nicholls told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in his new documentary, \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d which is airing on \u201cThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.\u201d \u201cI have a 3-year-old son and an 8-year-old son. It\u2019s really important for me, as I get older, to try and be there for them in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many [changes] in lifestyle you can do to hopefully push the disease backwards and give yourself more time, which is all we need until we find a cure.\u201d Unlucky genes When it came to genetics and dementia, Nicholls had drawn the short straw. He carried two copies of the APOE4 gene, one from each parent, which may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s at least tenfold. \u201cSadly, my mum passed away from what we think is Alzheimer\u2019s in her 70s,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cFor the last 10 years of her life, she just sat in a chair, rocking, while on about 14 medications. I\u2019d much rather have a longer health span and then just go quickly.\u201d Not everyone with one or even two copies of APOE4 develops Alzheimer\u2019s, however, creating a tantalizing opportunity. Can a person diminish their genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s via lifestyle and various medical interventions, especially if started early, before too much damage is done? Isaacson, who also has a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, believes the answer is yes. He began the first US clinic devoted to Alzheimer\u2019s prevention in New York City in 2013 before moving his program to Florida in 2021. His research has shown that following a dozen or more lifestyle interventions, when practiced 60% or more of the time, can improve cognitive function, especially in women. Today, scientists around the world are also investigating the impact on cognition of such lifestyle changes as a healthy plant-based diet,\u00a0stress reduction,\u00a0strength training, aerobic exercise and quality sleep habits \u2014 behaviors that Isaacson and his team outlined in a recent review\u00a0published in Nature. \u201cI don\u2019t use the term \u2018reverse.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what reverse means when it comes to the field of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut the results we\u2019ve seen with Simon and some other patients in our research are extremely exciting.\u201d How the heart and the brain are intertwined Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t the only pathway to a life of dwindling memory and the inability to think, plan and interact with loved ones. Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can be caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks, stroke, blood clots and more, all of which can further damage the body and brain. Poor hearts and their consequences can run rampant in a family over generations, a fact Nicholls knew all too well. \u201cMy whole family had endless heart attacks, resulting in my grandfather on my mother\u2019s side dying around age 50,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother had three heart attacks, the first at age 50, then a triple bypass before she went on to develop dementia.\u201d Carrying an APOE4 gene further increases the risk for heart disease as well as dementia, experts say. \u201cMy sister had three heart attacks, and when I was 40, I was told that I had atherosclerosis, with a ridiculously massive coronary artery calcium score of like 1,500 and occlusions in about 96% of my arteries.\u201d A normal coronary artery calcium score is zero. For a man in the prime of his life, the news was crushing. Doctors tried to use lifestyle changes and statins to reverse the plaque buildup but finally resorted to surgery, opening three of Nicholls\u2019 arteries with stents. He also began using an injectable drug called evolocumab, designed to boost the liver\u2019s ability to remove \u201cbad\u201d \u00a0low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, from the body. \u2018It was time to turn to my brain\u2019 Slowly, Nicholls\u2019 heart condition began to improve, but the bad news didn\u2019t end there. A brain scan found telltale signs of vascular damage in Nicholls\u2019 brain, which occurs when the tiniest blood vessels are starved of oxygen. \u201cThe doctors said I had too many white matter lesions.\u00a0I told myself that since I now had my heart more or less under control, it was time to turn to my brain,\u201d Nicholls said. In January 2023, Nicholls became participant No. 34 in a novel clinical trial at Isaacson\u2019s Florida center. The trial is designed to uncover cognitive risk factors and counter them with a personalized plan of attack. (Full disclosure: I am participant No. 20 in the same trial; you can read about my experience here.) \u201cThe overall goal of the study is democratize access to preventive neurology care by eventually using at-home blood testing to cost-effectively reach the most people,\u201d Isaacson said. As part of the trial, Nicholls underwent a battery of tests, including a unique blood test that can track levels of amyloid, tau\u00a0and other\u00a0hallmark biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other degenerative conditions. Deposits of amyloid can begin accumulating in the brain decades before symptoms begin,\u00a0even in a person\u2019s 30s and 40s. \u201cSimon\u2019s first test came back with a score of 70. Anything over 58 was positive for amyloid in the brain,\u201d Isaacson said.\u00a0\u201cThe results backed up the amyloid PET scan Simon had taken in 2019, where I could see the plaque in his brain.\u201d 10,000 steps a day: \u2018I\u2019m very consistent\u2019 Nicholls needed to lose weight, so he began taking tirzepatide (the active ingredient in the medications Mounjaro and Zepbound), one of the newer injectable drugs that suppress appetite by stimulating hormones that control blood sugar levels. At the same time, Nicholls was encouraged to step up his physical activity by incorporating strength training three times a week while adding 45 to 60 minutes a day of zone 2 exercise, in which you briskly walk, ruck, jog or cycle at 60% to 70% of your heart rate. \u201cI love going for a walk every morning at sunrise for an hour and a half with a podcast. I get in 10,000 steps or more every day. I\u2019m very consistent,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cI also do a very slow full-body workout with weights three times a week for an hour\u2019s time.\u201d Avoiding sugar, artificial sweeteners, alcohol and ultraprocessed foods is a must, as is following a plant-based meal plan such as the Mediterranean diet. \u201cWhen I first saw Simon, he had a bit of a middle, like most guys in their 50s,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen I saw him at nine weeks, I did a double take. He was totally buff, ripped even. \u201cWithin those nine weeks, he had lost 21 pounds, about 80% of that fat, and put on muscle, which was excellent,\u201d Isaacson added. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d The weight loss and increased muscle mass lowered Nicholls\u2019 fasting blood sugar levels, ending his march toward diabetes, while some tweaks to his cholesterol medications further optimized his good and bad cholesterol numbers. In August 2023, it was time to repeat the blood test for amyloid. By then, the company that administers the tests had added a measurement for tau, another key hallmark sign of Alzheimer\u2019s, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease. \u201cSimon\u2019s amyloid probability score on the new APS2 test had dropped to 53, which was phenomenal,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cBut he was still positive, as anything between 48 and 100 is considered to reflect a high probability of amyloid brain plaques on a brain scan.\u201d \u2018Turn on the screws\u2019 Now that the big concerns of cholesterol, insulin, diet, exercise and fat mass were addressed, it was time \u201cto turn on the screws,\u201d Isaacson said, with personalized recommendations based on Nicholls\u2019 biology. \u201cWe optimized Simon\u2019s omega-3 fatty acid levels, which is especially important for people with APOE \u03b54, as they need more omega-3. We also added B complex vitamins to control elevated homocysteine in his blood,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cHowever, we would not give B complex vitamins to anyone who did not have higher homocysteine levels.\u201d Elevated homocysteine, which is an amino acid used by the body to make protein, is a risk factor for brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. A September 2010 randomized controlled trial found that supplementation slowed brain atrophy in people with mild cognitive impairment. In the meantime, Nicholls, an avid researcher who loves to read medical journals, was adding some interventions of his own. \u201cI have steam and sauna rooms in my home, I do a lot of that. I love it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried cold water plunges, and I have lists of things to do I get from podcasts, from walking to sleeping to gratitude to yoga to sleep routines. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I do that Dr. Isaacson doesn\u2019t agree with: I get stem cell injections twice a year,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cSadly, I have arthritis in my hands, and that definitely feels better when I use stem cells, and I like to think they may be helping my brain, as well.\u201d There was one more big issue to tackle: Nicholls\u2019 sleep, or lack of it, which studies have shown can hasten cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s. With business around the world, Nicholls is a frequent flyer with \u201cterrible sleep\u201d due to jet lag and insomnia.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m also a worrier type of person,\u201d he confessed. Adding a sleep medication approved for insomnia helped, \u201cbut Simon really needs to tackle his sleep by improving his sleep hygiene with a more regular sleep schedule,\u201d Isaacson said. An unbelievable result On Halloween 2023, the next APS2 score arrived. Amazingly, Nicholls had reduced the amount of amyloid and tau in his blood to 40: He was testing negative in blood for signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. Shocked and amazed, Isaacson remained skeptical. \u201cI was very cautious. You know, promise not to overpromise. I needed to retest.\u201d A few days before Christmas, the repeat test results arrived. When it too was a negative finding of 40, Isaacson decided to tell Nicholls in person. \u201cDr. Isaacson drove all the way from Boca Raton to Miami excited, very happy,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cWe walked on a beach together, and we were ecstatic that we\u2019d actually been able go from positive to negative for amyloid.\u201d Although Nicholls is ecstatic about the improvements, he\u2019s also very humble about his efforts to improve his health. \u201cI\u2019m really not all that compliant. To comply is just horrendously difficult, right? Of course I want to have a beer or a hamburger or something stupid. I love gummy bears and eating crappy food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped that I have some great doctors to help me, but to be honest, my biggest motivator are my children,\u201d Nicholls added. \u201cI\u2019d love to see my sons get married and have their own kids, and to do that, I have to put in the work to stay the way I am now.\u201d Even lower amyloid levels and a larger hippocampus It appears Nicholls is well on his way toward that goal. In March, his APS2 score had dropped to 25, an unbelievably low number. Not only was Nicholls blood negative for amyloid and tau, the test suggested that his brain amyloid might be normal, with no distinguishable signs of the disease. The only way to definitively prove this, however, would be to repeat his amyloid PET scan, Isaacson said. \u201cWhat really drove his score down was the amyloid value,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cIt normalized at .101, which is like crazy good. That\u2019s not matter for discussion; for amyloid, .1 or above is normal.\u201d Even more startling: Brain volume scans showed that the hippocampus, the tiny seahorse-shaped organ responsible for memory, had actually grown in volume in Nicholls\u2019 brain since he started the intervention. In early Alzheimer\u2019s stages, the hippocampus loses tissue rapidly and then atrophies as the disease progresses. Despite these amazing outcomes, Isaacson remains cautious. After all, this is one person, and similar findings have not been been replicated in a larger, more controlled sample and published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the term \u2018reverse\u2019 because I don\u2019t know what will happen if the person stops doing the intervention,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cI also don\u2019t know if the brain might normalize for a short period of time and then, five years later, catch up. Until I have more data, I don\u2019t think that reverse is the right word.\u201d That doesn\u2019t stop his wonder at the results and his gratitude to Nicholls for his continuing dedication to the study and the personalized interventions. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d seen this before, but only in people who are taking anti-amyloid medications,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cWhen you work your entire career and are told by everyone, \u2018It\u2019s not possible to do this,\u2019 and then you see it \u2014 well, I\u2019m still humbled and amazed.\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s and brain health resources", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/health/alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}

And if you have no idea what that sentence even means, you\u2019re probably not a member of\u00a0Generation Z. The acronym\u00a0BORG stands for\u00a0\u201cblackout rage gallon,\u201d according to the\u00a0National Capital Poison Center in Washington, DC.\u00a0The term\u00a0refers to a concoction\u00a0often prepared in a gallon-size plastic jug that typically contains\u00a0vodka\u00a0or other distilled alcohol, water, a flavor enhancer and an electrolyte powder or drink.\u00a0BORGs are often drunk at outside day parties, otherwise known as darties. The new version of jungle juice There\u2019s so much alcohol in a BORG that \u201cdrinking one can lead to potentially life-threatening consumption and alcohol poisoning,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Anna Lembke, a professor of psychiatry and addiction medicine at Stanford University in California. The large-batch drink is the new version of jungle juice, according to Sabrina Grimaldi, the creator\u00a0and editor-in-chief\u00a0of online lifestyle magazine\u00a0The Zillennial\u00a0Zine. The publication targets the\u00a0micro-generation\u00a0between millennials and Gen Z. \u201cInstead of making a party-sized mixed drink in a huge 5-gallon drink dispenser, a giant storage tub, or even the grossest trend, which was making jungle juice in a sink or bathtub, everyone has their own personal drink,\u201d Grimaldi wrote CNN in an email.\u00a0As the drink\u2019s name\u00a0suggests,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s intended to get you extremely drunk.\u201d What Lembke calls the BORG\u2019s \u201csocial contagion factor\u201d makes it even more dangerous. \u201cKids see other kids doing it and want to try it themselves,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s another real danger here \u2014 to take a dangerous deviant behavior and normalize it by spreading it on social media.\u201d Gen Z binge drinking Grimaldi, who is 24, first heard about BORGs earlier this year when her editorial intern, Kelly Xiong, 21, pitched her a\u00a0story\u00a0on the topic of why they are so popular among Gen\u00a0Zers. \u201cI graduated college in 2020 so it\u2019s safe to say I haven\u2019t been a part of the college party scene in almost 5 years (especially because of the pandemic),\u201d Grimaldi said.\u00a0\u201cEven though Kelly and I are so close in age, it\u2019s crazy how these microtrends pop up.\u201d Xiong, who\u00a0just graduated from\u00a0the University of Pittsburgh, first learned about BORGs during her sophomore year at college. \u201cIt was during a St. Patrick\u2019s Day block darty,\u00a0and almost everyone had their own BORG,\u201d she told CNN\u00a0via email, adding that the drink is particularly popular at big outdoor day parties or\u00a0\u201cspecial occasion darties.\u201d While the origins of the term are difficult to trace, BORGs have made headlines, including in March 2023 when\u00a0more than two dozen University of Massachusetts Amherst\u00a0students, many of whom were believed to be carrying BORGS, were carried away by ambulance following an off-campus event. High school students are drinking BORGs The trend is not limited to the college demographic. At the high school senior\u00a0class pool party\u00a0last year and this year, \u201ceveryone made their own\u00a0BORG,\u201d said Virginia, 18, a senior at a private high school in Tampa, Florida, who didn\u2019t want her real name used to protect her privacy. Virginia said one of the reasons BORGs appeal to her is the social aspect. \u201cYou have to name your BORG and get creative by writing the name on it with a Sharpie,\u201d she said. BORG posts starring gallon jugs with punny names such as Captain Borgan, Our Borg and Savior, Borgan Donor and Borgan Wallen proliferate on TikTok. Thinking along those lines is part of what makes BORGs potentially dangerous to the people turning to them as a party drink, Lembke said. Virginia said she recognizes the dangers of drinking BORGs. \u201cA lot of people just pour vodka in and don\u2019t measure it, so it can actually be kind of dangerous as opposed to knowing you drank three cans of beer,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cNobody is really rationing how much they\u2019re going to drink.\u201d That\u2019s true even if the person is 21, the legal age to drink in the United States, or older. A\u00a0standard drink\u00a0in the US\u00a0contains\u00a01 to 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer, according to the National Institutes of Health.\u00a0For females, drinking more than four standard drinks (and for males, more than five) over a two-hour time frame is considered a binge,\u00a0according to the NIH. \u201cA BORG often contains a fifth (25.6 fluid ounces or 3.2 cups)\u00a0of vodka or other hard alcohol, which is about 17 standard drinks, which is a massive amount of alcohol,\u201d Lembke said. No amount of alcohol is good for you It\u2019s actually best not to drink alcohol at all, as\u00a0a number of recent studies have found that\u00a0no amount of drinking is healthy. The\u00a0World Heart Federation published a policy brief in 2022 saying there is \u201cno level of\u00a0alcohol consumption that is safe for health.\u201d If you do drink, health experts encourage moderation.\u00a0That\u2019s no more than 3 ounces of alcohol for women or 4 ounces for men over the course of a day, according to the\u00a02020-2025\u00a0Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Lembke also recommended not making a regular habit of it. The liver processes about 1 ounce of alcohol per hour, or roughly one standard drink per hour, Lembke said. Depending on the alcohol quantity in the mix, drinking a BORG\u00a0\u201ctotally overwhelms the capacity of the liver to metabolize it,\u201d especially for somebody who\u2019s not already tolerant to alcohol, Lembke said. The fact that BORGS are usually sweetened with a diluting agent such as electrolyte drinks or water flavor enhancers only makes them more dangerous, she said. \u201cIt makes it more palatable, and people generally can drink more than they could of something like straight vodka,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t increase the liver\u2019s ability to metabolize alcohol better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/borg-blackout-rage-gallon-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_skin-cancer-screening-wellness", "text": "Skin cancer is by far the most common form of cancer in the United States, according to the\u00a0American Cancer Society. With summer coming in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s time to check in with CNN wellness expert and emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen about the dangers of skin cancer and the need for safe sun exposure. As we head into summer, what do we need to know about the chance of developing skin cancer? And how can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration needs to be checked out? Which health care provider should be contacted if there is a concern? Should people get full-body skin cancer screening exams? Are self-exams useful? Wen has some answers for us, as well as steps everyone can take to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.\u00a0An emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University, she previously was Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: I was surprised to learn that skin cancer is so common. What are the major forms of skin cancer? Dr. Leana Wen: There are\u00a0three main forms\u00a0of skin cancer. The most common type is called basal cell carcinoma. These cancers can look like an elevated transparent bump on the skin and most frequently occur on the head, neck and other areas most exposed to the sun. Although these cancers generally develop slowly, they can grow deep and damage nerves and bones. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer. These often resemble a red bump and may manifest as a sore or wound that heals and then opens up again. These, too, tend to appear in areas with frequent sun exposure\u00a0and can also appear on the lip and ear. They can grow deep and spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is the third type that is critical to know. That\u2019s because while it only accounts for 1% of total cancers, it is the\u00a0cause of the majority of deaths\u00a0from skin cancer. In the United States in 2024, more than 8,000 people will die annually from this cancer. Melanoma can develop within a mole that already exists or as a new dark spot on the skin. There is also an association with sun exposure and melanoma. According to the American Cancer Society, though melanoma risk increases with age, it is\u00a0one of the most common cancers\u00a0in young adults. CNN: How can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration should be checked out by a medical professional? Wen:\u00a0There is an\u00a0\u201cABCDE\u201d rule\u00a0that describes warning features that could signify a melanoma. A is for asymmetry, if the shape of\u00a0one half\u00a0of the mole does not match the other. B is for border. A mole with blurred, irregular edges could be concerning. C is for color, meaning a mole that has multiple colors and shades. D is for diameter. Some melanomas can be very small, but most are over 6 millimeters, about \u00bc inch, wide. E is for evolving, meaning that the mole has changed over the past weeks or months. Anyone who notices these features of a mole should get it checked out. In addition, people who notice a new growth, a spot or bump that is increasing in size over time, a skin discoloration that is causing discomfort\u00a0or a sore that doesn\u2019t\u00a0get better\u00a0should also seek medical attention. CNN: Should people make an appointment with a dermatologist? What if they don\u2019t have one? Wen:\u00a0Those who have a dermatologist should contact that person first. Sometimes, a referral from a primary care provider may be necessary. People who have concerning signs that could point to melanoma should clearly state this as a reason \u2014 that they have a change in size or color of a mole, for example, and they are concerned about skin cancer. CNN: Is it recommended for everyone to receive regular skin cancer screening tests? Wen: The influential\u00a0US\u00a0Preventive Services Task Force issued a\u00a0recommendation\u00a0in 2023 that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus risks\u00a0of regular visual skin examination as a method to screen for skin cancer. It\u2019s important to note that this is the general recommendation for people at average risk for skin cancer\u00a0who\u00a0have\u00a0no suspicious moles or spots. People who do see concerning new skin changes should be sure to contact their physician right away. In addition, those who are at increased risk for skin cancer should ask a dermatologist if they should receive regular skin exams. These are done via visual inspection by the physician, meaning that the doctor looks over the entire body. Certain moles may be removed for biopsy to see if they are cancerous. CNN: What are factors that put someone at higher risk for skin cancer? Wen:\u00a0One main factor is ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. People who have extensive sun exposure, history of sunburns and tanning bed use are at elevated risk. Age is also a risk factor; the longer someone has UV exposure, the higher their risk. Those with 50 or more moles are also at higher risk, as are people with fair complexions. There are also specific risk factors related to personal and family medical history. These include personal or family history of skin cancer, history of precancerous lesions such as actinic keratoses, certain genetic disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum and history of immunosuppression. Individuals with risk factors, or who are not certain about them, should contact their physician to come up with a plan for screening. CNN: What about self-exams? Can these be helpful? Wen: Yes. It is a good idea for everyone to check their skin for moles. Look for the ABCDE warning signs as well as any new spots or sores that are itchy, tender\u00a0or painful. People should also remember to check everywhere on their bodies. While skin cancer is most likely in sun-exposed areas, other places are possible, too, including the palms of your hands, soles of your feet and genital areas. A good time to check is when you shower,\u00a0bathe, change clothes\u00a0or apply lotion. You could also ask for help from a family member or friend, especially in hard-to-see areas like the scalp. CNN: What are steps to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer? Wen:\ufeff Reducing UV exposure is a crucial step that everyone can take. That means, when possible, staying in the shade; wearing clothing that covers arms and legs; wearing a hat that covers the face, head, ears\u00a0and neck; and\u00a0regularly\u00a0using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. You can turn to the\u00a0excellent Environmental Working Group\u2019s resource on choosing sunscreens\u00a0that I use and that I recommend to everyone to find an effective sunscreen that works for your lifestyle, budget\u00a0and personal preferences. People should keep in mind that UV rays penetrate and can cause harm not just during the summer but year-round. Also, UV is not just present when it\u2019s sunny but also on cloudy days, and\u00a0the rays\u00a0can reflect off surfaces like snow, sand and water. And it\u2019s not only people who are fair-skinned who can have skin cancer;\u00a0individuals of all colors, including those with brown and Black skin, can develop skin cancer. Finally, I strongly urge people not to use indoor tanning beds. These expose users to high levels of UV rays and increase the risk of developing skin cancer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/skin-cancer-screening-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_glp-1-drugs-stomach-paralysis", "text": "Injected medications that treat diabetes and obesity increase the risk of a rare but serious side effect: stomach paralysis, according to new data on the real-world use of the drugs. At least three new studies based on large collections of patient records show that the risk of being diagnosed with stomach paralysis, or gastroparesis, is higher for people who take GLP-1 agonists than for those who don\u2019t. The studies have not been scrutinized by outside experts or published in medical journals, so the data is considered preliminary. Two were presented Saturday at the medical conference Digestive Disease Week 2024 in Washington; the third is slated to be presented Monday. Injected medications called GLP-1 agonists are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss.\u00a0In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose at least 10% of their starting weight.\u00a0Studies have also concluded that they have benefits for the heart as well as the waistline. Drugmaker Novo Nordisk said 25,000 people are starting Wegovy every week in the US alone. The drugs curb hunger by slowing passage of food through the stomach. They also help the body release more insulin and help send signals to the brain that turn down cravings. In some people, however, these medications can also cause unpleasant-to-severe bouts of vomiting, which may require medical attention.\u00a0They can also slow the stomach so much that medical tests show a condition called gastroparesis. Most of the time, doctors say, gastroparesis will improve after stopping the medication.\u00a0But some people say that their condition did not get better even months after coming off the drug, with life-altering consequences. Measuring the risk of gastroparesis In the new studies, the risk of gastroparesis appears to be rare, but it is consistent.\u00a0Compared with similar people who didn\u2019t take GLP-1 medications, those who did had about a 50% higher risk of being diagnosed with the condition. One study led by researchers at University Hospitals in Cleveland used records collected by the TriNetX database, which includes millions of patient records from 80 contributing heath care organizations.\u00a0The analysis focused on adults who were obese, with a body mass index higher than 30, but who did not have a diagnosis of diabetes and had not been diagnosed with gastroparesis or pancreatitis at least six months before starting a GLP-1 medication.\u00a0Records from more than 286,000 patients were included in the study. Diabetes by itself can also increase the risk of gastroparesis, especially if a person\u2019s blood sugar hasn\u2019t been well-controlled for a long period of time. Among people who were prescribed a GLP-1 medication for weight loss \u2013 such as semaglutide (branded as Ozempic and Wegovy), exenatide (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza) \u2013 10 out of every 10,000, or 0.1%, were diagnosed with gastroparesis at least six months later.\u00a0By comparison, 4 out of 10,000 people, or 0.04%, who were matched in the database based on their age, sex, ethnicity and other factors, but who were not taking a GLP-1 medication, developed the condition. The difference, which was statistically significant, amounted to a 52% increased risk of being diagnosed with stomach paralysis while on a GLP-1 medication. A second study, led by researchers at the University of Kansas, also used records from the TriNetX research network database.\u00a0It included patients who were prescribed GLP-1 medications for diabetes or obesity between December 2021 and November 2022, and it compared them with people who had diabetes or obesity and had been seen by a doctor during the same time frame but had not been prescribed a GLP-1 medication. Records from nearly 300,000 patients were included in the study. Compared with those who were not taking a GLP-1 medication, those who did were about 66% more likely to be diagnosed with gastroparesis.\u00a0This study found that 0.53% of patients on GLP-1 medications were diagnosed with stomach paralysis, or about 1 case of gastroparesis for every 200 people taking the drugs. People taking GLP-1 medications were also more likely to have nausea and vomiting or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to be prescribed a proton pump inhibitor.\u00a0They were more likely to have their gallbladders removed and experience drug-induced pancreatitis. \u201cAlthough these drugs do work and should be used for the right reason, we just want to caution everyone that if you do decide to start this, be prepared that you have a 30 percent chance that you may have GI side effects, and then the drug may have to be discontinued,\u201d said study author Dr. Prateek Sharma, a professor of medicine at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. Some side effects with the medications may also diminish over time as people get used to their doses. This is one reason doctors start with a low dose of the drug and work up to higher amounts over time. Sharma noted that the study included people who had diabetes in both the group taking the GLP-1 medications and in the comparison group, and they still found a higher incidence of stomach paralysis in those taking the medications, suggesting that diabetes alone wasn\u2019t driving the increased risk. \u201cThe drug was the only thing which was different between these two groups,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we do show that all GI side effects or symptoms, nausea, vomiting and gastroparesis, were significantly higher in the GLP-1 takers as compared to the controls,\u201d said Sharma, who is also president-elect of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Was an adverse event missed in clinical trials? Even though these drugs have been extensively studied, Sharma thinks it is possible that gastroparesis is rare enough that it didn\u2019t show up in the drugs\u2019 clinical trials because they didn\u2019t include enough patients. \u201cYou need hundreds of thousands of patients to come up with these conclusions, but that\u2019s why I think these database studies are much more important there,\u201d Sharma said. Another reason it may have been missed in clinical trials was the way researchers often test for it, according to Dr. Michael Camilleri, a gastroenterologist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic who has studied gastroparesis with the GLP-1 drug liraglutide. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, if you\u2019re going to study the problem with gastric emptying, you have to look at the gastric emptying of solids, not of liquids,\u201d from the stomach, Camilleri said. Liquids pass through the stomach more rapidly than solids. \u201cWhen the pharmaceutical companies did the appraisal of the effects of this class of medications on gastric emptying, they usually use a method that assesses the emptying of liquids from the stomach,\u201d he said. It\u2019s called the acetaminophen absorption test, and it\u2019s often used because it\u2019s faster and less expensive than a gastric emptying study with scintigraphy, which uses a radioactive tracer to see how much solid food is left in the stomach hours after a meal. Acetaminophen is absorbed through the stomach and carried into the bloodstream by liquids. Measuring how quickly acetaminophen shows up in the blood can give an idea how fast liquids are passing through the stomach, but not solids. Camilleri and other experts say acetaminophen absorption is not an adequate test for gastroparesis on GLP-1 medications. Camilleri was a co-author on a third study being presented Monday at Digestive Disease Week that looked at gastroparesis with GLP-1 medications. That study combed through records of nearly 80,000 patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication by doctors in the Mayo Clinic\u2019s health system.\u00a0The researchers focused on a subset of 839 people who\u2019d had symptoms of gastroparesis and who had gotten a gold-standard test for the condition: a procedure called gastric emptying scintigraphy. About one-third of that group, 241 people, had food in their stomach four hours after eating a test meal, which means they qualified as having gastroparesis. However, the study didn\u2019t calculate the difference in the risk of gastroparesis between people using the drugs and those who were not. Camilleri said it\u2019s likely that the gastroparesis risk is be underestimated in these studies because not everyone who had symptoms would have ultimately gotten the test needed to diagnose it. In the Mayo Clinic study, women and people who also reported having constipation on the GLP-1 medications were more likely to receive a diagnosis of gastroparesis. Camilleri said that constipation may be one clue that people will have trouble with gastroparesis on a GLP-1 medication but that there are still many questions to answer. \u201cFor the people who get this complication, it is extremely serious,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/glp-1-drugs-stomach-paralysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_health_breastfeeding-mom-public-shame-sinf-cec", "text": "It\u2019s spring, and the air is filled with the melodies of mating songbirds. But when I walk down a tidy street near my suburban Virginia home, the jarring memory of another sound echoes in my mind: my daughter\u2019s piercing screams. Those desperate cries jolted me out of a daydream as I pushed her stroller down this very sidewalk back in December 2022. My daughter was home sick from daycare, and I\u2019d taken her on a walk hoping the cooler air would calm her cough. It seemed to be working, until suddenly, it clearly wasn\u2019t. There are so many moments as a parent when you find yourself doing something you vowed you\u2019d never do \u2014 especially when your child is having a meltdown in public. This was one of those moments for me, but that alone is not why it\u2019s seared in my mind. I will never forget that day, not because of what my child did, or even how I handled it, but because of the surprising way a stranger responded. On that December afternoon, my usually sweet 17-month-old was erupting into a full-blown meltdown. As her face reddened with rage, I tried handing her the bottle I\u2019d brought. She swatted it to the ground and kicked her feet so hard one of her shoes flew off. Even though she was still learning her first words, she had no trouble expressing herself. She didn\u2019t want milk from a bottle. She wanted it direct from the source: me. The way I saw it, that was simply impossible here \u2014 and the idea of it was mortifying. I hadn\u2019t brought my nursing cover, the tasteful shawl I made a point of wearing while feeding her in public.\u00a0Whenever she needed to nurse, I tried to cover up politely or slip away out of view. On this street, we were exposed. There was nowhere to hide. It\u2019s only as I describe it now that I realize how bizarre that sounds. There are so many parts of the world where women and children truly need to take cover to survive. I was lucky to be somewhere safe. And besides, I was proud to be a mom and loved feeding my daughter, so why was I acting so ashamed? Long before I ever had a child of my own, I\u2019d heard comments from TV personalities who\u2019d slammed breastfeeding in public, I\u2019d read news stories about women who were told to cover up, and I\u2019d even heard some snide remarks from members of my own family about the way moms nursed their kids. Of course, I\u2019d also read about celebrities and seen friends who defied these antiquated expectations. And once I started breastfeeding in public myself, most people didn\u2019t really notice \u2014 or at least, they acted like they didn\u2019t. But still, whenever I fed my daughter outside our home, part of me felt anxious about whether anyone was going to be offended. The years of comments I\u2019d heard sent a message so clear that I\u2019d developed a sense of shame around my body, and around feeding my child, without even realizing it. So even as my daughter\u2019s cries grew louder on that December afternoon, breastfeeding her seemed out of the question. In every direction I looked, there were blocks of houses and nicely manicured lawns, with no benches or parks in sight.\u00a0Plopping down in the middle of the sidewalk and lifting up my shirt was something I\u2019d NEVER do. Returning home was the only escape route I could see. I did a quick calculation. If I walked fast, we could probably get home in 10 minutes. Imagining the large number of houses we\u2019d have to pass with her screaming at the top of her lungs, I plowed ahead. But the meltdown only intensified with each step. And as I saw my daughter gasping to catch her breath with tears streaming down her face, and as I thought about how hard the past few nights had been, with coughing fits keeping her up for hours, I realized that giving her what she needed was the only thing that mattered. So suddenly, there I was \u2014 after months of trying to be discreet so I wouldn\u2019t make anyone else uncomfortable while I fed my child \u2014 sitting cross-legged in the middle of a sidewalk, lifting up my shirt and praying no one would notice us. I was relieved to see how quickly she relaxed, but I braced myself every time I heard a car engine rumbling or the jangle of a dog\u2019s leash. Someone was going to see us and say something. I wished I could sink into the ground and hide. In the distance, I saw a woman walking brusquely in our direction. I steeled myself for the criticism I knew had to be coming. Why was I blocking the sidewalk? Why was I flashing the neighbors rather than feeding my daughter at home? Why couldn\u2019t I get it together and control my child? But once she reached our stretch of the sidewalk, this stranger didn\u2019t ask any of those questions. Her words were kind and compassionate. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d she asked. I was stunned. I\u2019d been so certain she would judge me. \u201cYes,\u201d I said a bit sheepishly. \u201cShe just melted down, and I had to feed her.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t glare. She smiled. Then she told me how beautiful my daughter and I looked sitting there together, paired with the classical music piping through her headphones. She was standing a few feet away, but her words were an embrace I hadn\u2019t even realized I needed. In a matter of moments, I started to see the same beauty she did. I let go of the pressure and shame that had been weighing on me and found myself opening up. It\u2019s been more than a year since our paths crossed, and I can no longer remember this woman\u2019s face, but I can still feel her warmth. That day, I told her that we\u2019d been on a peaceful walk when suddenly the situation turned. My daughter had been home sick all week, I explained, and she was simply exhausted. The stranger nodded knowingly. She could see I was exhausted, too. She asked me how I was holding up. Tears welled up in my eyes. I told her I was OK, because thanks to her, I was.

{"id": "2024_05_16_world_cotton-candy-exoplanet-discovery-wasp-193b-scn", "text": "What is big, with a fluffy,\u00a0cotton candy-like composition? Turns out, a planet. An international coalition of astronomers has newly discovered an unusual planet, dubbed WASP-193b, that\u2019s about 50% bigger than Jupiter and somehow still the second lightest planet ever found. But WASP-193b, located beyond our solar system about 1,200 light-years from Earth, isn\u2019t just a scientific oddity. The exoplanet could also be key to future research investigating atypical planetary formation, according to a study describing the find that published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy. This cotton candy planet isn\u2019t alone; there are other similar planets belonging to a class scientists facetiously call \u201cpuffy Jupiters.\u201d The lightest planet ever discovered is the superpuffy Kepler 51d, which is nearly the size of Jupiter but a hundred times lighter than the gas giant. Puffy Jupiters have largely been a mystery for 15 years, said lead study author Khalid Barkaoui. But WASP-193b, because of its size, is an ideal candidate for further analysis by the James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories. \u201cThe planet is so light that it\u2019s difficult to think of an analogous, solid-state material,\u201d said Barkaoui, a postdoctoral researcher of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a news release. \u201cThe reason why it\u2019s close to cotton candy is because both are mostly made of light gases rather than solids. The planet is basically super fluffy.\u201d Low-density planet presents big challenge WASP-193b, which researchers think is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, was a huge puzzle for researchers to piece together. Because the exoplanet\u2019s density is so light for its size, calculating its mass became a challenge. Usually, scientists determine mass using a technique called radial velocity, in which researchers analyze how a star\u2019s spectrum, a graph that indicates the intensity of light emissions in wavelengths, shifts as a planet orbits it. The bigger the planet, the more the star\u2019s spectrum can shift \u2014 but this didn\u2019t work for WASP-193b, which is so light, it didn\u2019t make any pull on the star that the team could detect. Because of how small the mass signal was, it took the team four years to gather data and calculate WASP-193b\u2019s mass, Barkaoui explained. Because the extremely low numbers they found were so rare, the researchers completed multiple trials of data analysis, just to be sure. \u201cWe were initially getting extremely low densities, which were very difficult to believe in the beginning,\u201d said co-lead author Francisco Pozuelos, a senior researcher at Spain\u2019s Institute of Astrophysics of Andalucia, in a news release. Eventually the team discovered the planet\u2019s mass is a measly 14% that of Jupiter, despite being so much bigger. But a bigger size means a bigger \u201cextended atmosphere,\u201d said study coauthor Julien de Wit, an associate professor of planetary science at MIT. That means WASP-193b provides an especially useful window into these puffy planets\u2019 formation. \u201cThe bigger a planet\u2019s atmosphere, the more light can go through,\u201d de Wit told CNN. \u201cSo it\u2019s clear that this planet is one of the best targets we have for studying atmospheric effects. It will be a Rosetta Stone to try and resolve the mystery of puffy Jupiters.\u201d But it\u2019s also not clear how WASP-193b even formed, Barkaoui said. The \u201cclassical evolution models\u201d of gas giants don\u2019t quite explain the phenomenon. \u201cWASP-193b is an outlier of all planets discovered to date,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/world/cotton-candy-exoplanet-discovery-wasp-193b-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_health_pregnancy-dates-abortion-limits-the-conversation-partner", "text": "Most Americans don\u2019t know two key facts about pregnancy, including how they are dated and how long a trimester is \u2013 and this could matter, as a growing number of states place restrictions on abortion. Florida enacted a new law\u00a0on May 1, 2024, that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, with\u00a0a few exceptions\u00a0\u2013 including documented rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Florida joins the majority of\u00a0Southern states\u00a0that now have complete bans or highly restrictive abortion laws, enacted since the Supreme Court overturned the\u00a0federal right to get an abortion\u00a0in June 2022. Many of the restrictive laws ban abortion after a set number of weeks. Florida Republicans supporting the bill have labeled it a\u00a0reasonable compromise between a full abortion ban and few abortion restrictions. READ MORE: Mexico is a destination for Americans seeking reproductive health services  Some OB-GYNs\u00a0have explained that\u00a0many women\u00a0do not even know they are pregnant at\u00a0six weeks.\u00a0Research shows that women\u00a0on average find out they are pregnant at five and a half weeks. About 23% do not know until seven weeks of pregnancy or later. So, do Americans, including those enacting six-week bans, actually understand how the timing or dating of pregnancy works? We are\u00a0scholars\u00a0of\u00a0political science,\u00a0gender and public opinion\u00a0and are writing a book about public opinion on abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the federal right to get an abortion in June 2022. How does pregnancy work? To gain insights into this issue, we developed a few pregnancy questions and included them in a research survey in late September 2023. The survey had 1,356 respondents, who were broadly representative of the U.S. population. The respondents\u2019 median age was 46. Approximately 49% of these people were men, while 70% were white and 29% were college graduates. Meanwhile, 43% of them were Democrats, and 38% were Republicans. READ MORE: Fetal personhood rulings could nullify a pregnant patient\u2019s wishes for\u00a0end-of-life\u00a0care The first question asked respondents how pregnancies are dated.\u00a0The correct answer\u00a0is that pregnancies are dated using the first day of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period, which is often two to three weeks before conception. The second question asked about trimesters. Many Americans are familiar with the term trimester, and\u00a0polling consistently shows\u00a0that Americans find abortion most acceptable during the first trimester. We asked Americans if they knew approximately how many weeks a trimester was. The correct answer is 13. Americans\u2019 pregnancy knowledge We found that only one-third of respondents knew how pregnancy is dated. A majority \u2013 approximately 60% \u2013 falsely thought that pregnancy is dated from conception or in the weeks since the woman last had sex. Less than one-fourth of the respondents answered both pregnancy knowledge questions correctly. In our survey, we also asked respondents whether they support a six-week abortion ban. Similar to other\u00a0national surveys, we find that most Americans oppose strict abortion restrictions \u2013 only 35% support six-week bans. Importantly, we find that those who support six-week abortion bans are significantly less likely than others to correctly understand the timing of pregnancy. The statistically significant relationship between having low levels of pregnancy timing knowledge and support for a six-week abortion ban holds in analyses controlling for potentially confounding variables. Some anti-abortion lawmakers\u00a0have demonstrated\u00a0their\u00a0ignorance\u00a0about pregnancy\u00a0before. There is, for example, a long history of some anti-abortion politicians saying, incorrectly, that it is\u00a0extremely rare\u00a0for a person who is raped to get pregnant. Our survey shows that a large swath of those opposing abortion lack knowledge about the basics of pregnancy. A gender disparity Perhaps not surprisingly, women in this survey knew more about pregnancy than men. The question about how pregnancies are dated, for example, was answered correctly by 43% of women compared with only 23% of men. As mentioned above, a majority of Americans incorrectly believe pregnancy is dated from conception, but significantly more men than women think this is true. This finding is particularly important when considering the gender breakdown of the Florida state lawmakers who approved the six-week ban. Although we do not have data on the pregnancy knowledge of those legislators, we do know that those who voted for the ban were\u00a0overwhelmingly men. Florida\u2019s six-week ban will make it much harder for anyone to get abortions there \u2013 and it will also affect people in\u00a0neighboring states\u00a0who want or need an abortion. In 2023, Florida was home to the closest abortion clinic for\u00a06.4 million women\u00a0living in the South. In 2023,\u00a0around 7,700 women\u00a0from other Southern states,\u00a0where abortion is now largely banned, traveled to Florida to get abortions. Overall, our findings raise serious questions about whether Americans without medical training \u2013 much like those in our state legislatures \u2013 have the necessary knowledge needed to regulate abortion access.

Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. Processed meats and sugary foods and drinks aren\u2019t correlated with the same risks as ultraprocessed whole grains, for example, said lead study author Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. The study analyzed data from more than 100,000 health professionals in the United States with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. From 1986 to 2018, the participants provided information on their health and lifestyle habits every two years. Every four years, they completed a detailed food questionnaire. The group eating the least ultraprocessed food ate about three servings a day on average, while the highest averaged seven servings a day, according to the study published Wednesday in The BMJ journal. Those who ate the most had a 4% higher risk of deaths by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths, the data showed. Song described the correlation as \u201cmoderate,\u201d noting that the connection was not equally strong among all kinds of ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThe positive association is mainly driven by a few subgroups including processed meat and sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened beverages,\u201d he said. Findings in this study were consistent with hundreds of others in the field, but what makes this one unique is its parsing out of different subgroups within the ultraprocessed food category, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. Do we need to get rid of all ultraprocessed foods? Song wouldn\u2019t necessarily advise a complete rejection of all ultraprocessed foods because it is a diverse category, he said. \u201cCereals, whole grain breads, for example, they are also considered ultraprocessed food, but they contain various beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, I do think people should try to avoid or limit the consumption of certain ultraprocessed foods, such as processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and also potentially artificially sweetened beverages.\u201d There are also more questions that need to be answered when it comes to ultraprocessed foods. First, the recent study is strong because of the length of time covered\ufeff, but it is an observational study. That means that while researchers can observe a correlation, they can\u2019t say that the foods were the cause of the deaths, said Dr. Peter Wilde, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in the United Kingdom. Researchers also need to look more at the components of ultraprocessed foods that might be affecting health \u2014 whether they be food additives, emulsifiers or flavors \u2014 to advise governments and institutions on how to regulate foods, Song said. Overall diet matters most Researchers also found that the most important factor to reducing risk of death is the quality of a person\u2019s overall diet, Song said. \u201cIf people maintain a generally healthy diet, I don\u2019t think they need to be like scared or be freaked out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall dietary pattern is still the predominant factor determining the health outcomes.\u201d A healthy diet is varied, with as many colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains as possible, Wilde said. \u201cIf you are worried about food additives, then choose foods that have low levels of additives,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cJust be mindful of the nutritional content of (the ultraprocessed foods) that you do choose to consume.\u201d It is also important to recognize that foods need to be eaten in balance. Fruit juice contains beneficial vitamins, minerals and antioxidants when consumed in moderation, but too much will have high levels of sugar that may override their benefits, Wilde said. \u201cThis is not black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cA particular food is not either good or bad, it will contain elements of both, and the balance between the two may depend on how much you eat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ultraprocessed-foods-death-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_health_weight-loss-ozempic-challenges-wellness", "text": "Since using weight loss medication, Allie Olivares has quieted the voice of her eating disorder in her brain while getting more comfortable running around with her 6-year-old. But her 80 pounds of weight loss while taking Wegovy has not come without challenges of its own, she said. \u201cI still deal with a lot of body dysmorphia,\u201d said Olivares, who lives in Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019ll look in the mirror, and it\u2019s almost like a funhouse mirror where like one minute I\u2019ll look at myself and be like, \u2018OK, yes, like I see myself for how I am.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll look away, and I\u2019ll look back and suddenly my body just looks much larger.\u201d Olivares says she has had a positive experience with the GLP-1 agonist medication, which mimics hormones in the gut involved in insulin regulation and appetite. It is also sold under the brand Zepbound for weight loss. But she warns that losing weight is not a cure for everything that\u2019s not right in your life. Sure, many people approach Olivares differently in a small body, but even those \u201cnice\u201d comments are a double-edged sword, she said. They often make her feel as if she was not acceptable before the weight loss. \u201cI\u2019m the same person. I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019m a designer. I\u2019m a wife. I\u2019m a daughter,\u201d she said. \u201cI do all the same things. It\u2019s just the package in which I come in is smaller now. So why am I being treated differently? \u201cIt definitely reinforces this feeling of \u2018Am I only worth what\u2019s on the outside?\u2019\u201d The experience Olivares had after losing weight isn\u2019t unique. New York City psychologist Alexis Conason warns that people should not expect the work to be limited to decreasing a number you see on a scale. Body image is not always tied to body size If you have a negative voice in the back of your head that picks your body apart, it may not go away when you lose weight, said Conason, who is also a certified eating disorder specialist. \u201cBody image is not a reflection of weight. Body image is about the way that we see and feel about our body internalized,\u201d she said. Many people try to lose weight hoping to feel better about their body, only to find that they still don\u2019t once they have lost the weight, Conason said. And that could lead to a dangerous cycle of continually feeling as if the answer is to get even smaller. Conason recommends separating your efforts to improve your body image from any efforts you might take on to lose weight. \u201cMany people are able to work in therapy to accept their body and improve their body image even without losing weight at all and feel much better about themselves,\u201d she said. It\u2019s crucial that you build a better relationship with your body independent of its appearance because those thoughts aren\u2019t always dependent on your size, said Dr. Genesis Ettienne, a licensed mental health counselor and marriage and family therapist in the Miami metropolitan area. \u201cSelf-confidence is a muscle that you have to flex,\u201d regardless of your weight, she added. The comments don\u2019t stop Since her weight loss, Olivares has found that many of her social interactions begin with a comment about her body. \u201cNoticing the weight loss is one of the first things (people) say to me when they meet me,\u201d she said. While there is a part of her brain influenced by diet culture that\u2019s happy that people see her body is smaller, it also can make her uncomfortable, Olivares said. \u201cPeople tend to see weight loss as an invitation to publicly comment on people\u2019s bodies,\u201d Conason said. \u201cOur bodies are so personal and really should not be objects for conversation.\u201d It\u2019s important not to comment on people\u2019s bodies, she said \u2014 even if it is about losing weight. On one hand, seeing a body doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Perhaps that person lost weight because of an eating disorder, grief or some other distressing event, Conason said. On the other, even if the weight loss is seen as positive, commenting on people\u2019s bodies can make them feel more on display, which can feel overwhelming and intrusive, she added. Ettienne said she hears every day how her clients feel as if their weight loss has become the entirety of their storyline in the minds of the people around them. What you can do about it That is where it is essential to communicate boundaries around whether and how you are comfortable talking about your body with others, she said. Maybe your approach is a direct conversation to say, \u201cI know I lost weight. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Or it can be something lighter to brush off body-centric conversations, she said. Direct conversation can be easier when you are closer with the person, Olivares said, but for others, she tends to try to casually pivot the conversation away from body talk. Olivares also has to work hard to deal with her body dysmorphia, she said. And that can mean avoiding mirrors for a bit. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be able to see yourself in reality, it\u2019s OK to disengage from a harm-reduction perspective,\u201d Olivares said. Usually, she finds that her dysmorphia is connected to other behaviors or feelings, so she encourages people going through similar experiences to dedicate time to sit with it and ask themselves where it is coming from, she added. \u201cEven if you\u2019re physically in a smaller body, if you\u2019re not addressing the mental framing (of) body dysmorphia,\u201d Olivares said. \u201cIt can be really hard no matter how small you get to see reality.\u201d If you are struggling with body image or a cycle of feeling as if you must lose more and more weight, seeking professional help is the best next step, Conason said. \u201cLooking for a licensed mental health provider who specializes in eating disorder care is really the best thing to do,\u201d she added.

{"id": "2024_05_13_health_ultraprocessed-food-bad-health-wellness", "text": "When\u00a0you open a bag of nacho-flavored chips or cheese puffs, you probably know that you\u2019re about to indulge in an unhealthy snack. The dead giveaway? It\u2019s the yummy, spicy, cheesy, neon-orange dust that coats each morsel and gets all over your fingers. Ditto for a frozen pizza and chicken nuggets. But what about a granola bar? An applesauce pouch? String cheese? Flavored yogurt? Surely these foods \u2014 snacks that millions of children and adults eat every day \u2014 are not bad, right? Well, it turns out that many fall under the category of ultraprocessed foods \u2014 depending on their exact ingredients. This type of food has been studied a lot lately, and the results aren\u2019t great. Ultraprocessed foods represent a relatively new way of categorizing foods. Proposed in 2009 by researchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, the system, called NOVA, is based not on what kind of food it is \u2014 meat, grains, vegetables, etc. \u2014 but rather on how processed it is. NOVA separates foods into four groups, starting with natural and minimally processed foods in the first category to ultraprocessed foods, which use industrial formulations and manufacturing techniques, in the fourth. \u201cMy operating definition for ultraprocessed (foods) is you can\u2019t make it in your home kitchen because you don\u2019t have the machinery and you don\u2019t have the ingredients,\u201d food policy expert Dr. Marion Nestle told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell on the Chasing Life podcast recently. Nestle is the Paulette Goddard Professor of nutrition, food studies and public health, emerita, at New York University. Listen to more of the conversation between Nestle and Tirrell here. Ultraprocessed foods contain additives such as flavor enhancers, colors and thickeners \u2014 basically ingredients you wouldn\u2019t usually use in your cooking.\u00a0It makes them shelf-stable, easy to prepare (just heat and serve) and in many cases hard to resist. (The food industry pushes back on the NOVA system, saying there is no agreed-upon scientific consensus on the definition of ultraprocessed.) Due to a confluence of historical, regulatory and economic factors, Nestle said, food companies in the 1980s \u201cdid a lot of work on trying to figure out what flavor and texture and color combinations would be most attractive to people and started producing foods that would make them lots of money.\u201d She said tens of thousands of new products have hit store shelves since then. \u201cMost of them fail, but the ones that win, win big,\u201d Nestle said. Before you reach for that can of soda, bag of chips or frozen dinner, why not learn more about what you\u2019re eating? Here are five things to know about ultraprocessed foods: Ultraprocessed foods are linked to bad health outcomes Eating a lot of ultraprocessed foods isn\u2019t healthy. \u201cNow there have been more than 1,500 observational studies \u2014 all of them demonstrating a consistent finding, which is that eating ultraprocessed foods is linked to obesity,\u00a0type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, bad outcome from Covid-19, overall mortality,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cAny bad health problem you can think of that\u2019s related to diet is related specifically to ultraprocessed foods.\u201d The most recent study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, analyzed more than 30 years\u2019 worth of data and found that eating ultraprocessed foods was associated with a 4% higher risk of death by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths. Other studies have linked ultraprocessed foods to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Nestle pointed out that these studies have been observational and not designed to prove causation \u2014 that ultraprocessed foods caused these bad health outcomes. \u201cYou can do that when you have a controlled clinical trial,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd guess what? We have one.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods cause weight gain That one randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that ultraprocessed foods actually caused people to gain weight. These types of studies are not easy or cheap to undertake, which is why they are not done more often. To conduct this one, Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, had 20 volunteers spend four weeks living at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. For two weeks, they ate a diet made up of 80% healthy ultraprocessed foods (think yogurt and whole wheat bread, not chips and soda). For the other two weeks, they ate a diet that contained no ultraprocessed foods. The diets were matched, among other things, for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients. Participants did not know what exactly the study was measuring. \u201cWe basically just asked people, you know, just eat as much or as little of the food that you\u2019d like,\u201d Hall told Tirrell. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be trying to change your weight, (you) shouldn\u2019t be trying to gain weight or lose weight.\u00a0Just eat to the same level of appetite as you normally would.\u201d Researchers found that when the participants were on the ultraprocessed diet, they ate about 500 calories more per day than when they were on the minimally processed one. This difference in calories translated quickly to the scale. Participants gained on average 2 pounds during the two weeks on the ultraprocessed diet and lost 2 pounds on the minimally processed one. And their blood work showed lower markers of inflammation when they were on the latter. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with nutrition research, you have no idea what an important finding this is,\u201d said Nestle, who was not involved in the study. \u201cFive hundred calories is huge.\u201d Hall said it\u2019s unclear what drives people to consume more calories when they are on an ultraprocessed diet. \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re really interested in now,\u201d he said, \u201cis to figure out what the mechanisms were.\u201d Ultraprocessed foods are hard to avoid Ultraprocessed foods are everywhere, and most of us consume them without even realizing it \u2014 even when you think you are eating something relatively healthy, such as baked potato chips or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, researchers found that ultraprocessed foods make up more than half of American adults\u2019 diets. For US children, that percentage is even higher, at 67%. Ultraprocessed foods are cheap and convenient Yup, that\u2019s right: Truly eating \u201cclean\u201d costs more. \u201cTo actually create the minimally processed menu, it was about 40% more expensive than the ultraprocessed menu,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even account for the time that it takes to make the foods, right? So, all those factors probably play a huge role in \u2026 the foods that we choose to eat in the real world.\u201d Not all ultraprocessed foods are bad Some ultraprocessed foods can provide important nutrients, such as whole wheat bread and yogurt. And others, in Hall\u2019s study, were shown not to increase caloric intake. \u201cThe snacks were neutral in terms of how many calories (the participants) ate,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhich goes to show that not all ultraprocessed foods necessarily drive this effect.\u201d Hall\u2019s team is conducting a new study to tease out which ultraprocessed foods are harmful and which are neutral, or even healthy. Americans may soon get more help sorting through the health effects of ultraprocessed foods. The US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration will soon issue new Dietary Guidelines, which are updated every five years. Nestle said that the scientific advisory committee guiding this process has been asked to consider the connection between ultraprocessed foods and poor health outcomes. We hope these five things help you understand ultraprocessed foods a bit more.

The term itself hails from medieval Norse meaning \u201clazy fellow\u201d \u2014 and later the middle English word meaning \u201cwalking, sitting or standing with a loose attitude.\u201d In the last 150 years or so, posture has come to be associated with aspects of a person\u2019s value, dignity, respectability and morality.\u00a0Erect posture\u00a0has been deemed \u201chealthy,\u201d \u201cthe aesthetic utopia,\u201d \u201cdignified,\u201d \u201ca backbone against subjugation,\u201d \u201cattractive\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d by various cultures, political movements and even social media influencers. READ MORE: Why sitting with crossed legs could be bad for you So it\u2019s not difficult to see then how slouching came to be considered \u201cbad\u201d for us since it\u2019s long been considered to be a bodily representation of negativity. But while posture is heavily overlaid with psychological meaning, is it really that bad for our spines if we slouch? Are certain postures really \u201cgood\u201d and others \u201cbad\u201d? The great news is that in the past two decades, there\u2019s been a plethora of rigorous clinical studies conducted which have concluded that there\u2019s\u00a0no relationship\u00a0between slouching and spinal pain. There\u2019s also\u00a0no evidence\u00a0that people who slouch are more likely to suffer with back or neck pain compared to non-slouchers. There\u2019s also no clear evidence that slouching while sitting at your desk or while using your phone causes damage to the spine. Even the UK government\u2019s latest guidance on\u00a0working with screens\u00a0puts less emphasis on an idealised posture at the workstation. READ MORE: Understanding that chronic back pain originates from within the brain helps recovery Instead, they emphasise the importance of adopting comfortable positions, varying your positions, avoiding awkward positions (such as flexing or arching your back or neck) and including regular breaks from your static posture throughout the day. All of these tips will help reduce the risk of\u00a0developing pain\u00a0and muscle fatigue. So if you experience back or neck pain, you can rest assured that the posture you adopt when walking or sitting probably isn\u2019t to blame as much as you might have been led to believe. Instead, it\u2019s probably related more to other features of life \u2014 such as how\u00a0stressed\u00a0or\u00a0physically active\u00a0you are and if you have\u00a0previously had back pain. There\u2019s a pretty good reason why slouching doesn\u2019t damage our spines, and that is because our spines are designed to allow movements as diverse as Olympic weightlifting to limbo dancing. Our spines aren\u2019t going to be damaged by a bit of sitting down, even if we happen to be wiggling our fingers on a keyboard at the same time. And while standing desks are popular, prolonged standing is no more comfortable for the spine than prolonged sitting READ MORE: Why you get shorter as you age The best thing to do throughout your day, to both make your body feel more comfortable and to\u00a0increase your productivity\u00a0and positive sense of well-being is to break up prolonged periods at your desk with breaks to walk, stretch, stand or sit down. Positive posture But there is one area where slouching may have a negative effect. Slouching has been linked to poorer information and memory recall, as well as worse mood when compared to\u00a0sitting upright. These memory and mood problems are shown to be\u00a0rapidly improved\u00a0when moving from a slouched to\u00a0erect posture. So perhaps there is some truth to the notion that slouching may still be a bodily representation of negativity. But aside from that, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests there\u2019s\u00a0no single, ideal or good posture. Differences in spinal posture are not related to pain. And, in fact, posture naturally varies from person to person \u2014 and can even vary depending on\u00a0race, sex, and even mood. So if you\u2019re a sloucher, rest assured that it isn\u2019t really bad for you and is as good as any other posture you adopt. Comfortable postures are safe and sitting is not dangerous. READ MORE: Surgery won\u2019t fix my chronic back pain, so what will?

If you can\u2019t move around and spend all day slouched in front of the computer, this may cause you some discomfort \u2014 but it\u2019s not actually damaging your spine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/health/slouching-spine-health-conversation-partner-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_california-phys-ed-heat-rules-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "Yahushua Robinson was an energetic boy who jumped and danced his way through life. Then, a physical education teacher instructed the 12-year-old to run outside on a day when the temperature climbed to\u00a0107 degrees. \u201cWe lose loved ones all the time, but he was taken in a horrific way,\u201d his mother, Janee Robinson, said from the family\u2019s Inland Empire home, about 80 miles southeast of Los Angeles. \u201cI would never want nobody to go through what I\u2019m going through.\u201d The day her son died, Robinson, who teaches phys ed, kept her elementary school students inside, and she had hoped her children\u2019s teachers would do the same. The Riverside County Coroner\u2019s Bureau ruled that Yahushua died on Aug. 29 of a heart defect, with heat and physical exertion as contributing factors. His death at Canyon Lake Middle School came on the second day of an excessive heat warning, when people were\u00a0advised to avoid strenuous activities\u00a0and limit their time outdoors. Yahushua\u2019s family is supporting\u00a0a bill\u00a0in California that would require the state Department of Education to create guidelines that govern physical activity at public schools during extreme weather, including setting threshold temperatures for when it\u2019s too hot or too cold for students to exercise or play sports outside. If the measure becomes law, the guidelines will have to be in place by Jan. 1, 2026. Many states have adopted protocols to protect student athletes from extreme heat during practices. But the California bill is broader and would require educators to consider all students throughout the school day and in any extreme weather, whether they\u2019re doing jumping jacks in fourth period or playing tag during recess. It\u2019s unclear if the bill will clear a critical committee vote scheduled for May 16. \u201cYahushua\u2019s story, it\u2019s very touching. It\u2019s very moving. I think it could have been prevented had we had the right safeguards in place,\u201d said state Sen. Melissa Hurtado (D-Bakersfield), one of the bill\u2019s authors. \u201cClimate change is impacting everyone, but it\u2019s especially impacting vulnerable communities, especially our children.\u201d Last year marked the planet\u2019s warmest on record, and extreme weather is becoming more frequent and severe, according to the\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Even though most heat deaths and illnesses are preventable, about\u00a01,220 people in the United States are killed by extreme heatevery year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Young children are especially\u00a0susceptible to heat illness\u00a0because their bodies have more trouble regulating temperature, and they rely on adults to protect them from overheating. A person can go from feeling dizzy or experiencing a headache to passing out, having a seizure, or going into a coma, said\u00a0Chad Vercio, a physician and the division chief of general pediatrics at Loma Linda University Health. \u201cIt can be a really dangerous thing,\u201d Vercio said of heat illness. \u201cIt is something that we should take seriously and figure out what we can do to avoid that.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many children have died at school from heat exposure. Eric Robinson, 15, had been sitting in his sports medicine class learning about heatstroke when his sister arrived at his high school unexpectedly the day their brother died. \u201cThey said, \u2018OK, go home, Eric. Go home early.\u2019 I walked to the car and my sister\u2019s crying. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that my little brother\u2019s gone. That I won\u2019t be able to see him again. And he\u2019d always bugged me, and I would say, \u2018Leave me alone.\u2019\u201d That morning, Eric had done Yahushua\u2019s hair and loaned him his hat and chain necklace to wear to school. As temperatures climbed into the 90s that morning, a physical education teacher instructed Yahushua to run on the blacktop. His friends told the family that the sixth grader had repeatedly asked the teacher for water but was denied, his parents said. The school district has refused to release video footage to the family showing the moment Yahushua collapsed on the blacktop. He died later that day at the hospital. Melissa Valdez, a Lake Elsinore Unified School District spokesperson, did not respond to calls seeking comment. Schoolyards can reach\u00a0dangerously high temperatures\u00a0on hot days, with asphalt sizzling up to 145 degrees, according to findings by researchers at the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. Some school districts, such as\u00a0San Diego Unified and\u00a0Santa Ana Unified, have hot weather plans or guidelines that call for limiting physical activity and providing water to kids. But there are no statewide standards that K-12 schools must implement to protect students from heat illness. Under the bill, the California Department of Education must set temperature thresholds requiring schools to modify students\u2019 physical activities during extreme weather, such as heat waves, wildfires, excessive rain, and flooding. Schools would also be required to come up with plans for alternative indoor activities, and staff must be trained to recognize and respond to weather-related distress. California has had heat rules on the books for outdoor workers since 2005, but it was a latecomer to\u00a0protecting student athletes, according to the\u00a0Korey Stringer Institute\u00a0at the University of Connecticut, which is named after a Minnesota Vikings football player who died from heatstroke in 2001. By comparison, Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, this spring\u00a0signed a law\u00a0preventing cities and counties from creating their own heat protections for outdoor workers, has the best protections for student athletes, according to the institute. Douglas Casa, a professor of kinesiology and the chief executive officer of the institute, said state regulations can establish consistency about how to respond to heat distress and save lives. \u201cThe problem is that each high school doesn\u2019t have a cardiologist and doesn\u2019t have a thermal physiologist and doesn\u2019t have a sickling expert,\u201d Casa said of the medical specialties for heat illness. In 2022, California released an\u00a0Extreme Action Heat Plan\u00a0that recommended state agencies \u201cexplore implementation of indoor and outdoor heat exposure rules for schools,\u201d but neither the administration of Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, nor lawmakers have adopted standards. Lawmakers last year failed to pass legislation that would have required schools to implement a heat plan and replace hot surfaces, such as cement and rubber, with lower-heat surfaces, such as grass and cool pavement.\u00a0That bill, which drew opposition from school administrators, stalled in committee, in part over cost concerns. Naj Alikhan, a spokesperson for the Association of California School Administrators, said the new bill takes a different approach and would not require structural and physical changes to schools. The association has not taken a position on the measure, and no other organization has registered opposition. The Robinson family said children\u2019s lives ought to outweigh any costs that might come with preparing schools to deal with the growing threat of extreme weather. Yahushua\u2018s death, they say, could save others. \u201cI really miss him. I cry every day,\u201d said Yahushua\u2019s father, Eric Robinson. \u201cThere\u2019s no one day that go by that I don\u2019t cry about my boy.\u201d KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/california-phys-ed-heat-rules-kff-health-news-partner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_world_blue-origin-rocket-ns-25-mission-scn", "text": "Blue Origin\u2019s tourism rocket has launched passengers to the edge of space for the first time in nearly two years, ending a hiatus prompted by a failed uncrewed test flight. The New Shepard rocket and capsule lifted off at 9:36 a.m. CT (10:36 a.m. ET) from the Jeff Bezos-founded company\u2019s facilities on a private ranch in West Texas. NS-25, Blue Origin\u2019s seventh crewed flight to date, carried six customers aboard the capsule: venture capitalist Mason Angel; Sylvain Chiron, founder of the French craft brewery Brasserie Mont-Blanc; software engineer and entrepreneur Kenneth L. Hess; retired accountant Carol Schaller; aviator\u00a0Gopi Thotakura; and Ed Dwight, a retired US Air Force captain selected by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to be the nation\u2019s first Black astronaut candidate. Despite completing training at the Aerospace Research Pilot School\u00a0and receiving an Air Force recommendation, Dwight ultimately didn\u2019t make the NASA Astronaut Corps. He went on to become an entrepreneur and a sculptor; a new National Geographic documentary on Black astronauts, \u201cThe Space Race,\u201d highlights Dwight\u2019s pioneering story. \u201cI had no intention of being an astronaut. That was the last thing on my bucket list,\u201d Dwight said in the documentary. \u201cBut once I was given the challenge, then everything changes.\u201d Dwight completed that challenge and reached the edge of space at the age of 90, making him the oldest person to venture to such heights, according to a spokesperson from Blue Origin. \u201cI thought I didn\u2019t need it in my life,\u201d Dwight said of the experience on Blue Origin\u2019s livestream after the capsule touched down at 9:46 a.m. CT (10:46 a.m. ET). \u201cBut I lied. I really, really did need it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing experience,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody needs to do this.\u201d The rocket booster landed safely a couple minutes prior to the capsule. During the mission, the crew soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. The rocket vaulted the capsule past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, an area 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface that is\u00a0widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot of\u00a0gray area. And at the peak of the flight, passengers experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and striking views of Earth through the cabin windows. The launch followed the success of an uncrewed science mission in December \u2014 the New Shepard program\u2019s first flight since the mishap more than a year earlier. New Shepard\u2019s 2022 failure A New Shepard rocket and spacecraft were set to launch a batch of science instruments on September 12, 2022. But one minute into flight, the rocket endured Max Q \u2014 an aerospace term that refers to a moment of maximum stress on a vehicle. It occurs when the rocket is at a relatively low altitude \u2014 where the atmosphere is still fairly thick \u2014 but the spacecraft is moving at high speeds, creating a moment of intense pressure on the vehicle. Around that time, the rocket appeared to emit a massive burst of flames. The New Shepard capsule, which rides atop the rocket, then initiated its launch abort system \u2014 firing up a small engine to blast itself safely away from the malfunctioning rocket. That system worked as intended, parachuting the capsule to a safe landing. Blue Origin later\u00a0revealed\u00a0that the cause of the failure was a problem with the engine nozzle, a large cone that directs the flaming exhaust at the rocket\u2019s bottom. Onboard computers accurately detected the failure and shut the engine down, according to the company. No injuries were reported on the ground, and Blue Origin said the science payloads and the capsule could be flown again. But the rocket, left without a functioning engine, smashed back into the ground\u00a0and was destroyed. Typically after New Shepard launches, the rocket booster guides itself back to a safe upright landing so it can be flown again. During a December interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Bezos\u00a0said the escape system that jettisoned the capsule to safety is the most difficult piece of engineering in the entire rocket \u2014 but \u201cit is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone go on New Shepard.\u201d \u201cThe (rocket) booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it,\u201d Bezos added. \u201cThe power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. \u2026 So the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. \u201cA tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view \u2026 to be as safe as one can make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it perfectly safe. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Rocket fix and return to service The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches and is charged with ensuring public safety, oversaw an investigation into the failure. The probe revealed that the engine nozzle failed because it experienced higher temperatures than what the company had anticipated. To fix the issue, Blue Origin said it implemented \u201cdesign changes to the combustion chamber\u201d \u2014 the area of the engine where fuel explosively mixes with oxidizer \u2014 and adjusted \u201coperating parameters,\u201d or the data that the company uses to model safe flights. \u201cAdditional design changes to the nozzle have improved structural performance under thermal and dynamic loads,\u201d the company said in a March 2023\u00a0statement. The FAA formally concluded the mishap investigation on September 27, 2023, outlining 21 \u201ccorrective actions\u201d Blue Origin needed to implement before returning to flight. The agency did not reveal details on what those actions were,\u00a0noting the report\u00a0\u201ccontains proprietary data and U.S \u00a0Export Control\u00a0information and is not available for public release.\u201d The changes and New Shephard\u2019s successful December flight teed up the company to restart its trips to space for thrill seekers. Before the September 2022 failure, New Shepard rockets had flown 22 consecutive successful missions \u2014 including six with passengers on board.\u00a0Bezos flew aboard the rocket\u00a0in 2021. Other notable space tourists previously carried by the vehicle include \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor William Shatner and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host Michael Strahan.

{"id": "2024_05_20_health_cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness", "text": "One may think young people are the main group enjoying the freedom of legalized weed, but in Canada, the greatest increase in users after legalization was among older adults \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s sending them to the hospital, according to new research. The rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults during the period of legalization of dried cannabis flower and edibles \u2014 October 2018 through December 2022 \u2014 in Canada was significantly higher than that of the pre-legalization period, according to a research letter published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Edibles, which include baked goods, candies and beverages, are increasingly popular, said lead research author Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician and clinician scientist at Sinai Health in Ontario. But some older adults may be unaware of the strength of today\u2019s weed, and little is known about the health effects of legalizing edible cannabis on older adults \u2014 the age group with the largest growth in overall cannabis use a year after dried cannabis flower was legalized in Canada, Stall said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an age-related bias that many health care practitioners, and frankly society, hold that older adults are not using drugs. And that\u2019s not true,\u201d Stall said. \u201cWe found that the largest increases in emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning among seniors occurred after edible cannabis became legal for retail sale in January 2020.\u201d The authors used the Ontario Ministry of Health\u2019s administrative data to examine the rates of emergency room visits for cannabis poisoning among older adults during the pre-legalization period \u2014 January 2015 to September 2018 \u2014 and the two legalization periods: October 2018 through December 2019, which permitted the sale of dried cannabis flower only, and January 2020 through December 2022, which marked the legalization of cannabis edibles. When people have cannabis poisoning, according to Stall, they may experience confusion; psychosis, including hallucinations; anxiety or panic attacks; rapid heartbeat; chest pain; nausea; and vomiting.\u00a0 During the eight-year study period, there were 2,322 emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning in older adults who were age 69 on average. Nearly 17% of those adults were simultaneously intoxicated with alcohol, about 38% had cancer and 6.5% had dementia. Compared with pre-legalization, legalization period No. 1 saw a twice higher rate of emergency department visits for cannabis poisoning. The rate during the second legalization period tripled that of pre-legalization. \u201cThis study provides a cautionary tale of legalization of substances without adequate research, education, and counseling of users regarding adverse effects and safe usage, particularly in older adults,\u201d said Dr. Lona Mody and Dr. Sharon K. Inouye, who weren\u2019t involved in the research, in a commentary on the research. Mody is the Amanda Sanford Hickey Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Inouye is director of the Aging Brain Center at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research in Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The sneaky effects of edibles When it comes to explaining the higher rates, both unintentional and intentional use of edible cannabis are worth discussing, experts said. \u201cEdible cannabis products may be particularly dangerous because they are often indistinguishable from non-cannabis containing foods and may contain high amounts of THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), the major active ingredient in both medical and recreational cannabis,\u201d Mody and Inouye said. In his own practice, Stall has seen a common scenario resulting from the lack of distinction, he said: An emergency department doctor is not able to figure out why an older adult patient is neurologically impaired via any typical tests \u2014 only for a toxicology screen to come back positive for cannabis, much to the patient\u2019s surprise. \u201cThe other thing is that cannabis today is very different than cannabis was as recently as the early \u201990s and mid \u201980s,\u201d Stall explained. \u201cToday\u2019s cannabis extracts contain as much as 30 times more THC. \u2026 Older adults who may not have used cannabis in decades and are now trying again in this post-legalization era may not be aware.\u201d Additionally, age-related changes in organ function and how the drug is distributed throughout the body \u2014 as well as having health conditions or being on prescription drugs, especially psychoactive ones \u2014 can make it easier for an older adult to experience cannabis poisoning, Stall added. Some people who intentionally consume cannabis edibles may not be aware that this form has a more delayed effect than an inhalant, which goes straight to the bloodstream, he said. Thinking the edible isn\u2019t working, they take another one too soon and end up getting more than they bargained for. There are also people whose prescription medications for pain management, insomnia or dementia symptoms aren\u2019t effective, so they consume edibles for therapeutic purposes but without consulting a doctor first, Stall said. Reducing harm from cannabis use Abstaining from cannabis use may be \u201cappropriate\u201d for some individuals, but \u201cI would be hesitant to give a blanket recommendation (that) no other adults should be using this because there are people who are going to use it even if that recommendation is given,\u201d Stall said. Therefore, preventing cannabis-related harms in older adults requires a multipronged approach, he added, including storing cannabis edibles in locked locations and in clearly identified packaging. Products older adults intentionally use should have dosing information with specific guidance for older adults, \u201crecognizing that the amount of drug they may need is a lot less than younger populations,\u201d Stall said. \u201cIn geriatric medicine, we have a mantra: Start low and go slow. That same mantra applies here.\u201d The amount at which cannabis can become poisonous can depend on multiple personal factors, but some studies have indicated people should wait at least three hours before taking a second dose, Stall said. Health care providers should also have open and judgment-free conversations with older adults about cannabis use and its benefits and risks, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/cannabis-edibles-poisoning-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_health_usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers", "text": "Laboratory tests by the US Department of Agriculture haven\u2019t found any H5N1 bird flu virus in raw beef, but they are a good reminder why eating rare hamburgers can be risky. As part of a suite of tests conducted to check safe food handling advice after the detection of H5N1 bird flu virus in dairy cattle, the USDA recently mixed a substitute virus into ground beef and then cooked patties at varying times and temperatures. Researchers found none of the virus in hamburgers cooked to 145 degrees, roughly the temperature of a medium burger, or well-done burgers cooked to 160 degrees. They did, however, find some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, although the virus was present \u201cat much, much reduced levels,\u201d said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA. Whether that small amount of virus could make someone sick is still an unknown. The USDA already advises consumers to cook ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, as measured with a food thermometer, to avoid infections from bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli, he noted. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody needs to change any of the safe food handling or safe cooking practices that are already recommended,\u201d Deeble said. The USDA also announced $22 million in new government investments to protect animal health. The bulk of the funding will go to the Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and to a network of state laboratories called the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. \u201cThere are some labs that have equipment that needs to be updated or upgraded and additional folks that are interested in adding capacity to the laboratories that they operate. And so this funding is going to help support those types of projects,\u201d Deeble said Thursday. Between May 6 and May 12, the national lab network processed 1,100 tests for H5N1 bird flu in cattle, and 278 of those were presumed positive, Deeble said.\u00a0He cautioned that because multiple samples can be taken from the same animal or tests may be pooled, the number of tests doesn\u2019t reflect the number of animals tested or the number that are positive.\u00a0Approximately 600 of the tests were performed in accordance with the USDA\u2019s new order, which requires testing of dairy cattle moving between states.\u00a0Another 450 tests were performed on animals showing symptoms. USDA said that it had gotten a positive response to its offer last week to financially compensate producers who take steps to protect their herds and workers against further spread of the virus. However, it doesn\u2019t have the forms ready for farmers to fill out, so nobody has been signed up for the program.\u00a0It hopes to have the paperwork ready by the middle of next week, Deeble said. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency had not been able to find farmworkers willing to participate in studies looking at how bird flu transmits on dairy farms in return for $75. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up hope. We are in\u00a0constant conversation with a number of states. We\u2019re getting closer, but as of yet, nothing across the finish line,\u201d Shah said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/health/usda-testing-bird-flu-virus-burgers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn", "text": "Maybe you spotted one crawling up your leg after a hike through tall grass or felt one on your dog\u2019s back as you ran your hand through its fur. If you\u2019re unlucky, maybe you found one already burrowing into your skin, engorged with your blood. Ticks are parasitic bloodsuckers, capable of spreading deadly disease, and they\u2019re becoming increasingly common. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. Ticks 101 Ticks are arachnids, close cousins of mites and more distant cousins of spiders. There are\u00a0more than 800 species of ticks found around the world, and 84 that have been documented in the United States. However, only a handful in the US bite and transmit diseases to humans. The most common ones are blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks, but they feed on lots of animals besides deer), lone star ticks, American dog ticks and brown dog ticks. After a tick egg hatches, it goes through three life stages: larva, nymph and adult. Both male and female ticks feed on blood by inserting their barbed, straw-like mouthparts into the skin of their host (unlike mosquitoes, which only bite if they\u2019re females preparing to lay eggs). However, only female ticks drink to the point that they become engorged. \u201cWhen you see a super big and engorged female, that means she\u2019s going to be laying eggs and starting that life cycle process over again,\u201d said Kait Chapman, an extension educator and urban entomologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These arachnids change dramatically in size and appearance based on how old they are and how much blood they\u2019ve drunk. \u201cThe nymph blacklegged tick, if you put these unfed ones on a poppy seed bagel, they blend in quite nicely,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island and director of that school\u2019s Center for Vector-Borne Disease and its TickEncounter Resource Center. Meanwhile, an engorged adult female of the same species can swell to the size of a pea. Tick bites and diseases While there are some months when different species and life stages are more active, it\u2019s possible to get bitten by a tick any time of year. If you find a tick attached to you (or your pet), you should remove it carefully. \u201cThe recommendation is that you use a pair of tweezers, get the tick by its head as close to the skin as possible and pull it straight out,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to twist, because we could leave part of that mouthpart embedded in the skin. And we don\u2019t want to grab the body because if you squeeze the body the tick could regurgitate more, which means that you\u2019re increasing your chance of getting tick-borne illness.\u201d Your impulse might be to squash the freshly removed tick, but it\u2019s better if you drown it with hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol and keep it to show to an expert or at least take a photo. That way, you can identify what kind of tick it is and how long it\u2019s been feeding; the University of Rhode Island\u2019s\u00a0TickEncounter website has tools\u00a0based on coloration, size and geographic location. It\u2019s important to identify the tick because certain species carry different diseases. They pick up bacteria, viruses and other microbes from the blood of infected hosts, and when they bite a new victim, they can pass those pathogens along. Blacklegged tick larvae and nymphs, for instance, often feed on white-footed mice,\u00a0which can carry a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. When a tick that\u2019s fed on one of these infected mice then feeds on a human, it can pass along that bacterium, which causes Lyme disease. Lone star ticks, on the other hand, don\u2019t feed on white-footed mice and consequently aren\u2019t carriers of Lyme. (They do carry other disease-causing microbes, though, and their bites can introduce a sugar molecule into the bloodstream that\u00a0makes people allergic to red meat.) In\u00a0a September 2023 study, researchers identified a protein that appears to play a big part in how some ticks \u2014 including the deer tick and the Western blacklegged tick \u2014 get infected by the harmful bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum before spreading it to human hosts and causing anaplasmosis, which is different from Lyme disease. Anaplasmosis can cause severe headaches, fever and chills, vomiting, and fatigue,\u00a0according to Cedars-Sinai. Understanding this protein may give scientists a better sense of how to stop the spread of the disease through ticks, the study said. But there is still a lot of research ahead before they get there. Preventing tick bites The diseases carried by ticks can be debilitating or even life-threatening, and the risk of infection increases the longer a tick has been on you. While there are some treatments available, it\u2019s best to avoid getting bitten in the first place. Various studies have suggested factors that could play a role in tick attraction, including a recent paper showing a\u00a0connection between tick attraction and static electricity\u00a0in a laboratory setting. And while ticks are attracted to cues such as the carbon dioxide exhaled by animals, they tend to lie in wait rather than actively seeking out their prey. \u201cContrary to popular belief, they don\u2019t fall from trees. They simply sit at the edge of a tall blade of grass, for example, that\u2019s maybe hanging over someplace, and they\u2019ll put their front leg out. We call that questing,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey will wait for that host to brush right by them, and so that\u2019s primarily how people get ticks: They brush by it; it attaches to their leg or their clothes.\u201d Insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus have been\u00a0approved by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0to protect against ticks. However, these chemicals work differently against ticks than they do against mosquitoes. For instance, DEET \u201cburns the feet of ticks, and they fall off because their feet are burning,\u201d as opposed to interfering with the tick\u2019s ability to find its prey the way DEET affects mosquitoes, Mather said. What\u2019s more, \u201cas soon as the product is dried, it doesn\u2019t burn as much, so it really doesn\u2019t last very long for ticks.\u201d Instead, Chapman recommends preventing tick bites by covering your skin and tucking the bottoms of your pants into your socks. Ticks also are killed by half an hour in the dryer, so toss your clothes in as soon as you get home, even before you wash them. What\u2019s more, \u201cwe favor\u00a0wearing treated clothes with permethrin\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s far, far more effective\u201d than bug spray, Mather said. \u201cIt blocks nerve conduction in ticks, and it makes them hyper-excited and then they just lose function pretty quickly, and it actually ends up killing them.\u201d Depending on where you live, he said, it might also make sense to investigate exterminating ticks living in your yard. These precautions might seem extreme, but to Mather, they\u2019re the way of the future, because \u201cwe live in a \u2018more ticks in more places\u2019 world, and more people are being exposed.\u201d Climate change may play some role\u00a0in the spread of ticks, but Mather said he believes that the influx of the parasites has more to do with white-tailed deer becoming more common in areas where higher densities of people live. As a result, he said, \u201cMore people are being exposed to the ticks that are reproducing on white-tailed deer.\u201d Despite the spread of ticks and the severity of illnesses that they can cause, Chapman stressed that with proper precautions (for you and your pets \u2014 ask your vet for tick preventatives), they shouldn\u2019t hold you hostage inside your home. \u201cYes, ticks exist. Yes, they can be a public health concern, but we don\u2019t want you to let ticks keep you indoors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should still be able to go outside and enjoy nature, but you just have to, once again, perform those tick checks. So take a little bit of time. Do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/tick-season-prevention-tips-wellness-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_world_dinosaurs-warm-blooded-science-newsletter-wt-scn", "text": "Dinosaur means \u201cterrible lizard.\u201d The idea that the prehistoric creatures were scaly, sluggish reptiles with sprawling postures that dragged their tails through tropical swamps is deeply imprinted in the collective imagination. However, science now has a more nuanced understanding of the diversity of dinosaur physiology. Many dinosaurs sported brightly colored feathers like birds. Dinos lived in many different ecosystems, including the Arctic, where they would have encountered snow (if not the ice caps of today) and winters devoid of light. New research this week is adding fresh detail to one of paleontology\u2019s biggest questions: Did dinosaur blood run hot or cold? Dino-mite It\u2019s hard to find evidence that unquestionably shows what dinosaur metabolisms were like. Clues from fossilized eggshells and bones have now suggested that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and others were not. Gleaning the answer matters because it sheds light on dinosaur behavior. Warm-blooded animals, such as mammals and birds, are more active than their cold-blooded counterparts. A new study, based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, found that the three main dinosaur groups adapted differently, with two of the groups evolving\u00a0the ability to regulate body temperature\u00a0in the early Jurassic Period about 180 million years ago. The research suggested that meat-eating theropods, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus, spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, indicating that they may have evolved the ability to generate body heat internally. A long time ago Researchers have mapped a 40-mile-long extinct section of the Nile River through satellite radar imaging and analysis of sediment. Ancient Egyptians erected some 31 pyramids, including Giza\u2019s Great Pyramid, along the banks of the now-defunct arm of the river, which the builders likely used to transport stone and other construction materials. The discovery, buried deep beneath farmland and not visible in aerial photographs, may help archaeologists locate other Egyptian temples and monuments concealed by fields and desert sands that now cover the riverbed. Trailblazers In another feat of mapping, a 3D model of a cubic millimeter of brain tissue \u2014 smaller than a grain of rice \u2014 is now available in staggering detail and beauty, thanks to a collaboration between Harvard University and Google researchers. A team led by Dr. Jeff Lichtman, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, cut the sample into thin sections one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair. Despite the fragment\u2019s tiny size, it contained 57,000 cells, 230 millimeters of blood vessels and 150 million synapses. The colorized images make the individual components more visible, but they are otherwise a truthful representation of the tissue.

Climate changed The patterns of rings in tree trunks \u2014 affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature \u2014 provide a climate history for each year of their lives, going back hundreds or even thousands of years. Tree-ring data from nine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Scandinavia, have allowed scientists to reconstruct annual temperatures for Northern Hemisphere summers between the years 1 and 1849 and compare them with last summer\u2019s temperatures. The summer of 2023 was warmer than any other summer during this 2,000-year period, according to the study. The temperature then was at least 0.5 degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) warmer than the warmest summer during the period studied, the year 246 \u2014 when the Roman Empire still ruled over Europe and the Maya civilization dominated Central America. Fantastic creatures Marine scientists have used artificial intelligence to decode previously unknown complexity in the calls of sperm whales. The whales produced a catalog of clicking sounds, which the researchers described as akin to a \u201cphonetic alphabet\u201d for sperm whales. Sperm whales produce clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels \u2014 louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums. What sperm whales are saying with their clicks remains a mystery to human ears, but understanding the scope of their vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking their calls with specific behavior.

{"id": "2024_05_20_health_meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging doctors to be on the lookout for potentially deadly meningococcal disease linked to travel to Saudi Arabia. Since April, there have been 12 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease associated with travel for Umrah, an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad in Saudi Arabia. Believers in the Muslim faith make Umrah trips to Mecca throughout the year to receive blessings. Muslims also make a longer, more ritualized pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime during a set time of year called Hajj. This year\u2019s Hajj is June 14 to 19. Five of the pilgrims who got sick this year live in the United States. France has had four cases, and the United Kingdom has had three. Ten of the people who got sick had been to Mecca, and two had a close association with someone who did. Meningococcal disease is highly contagious among unvaccinated people. Of the patients whose vaccination status is known, nine were unvaccinated. Meningococcal disease, including meningitis, is an uncommon illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. It can cause infection in the lining of the brain and spinal cord that can cause a lifetime of medical problems such as memory and concentration issues, seizures, balance problems, hearing loss and blindness. The disease can also lead to a serious blood infection called septicemia or blood poisoning. Research shows that\u00a0an estimated\u00a010% to 15% of cases end in death, even with appropriate treatment. The number of cases in the US has been on the rise, according to the CDC. This year, 143 cases were reported as of the end of March, compared with 81 for the same period last year. There were 422 cases in all of 2023, the most since 2014, according to the CDC. Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics if it\u2019s caught early enough. However, diagnosis is often delayed because the symptoms can mimic those of other infectious diseases like Covid-19 or the flu. Symptoms include fever, a headache, nausea or vomiting, trouble walking, a stiff neck, a skin rash, sensitivity to light and brain fog. Tests of the bacteria in the newly confirmed cases showed that in one case in the US and one in France, it was resistant to ciprofloxacin, one of the first-line antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease. Eight cases responded to treatment with penicillin or ciprofloxacin. Vaccines and boosters available Saudi Arabia requires all Umrah or Hajj pilgrims age 1 and older to have gotten the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine, also known as the meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccine.\u00a0It protects against four variations of the bacteria that are in wide circulation:\u00a0A, C, W, and Y. Overall, most cases in the US are related to serogroup Y. In the US, doctors may also recommend the MenB vaccine to protect against the B-variation of the bacteria. A shot made by Pfizer that was approved in the US last year, Penbraya, protects against all five of these most common serogroups that cause meningococcal disease. Most of the pilgrims who got sick tested positive for the W variation. One case in the United States was caused by serogroup C. In the US, the vaccine is routinely recommended for all preteens and teens\u00a0and for some younger children and adults under specific circumstances. One such instance is before travel to countries where meningococcal disease is more common. This includes a recommendation for a booster if the last time a traveler got the shot was three to five or more years before their trip. The CDC said Monday that health care providers should work with patients who are considering travel for Hajj or Umrah to make sure they have received the MenACWY vaccine within the past five years or get the shot at least 10 days before they leave for their trip. In the new notice, which was issued through the CDC\u2019s Health Alert Network, the agency also reminded providers to suspect meningococcal disease in anyone who has symptoms after recent travel for Hajj or Umrah. The CDC told health departments and providers to consider using several of the preferred antibiotics used to treat meningococcal disease in people associated with travel to Mecca. People who come into close contact with someone with meningococcal disease should get an antibiotic as soon as possible after exposure, regardless of their vaccination status, the CDC said, and ideally within a day after the initial patient has been identified. The most recent outbreak connected to a mass gathering was in 2000-01, the CDC said, and it was primarily caused by the W variation of the bacteria. It\u2019s only since 2002 that Saudi Arabia has required all pilgrims to provide proof of vaccination against meningococcal disease, but vaccination coverage among these travelers is \u201cknown to be incomplete,\u201d the CDC said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/meningococcal-disease-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_health_hiv-breastfeeding-recommendations-aap", "text": "Each time LaTonya looks at framed photos of herself breastfeeding her baby son for the first time, she swells with emotion. As a mother living with HIV in Colorado, it was a moment she wanted to commemorate. \u201cThat\u2019s how important it was to me to be able to breastfeed,\u201d LaTonya said about the photos. \u201cSo, I wanted to make sure we had that forever.\u201d For the first time, the American Academy of Pediatrics has changed its position to say people with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, can breastfeed their infants with \u201cvery low\u201d risk if they follow certain guidelines with support from their medical care team. Avoiding breastfeeding is the only option with zero risk for HIV transmission, but going forward, pediatricians should offer support and counseling for women who wish to breastfeed, who are receiving antiretroviral treatment, known as ART, as prescribed and who are maintaining an undetectable amount of virus in the body, according to a new clinical report from AAP that was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. Previously, the academy recommended that mothers with HIV in the United States not breastfeed their infants, regardless of their viral load and antiretroviral therapy use. Recommendations against breastfeeding for people with HIV date to about 1985, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that women with HIV infection avoid breastfeeding. \u201cThe AAP recommends that for people with HIV in the United States, replacement feeding (with formula or certified, banked donor human milk) is the only option that is 100% certain to prevent postnatal transmission of HIV,\u201d the new report says. \u201cHowever, pediatric health care professionals should be prepared to provide infant feeding counseling and a family-centered, culturally sensitive, harm reduction approach for people with HIV on ART with sustained viral suppression who desire to breastfeed.\u201d HIV is a virus that attacks the body\u2019s immune system, and if not treated, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. LaTonya has been living with HIV for about 20 years, she said, but as soon as she gave birth to her son, she knew that she wanted to breastfeed because of the health benefits breastfeeding has for infants, including being associated with a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes and sudden infant death syndrome. \u201cBeing a mom is absolutely amazing. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world,\u201d LaTonya said, adding that every parent desires to give their child \u201cthe best shot\u201d at being the best person that they can be. \u201cI feel like breastfeeding was a step towards me being able to provide that for him,\u201d she said of her son. After she talked talking about her decision with her doctors, they developed a plan for her to breastfeed since her viral load is undetectable and she is taking antiretroviral medications. They discussed \u201cconstant monitoring of viral loads\u201d to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a spike\u00a0in her viral load and that \u201ccomplete adherence to medication was essential,\u201d LaTonya said. CNN is not publishing her full name to protect her medical privacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s essential for people to understand the science behind it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re undetectable, you cannot transmit it to your partner. It\u2019s essential for people to understand that, as well as, if you\u2019re adhering to your medication, that it\u2019s not going to transfer through the breast milk to your child. And so therefore, why deprive your child of \u2026 having that benefit?\u201d \u2018This has been a long evolution\u2019 Although HIV can be passed to infants through breastfeeding, research has shown that the use of antiretroviral drugs can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission, and these medicines are found to be safe during breastfeeding. In the absence of the mother taking ART or the infant taking preventive antiretrovirals, the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk appears to be highest in the baby\u2019s first four to six weeks of life, ranging between 5% and 6%, according to the AAP report. But the risk is \u201cestimated to be less than 1%\u201d if the mother is taking antiretroviral medications and the virus is suppressed in her body, meaning there is no detectable viral load, the report said. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is that the AAP for the first time is explicitly saying that pregnant people with HIV who are on treatment and undetectable can be supported to breastfeed,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Abuogi, lead author of the report and a pediatrician in Colorado who works with people with HIV during their pregnancies. \u201cThis has been a long evolution, and people living with HIV have been a part of advocating for this change,\u201d Abuogi said. \u201cSome women feel shame or distress or feel like they\u2019re not fulfilling their role as a mother if they can\u2019t breastfeed, and some are really worried that that discloses their HIV status in their community \u2014 if breastfeeding is the norm and you have to explain why you\u2019re not doing it.\u201d It\u2019s estimated that about 5,000 people with HIV give birth in the United States each year. \u201cSo having the opportunity to offer women the choice, as all women have, and to support their decision is really empowering,\u201d Abuogi said. \u201cPeople living with HIV should have all of the same infant-feeding options as anyone else, and we\u2019re really working to make that a safe decision for women.\u201d Last year, an advisory panel to the US Department of Health and Human Services made similar updates to its recommendations around infant-feeding, saying that \u201cindividuals with HIV who are on ART with a sustained undetectable viral load and who choose to breastfeed should be supported in this decision.\u201d The new AAP position now aligns with those updated recommendations from the HHS panel, said Dr. Rana\u00a0Chakraborty,\u00a0a pediatric infectious disease specialist and researcher\u00a0at\u00a0Mayo Clinic\u00a0in Minnesota, who is a\u00a0member of HHS\u2019  Panel on Treatment of\u00a0HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s been under discussion for a few years now. It began with the Department of Health and Human Services panel, and I think the authors of this report from the AAP have really summarized very nicely the current\u00a0national guidelines\u00a0in the US,\u201d said Chakraborty, who was not involved in the new AAP report. \u201cA number of investigators, including many from the US working in relatively resource-limited settings, were\u00a0previously\u00a0able to demonstrate that\u00a0breastfeeding\u00a0could be\u00a0undertaken\u00a0safely if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and maintains undetectable HIV viral loads \u2014 in other words, the amount of virus in one drop of blood needs to be less than 50 copies per milliliter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the US, this is\u00a0also doable. But\u00a0breastfeeding during\u00a0maternal HIV infection\u00a0does need a\u00a0supporting\u00a0multidisciplinary team of providers to make sure that this can be done safely for\u00a0both\u00a0mom and baby.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re seeing a consensus\u2019 The AAP recommendations signal that there is now a consensus among leading medical groups that mothers living with HIV can be supported and counseled in safely breastfeeding their babies, said Dr. Elaine Abrams, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, who has treated people living with HIV during their pregnancies and postpartum but was not involved in the new AAP report. \u201cAll of the bodies that provide guidelines to clinicians are now saying the same thing. We\u2019re seeing a consensus, and the consensus also puts the mother right up-front central in the conversation and decision-making,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s moved away from telling her what to do, to rather understanding what she wants to do, providing her with evidence and information and then supporting her in her decision,\u201d Abrams added. \u201cIn the old days, that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case.\u201d In the early 2000s, studies emerged showing that infants born to women with HIV in low-income countries had increased risks of illness and death when they were given formula \u2014 and that was found to be associated with the mothers not having safe drinking water to mix with the formula, according to the new AAP report. That prompted the World Health Organization to recommend that people with HIV should breastfeed their babies in places without safe drinking water and accessible formula. As more mothers with HIV breastfed, more studies then found that when the mother took ART or the infant was given antiretrovirals preventively, that effectively reduced the risk of HIV transmission. The new AAP report noted that there is no consensus on the optimal regimen of preventive antiretrovirals for infants during breastfeeding. Also, people who breastfeed are recommended to do so exclusively, because mixing breastfeeding and formula or solid foods\u00a0has been associated with increased HIV transmission. \u201cThis increased rate may be a result of disrupted infant gut integrity associated with consuming substances other than human milk, decreases in the amount of antiviral or anti-inflammatory substances typically consumed in human milk, or other mechanisms,\u201d according to the AAP report. LaTonya said that among the guidance that her medical team discussed with her for breastfeeding was to not incorporate formula but to breastfeed exclusively. \u201cOne of the guidelines that we went over is, if we were going to breastfeed, that was the only thing that we could do,\u201d LaTonya said. \u201cWe could not mix formula and breastfeeding.\u201d Along with supporting and counseling patients with HIV who wish to breastfeed, the AAP also recommended in the new report that pregnant people be routinely tested for HIV and those living with HIV or newly diagnosed should be linked to treatment. LaTonya said that she hopes the new AAP recommendations encourage health-care providers to educate the public more about what an undetectable level of HIV means, how infections can be treated and how the virus can be suppressed. \u201cIt\u2019s something people live with, and it\u2019s not something to be afraid of,\u201d LaTonya said. The time for doctors to have those types of educational discussions with their patients would be when someone has a routine HIV test, she said. \u201cThey will talk to you about gonorrhea and chlamydia, but the HIV portion is missing. And so therefore, a lot of people are still stuck in the \u201880s with their mentality of HIV and AIDS,\u201d LaTonya said. \u201cI believe that is mostly due to lack of education.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/health/hiv-breastfeeding-recommendations-aap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_health_ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness", "text": "The ultraprocessed foods your kids eat now may be putting them a greater risk for cardiometabolic problems \u2013 like heart attack, stroke and diabetes \u2013 in adulthood, a new study suggests. \u201cOur study highlights the importance of promoting the substitution of ultra-processed foods with healthier alternatives, such as unprocessed or minimally processed options, in efforts to prevent further cardiometabolic health problems in children,\u201d said lead author of the study Dr. Nancy Babio, associate professor of Rovira I Virgili University and researcher from Institut d\u2019Investigaci\u00f3 Sanit\u00e0ria Pere Virgili and CIBEROBN in Spain. From this study, families and institutions should take away how early life lays the foundation to problems dealt with in adulthood, said Dr. Stuart Berger, a pediatric cardiologist and chair of the section of cardiology and cardiac surgery for the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the research. The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, analyzed data from more than 1,400 children ages 3 to 6 recruited from schools across seven cities in Spain. The children\u2019s caregivers met with researchers in person and completed questionnaires at home on physical activity, food consumption and demographics from 2019 to 2022, according to the study. Researchers divided the data from the children into three groups based on the amount of ultraprocessed food they ate. Children who consumed the most ultraprocessed foods were more likely to have risk factors like a higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure and waist-to-height ratio, the study showed. Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients \u201cnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Those ingredients \u2014 found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, chicken nuggets and ice cream \u2014 can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing. \u201cAmericans eat ultraprocessed foods every day,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research. A group of Americans in a study published on May 8 ate at least three servings of ultraprocessed food a day, with one group eating an average of seven daily servings, the study showed. Many studies have shown the negative health effects of ultraprocessed foods in adults, but Friday\u2019s study is among the first to show the impact they can have on the cardiometabolic health of young children, said Berger, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago. \u201cThis particular topic, ultraprocessed food consumptions and risk, is a very important topic in kids,\u201d he said. Starting young The study is observational, meaning that while researchers can identify an association between how much ultraprocessed foods children eat and their health, they cannot say that one causes the other, Berger said. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be mindful of ultraprocessed foods for young children, because how they eat for the rest of their lives is greatly impact by their early nutrition, he said. \u201cWhat we know is people who eat a certain way, even moms who eat in utero, set up baby\u2019s preferences,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere are a ton of publications that have shown that what we eat early in life \u2026 actually sets the stage for what happens in the future.\u201d Shifting your child\u2019s diet away from ultraprocessed foods and toward more fresh options is easier to do when they are very young, Berger said. Ultra-convenient The problem is that avoiding ultraprocessed foods is not equally easy for everyone. The study found that the children with the highest amount of ultraprocessed foods in their diet had mothers who were younger, had a higher BMI and had lower levels of education and employment. In places where fresh food might be harder to obtain, ultraprocessed foods are more accessible and inexpensive, Freeman said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are also ultra-convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, people reach for them when they feed their kids, and their kids aren\u2019t hungry, but they\u2019re filled with all these different chemicals and substances and seasonings and salts of sugars and whatever that they become very addicted to.\u201d Freeman stressed that giving kids ultraprocessed foods without also providing fresh fruits and vegetables sets them up for problems down the road. Adding in more nutritious foods and encouraging physical activity as much as possible is critical, Berger added. \u201cIf you can do something to create a healthy lifestyle early, there\u2019s a reasonable chance that you can you can eliminate metabolic syndromes later in life like diabetes, obesity, and all the complications associated with diabetes and obesity,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/health/ultraprocessed-foods-kids-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "health"}}
