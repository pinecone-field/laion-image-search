In their inaugural state-by-state analysis on women\u2019s health, researchers at the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on health issues, collected data on health care quality, outcomes and access for women in the US. The data came from several sources, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the researchers evaluated states on 32 specific metrics, scoring them relative to each other. The report, released Thursday, reveals that states in the Northeast scored highest. Massachusetts came out on top as \u201cthe best-performing health system for women overall,\u201d with Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire rounding out the top five. The poorest performers were spread across the southern half of the country. Mississippi had the lowest score overall, followed by Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma and Arkansas. \u201cThis is the very first time we at the Fund have created a scorecard exclusively focused on states\u2019 performance in reproductive care and women\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund. \u201cWhile some states undoubtedly are championing women\u2019s continued access to vital health and reproductive services, many others are failing to ensure that women can get and afford the health care they need. This failure is having a disproportionate impact on women of color and women with low incomes,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is that policymakers can use these findings to identify and address gaps in care, guaranteeing that all women across the United States can live healthy lives with access to quality, affordable care \u2013 no matter where they live or what their background is.\u201d \u2018Health of women \u2026 is in a perilous place\u2019 The new report reveals that life expectancy for US women is the lowest it\u2019s been in nearly two decades \u2013 since 2006. \u201cThe health of women in the United States is in a perilous place,\u201d the authors wrote, highlighting nationwide increases in deaths from preventable causes, as well as significant state-by-state differences in how many women are dying in reproductive age. In 2022, the mortality rate ranged from about 204 deaths for every 100,000 women of reproductive age in West Virginia to around 71 deaths per 100,000 in Hawaii, the report says. \u201cWe looked at deaths from all causes among women and girls ages 15 to 44, a common way to identify women of reproductive age, and we found a threefold difference across states, with the highest rates of death concentrated in the Southeastern states,\u201d said David Radley, a senior scientist for the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Tracking Health System Performance initiative. Causes of death included those related to pregnancy \u2013 with mental health conditions as the most frequently reported cause of preventable pregnancy-related deaths \u2013 as well as other preventable causes such as substance use, Covid-19 and treatable chronic health conditions. The report also noted that the maternal death rate nearly doubled between 2018 and 2022, with rates for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native women increasing the most. Deaths from breast and cervical cancer also are considered in the new report as preventable and treatable with timely screening and health care. Breast and cervical cancer deaths were found to be highest in Southern states. \u201cWe also saw big differences across states in women\u2019s ability to access care,\u201d Radley said. \u201cThe state of health care for women in this country is in a vulnerable place.\u201d A fractured landscape of health policies \u2013 including Medicaid coverage and access to abortion and reproductive care \u2013 contributes to significant state-level inequalities for women across the country, according to the new report. \u201cWe found big differences across states in a woman\u2019s ability to access reproductive health care services, the quality of care she\u2019s likely to receive and the outcomes she\u2019s likely to experience,\u201d Radley said. \u201cWe looked at insurance coverage and found that uninsured rates among women ranged from 2.5% to over 20% uninsured, with the highest uninsured rates in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs.\u201d Expanding Medicaid coverage to cover more people with household incomes below a certain level is linked with lower rates of maternal mortality, smaller racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and infant health outcomes, and broader use of reproductive health care services, according to the report. The three states with the lowest maternal mortality rates \u2013 Vermont, California and Connecticut \u2013 have all expanded Medicaid. Ten states have not expanded Medicaid \u2013 Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming \u2013 leaving about 800,000 women uninsured. Each of those states, except for Wisconsin, ranked below the average on women\u2019s health. Women in states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility were among those most at risk of lacking insurance coverage, the researchers found. Among women ages 15 to 44, those in Texas, Georgia and Oklahoma had the highest rates of being uninsured. Those in Massachusetts, the District of Columbia and Vermont had the lowest uninsured rates. \u201cBut access isn\u2019t just about having coverage, it\u2019s also about being able to get to a service provider when care is needed. It\u2019s estimated that over 5 million women already live in a county that\u2019s considered a maternity care desert, meaning there\u2019s no hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and there are no obstetric providers,\u201d Radley said. \u201cWe looked at the adequacy of the maternity care workforce in each state and found that states with the most restrictive abortion policies also tended to have the fewest maternity care providers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s concern among experts that abortion bans and restrictions may reduce the number of maternity care providers even further.\u201d \u2018Are those divides \u2026 going to continue?\u2019 States with abortion restrictions tend to have the fewest maternity care providers, higher rates of maternal mortality and broad disparities in health systems, according to the new report. Fourteen states \u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia \u2013 have enacted near-total bans on abortion since the US Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion two years ago. All but one of those states ranked below average in the new ranking of women\u2019s health from the Commonwealth Fund, and seven were among the poorest-performing states. The policy choices that state lawmakers put forth, including fully expanding Medicaid and imposing abortion restrictions, have \u201cclearly had implications for people in their states,\u201d said Sara Collins, senior scholar and vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at the Commonwealth Fund. \u201cThose are clear policy choices that states are making that are linked to the politics in their state and that are having an impact on women\u2019s access to health care,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAre those divides that we\u2019re seeing going to continue into the future?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre there going to be more women who are living in states that don\u2019t have full access to reproductive health care? Or are those trends going to reverse? And a lot of that is tied to the politics, both in states but also at the federal level.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/health/womens-health-state-rankings-commonwealth-fund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_nip-and-tuck-eye-surgery-pets-wellness", "text": "Hamilton was in such pain he refused to open his eyes. When the 4-year-old English bulldog tried, his misshapen eyelids would roll inward, causing his eyelashes to scrape against his cornea. \u201cHave you ever had something scratch your cornea? It is profoundly painful,\u201d said Dr. Dana Varble, chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community, a nonprofit organization that provides learning opportunities for veterinarians. \u201cFor these poor animals, every blink is excruciating,\u201d Varble added. \u201cThey often squint in order to see, and that can make the eyelids turn in even more.\u201d After Hamilton had plastic surgery on his eyes \u2014 what humans would call a nip and tuck \u2014 he was able to see and interact with his owners with no pain. \u201cThese nip and tucks are not cosmetic; they are critical to the health of the animal,\u201d Varble said. \u201cWhen the eyelids roll in and the lashes rub the cornea, eventually the cornea gets scarred and (this) causes visual problems, or even blindness.\u201d Some canine breeds are genetically more likely to develop eyelid problems, such as dogs with shortened muzzles and flattened faces \u2014 think boxers, Boston terriers, French bulldogs, Pekingese, pugs and shih tzus, to name a few. In Hamilton\u2019s case, his vision worsened after he gained weight, with his beefy cheeks forcing the eyelids to fold inward. However, symptoms of the painful condition can show up in puppyhood, often disguised as behavioral problems, Varble said. \u201cWe see these 6-month-old puppies who are cranky, they\u2019re not training well, they\u2019re still not housebroken or getting over that puppy nipping stage,\u201d she said. \u201cYou take a closer look, and they are constantly in pain every time they blink their eyes \u2014 no wonder they\u2019re not paying attention to training.\u201d Cats can suffer, too Large cat breeds with flat faces, such as Persians and Himalayans, or round, puffy cheeks such as Siberians, Ragdolls and Maine coons, can also have issues with malformed eyelids, although it\u2019s not as common as in dogs. A 6-month-old Maine coon named Jinxy frequently kept his painful eyes shut until his owner took him to a specialist in Athens, Georgia, trained to perform complex eyelid surgery. \u201cThese eyelid diseases happen in people as well, and I like to tell my clients we practice them on humans first to make sure they are safe before we do the surgery on their dog or cat,\u201d said Dr. Kate Myrna, an associate professor of veterinary ophthalmology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia in Athens. After his surgery, Jinxy was able to open his eyes and purr at his owner without pain, Myrna said. \u201cThese are necessary surgeries. If a pet is born with too much eyelid, it\u2019s not going to get better on its own,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile surgery sounds serious, it creates almost instant pain relief, and the eye is one of the fastest healing organs in the body.\u201d However, cats can be a bit more difficult to treat \u201cbecause when you try to get in close with that bright light, they usually have big feelings about it,\u201d Myrna said. \u201cSo don\u2019t be surprised if your vet needs to wrap your cat into a \u2018kitty burrito\u2019 to conduct the exam,\u201d she said, referring to putting a towel around a cat for safe handling. A lack of trained specialists When Denali, a mastiff mix, was rescued at 4 months old by Varble, she had bulging red glands in the corner of each eye. \u201cWe call it cherry eye, because it looks like a small cherry in the corner of their eye, but it\u2019s actually the tear glands behind the third eyelid rolling outward, instead of being tucked in as they should,\u201d Varble said. While not always painful, the condition can be irritating for dogs and puts them at risk of injury or infection from pawing at the eye. Left untreated, the condition can lead to dry eye and the potential for blindness, experts say. While all breeds are susceptible to cherry eye, it\u2019s most common among basset hounds, beagles, cocker spaniels, Great Danes, rottweilers, and dogs with flat faces such as boxers, bulldogs and Pekingese. Surgery to correct cherry eye can be relatively simple for an experienced veterinary surgeon, but some circumstances can be more challenging and require the skill of a vet trained in ophthalmology. \u201cDenali had a very severe case,\u201d Varble said. \u201cThankfully, the specialist was able to save the gland in her eye. That\u2019s important because if we have to remove the gland it increases the incidence of dry eye in those dogs after surgery.\u201d Unfortunately, there are only 500 veterinary ophthalmologists in the United States, making it difficult at times for pet owners and general vets to get the quick treatment needed, according to Varble. To overcome that obstacle, the North American Veterinary Community holds periodic trainings so a general vet can become more comfortable treating simple injuries and eye abnormalities. \u201cIf our general practice veterinarians can handle more than just first aid for eyes, they can free up the specialists for serious cases and significant emergencies,\u201d Varble said. \u201cIt just makes everybody more efficient and is better for the pets and their owners as well.\u201d Droopy eyes and signs of injury There are other eye problems that require plastic surgery as well. Mastiffs and bloodhounds are often born with \u201cbig droopy eyelids\u201d that refuse to close completely, Varble said. \u201cTheir lower lids can be so far down that the eyelids literally don\u2019t shut all the way when the upper lid comes down,\u201d Varble said. \u201cThat can create dry spots, and the dogs are more prone to get dust and other things stuck in their eyes.\u201d Unfortunately, a healthy eye can turn into a vision-threatening emergency rapidly, making it important that pet owners act as soon as they notice any significant irritation, Myrna said. \u201cIf your pet has morning sleep or goo in the corner of their eyes, or a bit of a discharge that is common with some cat and dog breeds, that\u2019s probably not a reason to go rushing into your vet,\u201d Myrna said. Signs of significant injury include redness in one or both eyes, excessive squinting or twitching of an eyelid, or an eye that remains closed or is unable to open, Myrna said. Another sign is a blue haze over the entire eye that lasts more than two hours. \u201cIt\u2019s different than cataracts, which are a white or blue color in the pupil,\u201d Myrna said. \u201cWhen the whole surface of the eye looks hazy blue, that\u2019s usually because it\u2019s waterlogged, and that\u2019s a sign of a problem that we need to look at right away. \u201cRemember, a scratched eye can easily become infected and can go from a superficial, easy to treat injury to needing surgery or the pet will lose the eye and lose vision \u2014 and that can happen overnight.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/nip-and-tuck-eye-surgery-pets-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_science_fireball-sighting-sonic-boom-nyc-nj", "text": "A meteor bright enough to be spotted in broad daylight streaked across the sky on Tuesday morning, catching the attention of several East Coasters who documented their sightings. The fireball, defined as a meteor\u00a0brighter than the planet Venus, is estimated to have soared over New York City before traversing a short path southwest and disintegrating about 31 miles (50 kilometers) above Mountainside, New Jersey, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA\u2019s Meteoroid Environment Office. The meteor was likely about 1 foot (0.3 meter) in diameter, which would have made the rock bright enough to see during the day, Cooke said. Spying a meteor of this size is a rarer occurrence than catching sight of the smaller particles a few millimeters (less than an inch) in size typically seen in the night sky. The American Meteor Society received over 40 reports of a fireball sighting at around 11:15 a.m. ET over New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and a few other states in the US Northeast. The society confirmed that two videos submitted to AMS included footage of the fireball. One clip came from a home security camera in Wayne, New Jersey, and the other from a dedicated meteor camera system positioned in Northford, Connecticut. During the same time eyewitnesses said they observed the fireball, several other spectators reported a loud sound as well as shaking in the area. A meteor can make an explosive sound when the rock breaks apart into smaller pieces, creating a \u201cpressure wave,\u201d Cooke said. This type of fracturing could also have caused the ground to shake. But NASA cannot confirm whether the meteor\u2019s appearance was linked to these two events, since infrasound detectors used to pick up low-frequency sound in the area were oversaturated by military activity simultaneously happening in the south, he added. Did the fireball leave behind meteorites? It\u2019s also possible for a meteor to travel fast enough to create a sonic boom if fragments survive entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and reach the lower layer, said Robert Lunsford, the fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society. \u201cWhen sounds are heard from a fireball, this indicates that some fragments survived down to the lower atmosphere and may have left small remnants of the original fireball on the ground. These remnants are traveling much faster than the speed of sound,\u201d Lunsford said in an email. However, this fireball likely did not create any meteorites, the term for a meteoroid that makes it to the ground, as it had disintegrated in the sky due to its size and speed, Cooke said. The last fireball reported in daylight over the area was about a year and a half ago, Cooke said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a maybe once a year\u2013type occurrence,\u201d but the timing of the fireball was ideal to spark a lot of attention, he added. \u201cPeople were out walking, doing their daily lunchtime thing, and all of a sudden this streak flashed across the sky \u2014 it was in the right place and the right time.\u201d If sky-gazers are looking to catch more glimpses of fireballs, there are several meteor showers set to peak within the next few weeks. The Southern Delta Aquariids could offer a sight of 20 meteors per hour at the end of July, and the Perseids could bring upward of 100 meteors per hour in mid-August, according to the\u00a0American Meteor Society.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/science/fireball-sighting-sonic-boom-nyc-nj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_health_dr-sanjay-gupta-analysis-trump", "text": "It has been nearly a week since gunfire erupted at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, resulting in an injury to the former president, the death of one attendee, Corey Comperatore, and severe injuries to two others. And although the images we\u2019ve seen of Trump since his attempted assassination have been those of a person who was barely injured and is now in high spirits, what we\u2019ve been told by the campaign offers very little insight into the former president\u2019s condition, what kind of care he received or how his medical team will monitor him in the days and weeks ahead. A full public assessment of Trump\u2019s injuries is necessary, for both the former president\u2019s own health and the clarity it can provide for voters about the recovery of the man who could become president of the United States once again. The concern is that gunshot blasts near the head can cause injuries that aren\u2019t immediately noticeable, such as bleeding in or on the brain, damage to the inner ear or even psychological trauma. As a trauma neurosurgeon, I have seen how a thorough evaluation after any kind of gunshot wound can provide a complete picture and lead to a speedier recovery. The first hour The first official communication about Trump\u2019s health from his campaign came about 40 minutes after the shooting. It simply said Trump was \u201cfine\u201d and was \u201cbeing checked out at a local medical facility.\u201d It added that more details would follow. Two hours later, in a post by Trump himself on Truth Social, he wrote: \u201cI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.\u201d In his speech at the Republican National Convention Thursday night, Trump described the moment of the shooting\u00a0but didn\u2019t shed new light on his condition or the care he received.\u00a0Beyond that, most of what we know about his injury is based on what we\u2019ve seen in pictures and video, and from secondhand accounts. A source familiar with the matter told CNN on Sunday that Trump underwent a number of \u201croutine\u201d tests at the hospital, including a CT scan that came back normal. CNN has repeatedly reached out to the Trump campaign and Butler Memorial Hospital, where Trump was treated, for more information but has not received further details about his condition or care.\u00a0CNN reached out to the Trump campaign for comment again Thursday. What we know about Trump\u2019s injury In the moments immediately following the sounds of gunfire on Saturday, we saw Trump raise his right hand to his ear and the side of his face. He did not collapse but seemed to duck to the ground of his own accord. With US Secret Service surrounding him, he stood up about a minute later, raised his right arm and was able to walk and speak immediately. We saw him rouse the audience, telling them to \u201cFight!\u201d as he pumped his fist in the air. From a medical standpoint, these are all very good signs and, despite the visible blood on his face, provided evidence that he wasn\u2019t severely injured. US Rep. Ronny Jackson, Trump\u2019s former White House physician, said during an interview Monday on \u201cThe Benny Show\u201d podcast, that he \u201cchecked out\u201d the wound to Trump\u2019s ear and bandaged it himself. He added that \u201cthere was no concussive effect from the bullet\u201d because it was far enough from Trump\u2019s head. \u201cIt just took the top of his ear off, a little bit of the top of his ear off, as it passed through,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt was bleeding like crazy.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Trump was transported to nearby Butler Memorial Hospital. Dr. David Rottinghaus, an emergency room physician there, said the hospital had been in contact with the Secret Service before Saturday\u2019s rally. Rottinghaus, who did not treat Trump himself and would not comment on Trump\u2019s treatment or condition, said he came to the hospital shortly after the shooting to help triage patients. \u201cWe do prepare for incidents like this. We had had advanced visits in the past for rallies when Mr. Trump was here. The last was the end of 2020. We have worked with the Secret Service in the past and local and federal law enforcement to come up with plans about if an incident like this happened,\u201d Rottinghaus told CNN. Those plans included designating a bed in the ER in case it was needed, having clinical teams at the rally itself to treat patients on-site for minor medical issues, and avoiding overwhelming the hospital if there were a crisis. When the unthinkable happened, Rottinghaus said, it took just minutes for Butler Memorial to put its plan into action, locking down the hospital and diverting patients to other health care facilities. Although we were told that Trump had a CT scan and other routine exams, it is not clear when these tests were performed, who read the scans or whether his brain specifically was examined. In the Monday interview, Jackson said Trump\u2019s injury was \u201cdressed up. He\u2019ll be OK. \u2026 It\u2019s going to granulate and heal in, and he\u2019s not going to need anything to be done with it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0On Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Eric Trump said that his father had \u201cno stitches but certainly, certainly a nice flesh wound.\u201d And Trump has been moving around the RNC in Milwaukee this week, talking and smiling through speeches with a bandage on his ear. What we don\u2019t know All of this points to a favorable prognosis. But it is still surprising that we have not heard more about the exact diagnosis and care of what may have been a catastrophic injury. And, while all the attention has been on his ear and right side of his head, that doesn\u2019t mean other injuries may not be present. It\u2019s not even clear that he was struck by a primary projectile from the rifle, a secondary projectile or a combination of both. Sometimes, it can be difficult to know without an in-depth evaluation. We do know that the shooter used an AR-15-style weapon, and in my experience in the operating room, I\u2019ve witnessed the kind of trauma this weapon can cause. The kinetic energy of it is significant: A rifle like the AR-15 can produce up to 1,300 foot-pounds of force. With that much power close to the head, there can be injuries beyond what\u2019s visible. For example, a fracture to the thin bone in that region of the skull, an epidural hematoma (or bleeding between the skull and the brain) and damage to the bones of the inner ear, which can result in hearing loss, vertigo or dizziness. A CT scan can usually detect such injuries, but they aren\u2019t always immediately apparent. As a result, sometimes patients are observed in the hospital and may even undergo a repeat CT scan. The stress from a shooting can also have psychological effects. \u201cIn the chaos that immediately follows being shot, these psychological impacts don\u2019t always manifest,\u201d said Dr. Kenji Inaba, a trauma surgeon with the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt can come up later on, and it\u2019s something that we always need to be acutely aware of.\u201d The good news is that most physical symptoms of an injury would probably have revealed themselves over the past few days. At this point, however,\u00a0the Trump campaign hasn\u2019t yet shared whether a full workup was done at the time or if there has been any follow-up since. Presidents and presidential candidates are not required to share their medical histories with the public, but voters have said that the health conditions of their leaders matter to them in this election. More information helps everyone make better decisions. Rottinghaus, the Butler Memorial physician, told CNN that after all the preparation for the unthinkable, \u201cthe unexpected happened\u201d on Saturday. Still, the hospital considers it a successful day: Staff juggled the arrival of a former president with care for their other patients. What made it work, he said, was communication, clear planning and preparation to act. In an intense political season for the country, that kind of collaboration and communication may be a lesson for the candidates, too.

{"id": "2024_07_19_health_personalized-mobility-routine-wellness", "text": "Your body is the living, breathing vehicle you rely on to navigate your life, so maintaining mobility is an essential part of your overall well-being. Unfortunately, one-size-fits-all workouts often fall short of delivering a functional, pain-free range of motion. The good news is that creating an effective, personalized mobility routine can be simple and time efficient. Whether you\u2019re a busy professional, stay-at-home parent or seasoned athlete, you can follow the 10 practical steps below to create your own custom mobility program to enhance your range of motion, reduce pain, improve stability and more. Editor\u2019s note: Consult with your doctor before beginning any new fitness program. 1. Assess your current mobility To create a personalized mobility routine, it\u2019s crucial to understand how you currently move. Working with a certified trainer or physical therapist, you can get a comprehensive Functional Movement Screen, or FMS, which is what I use to assess professional athletes. You can also do a self-assessment using simple functional exercises to evaluate your range of motion and identify limitations. To self-assess, stand in front of a mirror and perform a variety of basic movements that incorporate the upper and lower body, such as squats, lunges and arm raises, noting any movement restrictions, imbalances or feelings of discomfort. For more comprehensive results, assess yourself doing exercises from all six categories of functional human movement: squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling, rotating and core stabilization (see video above). Tip: Record yourself from different angles during your assessment for a better view. Save the recordings to use for comparison as you progress in your program. 2. Identify areas of improvement The limitations revealed in your assessment offer areas of opportunity for improvement. Identify and prioritize areas based on factors such as how often you rely on that particular area of your body to perform similar movements in daily life, the degree of limitation or imbalance you experience, and the level of discomfort you feel. If you feel acute pain, seek assistance from a health care professional before proceeding. Common areas offering opportunities for improvement include the hips and lower back. Tip: If your balance was challenged during the assessment exercises, I recommend further assessment with a basic one-leg stand test. 3. Set goals Setting clear goals provides direction for your mobility routine. Is there a particular task or daily activity that enhanced mobility would enable you to do better? Define two or three actionable goals that relate to the areas in need of improvement identified in the preceding step. For example, if you found limitations in your ability to squat and you are an avid golfer who would like to improve mobility to play better, consider framing one of your goals like this: I will improve my hip mobility and knee stability to be able to squat down to pick up my ball, swing my club and walk the course with greater ease. Tip: Setting specific goals relevant to your lifestyle will allow you to recognize your progress in daily activities more easily, increasing your motivation. 4. Choose the right exercises Your mobility routine should include eight to 12 exercises that give your body the chance to practice a full range of motion while also zeroing in on the target areas identified in your assessment. To address total-body mobility, focus on a variety of exercises that get you moving in all directions and take you through all three planes of motion: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). Then identify exercises specific to your target areas and goals. For instance, in the example provided in step three, you would want to include hip mobility and knee stability exercises to improve your squatting and golf game, such as lateral lunges, reverse lunges and box squats. Tip: You can do an online search to determine exercises specific to your needs and goals. Staying with the same example above, you would search \u201chip mobility and knee stability exercises to improve squatting.\u201d Just vet any resources to be sure they are reputable. 5. Create a routine that fits your lifestyle Personalized mobility is much more effective and efficient than one-size-fits-all training, so you do not need to spend hours each week on it. With the right mobility plan, you can achieve results in less than an hour a week spread out over days. For instance, you could practice a 10-minute routine three times per week or a five-minute routine five times per week while also repeating two or three targeted exercises in shorter one- or two-minute spurts daily. Tip: Your personalized mobility routine can serve as the perfect warmup before any other regular exercise program, such as strength training or cardiovascular activities. 6. Incorporate exercises into daily activities Your mobility training should be designed to fit seamlessly into your daily life to avoid any barriers to consistency. One of the best ways to do that is through habit stacking, a technique that involves performing the desired new habit just before, during or after an ingrained habit, and pairing them together in a way that makes maintaining the new habit easier. To do this, stack your targeted mobility exercises with daily habits such as brushing your teeth, making the bed or putting on shoes. Tip: Make stretching on your couch part of your TV-watching habit. 7. Stay consistent Consistency is the most critical factor in seeing improvement. Set reminders on your smart devices and take the habit-stacking advice from the preceding step to integrate your mobility exercises into your daily routine. If you struggle with accountability, get a friend to practice with you. Tip: Do not be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Recommit and start fresh the next day. 8. Track your progress Monitoring your improvements provides motivation and important insights. Use a digital diary or a notebook to track changes in your range of motion, imbalances, sensations and so on. Tip: Reassess yourself every six to eight weeks, referring back to your original assessment recording to measure changes. 9. Adjust as needed As you progress, it\u2019s important to adjust your routine based on your evolving needs. If you hit a plateau, do not hesitate to modify your exercises and/or seek advice from a professional. Tip: Be sure to update your goals as you progress or make new goals that are more appropriate as you incorporate changes in your lifestyle. 10. Celebrate your successes Noticed any increase in range of motion? Celebrate your achievements, no matter how modest they may seem, as they signify forward momentum. Simply sticking to your routine consistently is cause for celebration. Tip: Rewarding yourself with small gifts or indulgences for hitting milestones can reinforce positive behavior and keep you motivated. By following these 10 steps, you can design a personalized mobility routine that fits your lifestyle, addresses your unique needs and helps you achieve lasting results. Your body will thank you for it!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/health/personalized-mobility-routine-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_immunization-rates-report", "text": "Although the Covid-19 pandemic saw\u00a0unprecedented\u00a0speed in the development and distribution of coronavirus vaccines, experts say it was also marked by a significant and concerning drop in the rate of routine vaccinations. New data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund shows the world has yet to recover. The pandemic signified a \u201chistoric backslide,\u201d according to Dr. Katherine O\u2019Brien, director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biological at WHO. Now, she says, the race is on to reach children who missed shots during the pandemic and to restore and strengthen immunization services beyond pre-pandemic levels. WHO and UNICEF\u2019s 2023 immunization coverage report, released Sunday, is the world\u2019s largest dataset on immunization trends for vaccinations against 14 diseases. It analyzed estimates from 185 countries and used a third dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine \u2014 which is recommended for 1-year-olds \u2014 as the global marker for immunization coverage. The data revealed that\u00a0previous progress\u00a0in reaching pre-pandemic immunization levels has stalled. Worldwide DTP3 coverage was 84% in 2023, the same as in 2022 but below 86% recorded in 2019. The report\u2019s authors say this is a derailment on the trajectory toward the Immunization Agenda 2030\u00a0goal\u00a0of 90% coverage for essential childhood and adolescent vaccines. This stagnation reflects ongoing challenges with disruptions in health-care services, logistical challenges, vaccine hesitancy and inequities in access to services, the organizations said in a news release. The new report also showed that the number of children who had not received a single dose of DTP3 increased by 600,000 from 2022 to 2023, leaving 2.7 million more children un- and under-immunized than before the pandemic. \u201cToday\u2019s release highlights that we are off track and need to accelerate efforts to meet this challenge,\u201d said Dr. Ephrem T. Lemango, associate director for health and global chief of immunization at UNICEF. Bright spots around the globe Amid the overall challenge, however, \u201cthere are places where there are positive signs,\u201d Lemango told CNN. The data showed that the African region made the most progress last year in overall coverage, and countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria made notable strides in recovering post-pandemic, according to O\u2019Brien and Lemango. \u201cLow-income countries \u2026 where the health systems were hit the hardest by the pandemic \u2026 are starting to see some improvement compared with 2022,\u201d O\u2019Brien said at a news briefing. In Africa, vaccine coverage in the first year of life increased despite a rising number of births, which required more vaccinations to maintain the same coverage level, according to O\u2019Brien. The 2023 report also found HPV vaccine coverage in girls increased 7%, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Studies\u00a0have shown that the vaccine can reduce cervical cancer rates in women by 87%. However, current coverage remains well below the 90% target to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, reaching only 56% of adolescent girls in high-income countries and 23% in low- and middle-income countries, according to the news release. All eyes on measles WHO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that global immunization efforts have saved 154 million lives \u2014 6 lives every minute \u2014 over the past 50 years. About 60% of that can be attributed to the measles vaccine, the organization says, projecting it to be the \u201ctop contributor to preventing deaths in the future.\u201d But the 2023 data revealed that measles coverage in countries with large or disruptive outbreaks after the pandemic is too low to control further outbreaks. Nearly 35 million children were left with no or only partial protection, a decline the report called \u201cconcerning,\u201d even for countries that have not had outbreaks in the past five years. Low vaccination coverage was a major factor in outbreaks in 103 countries \u2013 accounting for roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s infant population \u2013 in the past five years, said the report. Cases of the highly contagious virus have also reemerged in the United States. In 2023, the 92% of US children that have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2 fell below the federal target of 95%, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that year. \u201cMeasles outbreaks continue to rise as measles vaccination coverage stalls,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cThe world saw over 300,000 confirmed measles cases in 2023, which is an almost threefold increase compared to what we had in 2022.\u201d According to the organizations, there is hope that the introduction of new and underutilized vaccines, through partnerships such as\u00a0Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will expand protection against infectious diseases like measles. \u201cThis progress is crucial in reducing the burden of diseases that have long plagued communities,\u201d Lemango added. Immunizations in conflict zones Over half of unvaccinated children in 2023 lived in countries experiencing fragility, conflict and vulnerability, the data shows, even though these places account for only 28% of new births worldwide. Many of these countries have had \u201cworrying declines in performance since 2019,\u201d the report says. Of children who did not receive any vaccines in 2023, 59% were in only 10 countries. Places such as Sudan, Yemen and Afghanistan are new to this list, the report says. \u201cThe protection of children in any conflict setting is of critical importance,\u201d WHO\u2019s O\u2019Brien said. \u201c[Conflict] creates an environment where infectious diseases have a big risk of causing large and impactful outbreaks.\u201d Some countries that experienced conflict, such as Ukraine, had initial dips in immunization coverage but did not see an overall drop in vaccinations. But in other areas, such as Sudan and parts of the Middle East, that wasn\u2019t the case. There was a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in vaccine coverage in Gaza in 2023, one not seen to the same extent in Israel, according to O\u2019Brien. Data in the report from Gaza was submitted for only January through September, and it \u201cdoesn\u2019t cover what is happening in 2024,\u201d Lemango noted. Analyzing immunization coverage in other areas of conflict is \u201ca mixed picture,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019ll give the example, however, of Ukraine, which has had an improvement in coverage. Not all conflict areas result in a reduction in coverage,\u201d she said, referencing resilient programs, the nature of conflict and the safety of health workers. According to Lemango, there is a \u201cclear pattern\u201d in Ukraine where service availability typically decreases at the beginning of a conflict and resumes once assistance and resources flow in. The issue, he said, is how to maintain this improved state. Global reach of local vaccines Vaccine coverage in the United States ranges between 95% and 98%, an indication of good availability of health services, according to Lemango. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Americans are entirely protected. \u201cUntil everyone or every country has the ability and the reach for every child to be vaccinated, the vulnerability to have outbreaks, epidemics and potentially pandemics is always imminent,\u201d he said. In April 2023, WHO and UNICEF partnered with organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to launch The Big Catch Up initiative in response to declining levels of vaccine coverage after the pandemic. The effort aims to boost childhood immunizations and fill gaps between pre- and post-pandemic work, according to the partnership. Achieving these goals and aiming for those outlined in Immunization Agenda 2030 will require collaboration and investment in innovation, according to the IA2030 Partnership Council. \u201cThe future is likely to be a future where we\u2019ll have many vaccines that are able to prevent preventable diseases,\u201d Lemango said. \u201cImmunization stands as one of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/health/immunization-rates-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_science_ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white", "text": "During the Cretaceous Period, a genus of sharks roamed the sea with rows of unusual teeth. Mostly large and rounded, these chompers were not meant to slice through their prey, but to grind and crush shelled creatures. However, since the sharks\u2019 presence in the fossil record has mostly consisted of isolated teeth, scientists have been left to speculate on what the rest of this ancient predator looked like since its\u00a0discovery in the 18th century. Now, remains uncovered from limestone quarries in northeastern Mexico are finally giving researchers a clearer idea of the shark\u2019s appearance, including one fossil that shows almost all skeletal elements and an outline of the specimen\u2019s soft-tissue body. The find also reveals where the genus, known as Ptychodus, sat on the shark evolutionary tree, and other previously unknown traits of this \u201clong-standing enigma,\u201d according to a study published in April in the journal\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. \u201cThe finding of the skeletal remains in Mexico not only allow us to unite these teeth that have been searching for a long time for a skeleton, but also allow us as scientists to revise our previous hypotheses regarding its biology and relationships and see what we got right and what we got wrong,\u201d said study coauthor\u00a0Dr. Eduardo Villalobos Segura, an assistant professor in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna, Austria, in an email. The discovery also provides insight into the evolutionary history of sharks found in our oceans today, experts say. Ancient relative of the great white shark Most species of Ptychodus lived between 100 and 80 million years ago during the\u00a0late Cretaceous period. The deposits in which the fossils were discovered \u2014 in Nuevo Le\u00f3n near the municipality of Vallecillo \u2014 date back to\u00a0approximately 93.9 to 91.85 million\u00a0years ago, Villalobos Segura said. Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage, they do not fossilize well, typically leaving archaeologists only teeth and few skeletal remains to find. But evidence suggests the\u00a0Nuevo Le\u00f3n fossils ended up in mostly stagnant conditions that would have allowed for an oxygen-deficient zone, resulting in the preservation of the soft skeletons, Villalobos Segura said. In the study, the researchers analyzed six fossils found at the site, including the complete specimen. Three other fossils were almost complete, and two were incomplete. With these remains, the study authors determined that Ptychodus belonged to the order of sharks known as Lamniformes, or mackerel sharks, the same group that the extinct\u00a0Otodus megalodon\u00a0and the modern great white shark belong to. Lamniformes also includes the modern species of megamouth, sand, goblin and basking sharks,\u00a0among others. \u201cPresent-day\u00a0sharks represent just a vanishingly minimal portion of the astonishing biodiversity that occurred throughout their entire evolutionary history (spanning almost 400 million years) \u2026 studying fossil\u00a0sharks is crucial to understand fully the evolutionary phenomena related to current groups,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Manuel Amadori, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of paleontology at the University of Vienna in Austria, in an email. The existence of mackerel sharks with crushing teeth was unknown until now, Amadori said. \u201cThere is still much more to discover, but we can say that we have taken another important step forward in understanding the complex evolutionary history of mackerel sharks,\u201d he added. The outline of the body, which revealed the shark\u2019s shape and fin location, also provides evidence that the prehistoric fish was not just a bottom-dweller as previously believed, but instead, a fast-swimming predator that might have hunted and eaten sea turtles and large ammonites instead of only eating mollusks found on the ocean floor, according to the study authors. Although the shark\u2019s exact diet is still unknown, the researchers suggest that this revised hypothesis about what it ate could be a hint at the cause of Ptychodus\u2019 extinction, since it puts the shark in competition with other Late Cretaceous marine predators with similar diets. \u201cWithout a complete specimen (hard evidence), what was known about Ptychodus beyond the teeth was largely scientific guesswork,\u201d said Michael Everhart, an adjunct curator of paleontology at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas, and an expert on\u00a0Late Cretaceous marine fossils, in an email. He was not involved in the study. \u201cThe new specimens answer questions that go back 180+ years to the 1830s when\u00a0Louis Agassiz\u00a0(an early renowned scientist and paleontologist)\u00a0first coined the name Ptychodus,\u201d which means rugous or\u00a0wrinkled tooth, Everhart added. Massive shell-crushing sharks The findings also suggested that the largest species of Ptychodus may have been slightly smaller than previously thought, reaching a maximum length of 9.7 meters (nearly 32 feet). Previous estimates of a species known as Ptychodus mortoni put it at 11.2 meters (nearly 37 feet), but the revised size is still larger than modern apex shark predators, the authors note in the study. Great whites today reach up to\u00a06 meters (20 feet)\u00a0in length. There are modern shell-crushing species, the largest being the Zebra shark, which reaches a maximum length of a little over 3.5 meters (12 feet) \u2014 not near as gigantic as Ptychodus. \u201cThe crushing teeth together with the gigantic size make Ptychodus a very unique shark,\u201d Amadori said. \u201c(In the fossil record) some teeth are massive, polygonal and almost flat, while others have strange, rounded protuberances or pointed cusps on the top surface. All these were joined together to form massive tooth plates, which this predator of the past could have used to crush almost anything it encountered.\u201d A new fossil revealing the complete side view of Ptychodus measured nearly 1.5 meters (about 5 feet) in length, suggesting it was from was of a much smaller shark. This could be due to the remains belonging to a younger shark, or because the Ptychodus genus included various species of different sizes, Villalobos Segura said. According to the nonprofit Mindat.org database, there are 22 species of Ptychodus currently known. Most species and individuals of Ptychodus were likely smaller than the largest Ptychodus mortoni specimen discovered, but there could also be the possibility of larger species yet to be found, Everhart said. Often, researchers can tell apart the different species of Ptychodus by varying features in the teeth, but the study authors were unable to identify which\u00a0species of Ptychodus\u00a0the six fossils studied belonged to due to the teeth being too worn down, Villalobos Segura said. The researchers said they hope future research reveals more about the ancient shark, including its diet and its role in past marine food chains and ecosystems. \u201c(The April study) is a comprehensive review of some remarkably complete fossils of the strange Cretaceous shark, Ptychodus,\u201d said Dr. Bretton Kent, an emeritus principal lecturer in the department of entomology at the University of Maryland, who has\u00a0studied and lectured\u00a0on the diversification of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). He was not involved in the study. \u201cOur present world can act like a set of blinders, limiting the scope of possible lifestyles we can envision for extinct animals. \u2026 Modern durophagous sharks (that consume hard-shelled organisms) are demersal, feeding on or near the bottom. And their bodies are frequently small and not particularly streamlined. So a gigantic, streamlined, high speed durophage that was much larger than a modern great white shark is quite remarkable,\u201d Kent added, in an email.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/science/ancient-shark-fossil-ptychodus-great-white/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_health_long-covid-risk", "text": "With a summer wave of Covid-19 infections sweeping the country, a timely new study has looked at the risk of getting long Covid and whether those odds have changed over time. It found that the likelihood of developing long Covid has dropped since the start of the pandemic but remains substantial, especially for people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against the coronavirus. About 7% of American adults, roughly 18 million people, have ever had long Covid, according to an analysis by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that was published in June.\u00a0Harvard economist David Cutler estimated in 2022 that the total cost of long Covid to the nation was $3.7 trillion, or 17% of the country\u2019s pre-Covid gross domestic product. The new study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggests that the human and financial toll will only grow.\u00a0The investigation leaned on computers and advanced machine learning to sift through the data in millions of medical records maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis and the VA Health System set out to find people who caught Covid over different points in the pandemic \u2013 before vaccines were available, during the period when the Delta variant was dominating transmission and after the Omicron family of variants entered the picture \u2013 to see whether the risk of lingering symptoms related to long Covid had changed. They also considered vaccination status. People were considered vaccinated if they\u2019d had at least their initial series of shots and unvaccinated if they had not. The study included more than 441,000 people who caught Covid-19 between March 2020 and the end of January 2022 and who lived at least 30 days after infection. Their records were compared with those of more than 4.7 million people who didn\u2019t catch Covid but who were seen at the VA for other reasons over the same time period. The researchers found that in the first year, when the ancestral coronavirus strain was circulating and there was little immunity against the virus, 1 out of every 10 people who caught Covid went on to have symptoms consistent with long Covid. Symptoms were counted across 10 disease categories as part of long Covid if they were new and developed between 30 days and a year after an initial Covid infection. Vaccines were a game-changer, cutting the risk of long Covid by half during the Delta wave, which struck in the summer of 2021. The risk remained high during Delta for people who were not vaccinated, however. Roughly 10% continued to have symptoms that lingered after their initial infection. During Omicron, which started after Thanksgiving in 2021, 3.5% of people who were vaccinated went on to develop long Covid after the acute phase of infection, while 7.7% of people who were unvaccinated did. The study has some limitations.\u00a0People treated at the VA are mostly White men, so the study population isn\u2019t as diverse as the general population, and its findings may not apply to everyone. For example, a recent study found that nearly 1 in 10 people who get Covid-19 for the first time while pregnant will go on to develop long Covid, an incidence that may be higher than in the general population. The new study doesn\u2019t account for possible differences in people who stopped after their primary series of Covid-19 vaccines and those who went on to get recommended boosters to keep their immunity up to date as the virus mutated over time. It also doesn\u2019t consider the immunity that people might develop after infection and reinfection, although that\u2019s a question senior study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, who is chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, said he is looking into as a follow-up. Al-Aly estimates that nearly three-quarters of the drop in long Covid risk since the early days of the pandemic can be attributed to vaccines. Although the cause or causes of long Covid symptoms aren\u2019t completely understood, there\u2019s some evidence that people with long Covid continue to have active virus hiding out in their bodies long after their initial infections. \u201cVaccines actually help your immune system to get rid of the virus,\u201d Al-Aly said. \u201cThey help the immune system suppress the viral load and clear the virus faster.\u201d The importance of vaccination is a key takeaway from the study, said Dr. Hector Bonilla, who is co-director of Stanford\u2019s Post-Acute Covid-19 Syndrome Clinic. Bonilla said that when Covid vaccines first became available, most people were eager to get vaccinated, and doctors saw a large drop in the number of new patients coming to them with lingering symptoms. Now, instead of a flood, they have more of a steady influx of new patients at his clinic, some of whom develop long Covid after a second or third infection. \u201cLong Covid is a bad illness,\u201d Bonilla said. And many people are caught off-guard when they experience it. But at this point, most have made their minds up about whether to stay up-to-date with their shots. He says more people need to understand that vaccination is a critical way to lower long Covid risk. \u201cVaccination is still a very important piece to prevent long Covid symptoms,\u201d Bonilla said. After the impact of vaccination, the study says, the other 30% of the drop in risk over time is probably to due to changes in the virus itself. \u201cThe virus is changing, is evolving, and it has, even among unvaccinated people, led to less risk of long Covid-19 over time than the original or the very early era of the pandemic,\u201d Al-Aly said. So according to the latest data, about 3 people out of 100 who are vaccinated with at least their primary series and catch Covid-19 now will go on to have long Covid, Al-Aly said. That\u2019s important progress but still amounts to a large number of people living with disability and poor health. Experts who were not involved in the study agree that 3.5% means the risk of long Covid is still substantial and serious. \u201cLarge numbers of new infections and reinfections are still translating into a huge number of persons with long Covid,\u201d Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University who treats people with long Covid, said in an email. \u201cWhile numbers have dropped from the early days of the pandemic, we are still seeing new patients with long Covid that developed after a recent infection,\u201d he added. Al-Aly said this study and others underscore the need for more funding for coordinated and continuing care for long Covid patients as well as the need for more urgency in the search for treatments. \u201cI don\u2019t think the US is doing enough to address this problem,\u201d Al-Aly said. \u201cI understand the desire to move on and put it all behind us, but the fact is, there are literally millions of people who are suffering from long Covid, and then even with the decline in number, there will continue to be millions more. \u201cThere is really no plan to tackle this issue, and that cannot be.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/health/long-covid-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_health_confidence-success-anxiety-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Everyone has encountered them: people who always appear to know what they are doing. They gladly take control of a situation, express their opinions as if they were established facts or plunge into a project believing they are going to succeed \u2014 with or without the required experience. What magic dust was sprinkled on their breakfast cereal to give them this superpower? \u201cConfidence \u2014 it is probably the most important resource in human well-being and human performance, I believe,\u201d neuroscientist and psychologist Ian Robertson told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast Chasing Life. Robertson is a professor emeritus of psychology and the codirector of the Global Brain Health Institute at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and the T. Boone Pickens Distinguished Chair\u00a0at the Center for BrainHealth at the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cConfidence is a belief with two strands to it,\u201d said Robertson, the author of \u201cHow Confidence Works: The New Science of Self-Belief.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the belief you can do something, and it\u2019s the belief that if you do that thing, you will get a reward or get an outcome you desire.\u201d When you feel confident, you are more likely to succeed because confidence activates brain circuits that produce an elevated mood, lower anxiety and sharper thinking \u2014 all of which raise the odds of success, Robertson said. These are the same brain circuits that get activated when you do succeed. So whether you have confidence or succeed, even at a small task, it leads to success and then even more confidence. \u201cThe greatest source of success is success,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd success, like confidence, acts like compound interest: It\u2019s exponential. A little bit grows steadily.\u201d You can listen to the full episode here. If confidence is on one end of the spectrum, anxiety is at the other, Robertson said. \u201cIf you lack confidence, if you don\u2019t think you can do that thing, then that will generate anxiety because of the prospect of failure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe greatest source of anxiety is the fear of the negative evaluation of other people, and almost all anxiety has to do with other people.\u201d Additionally, anxiety activates circuits that disrupt \u201cthe fluid synchronization of different brain regions that are critical for elite or top performance,\u201d he noted. Research shows\u00a0that people who are chronically anxious do less of everything, Robertson said. \u201cThey do less \u2026 socially, they do less in work, they do less in hobbies and interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because their brains are primed into a threat mindset, where they\u2019re anticipating and focusing their attention on potential negative outcomes and threat. And that inhibits those systems of the brain that do the opposite with confidence.\u201d For example, Robertson said, take two 5-year-old girls: They are equally intelligent and capable, but one has slightly more confidence than the other. \u201cThat slight difference in confidence will mean that that little girl is more likely to try something new. A tiny thing: Ask a question, (be) less frightened to make a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that will result more likely in a small success. That means she\u2019s then more likely to do the next step. And by the time these two girls are 25, there\u2019s a yawning gap in their achievement and their well-being because of the exponential nature of the mathematics of confidence.\u201d All is not lost if you were not born brimming with confidence. Robertson has five tips for building up confidence, even under daunting circumstances. Take action Taking steps to do something and then doing it (no matter how shaky you feel) will result in a burst of confidence. \u201cConfidence is linked to the action systems of the brain,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cThe great Persian poet Rumi said the road only appears with the first step. And people who lack confidence and have anxiety tend to hold back from taking action because they see \u2018threat.\u2019\u201d Taking action, in spite of feeling anxious, is very important for building confidence, Roberston said. \u00a0 Choose your focus carefully What you pay attention to determines your emotional state, so pick wisely, Robertson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re giving a talk to a group of people and there\u2019s a couple of people on their phones or frowning, your attention will lock on to them because \u2026 that\u2019s what we do when we feel under threat,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHowever, if you deliberately choose to pay attention to the majority of people, or to one person who is looking interested in the front row, who is smiling \u2026 you will feed your brain with positive thoughts and images that will help you remember past successes rather than past failures.\u201d He said that being intentional in this way will not only reduce your anxiety and decrease the effort you have to put into the task, it\u00a0will also build up your confidence. Adopt a growth mindset Your attitude toward yourself and your abilities can make a difference. \u201cYou have to believe that change is possible,\u201d Robertson said. People with a \u201cgrowth\u201d mindset believe that with effort you can learn abilities and cultivate talents; conversely, those with a \u201cfixed\u201d mindset believe talents and abilities are innate \u2014 you either have them or you don\u2019t. \u201cIf you have a fixed mindset \u2014 that is, you believe that your abilities or your emotions are determined by genetics or inheritance \u2014 then you\u2019re not going to engage in \u2026 the slow ups and downs that learning entails,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cYou can learn to be more confident \u2014 but not if you cripple yourself with a fixed mindset.\u201d Fixed theories about yourself are \u201calways wrong\u201d because the human brain is enormously plastic at all ages, he explained. Deal with your anxiety Anxiety is corrosive to confidence, so reframe anxiety as excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to control anxiety by not becoming frightened of it and not treating it as some alien force coming, but rather seeing it as a form of energy that you can harness,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIn fact, the bodily and brain symptoms of anxiety are identical to those of excitement.\u201d Robertson recommends that if faced with a situation that makes you feel anxious, such as a difficult conversation or an interview, adopt a \u201cchallenge\u201d mindset. \u201cYou can actually change your frame of mind to one of \u2018Oh, can I perform here?\u2019 versus \u2018Oh, terrible things are going to happen,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can help yourself do that by the words you say to yourself: \u2018I am excited.\u2019\u201d Robertson said that doing so doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to feel nervous, but by using language, you are harnessing a form of energy. Affirm your values Define yourself and what you stand for, he said. \u201cBecause who you are as a person is grounded in what you stand for and what\u2019s important to you, what your values are,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd if you can just take a few seconds to even write down what your values are and why they\u2019re important to you and what they mean to you, the evidence shows that your brain will be then more resilient and protected against the fear of criticism, of humiliation, of failure.\u201d In other words, Robertson said, you will be protected from the destructive anxiety that eats away at confidence. We hope these five tips help you build up confidence. Listen to the full episode here.

{"id": "2024_06_21_science_strawberry-full-moon-june-scn", "text": "Despite its name, June\u2019s full moon will not look like a strawberry. But the bright orb could still turn heads Friday night with an appearance that is bigger and more colorful than the average moon. The full moon \u2014 which will reach the crest of its fullness\u00a0at 9:08\u00a0p.m. ET Friday\u00a0\u2014 comes one day after the\u00a0summer solstice, the day of the year when the sun appears the highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. Since a full moon is opposite the sun, this strawberry moon will shine lower in the sky than usual, according to\u00a0NASA. Because of this \u201clower than average path across the sky,\u201d the full moon could have an \u201corange- or amber-colored appearance, for the same reason sunsets appear orange or reddish,\u201d said Preston Dyches, a science communicator with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. Dyches said the effect is the result of the moon\u2019s reflected light having to travel a longer distance throughout Earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering away most blue wavelengths (which are shorter than red wavelengths). Native American tribes across North America gave the strawberry moon its name to mark the in-season ripeness of strawberries, according to\u00a0The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The moon\u2019s low placement in the sky could also cause the orb to appear bigger than usual, according to\u00a0NASA,\u00a0due to an effect dubbed the moon illusion. Scientists don\u2019t really know why this optical illusion happens, but it\u2019s believed to be a combination of how our brain processes visual information and the moon\u2019s size in comparison with smaller objects near the horizon, such as trees or the roofs of houses. For optimal viewing, Dyches recommends looking when the moon is rising or setting to see the effects of the moon illusion. No equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features, according to\u00a0NASA\u2019s Moon Viewing Guide. \u201cWhenever something beautiful about the natural world can be experienced from your doorstep, it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time,\u201d Dyches said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to marvel at the sight of another giant world. \u2026 I like to gaze up and think of it as a place people will live and work someday.\u201d How to see the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019 in the night sky Because the moon appears full for three days a month surrounding its peak, the strawberry moon will be visible to almost everyone worldwide. However, it will be more difficult to observe for those farther north, such as in Alaska or Denmark, where the low-traversing moon will only briefly rise above the horizon, Dyches said. Besides the full moon, those in the Northern Hemisphere can spot the \u201cSummer Triangle,\u201d an arrangement of three bright stars whose presence in the sky symbolizes summertime in the north, said Dyches, who also produces the space agency\u2019s monthly sky-watching highlights video called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up.\u201d To find the triangular pattern, it is easiest to look for the brightest of the three stars, Vega, which will be near the east in the sky, according to EarthSky. The second brightest, Altair, will be to the lower right, and the star Deneb, to the lower left of Vega, will finish off the sides of the triangle. Those away from bright city lights can spot the center of the Milky Way as a \u201chazy band of dim clouds arching across the sky,\u201d and the constellation Scorpius can be seen as it \u201cpoints the way to the galaxy\u2019s core,\u201d Dyches added. Remaining moons of 2024 There are six more full moons set to shine bright in the sky this year,\u00a0according to EarthSky. Here are the remaining full moons of 2024 and their peak dates: July 21: Buck moon August 19: Sturgeon moon September 17: Harvest moon October 17: Hunter\u2019s moon November 15: Beaver moon December 15: Cold moon", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/science/strawberry-full-moon-june-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}

However, those looking to incorporate more veggies into their diet may be overlooking one in particular. Eating three servings of baby carrots a week can give a significant boost of important nutrients found in the\u00a0orange root vegetables, according to a new unpublished study presented June 30 in Chicago at\u00a0Nutrition 2024,\u00a0the annual meeting of the\u00a0American Society for Nutrition. Surveys found separately in 2015 and 2019 that only\u00a0about 1 in 10 American adults ate the recommended 2 to 3 cups of vegetables daily, according to a 2022 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0report\u00a0on fruit and vegetable intake. That statistic inspired lead study author Mary Harper Simmons and her colleagues to investigate a simple solution that could increase a person\u2019s weekly vegetable intake. \u201c(Baby carrots) are grab and go, great with things like ranch, hummus \u2014 I\u2019ve even seen people dip them in peanut butter \u2014 some people like them plain,\u201d said Simmons, a graduate student in nutrition at Samford University in Alabama. \u201cI would really like to show people that improving your health can be (done) with small simple changes. \u2026 It does not have to be one drastic change overnight.\u201d For the study, one serving of baby carrots \u2014 chopped into smaller pieces and commonly sold at grocery stores \u2014 was around eight to 12 carrots, the equivalent of 100 grams or half a cup, Simmons added. The unpublished study looked at 60 young adults who were either assigned to eat the servings of carrots three times a week, eat no carrots and instead take a multivitamin supplement, consume a combination of the carrots and the multivitamin, or consume neither the carrots or supplement as a control group. After four weeks, the researchers found those who ate the carrots had a 10.8% increase in carotenoids in their skin, natural antioxidants found to have\u00a0health benefits, such as preventing inflammation and promoting heart health, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Additionally, the researchers found those who only took the multivitamin (containing the same carotenoid found in carrots) did not see any changes in carotenoid levels. But those who consumed the carrots and the supplement saw the most benefits and increased their skin carotenoids by 21.6%. \u201cPeople might think, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m getting a multivitamin supplement, (that should be enough),\u2019 but that alone did not increase the carotenoid accumulation. It was a combination that seemed to increase it,\u201d said Dr. Suresh Mathews, the principal investigator for the new study and a professor and chair of Samford\u2019s department of nutrition and dietetics. \u201cThe \u2018food first\u2019\u00a0philosophy always works. But for populations that may be unable to just do only foods or are limited, the combination of the food and the supplements seems to have an even bigger effect in this case,\u201d he added. The benefits of eating carrots and other vegetables \u201cHigh vegetable intake is associated with all kinds of positive health effects \u2014 the risk of all kinds of chronic diseases are lowered with increased fruit and vegetable consumption,\u201d said Dr. Sander Kersten, the director of the division of nutritional sciences and Schleifer Family Professor\u00a0at Cornell University, who was not involved in the new study. Eating vegetables can protect against heart disease, some cancers, diabetes and obesity,\u00a0according to the CDC. But carrots and other orange and red-toned vegetables such as squash and sweet potatoes are unique in that they\u2019re high in beta-carotene, the carotenoid that the body converts into vitamin A, Kersten said. Dark leafy greens, such as spinach and kale, are also high in beta-carotene, he added. Vitamin A is important for keeping your heart, lungs and other organs healthy and also for supporting various bodily functions, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health. Vitamin A deficiency is not common in the United States,\u00a0but people should still look to eat fruits and vegetables to reap the benefits of the natural low-calorie, high-in-fiber foods, Kersten said. Young adults eating vegetables While a reminder to include vegetables in a healthy diet is good for everyone, Simmons said the message is particularly important when it comes to young adults. According to the\u00a02022 CDC report, around 7% of adults\u00a0ages 18 to 30 eat the recommended amount of vegetables, while a 2023\u00a0National College Health Assessment\u00a0from the American College Health Association found that about 1 in 4 college students surveyed said they ate three or more servings of vegetables per day. \u201cYou hear the thing we tell kids, \u2018Eat the rainbow,\u2019 and I feel like for any age that really does stand,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt is good to have a variety of colors on your plate, and if not every single time you eat, just having a variety throughout your day and throughout your week is definitely very beneficial to getting all those key nutrients that our body needs to function.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/health/carrots-vegetables-carotenoids-vitamins-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_health_deli-meat-listeria-outbreak", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning Friday about a deadly multistate listeria outbreak connected to deli meat. Two people have died, the agency said in an investigation notice, and at least 28 have had to be hospitalized. However, the CDC says the true number of people who are sick is probably higher than what\u2019s been reported because some may have had a milder form of the illness and not been tested for listeria. There\u2019s also a lag time between when an illness happens and when scientists can connect it with an ongoing investigation. Seven illnesses have been reported in New York; six in Maryland; two each in Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey and Virginia; and one each in Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The deaths were reported in Illinois and New Jersey. Of the 18 people whom state and local public health experts were able to interview, 16 reported eating meats sliced at a deli in the month before they got sick. There are no reports of people getting sick after eating packaged deli meat. It\u2019s not exactly clear what meat is to blame for the listeria in this outbreak, the CDC says. The CDC and the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service are investigating, but no recalls have been issued. Most people who were sick reported eating turkey or liverwurst, and some reported eating ham. The meat came from a variety of grocery store delis. Tests using DNA fingerprinting showed that the bacteria from sick people was genetically similar, suggesting that they probably caught the bacteria from the same food. The timeline of this outbreak stretches over several months, the CDC said. The first person got sick at the end of May, and the most recent case reported being sick on July 5. Listeria bacteria can cause listeriosis, the\u00a0third leading cause\u00a0of death from foodborne illness in the United States. Symptoms usually include fever, muscle aches and fatigue. Infection may also cause a headache, a stiff neck, confusion or seizures. Pregnant people may have pregnancy loss or premature birth. Listeria can spread easily at delis, the CDC says, transferring from equipment to surfaces to hands and food. Refrigeration does not kill the bacteria, but heat can. People who are pregnant, those who are 65 and older, and those with weakened immune systems are advised to avoid eating deli meat unless it\u2019s been heated until it steams or reaches an internal temperature of 165 F. If you\u2019ve had sliced deli meat at home, clean the refrigerator and any containers or surfaces that may have come into contact with it. Anyone who develops symptoms of listeriosis should get medical care right away. The CDC is also encouraging people who get sick with listeria to work with local public health officials, who may get in touch to find out what they ate in the past month and may ask for receipts or leftover food to help pinpoint the root of the outbreak.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/health/deli-meat-listeria-outbreak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_mediterranean-diet-children-cardiometabolic-health-wellness", "text": "The Mediterranean diet has been linked to many health benefits for adults. Now, a new study suggests it could be\u00a0beneficial to children\u2019s heart health\u00a0as well. An analysis of nine earlier studies including 577 participants from the ages of 3 to 18 has found incorporating the Mediterranean diet for at least eight weeks had a significant association with lowering blood pressure and total cholesterol, according to the study published Friday in the\u00a0journal JAMA Network Open. The research further supports that incorporating healthy dietary habits early in life can help prevent cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders, such as high blood pressure and\u00a0diabetes, which often originate in childhood, researchers say. \u201cEarly dietary habits significantly influence long-term health outcomes,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Jos\u00e9 Francisco L\u00f3pez-Gil, a senior researcher with One Health Research Group at the University of the Americas in Quito, Ecuador, in an email. \u201cThe key takeaway for parents is the importance of promoting a diet rich in whole foods and healthy fats to optimize their children\u2019s health and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.\u201d Knowing the benefits the Mediterranean diet has for adults\u2019 cardiometabolic health, the findings are not surprising but provide further emphasis on the importance of having a diet of\u00a0unprocessed foods\u00a0such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats and fish for all stages of life, said Dr. Stuart Berger, division head of pediatric cardiology at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago. Berger was not involved with the study. Here\u2019s how parents and guardians could help their children benefit from the Mediterranean eating plan, according to experts. Should kids eat the Mediterranean diet? The\u00a0Mediterranean diet\u00a0is a way of eating that includes plant-based cooking with an emphasis on healthy fats. Fruits, vegetables, beans, seeds, nuts, whole grains, lean meats and fish are all contributors to the\u00a0dietary plan. Not every child needs to adopt a Mediterranean diet, but it is important to increase \u201creal foods\u201d in children\u2019s diets and decrease highly processed foods that have added sugars and sodium, said Dr. Natalie Muth, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, who was not involved with the research. \u201cWe know that calories from ultraprocessed foods\u00a0make up about 70%\u00a0of a typical teenager\u2019s intake. Any change that can lower intake of things like chips, cookies, and sodas and increase intake of fruits and vegetables is a big win,\u201d said Muth, a\u00a0pediatrician and registered dietitian at the WELL Clinic at Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group in San Diego, in an email. But it is always important to keep in mind a child\u2019s preferences and to incorporate cultural traditions into any guidance around food choices, Muth added. For those looking to shift to the Mediterranean eating plan, following age-appropriate dietary plans and exercise recommended by a child\u2019s pediatrician is also key, said Berger, who is a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Gathering\u00a0together as a family over a meal as a way to connect also plays a major role\u00a0in the Mediterranean diet,\u00a0said Dr. Tamara Hannon, director of the clinical pediatric diabetes program at Riley Hospital for Children\u00a0at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis. \u201cParents need to lead by example by eating using this pattern, offering structured meals and snacks (scheduled), and exercising daily,\u201d she added in an email. Hannon, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, was not involved with the research. Hannon also recommends parents and guardians limit their children\u2019s eating between structured meals and snacks as well as eliminating sugary beverages and juices to improve blood glucose and weight management. Future research on improving children\u2019s heart health The authors of the new report found a variation in results across the earlier studies analyzed, which can be attributed to the differing factors of diet and physical activity each study displayed. Despite the variations, the Mediterranean diet consistently improved\u00a0blood pressure levels and\u00a0lipid profiles, L\u00f3pez-Gil said, which can lower the risk of cardiometabolic problems later in life such as heart attacks, strokes and diabetes. The researchers were surprised they didn\u2019t find evidence of any effects on glucose and insulin levels, L\u00f3pez-Gil said. The impact the Mediterranean diet has on these health factors could be less pronounced, or could require a longer time frame to have an effect, he added. The study looked at the results of kids adopting the dietary plan from eight to 40 weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to do more studies on kids in particular,\u201d Berger said, \u201cbut reviewing these studies suggest the \u2026 beneficial effects of the so-called Mediterranean diet and everything associated with it.\u201d Further research should include larger sample sizes and more diverse populations as well as longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of the Mediterranean diet on kids\u2019 cardiometabolic health, L\u00f3pez-Gil said. \u201cThe growing research shows the value (in the Mediterranean diet) to be the same for children and adolescents (as in adults),\u201d Muth said. \u201cOne of the most impactful steps a parent can take to help improve kids\u2019 nutrition is to commit to regular family meals and try to prepare foods at home, as often as possible.\u00a0The more kids are exposed to fruits, vegetables, and fish, the more likely they will try them and like them eventually.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/mediterranean-diet-children-cardiometabolic-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_health_sex-gender-child-brain", "text": "Sex and gender are often conflated or equated in everyday conversations, and most American adults believe a person\u2019s gender is determined by sex assigned at birth. But a new study of nearly 5,000 9- and 10-year-olds found that sex and gender map onto largely distinct parts of the brain. The research gives a first insight into how sex and gender may have \u201cmeasurable and unique influences\u201d on the brain, study authors said, just as other experiences have been shown to shape the brain. \u201cMoving forward, we really need to consider both sexes and genders separately if we better want to understand the brain,\u201d said Dr. Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and the Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, California, and a co-author of the study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances. The researchers on the new study defined sex as what was assigned to the child at birth. In the US, clinicians make this assignment based on genitalia. Most people are assigned either female or male, according to the research; the rest are intersex, a person whose sexual or reproductive anatomy doesn\u2019t fit this male/female binary. The researchers defined gender as an individual\u2019s attitude, feelings and behaviors, as well as socially constructed roles. They noted specifically that gender is not binary, meaning not all people identify as either female or male. Both sex and gender are a core part of human experience. They\u2019re key to how people perceive others and how they understand themselves. Both can influence behavior as well as health, the study authors say. The researchers looked at brain imaging data from 4,757 children in the United States, 2,315 assigned female at birth and 2,442 assigned male at birth, who were ages 9 and 10 and were a subset of the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. Over a period of 10 years, the children in the ABCD study underwent comprehensive neuroimaging, behavioral, developmental and psychiatric assessments. Beyond tests such as MRIs, the scientists did surveys of the children and their parents that were focused on gender, both at the beginning of the research and then a year later. The children were asked about how they expressed their gender and how they felt about it. The parents were asked about a child\u2019s sex-typed behavior during play and whether the child had any gender dysphoria, a term that mental health professionals use to describe clinically significant distress felt because a person\u2019s sense of their gender does not match their sex the assigned at birth. Parents were a key part of the study, said study co-author Dr. Dani S. Bassett, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania with appointments in the Departments of Bioengineering, Electrical & Systems Engineering, Physics & Astronomy, Neurology, and Psychiatry. \u201cWhen kids have a particular kind of gender behavior or gender expression, that will influence how their parents and also other caregivers and friends and family \u2026 et cetera interact with them,\u201d Bassett said. Information about a parent\u2019s perception of a child\u2019s gender gives researchers a better sense of the child\u2019s social environment and how it may affect their brain development. The authors used a kind of artificial intelligence called machine learning that built a model that could predict a child\u2019s sex and reported gender from their brain scan.  When the researchers looked the children\u2019s brain scans, the results seemed to show that sex influenced different regions of the brain that are involved in visual processing, sensory processing and motor control and some regions involved in executive function, which lets an individual organize and integrate information across time. Gender seems to influence some of the more sensory-specific networks that are associated with sex, but it also seems to have a broader influence and can be detected on different brain networks involved in executive function, including things like attention, social cognition and emotional processing. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re able to capture how gender maps onto the brain basically just tells us that gender is influencing our brain,\u201d Dhamala said. The structure of the human brain can be shaped by expertise and experiences. Research on London taxi drivers \u2014 who must take extensive tests to show that they can navigate the city\u2019s streets without maps or GPS \u2014 seems to show that they have significantly larger posterior hippocampi, the part of the brain related to spatial memory and navigation, than in people who aren\u2019t taxi drivers. \u201cSimilarly, as individuals and as humans, we are experts about ourselves and our genders. So it makes sense that gender will also be mapped within our brains,\u201d Dhamala said. What the new study cannot do is predict what gender a person may identify with beyond one limited snapshot in time captured by the scans and surveys. Gender, the authors note, is not something that is necessarily static, and a person\u2019s understanding of their gender can change throughout their lifetime. The study also can\u2019t determine what things in someone\u2019s environment will influence their brain function in terms of sex or gender, nor can it identify what a person\u2019s sexual orientation might be. \u201cSexual orientation is independent from gender and from sex,\u201d Bassett said, and it may be differently mapped in the brain. The researchers say they hope to someday learn more about how sex and gender interact in a person\u2019s life and how they influence one another and the brain throughout a lifetime. They also hope to see how different cultures affect a person\u2019s gender and their brain development. A 2022 poll showed that most American adults \u2014 and the vast majority of conservatives \u2014 believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. The distinction is key to gender-affirming care, medical treatment for people who identify as a gender that is different from the one they were assigned at birth. Conservative politicians have pushed for a record number of bans on such care, and nearly half of US states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care for minors. The study did not look at whether sex or gender were congruent or incongruent in any study participant. Rather, it looked at the child\u2019s binary sex and gender across self- and parent-reported measures. The study couldn\u2019t provide any specific findings if sex and gender were incongruent. \u201cGoing forward, the hope is that we can motivate other scientists to consider science and gender in their analyses in the data collections in their programs and research,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Avram Holmes, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers University. The field of neuroscience has only just begun to acknowledge and address the presence of biases and barriers to inclusivity within research, Holmes said. A fuller understanding of the way the brain works in terms of sex and gender could also have practical implications and potentially help scientists find better ways to treat people with brain-related illnesses. For instance, the study pointed to how people assigned male at birth are more likely to be diagnosed with substance use and attention deficit disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that sex and gender necessarily drive illness rates, but the cultures people are embedded in can also influence the likelihood they may or may not develop a particular illness,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cSo the types of environmental pressures a child undergoes across development could increase or decrease their risk for experiencing illness, independent of their initial brain biology.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/health/sex-gender-child-brain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}

In the United States, it\u2019s estimated that about 95% of teenagers and 40% of children between the ages of 8 and 12 use some form of social media, according to the report. \u201cThe nice thing about the family media plan is it helps families have conversations to outline what their expectations are, what their plans are with respect to media within the household and even beyond,\u201d said Task Force Co-Chair Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, assistant secretary for mental health and substance use in the US Department of Health and Human Services and leader of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In collaboration with the release of the new report, the task force also announced plans to launch new webpages online with resources, including age-based handouts for parents that pediatricians can distribute at well-check visits. \u201cChildren are often regulating and learning how to regulate emotions, and so it is important that media not be used as a replacement for looking at or processing important emotions,\u201d Delphin-Rittmon said. \u201cThis report outlines a range of suggested guidelines, and there\u2019ll be a series of ongoing resources as well.\u201d The report, spanning more than 100 pages, offers recommendations for the tech industry, guidance for clinicians and best practices for parents and caregivers \u2013 including \u201cconversation starters for families of tweens and teens\u201d \u2013 to improve the health and safety of children\u2019s experiences online. Some of the conversation starters that are outlined in the new report include: \u201cI\u2019d like us to talk about our family\u2019s approach for setting some boundaries around technology and media use. I was thinking that this is something we could work on together as I\u2019d like to include your input in these decisions.\u201d Another conversation starter is: \u201cOne aspect of social media use that is really important is protecting our privacy. Have you looked at the privacy settings on all your accounts? How are things going with those settings?\u201d Or, \u201cI sometimes have a hard time not checking my phone or feeling the need to respond to texts or emails. I\u2019m working on how to be better about my own boundaries. Let\u2019s help each other find a good balance.\u201d The report also provides a summary of the risks and benefits of social media use among young people and suggests future research into that space. \u201cPresident Biden has made addressing the youth mental health crisis a top priority. That\u2019s why we are taking steps to ensure the safety and well-being of young people when they use social media and online platforms,\u201d HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a news release Monday. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration has whole-of-government approach to protect the mental health, safety, and privacy of youth online, but it will take more than government alone to achieve results.\u201d \u2018We can do better to help young people\u2019 The Kids Online Health and Safety Task Force, under HHS, was developed last year under the Biden-Harris administration to protect and advance the health, safety and privacy of children online. The White House tasked the group with developing recommendations and reviewing the status of industry efforts to promote the health and safety of children. The new report recommends that the tech industry do more to keep children and teens safe online, such as by making privacy protections for minors the default on social media platforms, limiting \u201clikes\u201d and using data-driven methods to detect and prevent cyberbullying, among other actions. \u201cOne of our key findings was that many of the problems that young people face online are because of how technology companies design their products, and the task force report calls on industry to make design choices that will prioritize kids\u2019 wellbeing,\u201d said Task Force Co-Chair Alan Davidson, assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information and leader of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Some of those design choices include \u201cdesigning age-appropriate experiences for young people. There\u2019s a big difference between a young child and an older teenager. We need to think about the applications themselves, as there\u2019s a big difference between an education app and a gaming app, and how it approaches engagement,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe called on industry to do better around privacy protections for young people, particularly the defaults they set,\u201d he said. \u201cWe called on online services to improve systems that address bias and discrimination that young people face.\u201d Delphin-Rittmon added that, in focus groups hosted by the task force, young people have shared with her that they would like to see more protections as well. The task force\u2019s report did not speak to any specific pieces of legislation, but President Biden has called for Congress to enact legislative protections when it comes to children\u2019s online safety. So far, lawmakers have unveiled two bills to potentially address children\u2019s safety online: the Kids Online Safety Act, which would require social media platforms to restrict access to minors\u2019 personal data by default, and the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, which would set a minimum age of 13 for using social media platforms. \u201cThe bottom line is, we do think legislation is important, but there are things that industry can do today \u2013 that it should be doing \u2013 to better protect young people,\u201d Davidson said. As a parent, these conversations around online safety are personal for him. \u201cLike every parent and caregiver out there, or anybody who speaks to a family member about this, we\u2019ve definitely had challenging conversations with our children about their use of devices and their use of social media,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cIt is possible that I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m the meanest parent in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just speaks to the challenges that caregivers have today. We know that children and young people want to use these devices. They need to have them to be able to be part of their social experiences in many cases, and we can do better to help young people thrive online.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics announced Monday that it supports the task force\u2019s new report and commends the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Department of Commerce for addressing the impact of social media on the mental health of young people. \u201cTo help make the report\u2019s recommendations accessible and actionable, we\u2019ve published new resources for families and those who work with them, including conversation starters and activities to help parents and caregivers know what to say and how to begin building foundational skills,\u201d Dr. Megan Moreno, co-medical director of the SAMHSA-funded AAP Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health, said in a news release Monday. \u201cWe are pleased to be a strong partner in this work.\u201d Surgeon General warns about social media US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who is a member of the task force, has been outspoken about these social media-related concerns. Social media poses such a threat to children that it should have a warning label attached to it, according to Murthy. In June, he demanded that Congress put a warning label on social media apps, as it does with tobacco and alcohol products. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in the United States through the past several decades. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times in June. \u201cIt is time to require a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media platforms, stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA surgeon general\u2019s warning label, which requires congressional action, would regularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe.\u201d Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. In May 2023,\u00a0the Surgeon General issued an advisory\u00a0that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use,\u00a0saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. His declaration in June of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. Congress has\u00a0long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Meanwhile, several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would\u00a0prohibit children under 14 from obtaining\u00a0their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would\u00a0ban social media from using algorithms\u00a0in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/health/white-house-task-force-online-safety-kids-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_health_colorado-bird-flu-humans-confirmed", "text": "Five cases of bird flu have been identified among workers culling poultry at a farm in northeast Colorado, the state department of health said on Sunday. The commercial egg operation was impacted by H5N1 outbreaks that have also affected wild birds and dairy cows in several states. Three of the five human cases were announced Friday, and all of those have now been confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A fourth case was also confirmed, and a fifth is presumed positive based on state testing. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in a statement on Sunday that no additional test results are pending. The workers are believed to have caught the virus through direct work with infected birds. They had mild symptoms including conjunctivitis or pink eye and respiratory problems, but none of them were hospitalized, the state said Sunday. The investigation into the cases is ongoing with support of a team sent by CDC at the state\u2019s request. The CDC said Friday its risk assessment for the general public remains low. \u201cThere are no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity otherwise in Colorado or in other states affected by H5 bird flu outbreaks in cows and poultry,\u201d it said. Four people in the US had previously tested positive for bird flu in connection with the ongoing outbreak: one in Colorado, one in Texas and two in Michigan. All were workers at dairy operations. Colorado\u2019s agriculture industry has been hit hard by bird flu, with Gov. Jared Polis\u00a0declaring\u00a0a disaster emergency July 5 to ensure that the state can offer support and resources for farms in Weld County. Poultry products are still safe to eat if they have been properly handled and cooked, the Colorado health department said. The CDC advises that everyone avoid close or long exposure to sick or dead animals, animal poop or bedding. Experts also recommend against consuming unpasteurized or raw milk due to the potential for contamination. Another state finds bird flu in cattle Until the Colorado cases were announced, recent human H5N1 cases in the US had been linked to dairy cattle. On Friday, the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced that a dairy cattle herd in the state had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, raising the number of states that reported impacted herds to 13. The positive sample was collected in April, the state said, and the herd has fully recovered. It\u2019s not clear why it took the so long for the state or federal government to report the results. Since the first cattle infections were reported in late March, 157 herds have tested positive for H5N1 across 13 states.\u00a0Four states have had more than 20 herds impacted \u2014\u00a0Texas, Colorado, Michigan and Idaho\u00a0\u2014 according to the US Department of Agriculture.

{"id": "2024_07_19_health_bird-flu-colorado", "text": "A new human case of H5 highly pathogenic avian flu has been identified\u00a0in Colorado, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said Sunday that\u00a0five human cases of bird flu had been detected in poultry workers believed to have caught the bird flu virus through direct work with infected birds. The latest case is from an additional worker from this cohort. The workers had been involved in culling birds, a process used to control the spread of disease by selectively removing or killing infected animals. The six infected workers have experienced mild symptoms, including pink eye and respiratory issues, and all exposed workers have been offered antiviral medication, according to the CDC. Genetic sequencing of a sample from one of the Colorado cases shows that it\u2019s closely related to the first human case of bird flu discovered in Michigan, a sign that the virus has not experienced any changes due to antiviral resistance, according to the agency. These findings are \u201creassuring,\u201d it said Friday. A CDC field team, including epidemiologists, veterinarians, clinicians and an industrial hygienist, is assisting with Colorado\u2019s outbreak investigation. Since April, there have been 10 reported human cases of avian influenza in the US, four linked to exposure to sick dairy cows and six connected to infected poultry, according to the CDC. Friday\u2019s confirmation includes the latest case in Colorado. The virus has affected 18.32 million birds from 34 commercial flocks and 16 backyard flocks since April. The US Department of Agriculture is also reporting a growing number of infected cattle, with confirmed cases in 157 dairy cow herds across 13 states. The organizations say they are working to respond to the ongoing \u201cpublic health challenge\u201d posed by the multistate outbreak of bird flu. In part of this effort, the full sequence of the detected virus has been made available to the public so researchers in the US and around the world can analyze it.

{"id": "2024_07_16_health_988-suicide-lifeline-numbers", "text": "Two years after the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched, the service has answered over 10 million texts, calls and chats, according to new data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The lifeline, formerly a 10-digit number, transitioned to three digits in July 2022 as part of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s\u00a0strategy\u00a0to \u201caddress our national mental health crisis.\u201d Since 2022, the administration has invested over $1.5 billion in the effort, including expanding access to services for Spanish speakers, LGBTQI+ youth and young adults, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing, according to HHS. Those in crisis can reach the lifeline through a phone call, text, web chat and video chat. This year, text messages to 988 have increased 51% and calls 34% from the year before, a sign of the effects of expanded services, according to senior administration officials. Last year,\u00a0text messages through the lifeline increased 1,135%, chats answered increased 141% and calls answered increased 46%, a report from the department showed. The lifeline has made 110,000 contacts in Spanish and 475,000 with LGBTQI+ youth and young adults this year, the new report says. About 20,000 videophone contacts in American Sign Language were made, and 1.2 million calls were answered by the Veterans Crisis Line through 988\u2019s Press 1 option. \u201c988 is available to everyone,\u201d emphasized Andrea Palm, deputy secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cHaving someone on the other end of the line to listen and provide support makes a difference. It really does save lives, and that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d This year, HHS expects to roll out georouting technology to route 988 callers and texters based on their physical location versus their area code, the agency says. The move, which would follow an April\u00a0proposal\u00a0from the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to improve cell phone users\u2019 connectivity to local services and maintain additional privacy. The agency also pointed to the bolstering of a national backup system. Funneling federal funding to this system will help ensure that all contacts to 988 are able to be answered, regardless of a state\u2019s local capacity. A 911 for mental health crises In 2022, the year 988 debuted, suicide deaths reached a\u00a0record high\u00a0in the US, according to provisional\u00a0data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, the US surgeon general called for the implementation of a national prevention strategy in response to suicide rates that have been rising for decades. 988, like 911, is easy to remember. The switch to the three-digit lifeline saw an over\u00a045% increase\u00a0in overall contact volume in just the first month, according to HHS. \u201cTo remember 10 digits to call for help is not easy. That\u2019s why 911 is only three digits.\u201d said Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer at the National Alliance on Mental Illness or NAMI. \u201cTransitioning to a shorter number and a number that is focused on our wider array of mental health crises, not just suicide, opens up the door for people to reach out and be connected to the support they need.\u201d The hundreds of thousands of people who have contacted 988 in the past two years and the growth in its usage reflect the need for increased mental health services nationwide, she said. Behind the numbers Despite 988\u2019s growth, 3 in 4 Americans say they are not content with mental health treatment in this country, a July poll from the National Alliance on Mental Illness found. The NAMI/Ipsos poll also found that only 23% percent of Americans say they are familiar with 988. This is an increase from 17% in June 2023 but has not changed since October. \u201cWe need that number much higher,\u201d Wesolowski said. \u201cThis data speaks to the urgency of having awareness so people who need help can get connected to that help.\u201d However, the poll showed 72% of Americans said they are comfortable contacting the lifeline. Of those who had contacted 988 this year or whose loved one had done so, nearly 7 in 10 said they had received some or all of the help they needed. This sentiment is up 55% from June 2023, according to NAMI. HHS is prioritizing raising awareness about the lifeline and emphasizing that 988 is available not only for crises but for anytime someone needs to talk, according to senior administration officials. What happens when you contact 988 When someone calls 988, they first hear a greeting message. They are given the option to connect with specialized services and subsequently routed to a national network or local 988 Lifeline network crisis center. According to the\u00a0Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a trained crisis counselor answers the phone, listens to the caller, works to understand how the problem is affecting them, provides support and shares resources, if needed. Similarly, users can receive care through texting 988, an increasingly popular option. On a call with reporters Tuesday, Palm shared anecdotes from the progress the lifeline has made, emphasizing the real-life impact of the calls that make up this year\u2019s 988 data. \u201cA really important point are countless stories of real people whose lives have been changed forever,\u201d she said, sharing the story of Florida 988 counselor Kelly, who joined the service after losing her 18-year-old son to suicide. \u201cShe believes that if 988 had been in existence for her son, that it would have saved his life,\u201d Palm said. After the call The lifeline has reached millions in crisis since its debut, but what happens after they hang up the phone? Although the vast majority of calls do not escalate to emergency services being dispatched, users who need more help than can be provided over the phone or by chat may be contacted by local services, including mobile crisis and law enforcement teams. \u201cWe know [a police response] is not the best response for people in crisis,\u201d Wesolowski said, pointing to the need for mental health professionals to respond to cases of mental health crisis. According to senior administration officials, one of the goals of the lifeline is to divert from unnecessary police response and to ensure that users are safe while providing support based on individual needs, something that may require coordination between 988 and law enforcement. Next steps for 988 According to Palm, the administration still has more work to do to reach people who need help. \u201cNot everyone can access the support they need. And in other cases, stigma prevents them from reaching out at all,\u201d she said. Studies have shown that after speaking with a trained crisis counselor, most callers feel more hopeful and less depressed, suicidal and overwhelmed. Collaboration on the federal and state level for continued support of 988 is necessary for the success of the program to continue this impact, according to Palm and senior administration officials. \u201cIn the two years since we launched 988, it\u2019s become one of the most effective first line responses that we have to help individuals who feel alone and without options,\u201d she said. \u201cMake no mistake, 988 saves lives,\u201d Neera Tanden, White House domestic policy adviser, said on Tuesday\u2019s call. \u201cAs a country, we have a moral obligation to be there for each other, to reach out to offer help for just a listening ear.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/988-suicide-lifeline-numbers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_hiit-workout-without-jumping-wellness", "text": "For the past decade, high-intensity interval training has been among the top 10 fitness trends every year, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. During a HIIT workout, you pair short bursts of intense work \u2014 generally lasting between 15 seconds and four minutes \u2014 with quick recovery periods. These cycles are repeated over a set period of time. The workouts are popular because they are quite beneficial. You can burn a lot of calories in a short period of time during a HIIT workout, which is great for time-pressed individuals. They also build muscle mass, are better at enhancing sports performance than moderate-intensity, continuous exercise, and are more enjoyable than other exercise regimens, studies have shown. A HIIT workout also has a positive effect on your executive function, or cognition, according to a July 2021 review of 24 studies published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Increased cognitive function due to HIIT workouts was even seen in young adults, a February 2020 study showed, which researchers said indicated HIIT workouts may be both an efficient and effective way of combating cognitive decline as people age. Despite all these benefits and HIIT\u2019s popularity, some people are wary of trying these workouts since they often involve various forms of jumping. Popular HIIT moves include jumping jacks, box jumps, burpees, tucks and mountain climbers. If you\u2019ve got a bum knee, poor balance or are recovering from an injury, it makes sense to be leery of jumping. But there is good news \u2014 you can do a wide variety of HIIT workouts without a single jump and still get your heart racing. How to up the intensity without jumping \u201cHigh-impact activities like jumping are often confused with high-intensity ones,\u201d said Jonathan Tylicki, a certified personal trainer based in Irvine, California. \u201cBut high-intensity workouts can be low-impact, where you\u2019re not jumping but still get the same benefits as a high-impact, high-intensity workout.\u201d High-intensity workouts use multiple muscle groups at the same time and elevate your heart rate to more than 70% of its maximum. You can calculate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220, then calculating 70% of that number to know how fast your heart should be beating. For example, a 45-year-old\u2019s maximum heart rate would be 220 minus 45, or 175 beats per minute. Seventy percent of 175 is 122.5, so your heart rate should rise above 122.5 beats per minute during the high-intensity portions of your HIIT workout. More simply, during a high-intensity exercise cycle, you should only be able to say a few words at a time because you\u2019re huffing and puffing so much. So how do you get your heart racing without jumping around? One way is through speed. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing squats, do them as fast as you can,\u201d said Pete McCall, a certified personal trainer based in Encinitas, California, and host of the \u201cAll About Fitness\u201d podcast. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to jump at the end.\u201d Good form, of course, is important. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for the rapid lengthening and shortening of muscle tissues, which is one of the benefits of jumping,\u201d McCall said. \u201cBut you can get almost the same benefit by standing in place and doing as many squats as you can in 20 seconds.\u201d Another way to up the intensity of an exercise is to use resistance bands or weights. So toss a medicine ball, Tylicki said, or use resistance bands to create extra tension against your muscle tissues. One example: Tie a band to a doorknob of a shut door, then pull or row it as quickly as you can. The traditional shoulder press is a favorite of Tylicki\u2019s for upping the intensity of a workout. He instructs his clients to use heavier weights than they normally do or use lighter weights paired with faster speed. \u201cI love showing clients how their heart rate increases while doing shoulder presses,\u201d Tylicki said. \u201cIt always takes them by surprise.\u201d Rowing machines are also a great choice for a high-intensity, low-impact workout, McCall said. \u201cSo much of your body is in motion at one time, you use more muscle mass,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no impact from the ground. I have bad arthritis in my right knee, and the rowing machine is my go-to. They\u2019re one of the best-kept secrets.\u201d But consider some easier jumping, too If you don\u2019t have a limiting injury or issue, both trainers who spoke with CNN said you should consider trying some form of jumping during your workouts, at least occasionally. \u201cThere are benefits from including impact in training,\u201d Tylicki said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways to improve bone mineral density, for example, which is important for women who are prone to osteoporosis or osteopenia.\u201d The key is to start slowly and easily. Try jumping jacks or jumping rope, which have less impact than, say, box jumps. If you want to try box jumps, start with a short box and jump up, then step down, McCall said. \u201cAnybody can jump, but landing correctly is the issue,\u201d McCall said. \u201cIf you\u2019re jumping up and down off a box, you\u2019ll risk falling when you\u2019re jumping back down. I\u2019m a big fan of jumping, but not repeated jumps in place.\u201d No matter whether you occasionally jump during a HIIT workout or always go jump-free, it\u2019s important to limit HIIT sessions to two or three times per week, with at least one rest day in between, as they are intense sessions. Also, remember that the older you are, the longer it takes your body to recover. But don\u2019t let that stop you from incorporating HIIT workouts into your weekly routine since they offer so many benefits, especially for older adults. \u201cThey really reduce the risk of diabetes as you age and combat cognitive decline,\u201d McCall said. \u201cThe biggest benefit we\u2019re seeing now with HIIT workouts is the brain.\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus\u00a0is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/hiit-workout-without-jumping-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_health_brain-care-score-depression-risk-wellness", "text": "Scientists announced in December the successful creation of the Brain Care Score, a tool for assessing dementia or stroke risk without medical procedures. That score, which also helps patients and doctors identify beneficial lifestyle changes, may now also be able to predict the odds of developing depression later in life, according to a new study. The 21-point Brain Care Score, or BCS, refers to how a person fares on 12 health-related factors regarding physical, lifestyle and social-emotional components of health. Having a higher BCS was associated with a lower risk of developing depression in \u201clate life,\u201d defined as age 60 or older, found the study published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry. \u201cThe Brain Care Score is a simple tool designed to help anyone in the world answer the question, \u2018What can I do to take better care of my brain?\u2019\u201d said study author Dr. Jonathan Rosand, cofounder of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead developer of the BCS, in a news release. \u201cThis paper provides compelling evidence that raising your BCS is not only likely to make your brain healthier and more resistant to diseases like dementia and stroke, but that it also offers the hope of protection from depression,\u201d added Rosand, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u00a0 The four physical components of the BCS are blood pressure, cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c and body mass index, while the five lifestyle factors are nutrition, alcohol consumption, aerobic activities, sleep and smoking. The three social-emotional aspects referred to relationships, stress management and meaning in life. The higher a participant\u2019s score, the lower their risk of brain disease. Up to one-third or more of people older than 60 experience late-life depression, the risk of which can be influenced by lifestyle habits, the authors said. The team used health data from more than 350,000 people who had been recruited for the UK Biobank study between 2006 and 2010 and participated in follow-up assessments three times over the next decade or so. The UK Biobank study has followed the health outcomes of more than 500,000 people generally between ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom for at least 10 years. For participants of the new study, every five-point positive difference in their BCS was associated with a 33% lower risk of late-life depression, as well as a 27% lower composite risk of late-life depression, dementia and stroke over a follow-up period of 13 years on average. \u201cPeople think of the skull as like a separating factor for the brain, (as if) the brain is like an individual thing,\u201d said Dr. Richard Isaacson, a preventive neurologist at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear, based on this study and others, that if we can stay physically active, eat a healthy diet, minimize smoking and alcohol, keep a healthy weight and stay socially engaged, there\u2019s going to be downstream benefits \u2014 not just on vascular health and dementia, but also for mental health and emotional health.\u201d The importance of lifelong brain care The authors also found a substantial link between baseline BCS and depression risk among those younger than 50 \u2014 which they considered surprising since they expected only older adults may have neurodegenerative and inflammatory changes that can lead to depression, dementia and stroke. But the association among younger adults falls in line with the life trajectory of other diseases associated with age, Isaacson said. \u201cIn our Alzheimer\u2019s prevention clinic, we\u2019ve been seeing people age 25 and up,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cThat finding is not surprising to me, because there are early life, midlife and late-life risk factors for dementia. (For) Alzheimer\u2019s disease, for example, pathology starts in the brain decades before symptoms of memory loss. If a person is 65 years old and diagnosed with dementia, that means the disease first started in their brains between the ages of 35 to 45.\u201d The process is similar for a heart attack or stroke an older adult experiences after having high cholesterol in their 30s, he added \u2014 so the findings underscore the importance of caring for your brain throughout your life. \u201cThere is still much to be learned about what pathways contribute to late-life depression, dementia and stroke,\u201d said Dr. Sanjula Singh, first author of the study and instructor at the McCance Center for Brain Health, in a news release. \u201cOur results emphasize the importance of a holistic view of the brain to further understand underlying connections between different brain diseases.\u201d If you\u2019re an older adult experiencing depression, know that being open and seeking care is critical, Isaacson said. \u201cOlder generations may have been primed to just fight through it, (thinking) it\u2019s mind over matter,\u201d Isaacson said. But that\u2019s not always the case, he added, so try to accept that you\u2019re not feeling OK and talk with your doctor about treatment options such as therapy or antidepressants. The latter could have an added benefit for your cognitive function as you age, as some early research has started to indicate that some antidepressants, such as escitalopram, may slow the accumulation of beta-amyloid-protein in the brain, Isaacson added.

{"id": "2024_07_15_health_malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli", "text": "Children in Ivory Coast received the first doses of a new, relatively cheap malaria vaccine on Monday, a step that has been hailed as a major milestone in the battle against one of the world\u2019s most deadly diseases. The R21 vaccine, developed by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India (SII), has been sent to several African countries and will also be administered in South Sudan Tuesday, the University of Oxford said in a statement sent to CNN. The vaccine costs less than $4 a dose, making it \u201crealistic to roll out in many tens of millions of doses from now on,\u201d and it has high efficacy levels of around 75%-80% in young children, Professor Adrian Hill, director\u00a0of the\u00a0Jenner Institute\u00a0at\u00a0Oxford University, who led the development of the vaccine, said in an interview with BBC Radio on Monday. Up to 500,000 child deaths could be saved every year with the widespread implementation of R21, alongside its counterpart RTS,S vaccine, according to modeling by the World Health Organization (WHO). Spread by some types of mosquitoes, malaria is preventable and curable but still killed around 608,000 people around the world in 2022, according to WHO. About 95% of those deaths occurred in Africa, where children under the age of 5 account for around 80% of all malaria deaths across the continent. The SIII has already manufactured more than 25 million doses and has committed to producing up to 100 million doses a year, a scale that allows the vaccine to remain affordable, according to the statement from the University of Oxford. There are enough doses that 250,000 children under the age of 2 will initially be vaccinated in Ivory Coast, while Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic have all authorized the vaccine, too, the university said.   R21 will be used alongside the RTS,S vaccine, which has already been delivered to more than 2 million children over a four-year pilot program in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, where it reduced all-cause mortality by 13%, according to UNICEF. Both these vaccines have been approved by the WHO and are expected to have a hugely positive impact on public health, alongside other prevention strategies like mosquito nets. Hill added that there is still \u201ca lot of work for people in-country to get set up, particularly when you\u2019re aiming to distribute millions of doses from this year.\u201d \u201cThis is a three-dose vaccine, typically (given at) five, six, seven months of age and then a booster a year later. That\u2019s not a time point that other vaccines are usually given at, so there\u2019s training required in these largely relatively low income countries.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/health/malaria-vaccine-children-ivory-coast-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_health_bird-flu-cases-extreme-heat", "text": "Searing heat may have played a role in the infections of five workers who fell ill last week while culling a large flock of chickens infected with the H5N1 virus in Colorado, health officials said Tuesday. \u201cAt the time transmission is thought to have occurred, Colorado was experiencing 104-plus-degree heat,\u201d and it was probably hotter inside the barns, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0The CDC is investigating the outbreak along with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. This made the use of personal protective equipment a challenge, Shah said. In addition, to bring down temperatures in the sweltering barns, large industrial fans were blowing, moving air as well as dust and feathers.\u00a0Feathers from infected birds are known to carry the H5N1 virus. \u201cWe understand those large fans \u2026 were moving so much air \u2026 the workers were finding it hard to maintain a good seal or a good fit either between the mask or with eye protection,\u201d Shah said. Four of the Colorado cases have been confirmed by the CDC. A fifth tested positive at a state lab and has been sent to the CDC for confirmation. The incident has quickly doubled the number of farm workers known to be infected with H5N1 virus in the United States, and it is the largest number of workers known to be infected in connection with a single farm. In 2022, a poultry worker tested positive for H5N1 in Colorado.\u00a0This year, four other farm workers have tested positive \u2014 one in Texas, two in Michigan and another in Colorado \u2014 after working with infected dairy cattle.\u00a0Cases are believed to be undercounted because farm workers are often reluctant to be tested for fear of losing work and income. Genetic analysis of the virus from one of the recent human cases involved in the poultry culling was reassuring, Shah said, because it didn\u2019t show any mutations that might indicate the virus is spreading more readily to people. Testing also showed that the virus was closely related to the strain spreading in cattle. At the state of Colorado\u2019s request, the CDC has sent a 10-person team to assist with the investigation and contact tracing in the outbreak.\u00a0Sixty people have shown symptoms consistent with bird flu, and all but five have tested negative at a state laboratory, Shah said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen strong uptake of testing across this particular farm in Colorado,\u201d he added. None of the workers was hospitalized, and many had traditional flu symptoms, including conjunctivitis or eye infections, fever, chills, coughing and sore throats.\u00a0The workers have been offered an antiviral medication and are recovering. Altogether, about 160 people are involved in the culling, or killing, of 1.8 million egg-laying chickens on the Colorado farm, which is a \u201csignificant\u201d egg-producing operation that officials didn\u2019t name.\u00a0The culling operation is expected to continue another 10 to 14 days. It is not clear how the birds became infected, but viruses isolated from the birds are closely related to the same strain that\u2019s infecting dairy cattle, said Dr. Eric Deeble, the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s acting senior adviser of the H5N1 response. The CDC maintains that the threat to the public of the H5N1 bird flu virus is low. However, farm workers are at higher risk of catching the infection, which has recently spread from domestic and wild birds to dairy cattle and other mammals. To stay safe, the CDC recommends that people working with sick or dead cattle or birds wear personal protective equipment, or PPE, which includes waterproof coveralls, a face mask, goggles or a face shield, boots, gloves and a head covering. Workers involved in the culling of the chickens in Colorado were required to wear the full uniform, but environmental conditions made it difficult to keep on. \u201cWe understand that PPE use was not optimal, particularly the masks and the eye protection,\u201d Shah said. The United Farm Workers labor union has questioned whether the CDC\u2019s recommendations are practical given the record-breaking heat enveloping much of the United States this summer.\u00a0It had called on the CDC to rethink its PPE guidance so more people could follow it. \u201cThese are people that are being asked to put their lives on the line for a virus we don\u2019t understand all that well when they have no reasonable way of protecting themselves from either the virus or from heat illness,\u201d Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers, said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re being put in an impossible position.\u201d Workers wear fluid-proof coveralls, Strater points out, which prevent sweat from cooling their bodies, making it easy to overheat.\u00a0In dirty, wet environments like a barn, masks and respirators can become clogged or soggy within minutes. The CDC said it is working to refine its PPE recommendations to account for the heat.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve sent, as part of our team, a specialist in these matters, an industrial hygienist who can help implement improved engineering controls that may make PPE use more uniform as well as more palatable,\u201d Shah said. Strater said it\u2019s time for the CDC to consider vaccinating farmworkers, as Finland is, to give them \u2013 and the general public \u2013 an added layer of protection from the virus and from the threat of another pandemic if it spreads. \u201cThey need to be prioritized, not just because it\u2019s moral to protect their lives by prioritizing vaccination, but it\u2019s a relatively small group of people, when you think about the sort of firewall they\u2019re creating around the rest of the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a huge number of people we need to be protecting. These are people who are on the front lines and who are so intimately exposed.\u201d Although US health officials have stressed that they have no plans to distribute an H5N1 vaccine, they are getting several candidates ready to be deployed in case the virus becomes more dangerous. In May, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was ordering 4.8 million doses of H5N1 vaccine to be manufactured from bulk ingredients in the country\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile. Those doses are expected to be ready by the end of the month. In early July, HHS announced that it had paid Moderna $176 million to support the development of an mRNA-based vaccine against H5N1. The agency said it expects to see phase 1 clinical trial results on the safety of that vaccine by the end of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/bird-flu-cases-extreme-heat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_health_tennessee-sex-workers-sex-offender-registry-kff-health-news-partner", "text": "The Tennessee government has agreed to begin scrubbing its sex offender registry of dozens of people who were convicted of prostitution\u00a0while having HIV, reversing a practice that federal lawsuits have challenged as draconian and discriminatory. For more than three decades, Tennessee\u2019s \u201caggravated prostitution\u201d laws have made prostitution a misdemeanor for most sex workers but a felony for those who are HIV-positive. Tennessee toughened penalties in 2010 by reclassifying prostitution with HIV as a \u201cviolent sexual offense\u201d with a lifetime registration as a sex offender \u2014 even if protection is used. At least 83 people are believed to be on Tennessee\u2019s sex offender registry solely because of these laws, with most living in the Memphis area, where undercover police officers and prosecutors most often invoked the statute, commonly against Black and transgender women, according to a lawsuit filed last year by the American Civil Liberties Union and four women who were convicted of aggravated prostitution. The Department of Justice challenged the law in a separate suit earlier this year. Both lawsuits argue that Tennessee law does not account for\u00a0evolving science\u00a0on the transmission of HIV or\u00a0precautions that prevent its spread, like use of condoms. Both lawsuits also argue that labeling a person as a sex offender because of HIV unfairly limits where they can live and work and stops them from being alone with grandchildren or minor relatives. \u201cTennessee\u2019s Aggravated Prostitution statute is the only law in the nation that treats people living with HIV who engage in\u00a0any\u00a0sex work, even risk-free encounters, as \u2018violent sex offenders\u2019 subjected to lifetime registration,\u201d the ACLU lawsuit states. \u201cThat individuals living with HIV are treated so differently can only be understood as a remnant of the profoundly prejudiced early response to the AIDS epidemic.\u201d In a\u00a0settlement agreement\u00a0signed by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on July 15 and filed in both lawsuits on July 17, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said it would comb through the state\u2019s sex offender registry to find those added solely because of aggravated prostitution convictions, then send letters alerting those people that they can make a written request to be removed. The language of the settlement suggests that people will need to request their removal from the registry, but the agency said in the agreement it will make \u201cits best effort\u201d to act on the requests \u201cpromptly in the order in which they are received.\u201d The Tennessee attorney general\u2019s office, which represents the state in both the ACLU and DOJ lawsuits and approved the settlement agreement, said in an email statement it would \u201ccontinue to defend Tennessee\u2019s prohibition on aggravated prostitution.\u201d In an email statement, the ACLU celebrated the settlement as \u201cone step toward remedying the harms by addressing the sex offender registration,\u201d but said its work in Tennessee was not done because aggravated prostitution remained a felony charge that it would \u201cfight to overturn.\u201d Molly Quinn, executive director of LGBTQ+ support organization\u00a0OUTMemphis, another plaintiff in the ACLU lawsuit, said both organizations would help eligible people with the paperwork to get removed from the registry. \u201cWe would not have agreed to settle if we did not feel like this was a process that would be extremely beneficial,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cBut, we\u2019re sad that the statute existed as long as it did and sad that there is any process at all that folks have to go through after living with this extraordinary burden of being on the sex offender registry for really an irrelevant reason.\u201d Michelle Anderson, a Memphis resident who is one of the plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit, said in court records that since being convicted of aggravated prostitution, the sex offender label has made it so difficult to find a home and a job that she was \u201cunhoused for about a year\u201d and has at times \u201cfelt she had no option but to continue to engage in sex work to survive.\u201d Like the other plaintiffs, Anderson said her conviction kept her minor relatives at a distance. \u201cMs. Anderson has a nephew she loves, but she cannot have a close relationship with him,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cEven though Ms. Anderson\u2019s convictions had nothing to do with children, she cannot legally be alone with her nephew.\u201d The Tennessee settlement comes months after state lawmakers softened the law so no one else should be added to the sex offender registry for aggravated prostitution. Lawmakers removed the registration requirement and made convictions eligible for expungement if the defendant testifies they were a victim of human trafficking. State Sen. Page Walley (R-Savannah), who supported the original aggravated prostitution law passed in 1991 and co-sponsored the recent bill to amend it, said on the floor of the legislature that the changes do not prevent prosecutors from charging people with a felony for aggravated prostitution. Instead, he said, the amendments undo the 2010 law that put those who are convicted on the registry \u201calong with pedophiles and rapists for a lifetime, with no recourse for removal.\u201d \u201cHaving stood, as I mentioned, in 1991 and passed this,\u201d Walley said, \u201cit is a particular gratifying moment for me to see how we continue to evolve and seek what\u2019s just and what\u2019s right and what\u2019s best.\u201d KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 an independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

{"id": "2024_07_18_health_tattoo-ink-permanent-makeup-contamination-wellness", "text": "Sealed bottles of tattoo and permanent makeup ink, including some marked as sterile, contained millions of potentially dangerous bacteria, according to new research by the US Food and Drug Administration. \u201cIn light of our study results, we want to emphasize the importance of continuously monitoring these products to ensure the microbial safety of tattoo inks,\u201d said Seong-Jae (Peter) Kim, a microbiologist staff fellow at the FDA\u2019s National Center for Toxicological Research in Jefferson, Arkansas, in a statement. Kim is corresponding author of the July 2 report published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. Because the ink is injected deep into the skin where some bacteria can thrive, contaminated tattoo ink can cause infections and serious injuries, said study coauthor Linda Katz, the director\u00a0of the FDA\u2019s Office of Cosmetics and Colors. \u201cPathogens or other harmful substances in these inks can travel from the injection site through the blood and lymphatic systems to other parts of the body,\u201d Katz said in an email. When systemic spread occurs, bacteria can cause life-threatening complications such as endocarditis, a potentially deadly inflammation of the heart lining, or septic shock, which is the last and most severe stage of sepsis, the body\u2019s extreme response to an infection that can result in multi-organ failure, Katz said. If not quickly treated, \u201csepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death,\u201d according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other, more commonly reported symptoms of tattoo ink infections include injection-site rashes; impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection; erysipelas, a bright red and tender rash on the skin; and cellulitis, a deep infection of the skin that requires antibiotic treatment, according to Katz. People with multiple or large tattoos are at higher risk from contaminated ink, Katz said, because larger tattoos increase the likelihood of exposure to microorganisms. Applying permanent makeup can also raise the risk of infection, she said. \u201cWhile both tattoos and permanent makeup carry risks if contaminated ink is used, permanent makeup applied around the eye area may pose a higher risk to consumers because microbes could enter the eye and may cause an infection,\u201d Katz said. Unfortunately, the study\u2019s findings were not surprising, said John Swierk, an assistant professor of chemistry at Binghamton University, State University of New York, who has studied tattoo ink contamination. He was not involved in the new study. \u201cWe know that contamination in tattoo inks is a common occurrence,\u201d Swierk said in an email. \u201cPart of the problem is that there is no agreed upon, industry-standard method for sterilizing inks. Our work and the current study really highlight the need for good, standardized manufacturing processes across the tattoo ink industry.\u201d The tattoo industry is increasingly working with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with safety standards, said tattoo artist Selina Medina, director of research at the Alliance of Professional Tattooists, a nonprofit alliance of artists dedicated to promoting tattoo health and safety. \u201cManufacturers are investing in advanced sterilization technologies and formulation advancements to improve their production environments to reduce the risk of contamination,\u201d Medina said in an email. \u201cThis includes using clean rooms and enhanced quality control processes to mitigate against problems like this.\u201d Bacterial counts should be zero The latest study tested 75 samples of sealed tattoo and permanent makeup ink sold in the United States by 14 manufacturers that were not named by the FDA. Some of the samples were labeled as sterile. Researchers found 26 samples from 10 manufacturers, or 35% of the sample set, had some degree of bacterial contamination. While most samples showed bacteria counts of less than 250 CFUs (colony-forming units) per gram, a few samples contained bacterial counts as high as 105, Katz said. Each CFU represents the growth of a colony from a single microbe in a petri dish, so 10 to the fifth power equals 100,000 bacteria per gram. Earlier studies by the FDA found 35% of unopened and sealed inks from US manufacturers had bacterial counts as high as 10 to the 8th CFU, or 100 million bacteria per gram, Katz said. That amount should be zero, said infectious disease expert Dr. Robert Schooley, a distinguished professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases and global public health at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThe level of bacteria in materials that are injected into the skin or that come into contact with abraded or injured skin should be \u2018none detected,\u2019\u201d said Schooley, who was not involved in the FDA study. \u201cThe other issue here is that tattooing has also been associated with the transmission of viral infections including hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV,\u201d said Schooley, who is also codirector of the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, which uses one of bacteria\u2019s ancient enemies, phages, to fight superbug infections. \u201cThese (infections) were not studied in the FDA manuscript but the fact that so many of the inks failed bacterial sterility tests suggests that other organisms like viruses and fungi also can slip through the cracks,\u201d he said. How to protect yourself Many certified tattoo artists are aware of the danger and may already take steps to avoid contamination, Medina said. \u201cTransparency with clients is vital. Artists should communicate openly about the steps they take to ensure ink safety and address any concerns clients may have,\u201d Medina said. \u201cBefore using new batches of ink, some artists and studios conduct their own testing or require proof of testing from suppliers. This can include microbial testing to detect potential contamination.\u201d In addition, tattoo artists can resterilize inks before application by using an autoclave, a machine that utilizes steam to apply high pressure and temperature to items to eliminate bacteria, Medina said. The way an artist handles the ink while working on a tattoo is also critical, she said. For example, using the same gloves\u00a0to touch a client and the ink bottle is a hazard that can lead to tattoo ink contamination. Artists should ensure ink bottles are tightly sealed when not in use and stored in cool, dry locations away from direct sunlight to minimize the risk of contamination, Medina added. Experts say the ultimate solution is for the tattoo and permanent ink manufacturing industry to be subject to regulations that require testing and certification before inks are allowed on the market. \u201cTattoo inks are in the process of being regulated due to the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (of 2022) but much of that law dealing with tattoo inks has yet to be implemented,\u201d Swierk said. \u201cWe anticipate that MoCRA will be phased in over the next few years and that will represent the first serious regulation of tattoo inks in the US. Most of this will focus on good manufacturing processes and safety substantiation.\u201d The FDA released draft guidance for the tattoo industry in June 2023, which includes details on how manufacturers should conduct quality control measures, including sterilization.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/health/tattoo-ink-permanent-makeup-contamination-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_health_bowel-movement-frequency-gut-microbiome-wellness", "text": "How often you poop may influence more than whether you\u2019re uncomfortably bloated. The frequency may also affect your gut microbiome and risk of chronic disease, a new study has found. Gut bacteria that digest fiber, for example, seemed to thrive in participants who pooped once or twice a day, according to the study published Monday in the journal Cell Reports Medicine. But bacteria associated with the upper gastrointestinal tract or protein fermentation were enriched in those with diarrhea or constipation, respectively. The authors also found younger people, women and participants with a lower body mass index had less frequent bowel movements. \u201cMany people with chronic diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s and chronic kidney disease, report having had constipation for years prior to the diagnosis,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Dr. Sean Gibbons, who has lost family members to Parkinson\u2019s disease. \u201cHowever, it is unclear whether or not these bowel movement frequency \u2026 aberrations are drivers of disease, or simply a consequence of disease,\u201d Gibbons, associate professor at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, added via email. This quandary is what motivated the researchers to study the associations between bowel movement frequency and genetics, the gut microbiome, blood plasma chemistries and blood metabolites \u2014 small molecules that are participants in and products of metabolism \u2014 to assess whether the pattern may be negatively affecting the body prior to a disease diagnosis, Gibbons said. The authors examined the health and lifestyle data of more than 1,400 healthy adults who had participated in a scientific wellness program at Arivale, a consumer health company that operated from 2015 to 2019 in Seattle. Participants, nearly 83% of whom were White, answered questionnaires and consented to blood and stool sampling. Self-reported bowel movement frequency was separated into four groups: constipation (one or two bowel movements per week), low-normal (three to six weekly), high-normal (one to three per day) and diarrhea. The authors also found that several blood metabolites and blood plasma chemistries were linked with different frequencies. Byproducts of protein fermentation such as p-Cresol-sulfate and indoxyl sulfate, known to cause kidney damage, were enriched in constipated participants. Blood levels of indoxyl sulfate were also associated with reduced kidney function. And chemistries linked with liver damage were higher in people with diarrhea, who also had more inflammation. The authors believe their findings are \u201cpreliminary support for a causal link between bowel movement frequency, gut microbial metabolism, and organ damage,\u201d according to a news release. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting to me about this study is that we have long known about a connection between constipation and chronic kidney disease, but the potential mechanisms have never been well understood,\u201d said Dr. Kyle Staller, director of the Gastrointestinal Motility Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, via email. \u201cThis study provides one pathway by which future studies could investigate this connection over time \u2026 to learn whether people with low bowel movement frequency produce more potentially toxic metabolites and subsequently develop kidney disease,\u201d added Staller, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Understanding gut health \u201cThere are some important limitations here that make the findings less translatable to the average person,\u201d Staller said, including that the study doesn\u2019t prove a cause-and-effect relationship. The data result from participants studied at a single point in time, so other factors could be at play. It\u2019s also possible a person\u2019s gut microbiome could be influencing bowel movement frequency. Bowel movement frequency also isn\u2019t the most ideal measure of bowel function, he said. \u201cWe know that normal bowel movement frequency ranges from (three) bowel movements per week to (three) bowel movements per day, but the best measure of how fast things are moving through our gut is stool form,\u201d Staller added. \u201cThat is, when stools are harder, they have been sitting in the colon for longer \u2014 what we call a longer transit time. \u201cWhen stools are softer, the opposite is true. Thus, a more ideal measure of bowel function would be stool consistency rather than frequency.\u201d Additionally, many of the findings are based on the group with low to normal bowel movement frequency \u2014 three to six times per week \u2014 with few derived from those who were constipated or had diarrhea, experts said. \u201cIdeally, we would see kind of a \u2018dose-response relationship,\u2019 where the worse the constipation, the worse the kidney function and the higher number of these potentially harmful metabolites in the blood as a marker.\u201d What\u2019s more, bacterial species in participants\u2019 stools were detected by a type of technology that indicates only a larger group, or genus, the bacteria belong to, rather than specific species \u2014 which could have differential effects even when from the same group, he added. Participants with generally normal bowel movement frequency also had important differences in lifestyle, such as consuming more fruits and vegetables, being better hydrated and exercising more, said Dr. Rena Yadlapati, a professor in the division of gastroenterology at the University of California San Diego who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Regarding the potential processes behind the authors\u2019 hypothesis, \u201cprior work has established that gut microbes undergo a switch between fiber and protein fermentation, depending on gut transit time,\u201d Gibbons said via email. \u201cOver normal transit times (normal BMFs), gut microbes ferment dietary fibers into healthy organic acids that maintain intestinal homeostasis. \u201cHowever, if stool stays in the gut for too long (constipation), the microbes start to run low on fiber and they switch to fermenting protein (and eating our mucus layer, which is also protein rich),\u201d Gibbons added. \u201cProtein fermentation in the gut gives rise to these toxic compounds that are found in the blood.\u201d All considered, Staller doesn\u2019t think anyone should see the findings as a reason to worry about how fast their gut is moving, he said. \u201cMuch of the data is derived from people that we physicians would consider normal, and there are not enough truly constipated individuals from which we can draw hard conclusions.\u201d What\u2019s more important, he added, is the fact that the study reaffirmed the ability of dietary factors to also affect gut function. Experts\u2019 understanding of the interactions between resident gut bacteria and bodily functions \u201cis growing by leaps and bounds daily,\u201d Staller said. \u201cHowever, any attempt to simplify this knowledge into cultivating the \u2018ideal\u2019 gut microbiome is a ways off,\u201d he added. \u201cOur knowledge in this field is just too underdeveloped to make sweeping changes to our lives based on the findings of a study like this just yet.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/health/bowel-movement-frequency-gut-microbiome-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "health"}}
