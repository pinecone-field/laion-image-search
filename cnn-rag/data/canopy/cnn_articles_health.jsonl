Even though I was there three years ago, and it is a core memory for me, it\u2019s not mine to tell. It\u2019s hers, and she wants to tell it. So, I\u2019m going to sit back and let her do just that with my heart in my throat as I worry about what will happen later. Here are Vivi\u2019s words: I sat in the car with my dad and spit it out. \u201cDad, I\u2019m gay,\u201d I said. In the two seconds of silence that followed, I wasn\u2019t scared of how he would respond. I simply wondered how he would handle it. His oldest child and his only daughter just announced to him that she is something different than what\u2019s considered traditional. Another part of me considered his background. How would his Southern roots react to the unusual? His response: \u201cYou still have to mow the lawn. And we are going to have pizza for dinner.\u201d Back to me, Vivi\u2019s dad. I will never forgive myself for my boring response. I did not say, \u201cHi Gay, I\u2019m Dad.\u201d She set me up with the perfect dad joke opportunity, and I missed it. This has haunted me for the last three years. But seriously. I am honored that my daughter trusted me enough to know I would be there for her, even if she had her doubts. I worry more about what other parents might say to their children because I know there is a lot that parents get right and wrong when our children are brave enough to talk to us about their sexuality. Let\u2019s be clear here \u2014 the stakes are high. The Trevor Project reports that 41% of LGBTQ+ young people have considered suicide, while 28% have reported\u00a0being homeless because of their orientation. All this comes with depression, anxiety and even self-harming behaviors. This was on my mind when my daughter decided to tell her story. What do parents get right and wrong when our kids come out I know that how men respond as fathers to this most vulnerable moment has plenty of far-reaching consequences. So, what do we do? \u201cThe biggest risk is this irreversible fractioning of the relationship between the teen and the dad,\u201d said James Moran, director of education and public relations at Our Spot KC in Kansas City, Missouri, which provides housing, technical assistance and other support for the local LGBTQ+ community. \u201cThis can translate into difficulty forming relationships, housing, low self-esteem, and not having basic adult skills as a result of this conflict and lack of support.\u201d How should a father react when our teens come out to us? Moran has advice. \u201cThank you for trusting me with that,\u201d Moran suggested. Or \u201cHow can I support you? I don\u2019t think young folks are looking for you to be an expert but need you to show your support and heart even if the words come out wrong.\u201d That was what I tried to communicate in my response to my daughter. I wanted her to know that this was normal and no big deal. And since it wasn\u2019t a big deal, life needed to continue, and the grass was getting long. Plus, who doesn\u2019t love pizza for dinner? As she said recently, \u201cI understand my privilege to say that I was not scared to come out to my father. I recognize that I have a family that loves me, supports me, and will always have my back. My father has never been one to follow the tradition, so why should I?\u201d Knowing we are a family of gender-norm breakers, my daughter was referring to my role as an at-home dad for the last 16 years. And although I am proud that she had the confidence to be herself with me, my response wasn\u2019t perfect. I became concerned about how the world would treat her. Are we overprotective of our LGBTQ+ teens? No doubt parents are scared for their children to be \u201cout\u201d in the world, but at what cost? One mistake parents often make \u201cis prioritizing the protection of our kids over their identity,\u201d Moran said. Some parents ask their kids to \u201cnot be gay in public\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t show it anywhere.\u201d On the surface, that seems offensive. But it did cross my mind when I asked my daughter if she wanted to tell her story to help dads and their daughters. Her immediate response was yes, and then I was worried, even though it was my idea. It is not uncommon to get hateful comments on the articles that I write. My favorite is being accused of being \u201cless of a man\u201d because I\u2019m an at-home dad. Am I bringing that to my daughter? Fear and hate drive some people to acts of violence. CNN\u2019s article about LGBTQ rights and milestones details the struggles and discrimination that many in the community have faced. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier if she didn\u2019t tell her story and not come out to the entire world? No, it wouldn\u2019t be easier for her. It would mean she couldn\u2019t be herself, and I\u2019ve failed as a father if I would ever let that happen. It is important to me that she has agency in her life, and that begins by embracing who she is at her core, without apology. As I wrote this article, my daughter, her girlfriend and I talked about the advice they could give others who were going through the same coming out process. They told me to \u201cjust, as a dad, normalize it, and don\u2019t treat us differently than others. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Their statement makes me smile because it was said with the nonchalance of youth. Yes, to them it is not a big deal. But my daughter and her girlfriend having the confidence and support to come out and be who they truly are is a very big deal. They still have to mow the yard though. (But I\u2019ll buy the pizza.)

{"id": "2024_07_06_health_biden-debate-cognitive-tests", "text": "President Joe Biden said Friday that his poor performance in last week\u2019s debate was a bad night but not evidence of a serious condition. \u201cI have medical doctors traveling everywhere. Every president does, as you know. Medical doctors from the best of the world travel with me everywhere I go,\u201d Biden told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos. \u201cI have an ongoing assessment of what I\u2019m doing. They don\u2019t hesitate to tell me if they think there\u2019s something else wrong.\u201d Biden said he spoke with his doctor after the debate and was told, \u201cyou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d Being president, he said, means \u201cI get a full neurological test every day.\u201d But doctors who work with aging patients say there\u2019s no single moment or test that determines a person\u2019s mental fitness or ability to function. In-depth evaluations can provide more answers, including ruling out potential problems. Such tests might start with short questionnaires, then expand to physical exams, blood tests, brain imaging, lengthy interviews with the individual and conversations with family members and friends. In an analysis published Friday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta urged the president to undergo detailed cognitive and neurological tests and to make those results public. Such testing \u201ccan help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning,\u201d Gupta wrote. When asked on Friday whether he\u2019s had cognitive tests and an exam by a neurologist, Biden said no. \u201cNo one said I had to. \u2026 They said I\u2019m good,\u201d the president said. Biden gave no indication he would be willing to have such tests conducted in the aftermath of his debate performance. Effects of typical aging Most people who are aging normally will experience some cognitive changes, but when and how much varies from person to person. Slow, age-related cognitive decline starts around age 27, studies show, even for healthy and well-educated people. A person\u2019s reasoning and problem-solving skills, along with their ability to maintain the thread of a conversation, can get tougher with age, but not so much that it impairs what doctors consider normal functioning. \u201cEvery aging researcher will tell you, though, that not everything declines as you get older, and not everything declines at an equal rate,\u201d said Dr. Charan Ranganath, a professor of psychology and neuroscience and the director of the Dynamic Memory Lab at the University of California, Davis. For example, the ability to remember facts \u2014 an essential skill for a president \u2014 doesn\u2019t disappear with age, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re slower to pull it up, and you\u2019re more likely to struggle to pull up the facts when you need it,\u201d Ranganath said. And it\u2019s not just memory that changes with age, said Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University. \u201cIt\u2019s reasoning and sociability and attention and orientation, and emotional stability and judgment and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cSome get impaired with age, and some actually get better with age, such as vocabulary.\u201d A person\u2019s moral\u00a0reasoning and judgment or their capacity for compassion and empathy will not necessarily decline, Ranganath added. Unless there is some kind of cognitive impairment, those aspects of personality can improve in some people with normal aging. \u201cSo, again, pretty important for a job like president,\u201d Ranganath added. Cognitive impairment \u2014 a loss of memory and other mental abilities that affect daily life \u2014 is different and is not considered normal or inevitable with aging. It occurs in 12% to 18% of people older than 65 and is more prevalent with advancing age, Rowe said. By age 80, more than 25% of people may have some mild cognitive impairment. They may start to lose things and miss appointments, \u201coccurrences that could be characterized as impairing your function,\u201d Rowe said. A minority in this group will go on to develop dementia each year, he said. And some may adapt, maybe seeming to have improved function. \u201cThey always put the key in the same place. They write down all their appointments,\u201d Rowe said. Screening for cognitive impairment To screen for cognitive impairment, a person\u2019s primary care physician will often start with the Mini Mental State Exam, known as the MMSE, or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, also called the MoCA. The MMSE is a 5- to 10-minute 11-question assessment that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. Former President Donald Trump, who has faced questions about his cognitive function, has repeatedly said he \u201caced\u201d the MoCA \u2014 a 30-point test that takes about 10 minutes. It evaluates the ability to concentrate and tests executive function, memory, language, conceptual thinking and orientation, the ability to do calculations and the ability to organize and manipulate spatial information to create a design. Both ask for simple information, like what the date is and where the participant is, and ask to count backward from 100 using a particular number. Both tests ask a person to draw. The MMSE asks the participant to identify particular objects in the room and to take a piece of paper in their right hand, fold it in half and put it on the floor. For the MoCA, the person will be told five words and then asked to repeat them in five minutes. The tests are not in-depth. Ranganath describes the MMSE as a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d: Unless someone has established language problems, he said, \u201cbasically, you have to be seriously cognitively impaired\u201d to do poorly, \u201cespecially for somebody who is functioning at a high level, like a high-level politician.\u201d The MoCA, he said, is good at detecting when someone has mild cognitive impairment. It\u2019s a test for \u201cwhen people can really tell there\u2019s a memory problem, and that\u2019s often when they\u2019ll be talking to a doctor about it,\u201d Ranganath said \u2014 and perhaps seeking more detailed results. More detailed cognitive tests If a doctor or family member suspects more serious cognitive problems, a person may be referred to specialists who can do further tests that may take one or two days to complete. Usually, the person will be referred to a behavioral neurologist who specializes in aging and dementia and non-dementia diagnosis, as well as a neuropsychologist and possibly a social worker who will meet with them and their family, according to Dr. Emily Rogalski, a professor of neurology who runs the University of Chicago\u2019s Health Aging & Alzheimer\u2019s Research Care Center. \u201cPart of those evaluations will look at the overall health of the individual, from neurologic health to also cognitive health,\u201d she said. Cognitive health includes how a person can learn, think and remember. Neurological health involves the nervous system. Neurological disorders like Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s, or even a headache, can affect cognitive functions. But other conditions can have an impact too, such as an infection or tumor. \u201cThe neuropsychologist is able to do an in-depth evaluation of the strengths and challenges that an individual may be experiencing and start to understand the interactions between those strengths and challenges,\u201d Rogalski said. Testing could also include blood tests or imaging that may tell doctors what\u2019s going on in the brain itself. There will also be a physical examination. If a person has a history of congestive heart failure, a doctor may do a cardiac exam to check for deterioration that could contribute to cognitive issues, said Dr. Brad Dickerson, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and an associate neurologist who sees patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cYou have to take all that into consideration when you\u2019re trying to figure out why their cognitive functioning may be different than it was,\u201d he said. At this level of testing, part of the evaluation will also include a report from people close to the patient. \u201cThat sometimes is a spouse or a close family member who can comment on whether the individual is experiencing significant change from their previous level of function and whether that change is interfering with what we call activities of daily living,\u201d Rogalski said. Who should get tested \u2014\u00a0and when Dickerson said patients will often ask him when they should get tested. His answer: It depends. If, for example, an 80-year-old tells him that they keep forgetting the name of an actor in a movie they\u2019ve just seen or that they go into another part of the house to get three things and remember only two, and if the problem has gotten more annoying but over time isn\u2019t too disruptive, they could get a baseline cognitive and neurological assessment in the office. He said he would not be worried that this was a sign of a progressive disorder that needs to be diagnosed and treated. \u201cThere are elements of the history that would raise a doctor\u2019s concerns about a significant problem or would reduce the doctor\u2019s concerns about a significant problem,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cSometimes, you can\u2019t be sure of that until you sit down in the office and interview people.\u201d Rowe said he tells concerned family members and patients that the time to get tested is when they start asking whether they should. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in getting tested,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have a baseline so that you can get tested again in a year or two if you think things are getting worse.\u201d Testing, he said, should be able to tell them if they have issues that impair their function. But people shouldn\u2019t worry if they can\u2019t remember someone\u2019s name. Rowe, who served as chairman and CEO of the insurance company Aetna and was president and CEO of Mount Sinai NYU Health, believes that testing should be the default for people in several roles: presidential candidates, regardless of age; US Supreme Court justices; airline pilots. He says the public shouldn\u2019t get \u201ccarried away\u201d with scores: If one candidate\u2019s score is higher than the others, that doesn\u2019t mean that one is more qualified to be president, he said. \u201cBut if somebody fails a test,\u201d Rowe said, \u201cI think that it\u2019s something that people should know.\u201d Testing doesn\u2019t always lead to a dementia diagnosis. Addressing other health problems, such as a sleep disorder or medications interacting with each other, may lead to improvement. Patients may see symptoms reduced through lifestyle changes. If someone is found to have early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s, new treatments can slow the progression of disease. Distinguishing between cognitive impairment and typical age-related cognitive decline \u201care not trivial questions,\u201d and it\u2019s not something a family doctor can typically do, Ranganath said. Even in-depth testing may not give a clear indication of what a person is capable of now or in the near future. \u201cThere is also a bit of an art in figuring out how to translate someone\u2019s test results into a statement about real world functioning (i.e., whether a person is fit to drive, live independently, do a demanding job, etc.),\u201d Ranganath wrote in an email. \u201cMany times, the recommendation is obvious, but on occasion, it can be hard to tell and there are no clear cut answers. And if someone seems relatively competent at the moment, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they will be doing so well 2-4 years later.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang and John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/health/biden-debate-cognitive-tests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_bird-flu-fourth-human-case-in-us", "text": "A fourth person in the United States has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak among dairy cattle across the country. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Wednesday that it has identified the state\u2019s first human case of H5 avian influenza associated with the multistate outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle. This case is the fourth identified nationally in connection to the outbreak; two other human cases have been reported in Michigan and one in Texas. More than a quarter of dairy herds in Colorado have reported cases of bird flu, according to data from the state health department. As of Wednesday, federal\u00a0data\u00a0shows that seven states have confirmed cases in the past 30 days, and 40% of them are in Colorado \u2014 more than any other state. The infected person in Colorado had mild symptoms, reporting only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as a symptom, according to state health officials. He worked at a dairy farm in northeast Colorado and had direct exposure to dairy cattle infected with avian flu. After testing positive,\u00a0the man was treated immediately with the antiviral medication oseltamivir, and he has recovered, according to the state health department. \u201cThe risk to most people remains low. Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,\u201d Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist at the CDPHE, said in Wednesday\u2019s announcement. The last human case of\u00a0H5N1 in Colorado was in 2022\u00a0in a person who was exposed to infected poultry. In the current outbreak connected to infected dairy cattle, the first two human cases identified in the United States also reported eye-related symptoms and eye infections or conjunctivitis. The third human case in the US reported more respiratory symptoms, such as cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes. None of those three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission of the virus. On the national level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that it continues to monitor the situation carefully, using its flu surveillance systems to watch for H5N1 activity in people. The agency said Wednesday that the human case in Colorado \u201cdoes not change CDC\u2019s current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.\u201d However, the case \u201cunderscores the importance of\u00a0recommended precautions\u00a0in people with exposure to infected animals,\u201d according to the CDC. \u201cPeople with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.\u201d The CDC repeatedly\u00a0has recommended\u00a0that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. CDC officials said Tuesday that the United States has enough H5 bird flu tests to respond to the outbreak. \u201cWe have an ample number of H5-specific tests in the public health system for the current outbreak. As of right now, there are roughly 750,000 H5-specific tests available today and another 1.2 million such tests coming online in the next two to three months,\u201d Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cThis is on top of a robust supply of influenza A tests, the general tests that are available at doctor\u2019s offices around the country,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThe way that our system works is such that if someone tests positive for influenza A at the doctor\u2019s office, their specimen is sent to a public health laboratory for what\u2019s called subtyping. That tells us if the influenza A virus is a common seasonal one, or a rarer version like H5N1. That subtyping happens more commonly than you might think.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/bird-flu-fourth-human-case-in-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_health_child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness", "text": "Chicago native Jeffrey Odwazny\u00a0says he has been addicted to ultraprocessed food since he was a child. \u201cI was driven to eat and eat and eat, and while I would overeat healthy food, what really got me were the candies, the cakes, the pies, the ice cream,\u201d said the 54-year-old former warehouse supervisor. \u201cI really gravitated towards the sugary ultraprocessed foods \u2014 it was like a physical drive, I had to have it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents would find hefty bags full of candy wrappers hidden in my closet. I would steal things from stores as a kid and later as an adult.\u201d Some 12% of the nearly 73 million children and adolescents in the United States today struggle with a similar food addiction, according to research. To be diagnosed, children must meet Yale Food Addiction Scale criteria as stringent as any for alcohol use disorder or other addictions. \u201cKids are losing control and eating to the point where they feel physically ill,\u201d said Ashley Gearhardt, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who conducted the research and developed the Yale addiction scale. \u201cThey have intense cravings and may be sneaking, stealing or hiding ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cThey may stop going out with friends or doing other activities they used to enjoy in order to stay at home and eat, or they feel too sluggish from overeating to participate in other activities.\u201d Her research also shows about 14% of adults are clinically addicted to food, predominantly ultraprocessed foods with higher levels of sugar, salt, fat and additives. For comparison, 10.5% of Americans age 12 or older were diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in 2022, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. While many people addicted to food will say that their symptoms began to worsen significantly in adolescence, some recall a childhood focused on ultraprocessed food. \u201cBy age 2 or 3, children are likely eating more ultraprocessed foods in any given day than a fruit or vegetable, especially if they\u2019re poor and don\u2019t have enough money in their family to have enough quality food to eat,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cUltraprocessed foods are cheap and literally everywhere, so this is also a social justice issue.\u201d An addiction to ultraprocessed foods can highjack a young brain\u2019s reward circuitry, putting the primitive \u201creptilian brain,\u201d or amygdala, in charge \u2014 thus bypassing the prefrontal cortex where rational decision-making occurs, said Los Angeles registered dietitian nutritionist\u00a0David Wiss, who specializes in treating food addiction. \u201cUltraprocessed food addiction also teaches the young brain what to expect from food, like how much sugar reward one should get from eating a snack,\u201d said Wiss, which makes healthier options less appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s almost virtually impossible for a child, or even a 14- or 15-year-old, to be able to override all of this biology for very long,\u201d he added. The Institute of Food Technologists, an association of food professionals and technologists, does not agree with the research on ultraprocessed food addiction. \u201cWhile there is growing concern that some foods may be addictive for certain sub-populations including children, there is currently no scientific consensus to support that concern,\u201d said IFT\u2019s chief science and technology officer, Bryan Hitchcock, in an email. Food addiction is also not recognized by the World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Diseases and is a subject of debate in the scientific community, according to the International Food and Beverage Alliance, an industry association. \u201cSome believe markers of food addiction indicate eating disorders rather than substance use disorders,\u201d said IFBA\u2019s secretary-general, Rocco Renaldi, in an email. \u2018This disorder has almost killed me\u2019 Traumatic experiences in early childhood helped to trigger and nurture his addiction to ultraprocessed foods, Odwazny said. \u201cOne of my earliest memories is being in a high chair with ashtrays going over my head and plates smashing into the walls,\u201d Odwazny said. \u201cInstead of saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 or showing love, my family would feed me.\u201d At first, he said his parents thought his overeating was funny and began calling him names such as \u201cthe creeper\u201d when he would escape from his crib in the night to raid the refrigerator. As he grew, however, Odwazny\u2019s parents began to put locks on the refrigerator and kitchen cabinets. He was often ashamed of his eating. \u201cThere was a lot of name-calling. I was nicknamed everything from butterball to fat ass and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know the dads of some kids would call, \u2018Hey, buddy or pal,\u2019 but my dad used to call me \u2018the Orca.\u2019\u201d Despite his preoccupation with food, Odwazny was careful not to overeat in front of strangers as he grew up. Instead, when faced at a party with trigger foods such as chocolate-covered peanut butter cups, he would leave to buy that specific food. \u201cI would go to one store until I bought it all out, and then I would have to travel to another store,\u201d he said. \u201cI would buy two or three family-size bags, and I would eat so much in one sitting that I would be in a fog. Sugary food is a drug for me.\u201d The disorder took over his life. Before one meal of highly processed food was over, he was thinking about where to find the next. By 2016, his food addiction was at its worst. \u201cI would steal food or eat things that were burnt or spoiled,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve often gotten sick and had to go to the hospital. In fact, this disorder has almost killed me several times.\u201d The food-addicted brain Eating\u00a0higher amounts\u00a0of\u00a0ultraprocessed food raises the risk of obesity and the development of chronic conditions including\u00a0cancer,\u00a0cardiovascular disease,\u00a0obesity,\u00a0type 2 diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0depression. Still, many people find it hard to stop eating overly processed convenience foods such as hot dogs, French fries, crackers, frozen pizza, sausages, sodas, doughnuts, candy and ice cream. Ultraprocessed foods often contain flavors, different textures and \u201cadditives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,\u201d according to the\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Such foods are designed to maximize levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain, experts say. Added fats increase calories and improve the \u201cmouthfeel\u201d that makes food pleasing. Texture plays a role as well. \u201cFoods that melt in the mouth and are smooth or creamy, or alternatively, foods with crunch, can create an immediate neurochemical reward,\u201d Wiss said. \u201cA lot of food science goes into this and lot of research and development by manufacturers.\u201d Copious amounts of salt improve flavor. Sugar is so powerful that it\u2019s used as a replacement for pain medication for minor surgeries in babies: \u201cFor circumcisions or shots, they\u2019ll give babies a dose of sugar because it releases opioids in the brain and dulls pain,\u201d Gearhardt said. In fact, animal studies suggest sugar levels in ultraprocessed foods may be as addictive to the brain as alcohol or tobacco, she said. \u201cThese are really invasive studies, with wires in the brain,\u201d Gearhardt said. \u201cSugar creates the same amount of dopamine release that mimics what you see with nicotine and ethanol \u2014 around 150% to 200% above baseline. \u201cCocaine is much more addictive, between 1,000% and 2,000% above baseline,\u201d she said. \u201cBut animals still often choose a sweet taste over cocaine.\u201d The makers of ultraprocessed food strive to meet this dopamine \u201cbliss point\u201d via secret, proprietary mixtures of sugar, fat, salt and flavor additives that experts say trigger the basest of our animal instincts \u2014 the need for survival. \u201cIf there is a really high value meal in front of you, something rich and fatty that has a lot of calories in it, the brain is set up to say, \u2018Go ahead and eat it,\u2019 even if you are full because our ancestors had no guarantee they would find food the next day,\u201d said appetite specialist Alexandra DiFeliceantonio, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. The brain is also wired to remember and crave the pleasurable flavor of a food and its lifesaving calories in a process similar to Pavlovian, or classical conditioning, said DiFeliceantonio, who is also associate director of the Center for Health Behaviors Research at Virginia Tech. \u201cIt\u2019s what we all learned in Psychology 101, right?\u00a0 Light comes on; food drops; dog salivates,\u201d she said. Food processing plays a role How ultraprocessed foods are made may also contribute to addiction, experts say. Due to manufacturing methods that break down cell structures within foods \u2014 in essence predigesting the food \u2014 many ultraprocessed foods pass rapidly through the human gastrointestinal tract. That\u2019s confusing to a digestive system designed to slowly break down whole foods that have been torn and chewed, and to a brain that\u2019s used to getting a slow trickle of reward. With ultraprocessed foods, the brain receives surges of delight almost as quickly as the food is eaten, DiFeliceantonio said. \u201cThe majority of usable calories, boosted by intense flavors from whatever additives are in there, are quickly dumped into the upper intestine, sending signals to the brain all at once,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening really rapidly, and it\u2019s happening really strongly.\u201d The result, experts say, is a brain that fails to recognize ultraprocessed calories as filling. That, along with the rush of dopamine, may be a reason the brain has trouble saying, \u201cHalt!\u201d to ultraprocessed foods. \u201cThese foods appear to leave our brain in a state of perpetual vulnerability to rewarding substances and never feeling nourished or satiated,\u201d Gearhardt said. Nutrition is another issue. Ultraprocessed foods are often missing critical nutrients the body needs, which are especially important during childhood when the brain and body are growing. \u201cWhat is left after all the high heat and manipulation needed to create the ultraprocessed foods are the macronutrients \u2014 the calories, the carbohydrates, the fats and sometimes a little protein,\u201d Wiss said. \u201cMicronutrients are typically destroyed, which include the vitamins, minerals and antioxidant compounds that are known to confer health benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren who eat a lot of ultraprocessed foods could well be malnourished.\u201d According to the International Food and Beverage Alliance, however, there is no clear, objective, reliable or scientifically validated definition for \u201cultraprocessed\u201d food. \u201cIt is a catch-all, non-scientific concept that doesn\u2019t adequately account for nutritional differences in products:\u00a0the scientific evidence to date, and agreed upon by many authorities internationally, is that it is ultimately\u00a0the nutritional composition of foods, and of an individual\u2019s diet, that matters,\u201d said the IFBA\u2019s Renaldi. \u2018Our disease wants us to be separate\u2019 Overcoming his addiction to food \u2014 and later alcohol \u2014 has been a difficult journey for Odwazny. In an attempt to control his eating, he underwent two bariatric surgeries that typically have a high success rate. \u201cEach time I would pray, \u2018Please be it, please make this the answer.\u2019 But I would ultimately start binging on ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Odwazny said. \u201cThose surgeries were operating on the wrong part of my body, my stomach, but my eating disorder is right here,\u201d he said, tapping his head. Miserable and so overweight he could no longer do his job, Odwazny went on short-term disability and checked into rehab for a binge-eating disorder. That treatment plan didn\u2019t work, so he tried another, then another. Finally, he found a program that combined traditional treatment for binge-eating disorder with one for food addiction. Listening to other patients and staff speak about their own issues with food was life-changing, Odwazny said. \u201cOur disease wants us to be separate,\u201d he said. \u201cOur disease wants us to be not part of something else, because we want to isolate and think that we\u2019re the only ones. But when I heard the staff and some of the doctors talk about their own addictions, I knew the people that were treating me finally understood.\u201d A program that incorporates interventions for food addiction with treatment for restrictive eating disorders is relatively new and somewhat controversial, said food addiction specialist Dr. Kimberly Dennis, who is cofounder, CEO and chief medical officer at SunCloud Health in Chicago, where Odwazny\u00a0is in treatment. \u201cTreatment for a restrictive eating disorder, like binge eating or bulimia, focuses on helping the person overcome any aversion to food,\u201d said Dennis, who is also a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Medicine. \u201cAs soon as a person says, \u2018I can\u2019t safely eat that candy,\u201d the eating disorder therapist says, \u2018That\u2019s just the eating disorder talking, all foods are fine, and nothing is off-limits.\u2019\u201d Such treatment is a gold standard for someone who is avoiding food and malnourished, said Dennis, who is in recovery for food addiction and binge-eating disorder. \u201cSo a doughnut for breakfast, cupcake with lunch, and cookies as an afternoon snack would be a really good challenge for that person.\u201d However, if that person also has a food addiction, the approach may cause them to quit treatment, she said. \u201cTheir experience with eating that cupcake would be more like, \u2018I feel really triggered and worried that if I did this at home, I would be through the whole box of cupcakes by now.\u2019\u201d Today, Odwazny\u00a0is in recovery and is studying to become a certified alcohol and drug counselor in the Chicago area. He credits much of his success to his wife, Kimmy, whom he met during the Covid-19 pandemic while attending support groups at SunCloud. \u201cMy wife is also in the program, so we both know our food plans. My wife and I have our meals together \u2014 there\u2019s no sneaking, there\u2019s no hiding. I don\u2019t binge, but there are also certain foods that I don\u2019t eat,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I was in recovery, I never could imagine I would have such a beautiful wife that loves me, because no one loved me.

{"id": "2024_07_05_health_gupta-biden-cognitive-testing-analysis", "text": "When the 46th President of the United States took the debate stage a week ago, it became apparent, even from his first answer, that this would not be the performance he hoped for. For me as a brain specialist, it was concerning to watch President Joe Biden, and it quickly became clear that I was not alone in my reaction. Over the past week, I received more than a dozen calls, texts and emails from medical colleagues who, like me, specialize in the brain. It wasn\u2019t that what we noticed was necessarily new but that it was particularly pronounced, and right from the start of the debate. From a neurological standpoint, we were concerned with his confused rambling; sudden loss of concentration in the middle of a sentence; halting speech and absence of facial animation, resulting at times in a flat, open-mouthed expression. To be clear, these are only observations, not in any way diagnostic of something deeper, and none of these doctors wished to suggest that was the case. The consensus from the doctors reaching out to me, however, was that the president should be encouraged to undergo detailed cognitive and movement disorder testing, and those results should be made available to the public. Over the past five years, I have reported extensively on the advances in the world of treating and reducing risk of dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia. For the documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient,\u201d I even went through extensive cognitive testing to demonstrate what it entailed and determine whether I had problems with executive functioning, judgment or memory lapses, as well as blood tests to determine things like the level of abnormal proteins that may be present in my brain and my B12 levels. My sense of smell and my genetic risk factors were checked. This type of testing is not necessary for most people as a matter of routine, but every one of the brain doctors I spoke to recommended that level of examination for Biden. Biden\u2019s health history The last official report in February was a health summary which concluded that the president was \u201cfit for duty.\u201d The White House said a team of 20 doctors, including a neurologist, participated in completing his physical. An \u201cextremely detailed\u201d neurologic exam found nothing consistent with neurological disorders, the summary said. It also found no evidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease that might explain his stiff gait and decreased expression in his face. Although Parkinson\u2019s disease is the most common cause of parkinsonism - a set of movement symptoms such as stiffness and tremor \u2013 there are other causes as well, and it was not clear in the medical report that those had been investigated. They did find evidence of neuropathy and arthritis\u00a0in his feet, which can cause numbness, weakness and pain. There was no mention of any sort of cognitive testing. Biden was examined by his physician after the debate to check on a cold, the White House said, but it was a \u201cbrief check\u201d and not a physical.\u00a0When White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked this week whether Biden should receive and release the results of any kind of cognitive test, she replied that his medical team has said it\u2019s \u201cnot necessary.\u201d It\u2019s true that the trajectory of aging varies from person to person. Biden is 81, and former President Donald Trump is 78. Both have already lived longer than the average American male lifespan of 74.8 years. This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, as both men have access to high-quality health care, and they don\u2019t drink or smoke. Biden\u2019s medical team has previously disclosed that he had two separate brain operations for aneurysms, including one that ruptured on the left side of his brain, in 1988, and there is some evidence that this type of hemorrhage may increase the risk of delayed cognitive problems later in life. Trump\u2019s father died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 93. Neither man has any other known risk factors for cognitive decline. Trump does at times display some of these same signs as Biden, including nonsensical rants as well as confusing names and current events. He said he\u2019d undergone the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, known as MoCA, in the past. According to his medical team, he received a perfect score when he took the test in 2018. Trump said he took a second cognitive test for his last physical exam at the end of 2023 and \u201caced it.\u201d In a note at the end of last year, Dr. Bruce Aronwald wrote that Trump\u2019s cognitive exams \u201cwere exceptional.\u201d Trump has not released his actual medical records, and memos about his health that were previously released have at times used hyperbolic language, unusual for medical documentation. The MoCA isn\u2019t the same level of cognitive testing the medical experts I spoke to would like to see Biden do, but it could serve as an initial screening tool for cognitive decline. For Trump, this might be considered either a screening test or a baseline to understand how his cognition might be changing. It\u2019s not clear that Biden has ever had such a baseline examination for comparison. An \u2018episode\u2019 or a \u2018condition\u2019? To be clear, there are aspects of aging that can be beneficial to the job of the presidency. Older people may \u201chave something called crystalized intelligence, which is the accumulated wisdom associated with the passage of time,\u201d according to Jay Olshansky, professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois-Chicago. This is our knowledge that comes from learning and experiences. On the other hand, there are definitely aspects of cognition that decline as we age \u2014 especially fluid abilities like processing speed, attention span and memory. This is normal and expected and doesn\u2019t necessarily stand in the way of someone\u2019s ability to do their job. But for a minority of us, that decline is steeper and can lead to dementia. Think of this as the difference between forgetting where you put your keys and not understanding what your keys are for. Still, determining a diagnosis of dementia is not as straightforward as many believe, and there are many other things that could account for the clinical observations I described above. A poor night\u2019s sleep or low blood sugar can have an impact. A viral illness or the medications used to treat those symptoms can result in temporary brain fog. Biden and his aides have said it was a \u201cbad night.\u201d The White House press team said Biden had a cold but did not take any medications to treat symptoms. After the debate, Jean-Pierre added that he had jet lag following overseas travel earlier in the month and worked late doing his presidential duties as well as preparing for the debate.\u00a0According to three sources briefed on these comments, Biden told Democratic governors during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he will stop scheduling events after 8 p.m. so he can get more sleep. The debate started at 9 p.m. Eastern. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question\u201d whether Biden\u2019s debate performance was an \u201cepisode\u201d or a \u201ccondition,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during an MSNBC interview Tuesday. That is precisely why detailed testing is important. It can help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning. As a doctor, I would want to understand the possibility of underlying dementia because, over the past several years, we have learned that there are medical treatments and lifestyle changes that can delay and, in some cases, even reverse the symptoms of the disease. These are hopeful days when it comes to dementia, and early diagnosis and treatment is better than it has ever been. Seeking answers With an election looming in November, we don\u2019t have answers about Biden. The White House has rejected requests from the press to release more medical records and question Biden\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor. Biden\u2019s press secretary said O\u2019Connor watched the debate and had no concerns afterward. Elected officials, like anyone else, are entitled to some level of privacy, and under federal health-care laws, there is no ability for someone to obtain personal medical information on an individual unless authorized, even the president. There is also no requirement for the president or candidates to disclose that information. Most do not. In fact, in the 23 years I have been reporting on these topics, only Sen. John McCain \u2014 one of the oldest presidential candidates in US history \u2014 shared all of his records with me and the American public. We often hear that observing a candidate on the campaign trail is the best assessment of the individual\u2019s physical and cognitive health. Back in 2020, Biden said he was \u201cconstantly tested\u201d by the work of running for president. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is watch me,\u201d he said then. The country is watching now, and that assessment gives cause for concern \u2014 and a need for transparent testing.

{"id": "2024_06_27_opinions_bird-flu-eggs-food-health-safety-farms-ruhlman", "text": "I\u2019m writing from an organic farm and ecotourism site in Tuscany called\u00a0Spannocchia. I\u2019ve just made myself a couple of\u00a0mollet eggs\u00a0\u2014 whites cooked, yolks runny. Delicious \u2014 but also perhaps slightly worrying, given the emerging reports of\u00a0bird flu on poultry and dairy farms. Should I be concerned? And should you be as well, as you prepare your favorite meals at home? There have been numerous reported cases of wild birds and marine animals said to be carrying this virus and its variants, as well as the documented\u00a0spread to mammals\u00a0beyond cows, such as\u00a0cats, dogs\u00a0and mice. Should any of that determine the temperature at which I cook my eggs? And just as importantly, what should I tell home cooks who seek my advice on the matter? This avian flu virus is clearly something to take seriously as it spreads rapidly through dairy farms across the United States affecting\u00a0more than 90 herds in 12 states since March. It\u2019s clear that drinking\u00a0raw or unpasteurized milk is now high-risk. \u201cOur national dairy industry is clearly fighting a major epidemic of H5N1 avian flu,\u201d Donald G. McNeil Jr., a journalist who has covered epidemics for decades,\u00a0wrote. Even though I know it may contain harmful bacteria, I\u2019ve had raw milk. It\u2019s delicious \u2014 and at the time I drank it, it seemed worth the risk. But viruses are not bacteria. They are a different kind of microorganism, capable of mutating. Since we know that this virus is spreading through our dairy farms, it\u2019s clearly foolhardy to drink raw milk. Not just so that you don\u2019t get sick yourself but just as importantly, so that you don\u2019t become a spreader. Fortunately, with avian flu so far, there\u2019s no evidence yet of human-to-human transmission. But again, viruses mutate. There\u2019s no guarantee that transmissions between humans won\u2019t occur in the future. We have substantial evidence that heat inactivates the virus.\u00a0The USDA reports\u00a0that ground beef inoculated with the virus was virus-free when cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and higher. For a burger or steak, that would be medium to well-done, with no pink at the center. Live virus is likewise\u00a0not present in pasteurized milk. So where does all of this leave us in terms of how you should proceed in your kitchen? Most food authorities couch their your-food-is-safe-to-eat opinions with the caveat \u201cas long as it\u2019s properly cooked.\u201d But even with cooked food, there is some risk of becoming ill if an entire dish is not heated to pasteurization temperatures (between 145 degrees and 160 degrees Fahrenheit). Until we learn otherwise, I would say the best guidance for now is that it\u2019s probably safe to continue to prepare your meals as you always have \u2014 runny eggs and all. Most professional chefs I\u2019ve spoken to are comfortable with that guidance. They haven\u2019t changed kitchen protocol in terms of cooking times and temperatures as a result of bird flu. We need to monitor how and where the virus is spreading. For now,\u00a0the CDC risk assessment to humans from bird flu is low. But home cooks should keep an ear to the ground from health authorities for changes in that guidance. Is there a danger that our avian flu could cause chefs and food writers like me to rethink that guidance? Yes, I\u2019m afraid so. The virus has been found in the muscle of infected cattle, it\u2019s alive in raw milk, and it is small enough to pass through the pores of eggshells. As I was writing this piece, I reached out a few chefs and others including McNeil, who is a leading authority on viruses and how they spread to get their views on the potential danger to our food chain posed by bird flu. McNeil told me that he felt US food authorities could have done more \u2014 and done it much sooner \u2014 to sound the alarm to the public about the emergence and spread of bird flu. There are\u00a0plenty of experts\u00a0in the scientific community who agree with him. The government needs to do more to make industrial farms comply with inspections that some have been resistant to. Moreover, he wrote to me by email that \u201cit\u2019s clear that many dairy farmers are resisting letting inspectors onto their property to test either their cows or their workers. I think that\u2019s outrageous. Hidden transmission creates the perfect setting for an epidemic.\u201d Months into this bird flu outbreak, guidance from the government is less clear than we\u2019d like about what we should and shouldn\u2019t consume and how we should prepare the foods we love, and for a lot of people \u2014 including food professionals like me \u2014that\u2019s frustrating. As the H5N1 virus spreads, there might come a moment when food authorities decide we should be taking greater precautions than we did before its emergence. That could mean cooking all burgers medium to well, all eggs till they\u2019re hard and taking steak tartare topped with a raw egg yolk totally off the menu. With no evidence that the virus is in anything we eat raw other than milk, I\u2019ll continue to prepare my eggs so that the yolk is runny, and I\u2019ll keep ordering the beef tartare for dinner at my neighborhood bistro. It\u2019s funny, though. The Italian farm where I\u2019m staying employs numerous international interns. On the morning I began writing this essay, the first words I heard came from one of those interns, outside my window. She called out to her colleague, \u201cOne of the chickens is dead.\u201d Chickens on farms die for all kinds of reasons, but the timing seemed an ominous reminder that we need to be alert and to pay attention. Until we hear something definitive however, I\u2019m trying not to be afraid of my food, and advise you to do the same.\u00a0Bon appetit!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/opinions/bird-flu-eggs-food-health-safety-farms-ruhlman/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_emtala-emergency-care-scotus", "text": "Pregnant people in Idaho should be able to access abortion in a medical emergency in Idaho, at least for now. The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state\u2019s law where it conflicts with federal law. With Thursday\u2019s decision, the state would not be allowed to deny an emergency abortion to a pregnant person whose health is in danger, at least while the case makes its way through the courts. On Wednesday, the decision was mistakenly posted on the US Supreme Court website, and was first reported by Bloomberg News. The final opinion on Thursday was a sigh of relief, but doctors and legal experts acknowledged it\u2019s a temporary reprieve. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a separate opinion. \u201cIt is a delay.\u201d \u201cStorm clouds loom ahead,\u201d she wrote. Idaho\u2019s strict ban criminalizes performing most abortions and does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion if the patient\u2019s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself in most circumstances. The Biden administration argued that the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also known as EMTALA. EMTALA requires all US hospitals that have received Medicare money \u2014 essentially nearly all of them \u2014 to screen everyone who comes into their emergency rooms to determine whether the person has an emergency medical condition without regard for their ability to pay for those services. The 1986 law requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or to transfer them to another facility that has that capacity. The hospitals must also treat these patients\u00a0\u201cuntil the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.\u201d Pregnant people were singled out in the law\u00a0in 1989, after reports that some hospitals were refusing to care for uninsured women in labor. Congress expanded EMTALA to specify how it included people who were pregnant and having contractions. In 2021, the Biden administration released the\u00a0Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor\u2019s duty to provide stabilizing treatment \u201cpreempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,\u201d although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided. In July 2022, the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0guidance\u00a0clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision means a hospital must provide an abortion if it\u2019s medically indicated in an emergency situation, even in states that have abortion bans or restrictions that don\u2019t provide an exception to protect the health of the mother \u2013 at least as the case makes it way through the courts. But the move would only delay the issue, says Molly Meegan, chief legal officer for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a professional organization that represents the majority of practitioners in the United States. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem at all. In fact, pregnant patients are still trying to obtain care and unable to get it, and physicians are trying to provide care without clear parameters and with draconian criminal penalties hanging over their heads if they get the question wrong,\u201d she said. Dr. Stella Dantas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision shows exactly why clinicians need to be protected from outside interference in their relationship with patients, particularly when they need emergency care. Dantas said a law created by politicians that restricts a doctor\u2019s ability to provide care in an emergency is like having someone who has never flown a plane create restrictions on what a pilot could do during a flight emergency. \u201cIf that person couldn\u2019t do x, y, or z, when they were trained, in a split-second, if something flew into the engine, you wouldn\u2019t feel safe, and it wouldn\u2019t be the best for any of those people flying on a plane,\u201d Dantas said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cThis case has illustrated for many how critical abortion care is for all of us. For clinicians who care about their patients, for patients who may someday need an abortion and for the people that love them. \u201cDepriving patients of evidence-based care is unacceptable.\u201d Idaho\u2019s abortion law had an immediate effect on hospitals in the state.\u00a0On January 5, the Supreme Court lifted an injunction so Idaho no longer had EMTALA protections for pregnancy complications. St. Luke\u2019s, the state\u2019s largest provider of emergency services, said in April it had to send six pregnant patients from its emergency department out of state via air transport to protect their health. The year before, when the injunction was in effect, the hospital had to do this only once. Meegan said the law hasn\u2019t just hurt patient care. Physicians have told the group that they are leaving the state because they don\u2019t feel that they can practice medicine in a way that\u2019s consistent with their ethical obligations, training and judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s an untenable situation,\u201d Meegan said. Dr. Kara Cadwallader, a doctor who works in Idaho and is a member of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, said that even last week, her hospital had to send a pregnant person out of state for care even though they typically could have treated her. She said Wednesday she was \u201cvery excited\u201d about the ruling, even if it is a \u201csmall step.\u201d \u201cBeyond all the political reasons, it\u2019s incredibly important for pregnant patients here in Idaho, who now will be able to access emergency care appropriately,\u201d Cadwallader said. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said that with this decision, the Biden administration will continue to uphold the law and the right to emergency care. The administration also plans to make it easier for someone who is denied care to be able to file a complaint. \u201cWhen the Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it unleashed an unprecedented assault on reproductive rights, and every day we see the consequences,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cUnder President Biden\u2019s leadership, we have worked directly with providers, hospitals, and community leaders across the country to navigate the chaos that the decision introduced.\u201d Still, abortion regulations around the country are murky. Professor Elizabeth Sepper, of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that \u201cin every other state with an abortion ban, confusion will continue to reign.\u201d \u201cEven where states have \u2018health\u2019 exceptions in their laws, they typically are narrower than what EMTALA requires,\u201d Sepper wrote in an email. Forty-one states have abortion bans in effect with only limited exceptions, and 14 states have total bans. Around the country, doctors are confused about what they are allowed to do, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a privately owned health care company that provides abortion care. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t only about Idaho. This is really something that all eyes and ears are watching from multiple states across the country to try to figure out what we\u2019re able to do to provide basic health care, even if abortion has been restricted,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cAbortion saves lives. Abortion is absolutely necessary, oftentimes in emergency room settings to protect the health of the pregnant person. I think providers really understand that their hands have been tied post-Roe here, since the Dobbs decision, in numerous states and numerous parts of the country. Standard care for a woman who needs an emergency abortion does not vary from state to state, said Dr. Nisha Verma, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Emory University in Georgia. However, she said, the kind of care a patient will receive is totally dependent on where she lives. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case did not address the medical complexities this kind of care requires, and it will lead to confusion, fear and delays in what can be life-saving care, she said. \u201cWhat we had really hoped for is the Supreme Court to come down very firmly that doctors should be able to provide care for patients, including in emergency situations where abortion care can often be needed to stabilize patients. I think that working here in Georgia, we are constantly in a state of confusion trying to navigate incredibly confusing laws with exceptions that just don\u2019t make sense on the ground, that don\u2019t take into consideration all of the complexity that we deal with every day,\u201d Verma said. The ruling does not change the situation in Texas, reproductive legal advocates say. Texas sued the US government over EMTALA guidance, and in 2022 a federal judge allowed the EMTALA to be blocked. The federal government has asked the Supreme Court to review the law. That case could potentially go before the Supreme Court next term. \u201cWe should have never been in a place where states like Idaho, Texas, and others across the country could have state bans that seek to ignore federal law, forcing providers to forfeit their best medical judgment and second guess the care they can provide out of fear of criminalization and other penalties,\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood said at a news conference Thursday. She called Thursday\u2019s decision \u201csupreme gaslighting\u201d that will allow the court to come back to the decisions down the road, \u201cperhaps leaving it for when it\u2019s more politically convenient.\u201d \u201cOur bodies, lives and futures are still under deliberation,\u201d McGill said. Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, said she sees Idaho as a \u201cvery cruel case study\u201d of what happens when the law strips pregnant people of their right to emergency abortion care. She said Wednesday that she was disappointed in the ruling because the court had the opportunity to uphold a law that gives everyone access to care \u2014 but failed to do so. \u201cThe right to emergency care is perhaps one of the most basic rights there is,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cWe were fighting for scraps in this case, and even with that, a majority of the Supreme Court was not willing to recognize the humanity of pregnant people, that they would be entitled to this basic right to emergency care.\u201d CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Carma Hassan, Jamie Gumbrecht and John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/emtala-emergency-care-scotus/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_health_ozempic-wegovy-blindness-rare-risk", "text": "People who take Ozempic or Wegovy may have a higher risk of developing a rare form of blindness, a new study suggests. Still, doctors say it shouldn\u2019t deter patients from using the medicines to treat diabetes or obesity. Last summer, doctors at Mass Eye and Ear noticed an unusually high number of patients with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, a type of eye stroke that causes sudden, painless vision loss in one eye. The condition is relatively rare \u2014 up to 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population may experience it \u2014 but the doctors noted three cases in one week, and each of those patients was taking semaglutide medications. A look back at six years of medical records showed that people with diabetes were more than four times more likely to be diagnosed NAION if they were taking a prescription semaglutide, and those who were overweight or obese were more than seven\u00a0times more likely to experience the condition if they were taking the medication. The risk was found to be greatest within the first year of receiving a prescription for semaglutide. The study, published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Ophthalmology, cannot prove that semaglutide medications cause NAION. And the small number of patients \u2014 an average of about 100 cases were identified each year \u2014 from one specialized medical center may not apply to a broader population. Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of the only semaglutide medications in the US, emphasized that the data in the new study is not sufficient to establish a causal association between the use of semaglutide medications and NAION. \u201cPatient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from the use of our medicines very seriously,\u201d a company spokesperson wrote in an email to CNN. Semaglutide prescriptions have soared in the US, which could raise the number of people at risk for a potential side effect. And NAION is the second-leading cause of optic nerve blindness after glaucoma. But even with an increased risk, the condition remains relatively uncommon. \u201cThe use of these drugs has exploded throughout industrialized countries and they have provided very significant benefits in many ways, but future discussions between a patient and their physician should include NAION as a potential risk,\u201d lead researcher Dr. Joseph Rizzo, director of the neuro-ophthalmology at Mass Eye and Ear and a professor at Harvard Medical School, said in a news release. \u201cOur findings should be viewed as being significant but tentative, as future studies are needed to examine these questions in a much larger and more diverse population.\u201d Experts agree that the potential risk of NAION should not deter the use of semaglutide medications to treat diabetes or obesity. \u201cIn the ever-changing landscape of systemic therapies, being vigilant for potential new disease associations is a duty we all share on behalf of patients,\u201d Susan Mollan, an ophthalmologist with the University Hospitals Birmingham in the UK wrote in a related commentary. But the large number of people who are taking semaglutide should raise confidence that the absolute risk of developing NAION as a result is rare. The ways that semaglutides interact with the eyes are not entirely understood. And the exact cause of NAION is not known either. The condition causes damage to the optic nerve, but there is often no warning before vision loss. Changes in blood sugar levels can affect the shape of an eye\u2019s lens and may affect vision, said Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist and director of obesity medicine at Endeavor Health in Chicago. She was not involved in the new study. And the use of semaglutides, which prompt the body to create more insulin to reduce blood sugar, has been previously linked to temporary vision changes \u2014 new or worsening cases of diabetic retinopathy, or damage to blood vessels at the back of the eye \u2014 likely related to the rapid improvement of blood sugars. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved labels for both Ozempic and Wegovy include vision changes among potential side effects, and Novo Nordisk is exploring the link between semaglutide use and diabetic retinopathy in a trial which they expect to complete 2027. \u201cPatient safety is paramount at the FDA and we continuously review available sources of data and new information on potential risks of drugs, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, and update labeling as needed to communicate new information on potential risks to healthcare providers and to patients as soon as possible,\u201d Chanapa Tantibanchachai, a press officer with the FDA, told CNN over email. While there is a \u201cbiologically plausible mechanism\u201d for a potential interaction, \u201c\u2018association is not causation\u2019 and diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for NAION,\u201d Dr. Andrew Lee, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and neuro-ophthalmologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, told CNN in an email. He was not involved in the new study. For now, patients who are taking semaglutide or considering treatment should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors, especially those who have other known optic nerve problems such as glaucoma or preexisting visual loss, experts say \u201cIt is important to consult with ophthalmology if patients experience visual changes,\u201d Narang said. \u201cIt is important to make sure patients are consulting with physicians who are also comfortable prescribing semaglutide and talking through what may be clinically relevant versus irrelevant, and discussing benefits versus risks of long-term therapy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/health/ozempic-wegovy-blindness-rare-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_travel_van-life-travel-cec-wellness", "text": "Home is where you are. Home is where you make it. Home on the range. Home is \u2026 in a camper van? Absolutely! When I tried camper van life for the first time, I went all in. For three weeks, my husband and I drove a kitted-out, circa 2012 Ford Econoline van across North America, traveling from northern New Jersey to Los Angeles as we wound our way along the length of Route 66 in November 2019. It was a bold move, but I knew it was the most cost-efficient and efficient-efficient way to see as much of \u201cthe Mother Road\u201d as we could. My hope was that by renting a camper van, we\u2019d save money on purchased meals and hotel rooms and also feel more immersed in the journey and deeply connected to each town we visited. Our first night in the Bloomington, Illinois, Walmart parking lot was a little nerve-racking. I lay in my sleeping bag, listening to the activity beyond the van and wondering if we could handle this adventure. But after the first successful sleepover, we quickly settled into a routine. We\u2019d wake up each morning for a quick bathroom run and even shower at some of the surprisingly luxurious recreational vehicle parks we patronized. Then we\u2019d cook breakfast on our camp stove at the rear of the van and hit the road by 8:30 or 9 a.m. After a day covering roughly 130 miles and experiencing the historic sites, local museums, former filling stations and proudly kitschy roadside attractions along Route 66, we\u2019d make sure to arrive at our nightly destination by 4:30 p.m. \u2014 sundown in November comes early. By the time we dropped off the van near Los Angeles International Airport in late November, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a new but dear friend on the last day of summer camp. We\u2019d unwind, explore the sights of the town, treat ourselves to dinner away from the van, then bunk down in our sleeping bags and do it all again the next day. (We spent two-thirds of the trip sleeping in the van and the other third in historic lodgings along the route, such as Boots Court in Carthage, Missouri, and the El Rancho in Gallup, New Mexico.) The benefits of camper van travel Now, I\u2019m not saying you must spend weeks on an epic road trip to fully experience the joy of a camper van. And I\u2019m certainly not saying you need to sell all your possessions and become a full-time van lifer \u2014 I\u2019m grateful to return to my house and my cats after every trip. But even a few days of traveling and living in a camper van can give you a whole new perspective on yourself and the world around you. When you\u2019re in a camper van, everything you need is within reach \u2014 to an extent. I loved the challenge of condensing our lives into approximately 75 square feet and finding creative ways to live comfortably but efficiently. The morning coffee? It\u2019s right there. Your outfit for the day? Just reach behind you. If you need to change your shoes into hiking boots, grab a raincoat for an unexpected downpour, refuel with a quick snack or recharge with a 20-minute power nap, you don\u2019t need to go far. And you don\u2019t have to repack your bags to leave a hotel every morning. After the first night, I embraced the security and sanctuary of the van, knowing that whatever we had was around us. If we couldn\u2019t find it right away, it wasn\u2019t lost. We had exactly everything we needed \u2014 everything except, well, a bathroom, which brings me to the next life-changing aspect of a camper van. Camper van life makes you brave and gets you out there, interacting with others and connecting with the world. You\u2019re always in the environment, not separated by hotel corridors and lobbies. You\u2019re discovering creative places to stay for the night, looking forward to chatting with bartenders during the nightly dinner at a local restaurant or just fielding questions from strangers about the van and your trip. During our Route 66 adventure, our van prompted exchanges and allowed us to have moments we would likely have missed in a rental car. In Arcadia, Oklahoma, we stopped by Pops 66 Soda Ranch and struck up a conversation with a woman admiring our brightly painted camper van. She told us about one of the chairs at the nearby Oklahoma City National Memorial representing a boy named Zackary who loved collecting pennies. The next morning, we found Zackary\u2019s chair and placed a penny on it for him. Because the van functioned as a full campsite rig, we didn\u2019t have to figure out the logistics of bringing or renting equipment to camp in Joshua Tree National Park in California. We spent two nights in wonder among the granite boulders, with Cassiopeia shining brightly above, and two mornings waking up with the sun and the scent of high desert air. Tips for trying the van life Ready to try camper van travel? Companies rent vans that come fully equipped with mini kitchens and bedding, so it\u2019s almost as easy as booking an Airbnb. Some even come with toilets and showers, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a deal-breaker. Rent one for a quick round-trip weekend visit or explore further by taking a one-way jaunt to another rental hub and then flying home. If you\u2019re itching to have a new type of travel experience, you\u2019ll find it behind the rolling door of a camper van. As another well-loved saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey\u201d \u2014 but with a camper van, you\u2019ll get to appreciate both at once.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/travel/van-life-travel-cec-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_health_hiking-heat-safety-wellness", "text": "With summer officially here, many people are excited to go hiking along their favorite local trails or tackle an out-of-town bucket-list hike. But before you grab your backpack and race out the door, hiking and safety officials urge caution. Temperatures are already soaring in many parts of the nation and around the world, and high heat has the potential to make any hike risky \u2014 and even deadly. Earlier in June, a young couple was rescued on a hiking trail in the California desert after running out of water and becoming dehydrated. The boyfriend was conscious during the rescue, but the girlfriend appeared unconscious, and medical officials referred to her \u201csevere condition,\u201d according to KTLA in Los Angeles. Others have not been as fortunate. Last year, a 14-year-old boy died while hiking with two family members in Texas\u2019 Big Bend National Park. The temperature was 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius). In 2021, a couple, their 1-year-old child and their dog all died in California while hiking in Devil\u2019s Gulch Valley on an extremely hot day. Experts said they likely perished from hyperthermia (an abnormally high body temperature) and dehydration. In Phoenix, where more than 200 hikers are rescued every year \u2014 mostly due to hiking during the hottest part of the day \u2014 the city instituted a program to close certain trails when the heat reaches excessive levels. How to tackle hiking in the heat Despite these heat-related dangers, it\u2019s possible to hit the trails safely when temperatures soar. Here\u2019s how to do so, according to experts. Prepare for a hot hike ahead of time Whether it\u2019s hot or cool, you should be in reasonable shape before tackling any hike. If you\u2019re planning a hilly, 5-mile trek, for example, make sure you\u2019re able to hike 5 challenging miles before arriving at the trailhead. To prepare for heat, become acclimatized to hot weather. You can do so by taking short, easy hikes in warm weather, progressing up to longer, more difficult hikes in hot weather. If that\u2019s not possible and you\u2019re traveling to a hot locale for your hike, schedule the trek several days into the trip when your body will be more accustomed to the weather. It\u2019s also good to know your sweat rate, said Dr. Floris Wardenaar, an assistant professor of nutrition\u00a0at Arizona State University in Phoenix. Wardenaar, who studies the physiological aspect of hiking, recommended weighing yourself before and after several hikes, then comparing any weight loss with the amount of water you consumed during the hike. \u201cBody mass loss is a good proxy marker of sweat loss,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lose more than 2% of your body weight on a hike.\u201d If you\u2019re losing more weight than that, you should be drinking more fluids. Load up on water and carry a water filter Water is essential for any hike, no matter the season \u2014 but it\u2019s critical in hot weather. Unfortunately, many people underestimate the amount of water they\u2019ll need. \u201cAlways hike with a water treatment device, too, and carry electrolytes,\u201d Martinez said. Electrolyte tablets or drinks help replace the salts and minerals lost through sweat, which assists in preventing heat-related ailments such as heatstroke and heat exhaustion. \u201cBring extra water, even if it\u2019s heavy,\u201d said Teresa Ana Martinez, executive director and cofounder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition. The Continental Divide Trail stretches 3,100 miles (4,989 kilometers) from Mexico to Canada, including some 800 miles (1,287.5\u00a0kilometers) in New Mexico, where there\u2019s plenty of desert terrain. Hike in the morning, preferably on shady trails \u201cThe benefit of hiking earlier in the day versus later in the evening is that in the evening, the earth still holds heat from the day,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cIt will radiate from the rocks, too.\u201d If possible, select a trail that winds through shady woods, along water or even in a cool canyon or cave. This way, should you struggle with the heat, you can find shade and water for cooling off. Wear light, loose clothing that covers most of your skin A long-sleeve shirt and pants might seem counterintuitive on a hot day, but they\u2019ll prevent sunburn and stop your skin and body from heating up. A neck buff and hiking gloves are also a good idea, said Abe Christian, operations manager for the Florida Trail Association. The Florida Trail meanders more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) through the state, from Big Cypress Swamp on the southern tip of the peninsula to Fort Pickens in the panhandle. \u201cThere are plenty of places on the Florida Trail where the sun can beat you to death,\u201d Christian said. \u201cSo you need to cover your skin as best as possible.\u201d The buff can also double as a compress should the heat get to you. Just dip it in water and place on your head and neck. Take along a sun umbrella, phone \u2014 and a buddy Make sure you have a fully charged phone in case you need to call for help. A portable battery is helpful, too. Martinez swears by a sun umbrella, which keeps the sun\u2019s rays from heating your head. (Look for those with an ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF, label or a seal of recommendation from groups such as the Skin Cancer Foundation.) If possible, bring along a friend. Sometimes when you\u2019re experiencing dehydration, heat exhaustion or heatstroke, you\u2019re not thinking clearly and don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in danger. When in doubt, turn around \u201cIf you start your hike and think it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too hot,\u201d Martinez said. Just turn around and come back another day, she said. Another tip: Turn around when half of your water is gone, even if you haven\u2019t reached your goal. \u201cYour ego is your worst enemy,\u201d Martinez warned. \u201cPeople underestimate how quickly things can escalate. You don\u2019t know when your body will say, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/health/hiking-heat-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness", "text": "More water, please. Millions of Americans are experiencing a record-breaking heat wave that has continued for days on end. We know that keeping hydrated is important to staying healthy in the summer heat, but is water still the best drink during a heat wave? Or should people turn to sports drinks instead? What about soda, coffee and beer \u2014 is it advisable to keep drinking these beverages during extremely hot weather? To help guide us through drinks we should choose \u2014 and avoid \u2014 during hot weather events, I spoke with CNN wellness health expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: How much water should people normally drink, and does that change during extreme hot weather? Dr. Leana Wen: A quick rule of thumb that\u2019s often cited is the \u201c8 x 8 rule,\u201d which is eight 8-ounce glasses of water, or 64 ounces, of water per day for adults. That\u2019s half a gallon. This rule is not set in stone. There are many factors that influence how much water people need, including the type of food they eat, their body size and their physical activity. Other factors include air temperature and humidity, and, specifically, how much time you spend outdoors during hot weather. People working in the heat or otherwise engaging in physical activity should drink an 8-ounce cup of water every 15 to 20 minutes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This would total about 24 to 32 ounces per hour. People should also keep well hydrated before and after their outdoor time in the heat. CNN: Is it possible to drink too much water? Wen: Yes. The CDC guidance is that people should not drink more than 48 ounces (about 1.5 quarts) of water or other fluids in an hour. A large amount of fluid all at once can dilute the concentration of salts in our blood and be unsafe. CNN: When it\u2019s really hot outside, is water still the best fluid, or should people turn to sports drinks?  Wen: Sports drinks are beverages with added electrolytes. Their main purpose is to replenish water and electrolytes that are lost with sweating. These drinks contain electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Some have added sugars like fructose, glucose and sucrose.  Most people do not need drinks other than water. In general, adults engaging in mild to moderate physical activity and kids playing on the playground or doing recreational after-school sports do not need electrolyte replacement. The foods that we eat contain the electrolytes we need. People who could consider sports drinks are athletes who are engaging in vigorous exercise for at least an hour outdoors in hot weather. Again, though, not all these individuals will need electrolyte replacement beyond what they get from eating normally. Whether they do depends on factors such as how much they sweat, how hot and humid the environment is and how intensely they exercise. CNN: What\u2019s better, a sports drink that comes ready-made in a bottle or an electrolyte powder that you can add to make your own drink? Wen: Personally, I prefer the powder. There are also tablets that dissolve in water. These do-it-yourself options are cheaper, and I like to choose the brands that don\u2019t have much added sugar or chemicals. But this is a question of personal preference. Whatever you buy, make sure to look carefully at the ingredients. For instance, if you don\u2019t want added sugar or caffeine, make sure what you\u2019re drinking doesn\u2019t have these ingredients. CNN: What about energy drinks? Are these a good replacement for water? Wen: This is an important question. The short answer is no, energy drinks are not a replacement for water. They should be used with caution in adults, and children should not drink them. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which are meant to help you restore water and electrolytes. Energy drinks are not meant mainly to hydrate you. They often contain large amounts of caffeine and other legal stimulants such as L-carnitine and guarana. While caffeine can boost energy in the short term, it is also a diuretic, meaning that it causes someone to lose water. Too much caffeine also can cause jitteriness, anxiety and irregular heartbeats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against energy drinks for children and adolescents. In some studies, though, as many as 30% to 50% of adolescents report using energy drinks. I urge parents to be careful to distinguish between sports drinks and energy drinks. Neither are needed, but energy drinks, in particular, should be used with caution. CNN: What about other drinks with caffeine, like coffee? Is a cold brew or iced mocha a bad idea in hot weather? Wen: Not necessarily, though people should be aware that these caffeinated drinks may not hydrate you and may even dehydrate you further. This doesn\u2019t mean you should stop all coffee when it\u2019s hot outside. Just be aware of the effect of caffeine and consider drinking extra water while you are enjoying caffeinated beverages. CNN: What about sodas, punches and alcoholic beverages? Wen: Sodas and punches are considered ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to many adverse long-term health consequences, such as increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. Consumption should generally be kept at a minimum, and hot weather is no exception. Again, water is the preferred substance for hydration. Alcohol is best avoided when it\u2019s very hot outside. Be especially careful not to drink large amounts and become inebriated, as this could blunt your body\u2019s response to temperature regulation. You also may miss early signs of heat-related illnesses. Alcohol can be dehydrating as well. If you do choose to drink alcohol, limit your drinks, make sure there are people around you in case you get into trouble medically and be sure to drink plenty of additional nonalcoholic fluids. CNN: What about kids who are in all-day sports camps? Wen: It\u2019s hard to answer this without knowing exactly how the camp is structured. Many sports camps have indoor activities for at least a portion of the day, and even those that are predominantly outdoors should move their activities indoors during extreme heat warnings. When in doubt, it\u2019s advisable to speak with the camp director and ask about how much time will be spent outdoors. If the time is limited, there are regular breaks and much of the activity is low to moderate intensity, it\u2019s probably sufficient to hydrate with water and supplement with nutrient-dense snacks such as watermelon, coconut and avocado. Also focus on hydrating before and after camp. Sports drinks probably aren\u2019t needed, and, again, it\u2019s advisable for children to avoid energy drinks. CNN: What other precautions would you follow during extreme heat? Wen: Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Take extra care of children and the elderly, as well as people with chronic medical conditions that could be exacerbated by the heat. Be careful while exercising and try to move activities indoors or go in the early morning or late evening. And make sure to keep well-hydrated with the best substance for hydration \u2014 water!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_health_parents-kids-screen-time-wellness", "text": "Whether it\u2019s\u00a0lockboxes\u00a0or\u00a0control apps, parents have searched far and wide for ways to reduce their child\u2019s screen time. A new\u00a0study\u00a0suggests that the answer may lie in the parent\u2019s own screen habits. Using a phone in front of your child can have more of an effect than you might think. The study, published this month in\u00a0the journal Pediatric Research, shows that parents\u2019 screen use is associated with increased adolescent screen time \u2013 along with problematic social media, video game and mobile phone use. Problematic use can include addictive behaviors such as withdrawal, building tolerance, relapse and obsessive thoughts, which may disrupt daily functioning, according to the study. The researchers analyzed data from the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, involving over 10,000 families with 12- and 13-year-olds. The data revealed that\u00a072.9% of parents said they use screens around their adolescents. This is a huge predictor of a child\u2019s screen use, according to Dr. Jason Nagata, lead study author and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. When a child sees their parent using a screen, experts say, they are likely to mimic the behavior. Surveyed parents rated their agreement with statements such as \u201cWhen I am with my child, I use a screen-based device\u201d on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Each point increase was associated with a nearly 40-minute rise in their children\u2019s screen time. \u201cEven if parents think their kids are not paying attention, the data shows one of the biggest predictors of preteen screen use is what their parents do with screens in front of them,\u201d Nagata said. Dr. Ken Ginsburg, a professor of pediatrics at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who was not involved in the study, added that parents are role models for their children 24/7. \u201cOur actions can speak so loudly that kids can\u2019t hear the words we are saying. Practicing what we preach makes all the difference,\u201d he said. Using screen time as a reward or consequence might also be counterproductive, increasing usage.\u00a0Preteens, who may be increasingly turning to social media for support and identity exploration, can view these parenting practices as intrusive, leading to rejection of rules, according to the study. \u201cWhen parents are overly controlling, it backfires,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cKids watch what we do and don\u2019t like to be controlled. When kids perceive we set rules to control them, they always go around those rules.\u201d The screen age Children\u2019s average daily screen time more than doubled during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to\u00a0previous research, and some nations are grappling with how to curb the potential negative effects. Regulators in China have\u00a0proposed\u00a0a two-hour daily limit on phone time for minors. In the US, the surgeon general has\u00a0called\u00a0for warning labels on social media apps to mitigate \u201csignificant harms\u201d associated with their use. \u201cScreen use is on the rise for everyone,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cWhile screens in themselves are not inherently bad \u2026 teenagers are particularly vulnerable to excessive use.\u201d Specifically, screen overuse reduces the essential sleep time and quality needed for a kid\u2019s healthy development, according to Nagata and previous research. Beyond role modeling, open communication and creating a media plan are effective strategies for balanced screen use, according to the study and guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Family Media Plan. Dr. Susan Tomopoulos, co-developer of the plan and an associate professor of pediatrics at NYU\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine who was not part of the new study, said the increased pandemic screen times were an impetus for the academy to update its media recommendations. \u201cAfter the pandemic, parents were turning to doctors because they wanted to manage their family\u2019s media habits,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they were overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know where to start.\u201d Setting up healthy media practices begins with a family conversation to customize screen time guidelines and outline screen-free zones around the house, according to the academy. This is especially important in the bedroom and dining room, where screen presence is associated with higher adolescent screen time and problematic social, video game and mobile phone use, the study found. Prioritizing screen-free activities and face-to-face time is crucial for a child\u2019s healthy development, according to Tomopoulos. \u201cIt is so easy for adults, as well as kids, to get caught up in swiping and scrolling. We really want entire families to check their digital habits at home \u2026 and to talk early and often about technology media,\u201d she added. How to have a conversation with your child Initiating a productive discussion on media use starts with conveying to the child, \u201cI set rules because I care,\u201d according to Ginsburg, who is also co-founder and program director of the\u00a0Center for Parent and Teen Communication. \u201cOne of the biggest myths is that teenagers do not care what their parents say. When we set rules, it is important we communicate why,\u201d he said. \u201cThe baseline should be \u2018I care about you, and therefore blank,\u2019 instead of \u2018don\u2019t do blank.\u2019 \u201d The conversation may end with an agreement on certain principles such as establishing a \u201cone screen at a time\u201d rule and limiting screens at mealtime, bedtime and study time, as\u00a0recommended\u00a0by the American Academy of Pediatrics. As the ABCD Study continues to follow participants into adulthood, research into the long-term effects of excessive adolescent screen use is also unfolding. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot more guidance for parents to help their children navigate social media,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cThe goal is to give children the skills to develop healthy screen behaviors for their young adulthood and beyond.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story spelled Dr. Ken Ginsburg\u2019s name incorrectly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/parents-kids-screen-time-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_health_exercise-mental-health-happiness-wellness", "text": "Think back to when you were a kid and movement was instinctive \u2014 and often infused with pure joy. Maybe it was racing your sister and dad to the front door. Or jumping on the bed with friends during a sleepover. Or playing a team sport. Or riding your bike around the park. For many, the link between movement and joy was severed and forgotten somewhere along the road to adulthood, displaced by the realities and responsibilities of daily life. Movement might have been transformed into something more obligatory \u2014 we must do it to optimize our health or get in shape. Or it might have become too time-consuming. For some, it might even have become painful due to injury, disease or the passage of time. But we abandon movement at our own peril and at risk of our well-being. Studies have found that movement \u2014 and its more challenging and intentional cousin, exercise \u2014 is not only beneficial for physical health but is also closely associated with mental status and mood. \u201cI always say that exercise is like an intravenous dose of hope,\u201d psychologist Kelly McGonigal told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life recently. \u201cAnd it\u2019s any form of movement that you\u2019re willing to do with any part of your body that you can still move.\u201d McGonigal is the author of \u201cThe Joy of Movement: How Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage.\u201d A group fitness instructor and a lecturer at Stanford University, she has used movement and exercise throughout her life to manage her own anxiety and depression. McGonigal\u00a0said exercise allows for the creation and release of \u201chope\u201d molecules, technically called myokines, during muscle contractions \u2014 for example, when we work out or even just move around. Some of these myokines can have antidepressant effects. \u201cOur muscles do more than just move our bones around or stabilize our skeleton,\u201d she said. \u201cOur muscles are almost like endocrine organs. They manufacture these molecules that they can release into the bloodstream that then travel around and affect all of our organs.\u00a0And some of them can cross the blood-brain barrier and affect your brain, including your mood and your mental health and your brain health.\u201d Exercise enables you to see your body as an ally, according to McGonigal. \u201cI think this is one of the coolest bits of the science of movement and exercise, particularly because of how it allows us to feel like our body is our friend,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our partner, not something we\u2019re trying to fix or control through movement.\u201d McGonigal said many other brain chemicals get released during exercise that can affect someone\u2019s state of mind, resulting in, for example, a runner\u2019s high, a flow state and even euphoria. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a lot of different kind of brain states you could experience in movement; it\u2019s not one \u2018thing,\u2019\u201d she said. You can listen to the full discussion here. What can you do to tap into joy during exercise and movement? McGonigal has these five tips. Take your workout on the road Head out into nature. \u201cWe know that mindful forms of movement, as well as moving outdoors in nature, tends to put the brain in a state of this heightened awareness to the present moment that feels like vitality and connection to life,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cPeople often feel a relief from inner chatter and stress and worrying. \u2026 It\u2019s changing which systems of the brain are most active and putting you in a state that\u2019s like meditation.\u201d Pump up the volume Queue up your favorite playlist and get moving. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a workout where you\u2019re listening to music you love that\u2019s high energy, you\u2019re moving to the beat, and you\u2019re doing things that really get your heart rate up \u2026 it often is more like euphoria,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel incredible, and you\u2019ve got those endorphins, and that brain chemistry also really helps you feel connected to other people.\u201d Join the group Being social helps you exercise. \u201cMake movement social. We know that people form friendships and communities of support through movement, whether it\u2019s strength training or running,\u201d McGonigal said. These days, who couldn\u2019t use another friend or source of support? Exercise also helps you be more social. \u201cPeople who exercise, they report being less lonely, they report having better relationships with others and \u2014 for reasons that range from the biochemical and how the brain chemistry of exercise primes you to be more social \u2014 to be able to connect with others better,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIf you are socially anxious and you exercise, by the end of that workout, you\u2019re going to be almost like a more extroverted version of yourself.\u201d Get back to basics Find something you really like doing. \u201cThink about positive experiences you\u2019ve had with movement in your life,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cMaybe go back to something that you miss or find a new way to do it.\u201d Change your mindset to one of gratitude While you are moving, find ways to appreciate your body for being able to move, as opposed to monitoring it. Adopt a \u201cmindset switch of, \u2018Wow, body \u2014 that was incredible!\u2019 Or \u2018Thank you, body, for having the energy to let me do this,\u2019\u201d McGonigal said.

{"id": "travel_summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn", "text": "Do you yearn for long days and short nights? Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers. The summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It\u2019s the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It\u2019s also the first official day of summer. Our ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion.\u00a0Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge). Pagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe. The mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility \u2013 both the plant and human variety \u2013 in destinations worldwide. The science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia. Summer solstice science Is it summer solstice all over the world? No. It\u2019s only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world\u2019s population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there. When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on\u00a0June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that\u2019s 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool. Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador\u2019s capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight. But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn\u2019t get that dark.\u00a0 The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They\u2019ll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order. Why don\u2019t we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night\u00a0back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That\u2019s because the Earth is aligned on an\u00a0axis, an imaginary pole\u00a0going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts \u2013 at\u00a0an angle of 23.5 degrees. \u201cAs Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun\u2019s direct rays,\u201d explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that\u2019s the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox. Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it\u2019s not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US. \u201cOn average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\u201d says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward. \u201cTemperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night \u2013 so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\u201d says Ward. \u201cThe only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\u201d\u00a0because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August. The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe. How to celebrate summer solstice What does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically. The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at\u00a0summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times. The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise. What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day. In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night \u2013 a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires. In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations\u2019 International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}

Facts Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common form of dementia, which is a general term for the loss of memory and intellectual abilities. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is fatal and there is no cure. It is a slow-moving disease that starts with memory loss and ends with severe brain damage. The disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, the neuropathologist did an autopsy on the brain of a woman who died after exhibiting language problems, unpredictable behavior and memory loss. Dr. Alzheimer discovered the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are considered the hallmarks of the disease. Contributing Factors:Age - The likelihood of developing Alzheimer\u2019s doubles every five years after the age of 65. For most people, symptoms first appear after the age of 60. Family history - Genetics play a role in an individual\u2019s risk of developing the disease. Head trauma - There is a possible link between the disease and repeated trauma or loss of consciousness. Heart health - The risk of vascular dementia increases with heart conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. Possible Symptoms:Memory lossRepeating questions and statementsPoor judgmentMisplacing itemsMood and personality changesConfusionDelusions and paranoiaImpulsivenessSeizures Difficulty swallowing  National Estimates According to the CDC, an estimated 6.5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is the fifth leading cause of death for adults in the United States aged 65 or older. The estimated cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementias in the United States in 2023 is $345 billion. Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s is an uncommon form of dementia that strikes people younger than age 65. Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease often runs in families. Research March 9, 2014 - In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers report they have developed a blood test that predicts with astonishing accuracy whether a healthy person will develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. September 2014 - The research journal Aging reports that in a small study at UCLA, nine out of the 10 patients involved, said their symptoms reversed after they participated in a rigorous program that included things like optimizing Vitamin D levels in the blood, using DHA supplements to bridge broken connections in the brain and strategic fasting to normalize insulin levels. September 11, 2015 - The Journal of Neurology publishes a study that suggests that the compound resveratrol, when taken in concentrated doses, may have benefit in slowing the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. November 23, 2016 - US drugmaker Eli Lilly announces it is ending the Phase 3 clinical trial of its Alzheimer\u2019s drug solanezumab. \u201cPatients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with placebo,\u201d the company says in a statement. February 2017 - The drug company Merck halts the late-stage trial of its Alzheimer\u2019s drug verubecestat, after an independent study found that it had \u201cvirtually no chance\u201d of working. July 25, 2018 - Additional results of an early clinical trial for an experimental drug, the antibody called BAN2401, shows that it improved cognition and reduced clinical signs of Alzheimer\u2019s in the brains of study participants. Details about the immunotherapy were announced at a news conference during the 2018 Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference. February 28, 2019 - The journal Nature Genetics publishes a study that reveals four new genetic variants that increase risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The genes appear to work in tandem to control bodily functions that affect disease development. March 21, 2019 - Pharmaceutical company Biogen announces that they are ending two Phase 3 clinical trials of a drug that targets the buildup in the brain of beta-amyloid, one of two proteins that researchers believe contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s. The drug, called aducanumab, was considered to be a promising candidate in improving cognitive function. In October, Biogen announces that it will apply for regulatory approval for aducanumab and begin new studies. \u201cThe decision to file is based on a new analysis, conducted by Biogen in consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), of a larger dataset from the Phase 3 clinical studies that were discontinued in March 2019 following a futility analysis.\u201d March 13, 2021 - The New England Journal of Medicine publishes a study indicating that Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s experimental intravenous drug donanemab could slow the cognitive decline of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, according to early clinical trial results.  June 7, 2021 - The FDA approves the use of the experimental drug aducanumab for early phases of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, despite an FDA advisory committee concluding last year that there is not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of the treatment. This is the first time since 2003 the FDA has approved a novel therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s. On January 31, 2024, Biogen announces it is discontinuing the drug aducanumab as it shifts resources to other Alzheimer\u2019s medication.  April 4, 2022 - A study that uncovered an additional 42 genes connected to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is published.  April 7, 2022 - The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announces it will restrict coverage of the controversial and costly Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm to those enrolled in qualifying clinical trials. May 4, 2022 - The FDA announces that it permitted marketing for a new diagnostic test for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is the first in vitro diagnostic test that could offer an alternative to tools like PET scans, which are currently used to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease. June 30, 2022 - Scientists identify a gene that appears to increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s in women, providing a potential new clue as to why more women than men are diagnosed with the disease. The gene, O6-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase, or MGMT, plays an important role in how the body repairs damage to DNA in both men and women. But researchers did not find an association between MGMT and Alzheimer\u2019s in men. January 6, 2023 - The FDA grants accelerated approval for the drug lecanemab, which will be marketed as Leqembi. It has shown \u201cpotential\u201d as an Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment by appearing to slow progression, according to Phase 3 trial results, but it has raised safety concerns due to its association with certain serious adverse events, including brain swelling and bleeding. July 6, 2023 - The FDA grants traditional full approval to Leqembi, the first medicine proven to slow the course of Alzheimer\u2019s. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that it will now expand coverage of the drug, broadening access for up to an estimated million people with early forms of the disease. January 22, 2024 - A new study in the JAMA Neurology journal suggests testing a person\u2019s blood for a type of protein called phosphorylated tau, or p-tau, can be used to screen for Alzheimer\u2019s disease with \u201chigh accuracy,\u201d even before symptoms begin to show. July 2, 2024 - The FDA approves donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Donanemab, made by Eli Lilly, works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2013/08/23/health/alzheimers-disease-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_07_02_health_fda-brominated-vegetable-oil-ban-wellness", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration will no longer allow the use of brominated vegetable oil in food products, the agency said Tuesday. Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) is vegetable oil modified with the chemical bromine and has been used in small amounts to keep citrus flavoring from floating to the top in beverages, according to an FDA statement. Dozens of products \u2014 mostly sodas \u2014 use BVO as an ingredient, according to the Food Scores database run by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that focuses on consumer health, toxic chemicals and pollutants. The rule that no longer allows BVO in food will go into effect August 2, but companies will have one year after that date to reformulate and relabel their products as well as deplete their BVO inventory, according to the FDA statement. The food additive was removed from the FDA\u2019s list of Generally Recognized As Safe or \u201cGRAS\u201d substance list in 1970 and has been regulated since then, the agency said. Because of the past restrictions, there are only a small number of products that still contain BVO, the FDA said. \u201cOver the years many beverage makers reformulated their products to replace BVO with an alternative ingredient,\u201d James Jones, FDA deputy commissioner for human foods, said in a 2023 statement. Additionally, a 2012 Change.org petition with more than 200,000 signatures brought attention to health concerns, according to an EWG news release. It also said many companies eliminated it from consumer products due to market pressure. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation into law in October 2023 prohibiting the manufacture, sale or distribution of foods that contain BVO as well as red dye No. 3, potassium bromate and propylparaben. Studies point to health concerns Brominated vegetable oil can accumulate in the body and has been linked to health hazards, according to the EWG. Those include nervous system damage, headaches, skin and mucous membrane irritation, fatigue and loss of muscle coordination and memory. A 1976 study found that consumption of BVO by pigs damaged their hearts, kidneys, livers and testicles. The FDA cited a 2022 study in the proposal to revoke the BVO regulation that found rates given BVO had the substance\u2019s derivatives accumulated in their heart, liver and fat. The reconsideration of BVO regulations shows that the FDA is reviewing new evidence as it emerges and responding to public concerns, CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen said in a previous story. What should people do until the BVO ban goes into effect on August 2? \u201cMy takeaway from the studies is that how much and how often you drink matters,\u201d Wen said. \u201cIf someone drinks one soda at a barbecue that happens to contain BVO, that\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cHowever, if someone is drinking a soda a day, every day, they should be careful and check out the ingredients.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/fda-brominated-vegetable-oil-ban-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk", "text": "GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy may help lower the risk of certain cancers, a new study suggests. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting 13 types of cancer, and the risk increases the longer a person is overweight and the more excess weight they gain. About 40% of new cancer diagnoses are associated with excess weight, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, there were about 170 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people, CDC data shows. But a study published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with a class of GLP-1 drugs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with 10 of the 13 obesity-associated cancers than those who were taking insulin. The risk was cut by more than half for gallbladder cancer, meningioma, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, a kind of liver cancer. It was also significantly reduced for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and kidney cancer. Excess weight can cause changes in the body such as long-lasting inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones that can cause cancer, according to the CDC. And GLP-1 medications interact with systems related to insulin production. The new findings that link GLP-1 treatment to reduced risk of some cancers \u201ccompare favorably\u201d with similar effects linked to intensive lifestyle intervention and metabolic-bariatric surgery that have been found in other trials, the study authors wrote. However, the research found that GLP-1 treatment was not associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, which CDC data shows is the most common type of cancer associated with obesity. Risk was also not reduced for stomach cancer or thyroid cancer. In fact, other research has found that GLP-1s may interact with the body\u2019s insulin production in ways that negatively affect the thyroid, and the study authors note that patients should be aware of potential thyroid-related risks that are included on the medication\u2019s packaging. The new study also found that the risk of cancer diagnosis for people with type 2 diabetes was not different among those who were treated with GLP-1s compared with those where were being treated with metformin. In fact, the risk of diagnosis with kidney cancer was higher among those using GLP-1s than those on metformin. For this study, researchers from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and the MetroHealth System analyzed more than a decade of medical records for nearly 1.7 million people with type 2 diabetes. More information is needed about how reduced cancer risk may relate to the scale of weight loss, but the findings provide \u201cpreliminary evidence of the potential benefit of GLP-1RAs for cancer prevention in high-risk populations and support further preclinical and clinical studies,\u201d the study authors wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/glp-1-weight-loss-lower-cancer-risk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_08_18_health_dengue-what-to-know-wellness", "text": "Dengue virus is the most common mosquito-spread virus globally, but generally relatively rare in the continental United States. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week about a higher-than-expected number of dengue cases among US travelers \u2014 745 cases through June 24 \u2014 as well as a public health emergency in Puerto Rico, where the virus is endemic. Global infections in 2024 have been the highest on record, with cases in the Americas already reaching 9.7 million \u2014\u00a0exceeding the highest number ever recorded\u00a0in a single year. What is dengue, and where is it common? Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is spread mainly via the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also known to carry several other viruses such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, according to the CDC. Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to WHO. It\u2019s also endemic in the US territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and American Samoa. More than 34,000 locally acquired cases were reported in the US between 2010 and 2023, according to CDC data. A handful of outbreaks of locally transmitted cases have been reported in states with warmer climates, including Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona. California reported its first locally-transmitted case in Pasadena\u00a0last year. But almost all US cases are reported in Puerto Rico, says Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey, chief of the Dengue Branch in the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told CNN previously. And that\u2019s not a surprise. \u201cIt has the perfect climate for it. It\u2019s a tropical island,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are indeed efforts from the health department and other organizations like the Puerto Rico vector control unit to control dengue in the area.\u201d This includes public education and integrated mosquito management such as \u201cremoving places where the mosquitoes lay eggs, and that is done through community engagement, but also clean-up campaigns,\u201d Paz-Bailey said. Similar efforts are also recommended in the rest of the US and its territories, she noted. Dengue symptoms Only about 1 in 4 people infected with dengue will have symptoms. The most common symptom is fever, and it can also cause nausea, vomiting, rash or aches and pains \u2013 typically behind the eyes or muscle, joint or bone pain. There are four strains of the virus, or serotypes, according to the World Health Organization. Once someone catches one of the strains, it can\u2019t infect them again. But the more times someone is infected with different strains, the more likely they are to become severely ill. Severe dengue\u00a0is less common, with about 1 in 20 people developing it. But the symptoms are more troubling. It can cause shock, internal bleeding and even death. About 100 million people get sick and 40,000 die of severe dengue around the world each year, according to the CDC. Testing for dengue If you get sick and live in an area where dengue might be spreading or have traveled to a place where the virus is common, the CDC recommends consulting your doctor. The only definite way to know if you have the virus is through blood testing, which varies from place to place, Paz-Bailey said. The general recommendation is to do a PCR test, she says, if your symptoms started within a week or less. \u201cIf the person presents beyond the seven-day window, a serological test to measure IgM antibodies is recommended,\u201d Paz-Bailey said. It can take a day to a week to get those results, she says. Dengue vaccine and treatment The US Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine for dengue in 2019 and the CDC recommends it to children ages 9 to 16 who have laboratory-confirmed evidence of a dengue infection and who live in areas of the United States where dengue is endemic or regularly occurring. The vaccine requires three doses, given six months apart. However, Sanofi-Pasteur said it will stop manufacturing the vaccine, Dengvaxia, due to a lack of demand in the global market. There is no dengue vaccine available for adults in the US. The CDC said there are two other dengue vaccines approved or in development, but they are not currently available in the United States. There\u2019s also no specific medicine to treat dengue, the CDC says. Over-the-counter meds like acetaminophen can ease fever or pain, but experts say not to take aspirin or ibuprofen because they can increase the risk of hemorrhaging sometimes seen with dengue. Protecting yourself from dengue Preventing mosquito bites\u00a0and\u00a0controlling mosquitoes\u00a0in and around the home are the key ways to prevent dengue. If you\u2019re going outside, the CDC recommends US Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellents to prevent bites from mosquitoes that may be carrying dengue. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants is another option, along with treating your clothing with 0.5% permethrin, an insecticide. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which spreads dengue and other viruses, does not like to travel far and prefers to breed in our backyards, said Dr. Isik Unlu, acting director and operations manager of the Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control Division. \u201cThey prefer to be around people. That is the problem,\u201d she said, adding that the species is often found in containers that collect rainwater, especially during the summer months. Almost everything you see in a backyard can become a breeding ground, Unlu says, including birdbaths, plant saucers, tires, extension gutters and kiddie pools. Unlu and Paz-Bailey recommend removing standing water around your home as often as possible to prevent mosquitoes from gathering and breeding. Mosquito surveillance in the US In Florida, Unlu and her team are often called out to homes where mosquito infestations are reported. If they find a large population of adult mosquitoes, the team heads out in the middle of the night to spray the area with insecticide. Her county has hundreds of mosquito traps set. \u201cWhen we collect the mosquitos from these traps, especially if it\u2019s an area that we suspect dengue is circulating or we have confirmed cases, our research team assists us to process these mosquitos,\u201d Unlu said. The mosquitos are evaluated for sex, counted, put in test tubes and sent to a lab outside Orlando to be tested for dengue and other viruses. Dengue is not considered endemic to Florida, according to the CDC. Unlu says this is largely due to disease surveillance operations. But the virus is present in the southern part of the state because of people traveling to places where it is endemic, such as Cuba or Brazil. \u201cWe get residents who go on vacation or visit their family where dengue is endemic and more common, and they get bitten there, and then they travel back here,\u201d Unlu said. \u201cAnd since we have the vector, Aedes aegypti, here, when they get bit, the mosquitos then get infected, and then they bite another human being who never traveled outside Miami, and they get sick.\u201d The CDC\u2019s Paz-Bailey says climate change will also encourage the spread of dengue around the world. \u201cHigher temperatures will probably expand the range of places where a mosquito can survive. And then it can also facilitate transmission through other ways, like faster viral replication in the mosquito and increased survival of mosquitoes,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

Prophet Premium Blends issued a\u00a0recall\u00a0of Diamond Shruumz products last week, citing muscimol, a chemical from Amanita mushrooms, as the possible cause of the reported symptoms. The FDA is reviewing this information, and according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the cause of the reported illnesses is not known. The company says in a notice on the Diamond Shruumz website, \u201cAt Prophet Premium Blends, we prioritize the health and safety of our consumers above all else. Recently, we have been\u00a0made aware of reported incidents involving our product,\u00a0Diamond Shruumz.

{"id": "2024_07_02_health_lilly-azheimers-donanemab-fda", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to slow the progression of early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Donanemab, made by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly, works by helping the body remove amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Lilly said it will be sold under the name Kisunla and would cost $695 per vial before insurance, what would amount to $12,522 for a six-month course or about $32,000 for a year, depending on when the patient would complete their treatment. Donanemab is not a cure, but clinical trials showed that it slowed the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s, allowing people to live independent lives for longer and safely participate in everyday activities. Lilly told\u00a0a committee of FDA advisers in June that\u00a0late-stage clinical research data\u00a0showed \u201chighly meaningful results\u201d for people who took donanemab, with about 35% lower risk of progression of the disease over a year and a half compared with those who got a placebo. The FDA advisers\u00a0voted\u00a0that the treatment appeared safe and effective. Although rare, there were some serious adverse events during the drug trial, Lilly told the committee, occurring in only 2% of patients. The participants who took donanemab had a slightly higher mortality rate: 2%, compared with 1.7% in the placebo arm of the trial. Three people died while taking the drug after developing ARIA, micro-hemorrhages known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Because most of the ARIA\u00a0incidents came in the first six weeks of the trial, Lilly told the FDA advisers that it added another MRI exam to the trial before giving second doses in order to detect people with asymptomatic ARIA. If it was detected, providers would pause treatment so it could resolve and not become more serious or symptomatic. Kisunla is not the first monoclonal antibody treatment approved to treat early Alzheimer\u2019s. Eisai and Biogen\u2019s\u00a0lecanemab, sold as Leqembi, is already being used. Another drug by Biogen, aducanumab, sold as Aduhelm, in 2021 became the first such therapy to get accelerated FDA approval, but\u00a0the company said\u00a0it will stop making it by the\u00a0end of this year\u00a0as it shifts resources to its other Alzheimer\u2019s drug. In trials of Leqembi, the drug that\u2019s already on the market, some participants also had ARIA, but it was at a lower rate than seen in the donanemab trial. Leqembi has also\u00a0been tied\u00a0to patient deaths. Kisunla was approved with instructions that prescribers can consider stopping the patient\u2019s treatment if they see improvement based on brain scans. The potential to complete the treatment after a limited course of therapy, Lilly said, could lower out-of-pocket costs. Kisunla otherwise costs more than Leqembi, which runs about $26,500 per year. Lilly said Tuesday that because the medicines work best in the early symptomatic stage of the disease, it\u2019s working with others to improve early detection and diagnosis. \u201cEach year, more and more people are at risk for this disease, and we are determined to make life better for them,\u201d said Anne White, executive vice president and president of Lilly Neuroscience. One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia,\u00a0according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, killing more people than prostate and breast cancer combined. Successful treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s can\u2019t come fast enough,\u00a0advocates for patients say, and could be a big help to a growing number of people who are predicted to develop the disease. The number of people projected to have Alzheimer\u2019s is predicted to grow to nearly 14 million by 2060,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0As of 2023,\u00a0about 6.7 million Americans 65 and older  live with Alzheimer\u2019s. The disease doesn\u2019t just affect patients. More than 11 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias in 2022 alone,\u00a0research\u00a0shows,\u00a0while there has been an\u00a0ongoing shortage of paid workers and medical professionals. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association said Tuesday that it was celebrating the announcement of the approval of the treatment. \u201cThis is real progress. Today\u2019s approval allows people more options and greater opportunity to have more time,\u201d Dr. Joanne Pike, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said in a news release. \u201cHaving multiple treatment options is the kind of advancement we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2014 all of us who have been touched, even blindsided, by this difficult and devastating disease.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/health/lilly-azheimers-donanemab-fda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}

Infections are probably growing in at least 38 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Wastewater surveillance suggests that viral activity is still relatively low, but hospitalizations and deaths are also ticking up. Covid-19 levels are especially high in the West, where viral levels are back to what they were in February, and in the South, according to the CDC. \u201cThe virus tends to replicate well and to stay alive in an environment with warm and moist conditions.

But whether that pattern is going to continue or whether it will become an all-year-round disease or whether it will stay in one particular time \u2014 I think it\u2019s a little early to say.\u201d Data from WastewaterSCAN, a nationwide sewage surveillance network based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, suggests that this summer wave started weeks earlier than last summer\u2019s wave and has reached levels similar to last summer\u2019s peak. \u201cIt remains to be seen if this will be a peak level for this surge,\u201d said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, assistant professor of environmental health at Emory and program director for WastewaterSCAN. \u201cWe are always trying to unpack what is potential seasonality with Covid and also what are the impacts of new variants that may be coming through that drive these surges that we see more regularly, more frequently than we do for influenza and RSV,\u201d she said. Over the past few months, the JN.1 virus variant that drove this winter\u2019s surge has been overtaken by newer offshoots. These so-called FLiRT variants \u2014 an acronym that refers to the locations of the amino acid\u00a0mutations that the virus has picked up \u2014 have changes in some places that help them evade the body\u2019s immune response and others that help them become more transmissible. Two of them \u2014 KP.3 and KP.2 \u2014 now account for more than half of the new Covid infections in the US, according to CDC data. Expect an updated vaccine this fall Because of manufacturing timelines, experts have to make predictions now if they want a new vaccine for fall. Earlier this month, the FDA endorsed a plan to update the Covid-19 shots to be more effective against the JN.1 lineage of the coronavirus. But the agency later updated its own recommendation. Vaccine manufacturers were advised to target the KP.2 strain if possible, in part because of the \u201crecent rise in cases.\u201d \u201cJN.1 has continued to evolve, and it makes it somewhat difficult to pick the particular specific strain to be used,\u201d Dr. Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told an independent advisory committee ahead of the initial recommendation. The new vaccines \u2014 some that will make the switch to target KP.2 \u2014 are anticipated to become available between mid-August and late September. That\u2019s enough time to offer protection during the winter respiratory virus season but probably after this summer\u2019s wave has ebbed. On Thursday, the CDC recommended that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated Covid-19 vaccine for the 2024-25 season. The recommendation echoes the vote of that agency\u2019s independent advisory committee. \u201cIt makes sense to do that vaccine at the same time that you\u2019re expecting flu and RSV, because you just want to reduce the overall incidence of disease,\u201d Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told CNN. Protection from Covid-19 vaccines wanes, and the timing of the shot prioritizes maximum protection when there have typically been higher and more sustained peaks, Plescia said. Unlike flu and RSV, Covid-19 is constantly circulating; it doesn\u2019t offer a reprieve. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever get a break,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do get a break from flu and RSV. You get through the season, and then you\u2019re done. You can prepare for the next one. [Covid] is just kind of always there.\u201d Flu and RSV levels now remain low in the US, according to the latest CDC update. But vaccination rates for all three major respiratory viruses lagged during the winter season, and the CDC advisers also looked ahead to the upcoming season with discussions around vaccine coverage recommendations for flu and RSV. On Wednesday, the CDC updated its recommendations on who should get the RSV vaccine. For the upcoming respiratory virus season, everyone 75 and older is urged to get an RSV vaccine, as well as those ages 60 to 74 who are at higher risk of severe illness. The changes are meant to \u201csimplify RSV vaccine decision-making for clinicians and the public,\u201d the agency said. When it comes to infectious respiratory diseases, Plescia said, \u201cpeople need to remember that there are things you can do to reduce your risk. And getting vaccinated is the main one.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/covid-summer-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_health_summer-food-safety-wellness", "text": "This Independence Day holiday takes place as\u00a0record-breaking heat waves\u00a0have spread across many parts of the US and the world, and the temperatures could be deadly. There\u2019s potential for record-breaking heat and extreme heat risk for portions of the South and Southwest. California is likely to be especially hard hit, with highs passing 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) in many areas. At the same time, the avian influenza outbreak has spread to cows, raising questions about whether certain foods like milk, eggs and hamburgers remain safe. As I drank lots of water and perspired through high temperatures and humidity at an outdoor concert this week, I thought about safely celebrating the Fourth of July holiday. What about all the grilled meat, burgers and potato salad sitting outside in the heat?\u00a0How can we stay cool while attending picnics and barbecues during this holiday weekend? Are there additional food safety precautions we should take, given the predicted high temperatures? And are there other health factors to consider this holiday, such as keeping cool and well-hydrated? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: Can you remind us why food safety is important? Dr. Leana Wen: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are around 9 million episodes of foodborne illness annually. These illnesses primarily occur when people ingest food or drink that has been contaminated with bacteria, viruses or parasites. Most episodes are mild, though even mild illnesses are unpleasant\u2014they are generally characterized by nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Some people can become very sick and require hospitalization, and unfortunately, some can die. Those at highest risk for severe illness include older individuals, children under 5, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems. CNN: What food precautions should people take for barbecues and other outdoor gatherings? Wen: Undercooked meat contains a lot of infectious organisms. The best way to make sure meat is cooked thoroughly is to use an internal thermometer. I recommend this US government food safety website to check the internal temperature that different types of meat should be cooked to. For instance, chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit, and ground beef should be cooked to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the meat is cooked, keep it at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or above until serving to prevent germs from developing. Prior to cooking, refrigerate raw meat rather than keeping it at room temperature. It should be removed just before being placed on a barbeque. CNN: Given how hot the weather might be this week, are there other specific factors to consider? Wen: Yes. Under normal weather circumstances, the advice from the US Department of Agriculture is that perishable food can be unrefrigerated for up to two hours. However, if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, that\u2019s reduced to one hour. That applies to cooked meat like hamburgers as well as perishable salads like potato salad and cole slaw. In hot weather, these items should be eaten right away; if not, they should be refrigerated within an hour. CNN: What about people who are having barbecues at parks or other places without refrigerators? Wen: They should have a well-insulated cooler with lots of ice. Raw, uncooked meat should be kept at 40-degrees Fahrenheit or lower until it is ready to go on the grill. I also recommend keeping uncooked meat in tightly sealed bags so that it does not contaminate other items that are served raw, like veggies and fruit. Another precaution for barbeques is to keep an eye on what utensils and plates you use for raw meat versus other food. Label the utensils, plates and containers that come into contact with raw meat. Keep them separate from plates that contain salad items, fruit, chips, buns and other items. CNN: And make sure to wash your hands after touching raw meat? Wen: Yes, absolutely. You don\u2019t want to go right from handling raw hamburger meat to making a salad. Make sure to wash your hands well with soap and water each time after handling raw meat. CNN: Let\u2019s talk about bird flu for a moment. Has the avian flu outbreak affected how we should think about eating products like hamburgers and chicken wings? Is it still safe to eat eggs and drink milk? Wen: According to federal health officials, it is safe to continue eating these products as long as meat and eggs are cooked to the recommended temperatures. It is also safe to keep drinking milk, though it\u2019s crucial to emphasize that the milk needs to be pasteurized. Raw milk is not safe to drink. Not only can raw milk harbor bacteria, but it is also possible that raw milk can transmit the bird flu. It wasn\u2019t advisable for people to drink raw milk or consume products made from raw milk prior to the bird flu outbreak, and it certainly is not advisable now. CNN: We\u2019ve talked a lot about food safety. What are other health issues to consider this Fourth of July? Wen: If you will be in hot weather, be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Watch out for those who are most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, specifically children, older adults and people with chronic medical conditions. Watch out for your pets as well. They can get overheated, too. Never leave pets or children unattended and in a car by themselves; the inside of the car overheats rapidly and these high temperatures can be fatal. Everyone should try to stay in the shade when possible. Keep well-hydrated. Water is the best form of hydration, and be aware that excessive caffeine and alcohol can be dangerous during heat waves. Wear clothing that protects you from the sun, and make sure to apply and re-apply sunscreen often.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/health/summer-food-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_health_multiple-alarms-wake-up-sleep-wellness", "text": "Let\u2019s say you need to wake up by 7 a.m. to get to work on time. So you set your first smartphone alarm for 6:30 a.m., your second at 6:45 a.m. and your third at 6:55 a.m. to avoid the snooze button. And you throw in 7:05 a.m. just to be cautious. Does this sound familiar? If you are clogging your clock app with all those morning alarms, you\u2019re setting yourself up for a groggy morning, experts say. Hitting the snooze button for increments of nine minutes of sleep at a time does the same thing, said Dr. Brandon Peters, a neurologist and sleep medicine physician with Virginia Mason Franciscan Health in Seattle. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying in the moment to hit the snooze and delay getting out of bed and starting the day, but it does actually fragment and undermine that sleep quality,\u201d Peters said. For the last hours of sleep, people usually go in and out of the fourth and last stage of the sleep cycle, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This stage is particularly important for memory processing and creative thinking, he added. Having that stage of sleep fragmented could impact that brain function. He recommends setting one alarm, allowing for deep sleep to continue uninterrupted until you need to wake up in the morning. Here\u2019s how to train your mind and body to get out of bed after that first alarm goes off. Why do I have trouble getting up in the morning? Certain sleep disorders could be causing someone to have trouble waking up in the morning to one alarm, such as sleep inertia, which causes a difficult transition out of sleep, said Dr. Cathy Goldstein, a sleep medicine physician at the Michigan Medicine Sleep Disorders Centers. That may result in someone unknowingly turning off and snoozing alarms when first woken up. Most of the time, however,\u00a0someone who needs multiple alarms to wake up in the morning is sleep deprived, she said. First, try to get to any underlying issues that could be causing this problem, Goldstein noted. \u201cNumber one: are you actually getting the sleep you need? Not the amount of sleep you think you should get or that you want to get, but the amount of sleep that you actually need. And are you getting that on a nightly basis?\u201d asked Goldstein, who is also a clinical professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Most adults need around\u00a0seven to nine hours\u00a0of sleep a night, but it does take time to figure out how much sleep you need. Goldstein recommends students use summer break to find how many hours of sleep they get naturally after a few weeks. For others, a long vacation could provide some helpful answers. Another reason someone may battle the alarm clock every morning is that they\u2019re naturally a night owl, but their work schedule calls for an early bird, said Dr. Alicia Roth, a clinician at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Sleep Disorders Center in Ohio. \u201cIn an ideal world, we would go to bed when we\u2019re sleepy, and we would wake up when we wake up. That is not the world we live in.\u201d But\u00a0there are ways to gradually shift your body clock and\u00a0make early mornings easier, she added. How to wake up to one alarm If you have to wake up at 7 a.m., and the alarm starts at 6 a.m., you are getting an hour of bad-quality sleep, instead of just sleeping through until 7 a.m, Roth said. While setting just one alarm is best, it might be hard to wake up to only one after using multiple alarms as your safety net, she added. Roth recommends testing out different alarm clocks, such as one that utilizes light or an alarm that makes you get out of bed to turn it off. Getting 15 to 30 minutes of sunlight in the morning can also help shift the internal body clock and is particularly important for those who are natural night owls, said Peters, author of the new book \u201cThe Sleep Apnea Hypothesis.\u201d It is also important to wake up and go to sleep around the same times each day, Goldstein said. \u201cIf you\u2019re somebody who sleeps really well from 3 a.m. to noon, and that\u2019s how you sleep on the weekends, but on Monday morning, you have to wake up at 6 a.m. to commute,\u201d that will be hard, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s earlier than your biology is prepared to wake up, and it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get up.\u201d Goldstein recommends shifting bedtime 30 minutes earlier every few days, or an hour earlier once a week for those looking to change their biological clocks. Avoiding harsh lights and limiting screen time up to four hours before bed can also help promote the body\u2019s natural melatonin production, she added. If someone finds they have woken up before their alarm goes off, Peters doesn\u2019t recommend checking the time, because doing so could make it difficult to fall back asleep if they start to worry about the sleep time they have left or the day ahead of them. Instead, Peters recommends trying to fall back asleep until it feels as though 15 to 20 minutes have passed. If you\u2019re still awake, then you can check the time and decide if you want to get up for the day, he added. \u201cIf it\u2019s close to your normal wake time, you might start your day a little early. If it\u2019s in the middle of the night, you might go off and do something quiet, like read, and then come back to bed when you\u2019re feeling more drowsy or sleepy.\u201d While some may be able to naturally wake up without using an alarm, it is not a realistic goal for everyone, particularly those who experience sleep inertia, or have naturally later biological clocks, Goldstein said. \u201cWe never want to sleep shame people,\u201d she said. \u201cIn medicine, and in public health we operate on averages a lot of the time, what\u2019s best for the most. But there are these biological differences, and we want to make sure that everybody is optimizing their sleep the best that they can.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/health/multiple-alarms-wake-up-sleep-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_health_plague-human-risk-explainer", "text": "Plague, one of the deadliest bacterial infections in human history, caused an estimated 50 million deaths in Europe during the Middle Ages when it was known as the Black Death. While extremely rare, the disease is still around today, with a man in New Mexico dying of plague in March after being hospitalized for the disease and a person in Oregon being diagnosed with bubonic\u00a0plague in February after likely being infected by their pet cat. It\u2019s transmitted by fleas that live on rodents. Symptoms usually appear within one to seven days after infection and include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, in the groin, armpit or neck areas as well as fever, chills and coughing. How do you get the plague? Plague affects humans and other mammals. Usually, people get the plague after being bitten by a rodent flea carrying Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the disease, or by handling an infected animal, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cats, which become sick themselves, can directly infect humans, while hardier dogs may simply carry the fleas back to their owners. People also can become sick by inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. The bacteria persists because low levels circulate among populations of certain rodents, according to the CDC. These infected animals and their fleas serve as long-term reservoirs for the bacteria. \u201cThe reason why it hasn\u2019t been eliminated is because there\u2019s an animal reservoir,\u201d Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,\u00a0said in February. \u201cThe bacteria can infect animals, and because we can\u2019t treat all animals\u00a0in the wild, it persists in nature and thus occasionally\u00a0causes a limited number of human cases.\u201d Where can you get the plague? Plague occurs naturally in rural areas in the western United States, particularly Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. That\u2019s where an average of seven human plague cases are reported each year to the CDC. But significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia. From 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths, according to\u00a0the World Health Organization.\u00a0It said the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru. There are three types of plague \u2013 bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic plague. With the pneumonic form of plague \u2013 which means it affects the lungs \u2013 there is a risk of direct transmission from human to human. That was the case\u00a0in the large outbreak in Madagascar in 2017, where there were 2,348 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and 202 deaths. The last urban plague epidemic in the United States occurred in Los Angeles from 1924 through 1925, the CDC said. How worried should I be? Modern antibiotics \u2013 streptomycin is the usual first-line treatment \u2013 can prevent complications and death if given promptly after symptoms appear. The treatment is used for the two most common types of plague: bubonic and pneumonic. \u201cThe reason why it caused such widespread death and destruction in the Middle Ages is because we didn\u2019t have antibiotics at that time,\u201d Barouch said in February about plague. \u201cAlthough it can be a serious illness, it\u2019s usually easily treatable with antibiotics as long as it\u2019s caught early. So now it\u2019s a very treatable disease. It shouldn\u2019t create the fear that people had in the Middle Ages of the Black Death,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone develops symptoms consistent with the plague \u2014 usually the initial symptoms are fever, chills and swollen lymph node \u2014 then seek medical attention, because at the early stages, the plague is easily treatable with antibiotics.\u201d Bubonic plague has a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60%\u00a0when left untreated,\u00a0while pneumonic plague, when left untreated, is always fatal,\u00a0according to WHO. However, a strain of bubonic plague with\u00a0high-level resistance to streptomycin\u00a0has been seen in Madagascar. More than 80% of US cases have been the bubonic form, which is the most common form of infection. Untreated bubonic plague can turn into the more serious pneumonic plague, which causes rapidly developing pneumonia after bacteria spread to the lungs. Is there a vaccine for the plague? There is a\u00a0Yersinia pestis vaccine, but it is recommended only for high-risk people like scientists who work directly with the bacterium, Dr. Harish Moorjani, an infectious disease specialist at Phelps Hospital in New York, part of Northwell Health, said in February. \u201cMost people don\u2019t need the vaccine,\u201d Moorjani said. A 2019 review\u00a0of experimental plague vaccines suggests that researchers are exploring a variety of approaches to develop an effective plague inoculation. Since different vaccine designs lead to different mechanisms of immunity, the authors conclude that combinations of different types might overcome the limitations of individual vaccines and effectively prevent a potential plague outbreak. How do you protect yourself and your family? Key steps for prevention of plague include eliminating nesting places for rodents around your home, sheds, garages and recreation areas by removing brush, rock piles, trash and excess firewood. Report sick or dead animals to law enforcement or your local health officials; do not pick up or touch them yourself. If you absolutely must handle a sick or dead animal, wear gloves. If you live in an endemic area,\u00a0take added precautions. Use insect repellent that contains DEET to prevent flea bites and treat dogs and cats for fleas regularly. Do not sleep with your pets as this increases your risk of getting plague. Finally, your pets should not hunt or roam rodent habitats, such as prairie dog colonies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/health/plague-human-risk-explainer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2017_09_18_health_opioid-crisis-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at the opioid crisis.  Experts say the United States is in the throes of an opioid epidemic. An estimated 8.9 million Americans aged 12 and older misused opioids in 2022, including 8.5 million prescription pain reliever abusers and 1 million heroin users. Opioids are drugs formulated to replicate the pain-reducing properties of opium. Prescription painkillers like morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone are opioids. Illegal drugs like heroin and illicitly made fentanyl are also opioids. The word \u201copioid\u201d is derived from the word \u201copium.\u201d  Overdose deaths have been on the rise for years in the United States, but surged amid the Covid-19 pandemic: Annual deaths were nearly 50% higher in 2021 than in 2019, CDC data shows. Data on overdose deaths. Prescription opioid volumes peaked in 2011, with the equivalent of 240 billion milligrams of morphine prescribed, according to the market research firm, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee had the highest opioid dispensing rates in 2020. Common Opioids Opioids such as morphine and codeine are naturally derived from opium poppy plants more commonly grown in Asia, Central America and South America. Heroin is an illegal drug synthesized from morphine.  Hydrocodone and oxycodone are semi-synthetic opioids, manufactured in labs with natural and synthetic ingredients.  Fentanyl is a fully synthetic opioid, originally developed as a powerful anesthetic for surgery.  It is also administered to alleviate severe pain associated with terminal illnesses like cancer. The drug is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. Just a small dose can be deadly. Illicitly produced fentanyl has been a driving factor in the number of overdose deaths in recent years.  Methadone is another fully synthetic opioid. It is commonly dispensed to recovering heroin addicts to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.     Opioids bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting pain signals. They also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a \u201chigh.\u201d Addiction Opioid use disorder is the clinical term for opioid addiction or abuse. People who become dependent on opioids may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the medication. Dependence is often coupled with tolerance, meaning that users need to take increasingly larger doses for the same effect.  A drug called naloxone, available as an injection or a nasal spray, is used as a treatment for overdoses. It blocks or reverses the effects of opioids and is often carried by first responders.  Regulation and Funding The 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, allocated $1 billion over two years in opioid crisis grants to states, providing funding for expanded treatment and prevention programs. In April 2017, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price announced the distribution of the first round of $485 million in grants to all 50 states and US territories. In August 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the launch of an Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit within the Department of Justice. The unit\u2019s mission is to prosecute individuals who commit opioid-related health care fraud. The DOJ is also appointing US attorneys who will specialize in opioid health care fraud cases as part of a three-year pilot program in 12 jurisdictions nationwide.  On October 24, 2018, President Donald Trump signed opioid legislation into law. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes provisions aimed at promoting research to find new drugs for pain management that will not be addictive. It also expands access to treatment for substance use disorders for Medicaid patients. State legislatures have also introduced measures to regulate pain clinics and limit the quantity of opioids that doctors can dispense.  Timeline 1861-1865 - During the Civil War, medics use morphine as a battlefield anesthetic. Many soldiers become dependent on the drug.  1898 - Heroin is first produced commercially by the Bayer Company. At the time, heroin is believed to be less habit-forming than morphine, so it is dispensed to individuals who are addicted to morphine. 1914 - Congress passes the Harrison Narcotics Act, which requires that doctors write prescriptions for narcotic drugs like opioids and cocaine. Importers, manufacturers and distributors of narcotics must register with the Treasury Department and pay taxes on products   1924 - The Anti-Heroin Act bans the production and sale of heroin in the United States.  1970 - The Controlled Substances Act becomes law. It creates groupings (or schedules) of drugs based on the potential for abuse. Heroin is a Schedule I drug while morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone (Percocet) and methadone are Schedule II. Hydrocodone (Vicodin) is originally a Schedule III medication. It is later recategorized as a Schedule II drug.  January 10, 1980 - A letter titled \u201cAddiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics\u201d is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It looks at incidences of painkiller addiction in a very specific population of hospitalized patients who were closely monitored. It becomes widely cited as proof that narcotics are a safe treatment for chronic pain.  1995 - OxyContin, a long-acting version of oxycodone that slowly releases the drug over 12 hours, is introduced and aggressively marketed as a safer pain pill by manufacturer, Purdue Pharma.  May 10, 2007 - Purdue Pharma pleads guilty for misleadingly advertising OxyContin as safer and less addictive than other opioids. The company and three executives are charged with \u201cmisleading and defrauding physicians and consumers.\u201d Purdue and the executives agree to pay $634.5 million in criminal and civil fines.  2010 - FDA approves an \u201cabuse-deterrent\u201d formulation of OxyContin, to help curb abuse. However, people still find ways to abuse it.  May 20, 2015 - The DEA announces that it has arrested 280 people, including 22 doctors and pharmacists, after a 15-month sting operation centered on health care providers who dispense large amounts of opioids. The sting, dubbed Operation Pilluted, is the largest prescription drug bust in the history of the DEA.     March 18, 2016 - The CDC publishes guidelines for prescribing opioids for patients with chronic pain. Recommendations include prescribing over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen in lieu of opioids. Doctors are encouraged to promote exercise and behavioral treatments to help patients cope with pain.    March 29, 2017 - Trump signs an executive order calling for the establishment of the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is selected as the chairman of the group, with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an adviser. July 31, 2017 - After a delay, the White House panel examining the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic releases its interim report, asking Trump to declare a national public health emergency to combat the ongoing crisis    September 22, 2017 - The pharmacy chain CVS announces that it will implement new restrictions on filling prescriptions for opioids, dispensing a limited seven-day supply to patients who are new to pain therapy.  November 1, 2017 - The opioid commission releases its final report. Its 56 recommendations include a proposal to establish nationwide drug courts that would place opioid addicts in treatment facilities rather than prison.  February 9, 2018 - A budget agreement signed by Trump authorizes $6 billion for opioid programs, with $3 billion allocated for 2018 and $3 billion allocated for 2019.  February 27, 2018 - Sessions announces a new opioid initiative: The Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force. The mission of the task force is to support local jurisdictions that have filed lawsuits against prescription drugmakers and distributors. March 19, 2018 - The Trump administration outlines an initiative to stop opioid abuse. The three areas of concentration are law enforcement and interdiction; prevention and education via an ad campaign; and job-seeking assistance for individuals fighting addiction. April 9, 2018 - The US surgeon general issues an advisory recommending that Americans carry the opioid overdose-reversing drug, naloxone. A surgeon general advisory is a rarely used tool to convey an urgent message. The last advisory issued by the surgeon general, more than a decade ago, focused on drinking during pregnancy. May 1, 2018 - The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a study that finds synthetic opioids like fentanyl caused about 46% of opioid deaths in 2016. That\u2019s a three-fold increase compared with 2010, when synthetic opioids were involved in about 14% of opioid overdose deaths. It\u2019s the first time that synthetic opioids surpassed prescription opioids and heroin as the primary cause of overdose fatalities.   May 30, 2018 - The journal Medical Care publishes a study that estimates the cost of medical care and substance abuse treatment for opioid addiction was $78.5 billion in 2013.   June 7, 2018 - The White House announces a new multimillion dollar public awareness advertising campaign to combat opioid addiction. The first four ads of the campaign are all based on true stories illustrating the extreme lengths young adults have gone to obtain the powerful drugs. December 12, 2018 - According to the National Center for Health Statistics, fentanyl is now the most commonly used drug involved in drug overdoses. The rate of drug overdoses involving the synthetic opioid skyrocketed by about 113% each year from 2013 through 2016. January 14, 2019 - The National Safety Council finds that, for the first time on record, the odds of dying from an opioid overdose in the United States are now greater than those of dying in a vehicle crash. March 26, 2019 - Purdue Pharma agrees to pay a $270 million settlement to settle a historic lawsuit brought by the Oklahoma attorney general. The settlement will be used to fund addiction research and help cities and counties with the opioid crisis. July 17, 2019 - The CDC releases preliminary data showing a 5.1% decline in drug overdoses during 2018. If the preliminary number is accurate, it would mark the first annual drop in overdose deaths in more than two decades. August 26, 2019 - Oklahoma wins its case against Johnson & Johnson in the first major opioid lawsuit trial to be held in the United States. Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman orders Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million for its role in the state\u2019s opioid crisis. The penalty is later reduced to $465 million, due to a mathematical error made when calculating the judgment. In November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reverses the decision. September 15, 2019 - Purdue files for bankruptcy as part of a $10 billion agreement to settle opioid lawsuits. According to a statement from the chair of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, the money will be allocated to communities nationwide struggling to address the crisis.

{"id": "2024_06_21_health_tiktok-falsehoods-sun-protection-wellness", "text": "As our planet endures what may be the hottest year on record, social media influencers are spawning messages about the sun and sunscreen that are not only false, but dangerous, say experts. \u201cStop wearing sunscreen,\u201d says a TikTok influencer with 1.6 million followers and 36 million likes. \u201cThe more time you spend outside, the less likely you are to get sunburned,\u201d proclaims a shirtless TikTokker with nearly 90,000 followers and over 11 million likes. \u201cThe sun does not cause skin cancer,\u201d insists a TikTok pundit with 76,000 followers in a post that has been bookmarked nearly 4,000 times. \u201cCooling down the skin can help prevent sunburns,\u201d claims another TikTokker with over 4 million likes. \u201cWhen I feel my skin starting to get hot in the sun, I\u2019ll go in the ocean or I\u2019ll go in the pool, and I\u2019ll cool down.\u201d Such assertions fly in the face of decades of scientific research on the dangers of sun exposure and the protective role of sunscreen, experts say. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a \u201cproven human carcinogen,\u201d causing squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, which works closely with industry. Long-wave ultraviolet A rays (UVA) and short-wave ultraviolet B rays (UVB) penetrate the ozone layer\u00a0and can burn, damage and age skin\u00a0even on cloudy days. \u201cExtensive research has shown that UV radiation from the sun is a significant cause of skin cancers such as melanoma. It\u2019s really indisputable at this point,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen Suozzi, a dermatologic surgeon at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cUV radiation has both UVA and UVB, and we know that both of them damage the DNA in skin cells,\u201d she said. \u201cThese mutations accumulate over time and then lead to skin cancer \u2014 which can quickly spread throughout the body \u2014 as well as wrinkles, dark spots and other signs of skin aging.\u201d What should you do? Wearing a hat, sunglasses and protective clothing \u2014 along with sunscreen and staying in the shade during the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \u2014 will help protect the skin from sun damage, experts say. Jumping in the water to cool off the skin, however, does not. \u201cIt\u2019s really the exact opposite,\u201d Suozzi said. \u201cYou\u2019ll just lose the sense of heat, so you\u2019ll get a higher exposure to UV without knowing it, and because the water is reflective, you\u2019ll get a double hit of exposure to your face.\u201d Early sun damage can lead to melanoma years later Historically, younger generations often fail to adequately protect themselves from the sun, experts say. Surveys show that trend continues today among Gen Z young adults. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only 8% of men and 26% of women younger than 30 said they always used sunscreen when outside for more than an hour on a sunny day. \u201cSunlight isn\u2019t toxic, sunscreen is,\u201d according to an X contributor who says he has a doctorate in tanning without sunscreen. While some products do contain worrisome chemicals, many do not, and today\u2019s broad spectrum sunscreens do a much better job at protecting the skin from UVA and UVB rays, said David Andrews, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a consumer organization which advocates for sunscreen safety. \u201cMineral-based sunscreens are not absorbed into the skin and are better for the environment,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThere are many good, safe choices on the market that don\u2019t leave a white cast on the skin.\u201d Unless accelerated by a tanning bed, skin damage can take years, if not decades to develop, experts say, leaving today\u2019s unwary youth at risk for early skin aging and lethal skin cancers such as melanoma. \u201cMelanoma is the deadliest cancer known to man,\u201d said Dr. Kelly Olino, clinical director of the Smilow Melanoma Program at the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cMelanoma is the only type of cancer where, if it is two-millimeters in size, we say \u2018Goodness, this is serious,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf you had a two-millimeter colon cancer, we\u2019d be having a parade saying, \u2018Wow, we got this one really, really early.\u2019\u201d Sun tanning versus sunburns While getting a sunburn appears to be a no-no for many of these social media gurus, they do encourage their followers to get a tan. The reasoning goes like this: As UV exposure is increased, a pigment in the skin called melanin darkens. Melanin has protective properties against UV radiation; therefore tanning should be encouraged. \u201cSlow exposure to the sun allows you to build melanin and protect skin the natural way,\u201d says a Tiktokker who has gathered over 3 million likes. \u201cAs long as\u00a0you have a good tan, you don\u2019t need sunscreen. It\u2019s much better to just quietly, slowly build up a tan during the spring,\u201d said a computer scientist interviewed on X, formerly known as Twitter. That\u2019s just so wrong, according to experts. \u201cTanning is the body\u2019s response to being damaged, so tanned skin is already damaged skin, and all you\u2019re doing is creating more and more damage,\u201d Olino said. \u201cIn the best case scenario with your \u2018base tan\u2019 or sun damaged skin, the melanin that\u2019s produced gives you an SPF of 2 to 4 or so, and we would never tell people that anything less than 30 SPF would be protective from additional sun damage,\u201d she said. In fact, a sunburn is much more than a red flag for a little sun damage. It\u2019s a sign of actual cell death, Suozzi explained. \u201cWe see this under the microscope,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call them sunburnt cells, and you can see them actually dying. And when they die, the body creates inflammation, and that\u2019s what causes the redness. It\u2019s a very inflammatory process.\u201d When it comes to vitamin D, 15 minutes of sun on the skin each day is all that is needed, said Andrews, and the skin does not need to be free of sunscreen for that to happen. \u201cVitamin D can still be generated when you\u2019re wearing sunscreen,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cYou can actually still have that beneficial sun exposure while you\u2019re wearing a sunscreen that\u2019s reducing the risk of sunburn and preventing overexposure to the sun.\u201d A little truth, a lot of malarky Social media pundits often espouse ideas that distort a grain of truth, such as pointing to data that shows a simultaneous rise in sunscreen use and new melanoma diagnoses. \u201cSince sunscreen came out, the rise of skin cancer has only gone up and up,\u201d says one TikTok influencer. \u201cIf you think sunscreen is protecting you from melanoma, why is the rate going up?\u201d asks the computer scientist in her TikTok interview. It is true that the rate of melanoma cases has been rising, but it\u2019s not due to sunscreen, Suozzi said. Instead, credit dermatologists, who are detecting skin cancers at earlier stages and saving lives. That\u2019s a good thing. \u201cDue to better screening we are detecting melanomas at earlier stages, which leads to higher reported incidence rates,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition, the sun exposure that\u2019s causing the increase in melanomas today occurred 40 or 50 years ago, when people were in their 20s and unlikely to use sunscreen. So the driving force is exposure years and years ago, not the increased use of sunscreen today.\u201d Sunglasses are another target. As one TikTok influencer told his friend: \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get sunburned if you wear sunglasses. \u201cOur eyes can sense the sun \u2026. and when it\u2019s harsh lighting our eyes tell us to produce melanin in our skin,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf our eyes can\u2019t realize that the sun is that harsh because we\u2019re wearing a lens over top, it\u2019s gonna burn your skin.\u201d So if people go out into the sun with sunglasses on, \u201cyou can burn a lot easier because your brain didn\u2019t get the message that the sun\u2019s hot,\u201d another said. While the eyes do contain melanin \u2014 that\u2019s what determines our eye color \u2014 the vast majority of the body\u2019s pigmentation is produced by cells in the skin, which is the largest organ of the body. Ultraviolet light penetrates deep into the lower layer of the epidermis to trigger the process. \u201cThe videos seem to imply that if you weren\u2019t wearing sunglasses, you\u2019d also get tanned under your clothes, which we absolutely know doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d EWG\u2019s Andrews said. \u201cIf it\u2019s only going to the brain, then your whole body would be perfectly tanned, right? \u201cIt made me laugh and cry. It\u2019s frightening, and I know those videos have thousands of views, which is shocking, because the message is so separated from reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these falsehoods are only influencing a few people, that\u2019s one person too many.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/tiktok-falsehoods-sun-protection-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
