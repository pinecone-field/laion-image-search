According to the CDC\u2019s map, the regions hardest hit by heat illnesses are not always the ones seeing the highest temperatures. While temperatures have soared to 100 degrees and even beyond across much of the South and Southwest, the states seeing the highest numbers of heat-related ER visits are in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Mountain west, where temperatures have been in the 80s and 90s. But the heat is much more unusual, especially in mid-June, for these locations,\u00a0trending well above historical averages. On Saturday, for example, when the heat was reaching a climax in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, hospitals in more than two dozen states across six regions reported \u201cextremely high\u201d rates of heat-related emergencies despite temperatures hovering in that lower range. The CDC defines \u201cextremely high\u201d as being in the top 5% of busiest days for heat-related illnesses over the last five years, from 2018 through 2023. Hot buildings, inexperience put people at risk CDC health scientist Claudia Brown says that\u2019s because built environments in those areas aren\u2019t designed to deal with heat and people\u2019s bodies aren\u2019t as used to handling high temperatures. \u201cSo in these more northern regions, for example, there tends to be less prevalence of air conditioning in the homes,\u201d said Brown,\u00a0who works in the Climate and Health Program at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health.\u00a0\u201cSo you may not have as high of temperatures as you have in, say, Arizona, but you have a higher health impact because they don\u2019t have, necessarily, the infrastructure in place to deal with that heat.\u201d With climate change increasing both the number and intensity of heat waves, the CDC earlier this year launched a new heat risk tool where people can look up their ZIP code and see a heat forecast and recommendations to stay safe. Dr. Cheyenne Falat works in the emergency department at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, a city that declared a code red heat alert over the weekend and opened cooling stations for residents. \u201cWe have seen some pretty significant cases of heat stroke and other heat illnesses coming in over the past few weeks, not just the past few days,\u201d said Falat, who also specializes in environmental medicine.\u00a0 She\u2019s bracing for more. In Baltimore, where there are high rates of substance use disorders, people can get into trouble if they take drugs and pass out in a car with no one around.\u00a0 Other patients have been older adults who live in homes without air conditioning, outdoor workers, and people who underestimate the heat when they head outside for a workout. Falat said heat is a serious health threat Americans are just learning how to grapple with.  \u201cHeat waves as a natural phenomenon kill more people, on average, than any other extreme weather event,\u201d she said. Staying safe in extreme heat Dr. William Brady, who works in the emergency department at the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville said he thinks inexperience has a lot to do with it, too. \u201cYou know, if you live in New Hampshire, you\u2019re used to really not dealing with terribly high periods of heat,\u201d Brady said. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that way, that I have to be careful with the heat.\u201d Brady said their ER is seeing an uptick in cases of heat exhaustion, usually in people who work or exercise outdoors.\u00a0 They come in with \u201cnausea, vomiting, headache, that sort of thing.\u201d So far, he says, he hasn\u2019t seen any cases of heat stroke, which can be life-threatening. Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, where patients have a throbbing headache, a rapid heart rate, high fever, as well as neurological symptoms like confusion. They may also faint or pass out. Brady said he\u2019s also seeing more people with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk from climbing temperatures such as emphysema, heart failure and diabetes. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more patients that are coming in just not tolerating the heat,\u201d he said. With climate change driving longer, ever hotter waves of high temperatures, Americans are on a steep learning curve when it comes to heat. \u201cWe know that heat is uncomfortable when temperatures and humidity reach a certain height,\u201d Brady said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not really used to being threatened by it the way other parts of the world have had been.\u201d Brady recently attended a medical conference in Taiwan and took a class to learn how to manage large crowds and mass gatherings during periods of high heat, to cut down on the risk of heat injury. \u201cThis is a potentially new issue that were beginning to face,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAnd we need to pay attention to it because it is exceedingly dangerous.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/er-visits-heat-related-illnesses-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_health_eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness", "text": "While holidays are often marked by parties, shared meals, gift-giving and special outfits, experts say there\u2019s health benefits to remembering the meaning behind the celebration. The three-day holiday of Eid-al-Adha commemorates the story in the Quran of God appearing to Ibrahim, or Abraham, in a dream and commanding him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. The holiday, which starts on Sunday this year, is determined by the lunar calendar, and Saudi Arabia announces the dates according to its time zone. Muslims believe that as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, an angel of God stopped him and gave him a ram to sacrifice in place of his son. A version of the story also appears in both Christian and Jewish scriptures. Many people kick off the holiday by calling and texting Muslims they know throughout the world with \u201cEid Mubarak,\u201d which means blessed feast or festival. Families typically attend a special morning prayer at the local mosque and then gather with loved ones to feast over a holiday meal and exchange money or gifts. Others may make a obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca \u2014 the Hajj pilgrimage \u2014 to visit the holiest sites in Islam, including the mountainous region where Abraham\u2019s feted act took place. Muslims also honor Abraham\u2019s sacrifice with udhiya or qurbani \u2014 sacrificing a cow, sheep or goat and then sharing the meat with friends and family and offering it to those in need. Many people also send donations to or place qurbani orders in Muslim countries to feed disadvantaged people. These traditions are reminders that letting go, having faith and doing good deeds will be rewarded, said Dr. Yasmine Saad, a clinical psychologist and author in New York City. This message and the pious and social acts of Eid, such as celebrating with friends and family and spreading acts of charity exemplify mindfulness and can be helpful when implemented regularly. \u201cEid is a reminder that we should strive to add more of this balance in our day-to-day,\u201d said Dr. Rania Awaad, clinical professor of psychiatry and director of the Stanford Muslim Mental Health & Islamic Psychology lab. Here are some mindful takeaways from the Eid holiday that you can include in your routine \u2013 no matter what you believe in. At its core, mindfulness is staying in the present, focusing on one\u2019s thoughts, feelings and surroundings without judgment. The practice of mindfulness carries multiple health and wellness benefits such as decreasing pain, reducing stress and easing feelings of depression. Stay hopeful and look for silver linings The story of Abraham is not easily transferable to everyday life as it was an example of an extreme hurdle, but the lesson of pushing through a hardship and carrying on with resilience is relatable.\u00a0 \u201cIslam really develops this notion of faithfulness and patience in the face of a trial,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Reynolds, professor of Islamic Studies and Theology at University of Notre Dame. In Islamic spirituality, this mindset \u201cbecomes a real important way for Muslims to carry on through trials, suffering, oppression, evil that they suffer in life.\u201d Reynolds describes this mindset as a \u201csustaining force\u201d for Muslims. And it\u2019s not limited to Islam \u2014 anyone can reflect on one\u2019s current circumstances and look for positivity as a way to get through the hard parts. Do your part and trust the process During Abraham\u2019s challenging ordeal, his wife was also being tested. According to Islamic narrative, she was left alone in the desert in present-day Mecca with their son so that Abraham could follow God\u2019s command. In this story, the baby was in desperate need of nourishment, so the mother ran between two hills seven times to try to procure water for the baby. Eventually water \u2014 of which the well has become the source of holy water for Muslims \u2014 sprung up from the ground where the baby\u2019s feet lay. It sounds like a miraculous happening, but when applied to daily life, one can view it as doing one\u2019s work and trusting that things fall into place. Abraham\u2019s wife did her part by trying her best to search for nourishment for her child. Feeding others \u2018feeds the soul\u2019 Muslims commemorate the day with the sacrifice of an animal, and they take it a step further by making a meal of it for their own families and for people less fortunate. In this way they venerate Abraham while underscoring sharing and giving. At the root of qurbani is creating a shared experience while giving to others. \u201cA lot of people are feeling purposeless, and they feel that what they do in their life doesn\u2019t hit home,\u201d Saad said. \u201cGiving to others, giving to poor (people), sharing, making an impact in other people\u2019s lives always feeds the soul.\u201d You can make cooking for others, volunteering at a soup kitchen and donating your money, time or goods a regular \u2014 but impactful \u2014 part of your routine. Giving can \u201crealign people so their mind will be different, they will think more positive thoughts, their bodies will feel better, they will have a smile on their face,\u201d Saad said. By stepping out of one\u2019s routine and giving to others, it can help make \u201cyou feel you have an impact, you help, you have significance.\u201d This sense of purpose and meaning contributes to living a happier and longer life, according to an expert. In a larger sense, kindness contributes to one\u2019s sense of community and belonging, and donating to others has proven to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health, according to studies. It takes a village Humans are inherently social creatures, and loneliness and social isolationa are not good for one\u2019s brain, body or spirit, according to research. Even the size of a person\u2019s social network can impact health. Smaller networks are linked to larger feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can impact disease and death rates. Further, more positive experiences in social relationships is generally linked to better coping and lower stress. Because Eid is celebrated over a period of three days, the holiday emphasizes socializing and connecting with others for longer than just an afternoon or a day. These kinds of \u201csocial ceremonies\u201d can be helpful, said Dr. David Spiegel, psychiatrist and director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford Medicine. People have survived because \u201cwe\u2019ve formed communities, and support one another, and protect one another,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a community act that gives you a sense of doing something and doing something together with other people does help people to manage stress better.\u201d Connecting with one\u2019s community and expanding that circle, or even in smaller ways such as making time for a friend can be healthy. Fill your cup While going on the Hajj pilgrimage might be spiritually fulfilling for some Muslims, it may not be practical for everyone to take that journey. But creating space that brings in any sort of fulfillment can usher in new, exciting energy. Whether it\u2019s reading a good book or going on a yoga retreat for example, it can be something you do for your growth and gratification. Even a hike can do it for some, Awaad explained. \u201cIt could be something that just fills your cup to where you\u2019re able to then ground yourself and be much more attuned to the people around you and to the work that you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/health/eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_emtala-emergency-care-scotus", "text": "A document that was mistakenly posted on the US Supreme Court website Wednesday indicates that the court may allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho, at least temporarily. The state would not be allowed to deny an emergency abortion to a pregnant person whose health is in danger, at least while the case makes its way through the courts. The posting was first reported by Bloomberg News. It\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s the final version that the court will issue in the coming days. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a separate opinion Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. \u201cIt is a delay.\u201d Because Idaho\u2019s strict ban does not allow a doctor to perform an abortion if the patient\u2019s health is in danger from the pregnancy itself in most circumstances, the Biden administration argues, the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, also known as EMTALA. EMTALA requires all US hospitals that have received Medicare money \u2014 essentially nearly all of them \u2014 to screen everyone who comes into their emergency rooms to determine whether the person has an emergency medical condition without regard for their ability to pay for those services. The 1986 law requires hospitals, to the best of their ability, to stabilize anyone with an emergency medical condition or to transfer them to another facility that has that capacity. The hospitals must also treat these patients\u00a0\u201cuntil the emergency medical condition is resolved or stabilized.\u201d Pregnant people were singled out in the law\u00a0in 1989, after reports that some hospitals were refusing to care for uninsured women in labor. Congress expanded EMTALA to specify how it included people who were pregnant and having contractions. In 2021, the Biden administration released the\u00a0Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligation, which says a doctor\u2019s duty to provide stabilizing treatment \u201cpreempts any directly conflicting state law or mandated that might otherwise prohibit or prevent such treatment,\u201d although it did not specify whether an abortion has to be provided. In July 2022, the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0guidance\u00a0clarified that EMTALA includes the need to perform stabilization abortion care if it is medically necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. A Supreme Court document like the one accidentally posted Wednesday means a hospital must provide an abortion if it\u2019s medically indicated in an emergency situation, even in states that have abortion bans or restrictions that don\u2019t provide an exception to protect the health of the mother \u2013 at least as the case makes it way through the courts. But the move would only delay the issue, says Molly Meegan, chief legal officer for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a professional organization that represents the majority of practitioners in the United States. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem at all. In fact, pregnant patients are still trying to obtain care and unable to get it, and physicians are trying to provide care without clear parameters and with draconian criminal penalties hanging over their heads if they get the question wrong,\u201d she said. Idaho\u2019s abortion law had an immediate effect on hospitals in the state.\u00a0On January 5, the Supreme Court lifted an injunction so Idaho no longer had EMTALA protections for pregnancy complications. In April, St. Luke\u2019s, the state\u2019s largest provider of emergency services, said it had had to send six pregnant patients from its emergency department out of state via air transport to protect their health. The year before, when the injunction was in effect, the hospital had to do this only once, according to details in Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court document. Meegan said the law hasn\u2019t just hurt patient care. Physicians have told the group that they are leaving the state because they don\u2019t feel that they can practice medicine in a way that\u2019s consistent with their ethical obligations, training and judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s an untenable situation,\u201d Meegan said. Dr. Kara Cadwallader, a doctor who works in Idaho and is a member of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, said that even last week, her hospital had to send a pregnant person out of state for care even though they typically could have treated her. She is \u201cvery excited\u201d about Wednesday\u2019s ruling, even if it is a \u201csmall step.\u201d \u201cBeyond all the political reasons, it\u2019s incredibly important for pregnant patients here in Idaho, who now will be able to access emergency care appropriately,\u201d Cadwallader said. Dr. Julie Lyons, a family medicine physician at St. Luke\u2019s, told CNN earlier this year that the Idaho abortion law is so restrictive that she makes sure to talk to patients \u2013 even at their first prenatal appointment \u2013 about what they will need to do if they have an emergency. \u201cWe, more than ever, are having that discussion - like, if you need to go out of state, you need to check with your insurance, you need to make sure you buy life flight insurance,\u201d Lyons said in February. \u201cMany of my patients are scared to be pregnant in Idaho. It\u2019s really tragic,\u201d she added. Any decision on EMTALA does not just affect Idaho, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a privately owned health care company that provides abortion care. Forty-one states have abortion bans in effect with only limited exceptions, and 14 states have total bans. Abortion can be a necessary part of health care, Hagstrom Miller said, but with the high court\u2019s move to overturn Roe v. Wade, doctors are confused about what they are allowed to do. \u201cAbortion saves lives. Abortion is absolutely necessary, oftentimes in emergency room settings to protect the health of the pregnant person,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cI think providers really understand that their hands have been tied post-Roe here, since the Dobbs decision, in numerous states and numerous parts of the country. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t only about Idaho. This is really something that all eyes and ears are watching from multiple states across the country to try to figure out what we\u2019re able to do to provide basic health care, even if abortion has been restricted.\u201d Law professor Elizabeth Sepper, of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that \u201cin every other state with an abortion ban, confusion will continue to reign.\u201d \u201cEven where states have \u2018health\u2019 exceptions in their laws, they typically are narrower than what EMTALA requires,\u201d Sepper wrote in an email. Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, said she sees Idaho as a \u201cvery cruel case study\u201d of what happens when the law strips pregnant people of their right to emergency abortion care. She said she\u2019s disappointed in Wednesday\u2019s ruling because the court had the opportunity to uphold a law that gives everyone access to care but failed to do so. \u201cThe right to emergency care is perhaps one of the most basic rights there is,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cWe were fighting for scraps in this case, and even with that, a majority of the Supreme Court was not willing to recognize the humanity of pregnant people, that they would be entitled to this basic right to emergency care.\u201d CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Carma Hassan, Jamie Gumbrecht and John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/emtala-emergency-care-scotus/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn", "text": "Do you yearn for long days and short nights? Then this could be the best day of the year for you and your fellow sunlight seekers. The summer solstice is Thursday, June 20. It\u2019s the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. It\u2019s also the first official day of summer. Our ancient ancestors certainly took note of the yearly occasion.\u00a0Some of their monuments were aligned to precisely mark the summer solstice light (looking at you Stonehenge). Pagan celebrations of the day carry on into modern times. Events include gatherings at Stonehenge in England, the Midsummer Eve celebration in Sweden and Ivan Kupala Night in parts of Eastern Europe. The mirror image of the winter solstice, the summer solstice is historically linked to fertility \u2013 both the plant and human variety \u2013 in destinations worldwide. The science of the solstice and its traditions have fascinated people for millennia. Summer solstice science Is it summer solstice all over the world? No. It\u2019s only in the Northern Hemisphere, where almost 90% of the world\u2019s population lives. People south of equator in places such as Chile, South Africa and Australia are having their winter solstice and the shortest day of the year there. When is the 2024 summer solstice exactly? It will fall at 20:51 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on\u00a0June 20. Your local time zone in relation to UTC determines the time and even the date that the solstice happens for you. For instance, that\u2019s 1:51 p.m. in Los Angeles, 4:51 p.m. in New York City, 9:51 p.m. in London and 5:51 a.m. June 21 in Tokyo. Earthsky.org has a handy time zone conversion tool. Who gets the most sunlight? The differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. In Ecuador\u2019s capital of Quito, barely north of the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra six and a half minutes of daylight. But residents of northerly Helsinki, Finland, will get a 3:54 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of daylight. Even the night doesn\u2019t get that dark.\u00a0 The denizens of Fairbanks in central interior Alaska can scoff at those 19 hours. They\u2019ll get almost 22 hours of daylight, and blackout curtains might be in order. Why don\u2019t we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get nearly equal doses of day and night\u00a0back during the spring equinox three months ago. But the amount of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. That\u2019s because the Earth is aligned on an\u00a0axis, an imaginary pole\u00a0going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts \u2013 at\u00a0an angle of 23.5 degrees. \u201cAs Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun\u2019s direct rays,\u201d explains NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that\u2019s the summer solstice. After that, the days start getting shorter again until we reach that 12-hour day/night split in the the fall equinox. Is this also the hottest time of year? Generally, it\u2019s not, although this week is a scorcher in much of the US. \u201cOn average, the vast majority of the United States experiences its warmest temperatures in July or early August,\u201d says CNN Senior Weather Producer Taylor Ward. \u201cTemperatures essentially continue to rise after the summer solstice because the amount of energy coming in from the sun continues to be greater than the amount of energy lost at night \u2013 so it is basically an accumulation of warmth until the daylight gets short enough that this changes,\u201d says Ward. \u201cThe only area of the country that actually sees their warmest temperatures in June, coinciding with the longest daylight of the year, is portions of the Southwest\u201d\u00a0because of the timing of the cloudy monsoon season there in July and August. The same general temperature pattern holds true in places such as Japan and much of Europe. How to celebrate summer solstice What does Stonehenge have to do with the summer solstice? The ancient stones of the monument in Southwest England dating to around 2500 BC were aligned by its makers astronomically. The central axis of Stonehenge was aligned with the sunrise at\u00a0summer solstice and sunset at winter solstice so that the stones precisely frame the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. And it still works like clockwork in modern times. The English Heritage society organizes gatherings at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and produces a livestream of the sunrise. What other cultural traditions surround the summer solstice? In Sweden, the Midsummer Eve celebration is tied to the solstice, always being held on the Friday that lands anywhere from June 19 to June 25. Maypoles, folk dancing and romantic rituals are the order of the day. In Ukraine and some other places in Eastern Europe, the summer solstice is connected with Ivan Kupala Night \u2013 a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs. People dance, place flowered wreaths on the water and gather around bonfires. In India, the birthplace of the ancient practice of yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions throughout the nation. And the United Nations\u2019 International Yoga Day falls each year on the summer solstice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/summer-solstice-celebrations-traditions-world-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness", "text": "There\u2019s a crack of light shining through the dark clouds of America\u2019s battle with poor nutrition and subsequent health issues, according to a new study that analyzed two decades of nutritional data. \u201cThere is good news. Americans are starting to hear the message about nutrition, and some companies and restaurants are starting to make healthier products. It\u2019s a little bit of an improvement,\u201d said senior study author and cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston. However, he added, the majority of the improvement occurred between 1999 and 2010, with no advances in nutrition after that. \u201cWe have stalled as a nation \u2014 and that does not bode well for our health,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIf I was grading America on its diet, I\u2019d give it a D\u2014just up from an F.\u201d An upward trend, but more is needed The number of adults in the United States who ate a poor diet decreased from about 49% to just over 37% between 1999 and 2020 \u2014 a drop of 11.4%, while those who ate somewhat better nutritionally rose by 10.5%, the study found. A poor diet was defined as one with too many refined grains, processed meat and sugary beverages, including fruit juice, as well as ultraprocessed foods full of added sugar, salt and fat.\u00a0Healthy choices such as fruits and vegetables are extremely low in this eating style. \u201cIntake of fruits and vegetables didn\u2019t increase at all over this 20-year period, which is pretty striking,\u201d Mozaffarian said. An ideal diet included at least the daily recommended servings of fruits and vegetables, as well as more beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Dietary guidelines such as those from the American Heart Association suggest eating 4 to 5 cups a day of canned, fresh or frozen fruits and the same amount for vegetables. The nutritionally ideal diet also contained few sugary beverages, processed meats, refined grains and ultraprocessed food, which is often high in added sugars, fat and salt, the study said. Unfortunately, the number of people who ate an ideal diet \u2013\u2014 which included those 9 cups of fruits and vegetables \u2014 rose less than 1%, the study found. \u201cPeople often ask me, \u2018Well, if the diet\u2019s slowly improving, why is obesity and diabetes still going up?\u2019 It\u2019s still going up because only 1.58% of Americans have an ideal diet. We still have a long way to go,\u201d Mozaffarian said. More than a million Americans die each year from diet-related diseases such as obesity, cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes,\u00a0according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the United States an\u00a0estimated $1.1 trillion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity annually. \u201cI think it is correct to emphasize that diet quality remains dismal in the US. There is no secret why Americans are experiencing epidemics of obesity and diabetes and declining life expectancy,\u201d said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, in an email. He was not involved in the study. Food insecurity is a major issue The study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed dietary information on nearly 52,000 US adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. Nutritional advances were highest among women, younger adults, Hispanic adults, and people with more education and higher incomes who had access to private health care insurance. Fewer gains were seen in men, Black or older adults and people with less income, lower educational levels, non-private health insurance, and food insecurity issues. \u201cDisparities in the population by education and income and race and ethnicity are the same or sometimes getting worse,\u201d Mozaffarian said. The study found that people with lower income saw a 5% improvement in nutritional quality, while those with higher incomes improved their nutritional score by 16%. \u201cWe do need to avoid just blaming the victims of the dysfunctional US food system for the terrible diets documented in the survey,\u201d Willett said. \u201cWe fail to educate students about nutrition in our schools and feed them unhealthy diets. \u201cOur health care system is missing in action almost completely, we allow advertising to seduce children into junk foods and beverages that kill them prematurely, and we indirectly subsidize unhealthy foods in many ways that make healthier options relatively more expensive and less available to low-income Americans,\u201d he said. How to improve your nutrition There are easy steps you can take to boost the nutritional quality of your diet, experts say. Cook at home as often as possible: \u201cMy top suggestion is to shop at the grocery store as much as you can, rather than getting your food at a coffee shop, sandwich shop or quick-serve restaurant,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Even eating at a full-service restaurant should be limited, he added. Prior research by Mozaffarian and his team found about 80% of all food consumed by Americans from restaurants was of poor diet quality. \u201cShockingly, even when we compared fast food versus sit-down restaurants, there wasn\u2019t a dramatic difference in quality,\u201d he said. Instead, try to choose minimally-processed foods to cook at home and avoid the ready-to-heat-and-eat convenience foods so prevalent at the grocery store. Bring your lunch and snacks to work. Don\u2019t drink your sugar. Americans are beginning to get the idea that sugary sodas are unhealthy, but they have not yet made the connection that energy, sports and caffeinated drinks can be equally sugar laden, Mozaffarian said. \u201cEnergy drinks, pre-sweetened iced teas, and specialty coffee drinks can have more sugar than soda,\u201d he said. \u201cI see people walking out of the coffee shop with drinks with whipped cream on top. Don\u2019t drink your sugar.\u201d However, once sugary beverages are removed from the equation, only \u201c6% of calories in the country come from added sugar in foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIn contrast, about 35% of calories in the country come from refined grains and starches.\u201d Limit refined grains.\u00a0Overall, the biggest contributor to the poor quality diet of Americans is refined grains, at 5.2 servings per day \u2014 \u201calmost two servings a meal of refined grains such as refined bread, refined rice, crackers, chips, and other ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Whole grains still contain the bran and germ, which is a nutritional powerhouse full of healthy fats, antioxidants, minerals and E and B vitamins. Whole grains take longer to digest, don\u2019t raise blood sugar as quickly as refined grains and contain more fiber, which can reduce the risk of chronic disease, promote weight loss, and improve digestion. \u201cSome examples of whole grains include barley, bulgur, farro, millet, quinoa, black rice, brown rice, red rice, wild rice, oatmeal and popcorn,\u201d according to My Plate, the US Department of Agriculture website. Refined grains such as white flour, corn grits, white bread and white rice have been milled, removing the bran and germ, to give them a finer texture and longer shelf life. Milling also removes nutrients like dietary fiber, iron and vitamins.\u00a0Refined grains are found in nearly all ultraprocessed foods, including breakfast cereals, desserts, pastries, bread and crackers. Replace refined grains. Instead, nourish your gut microbiome with fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds and minimally-processed whole grains,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi can also help the microbiome, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_new-studies-bird-flu-dairy-workers-and-dairy-products", "text": "US health agencies are starting new rounds of tests on dairy workers and milk products to better understand the possible impact of H5N1 bird flu. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is partnering with the state of Michigan to begin a highly anticipated study to assess whether workers exposed to infected cattle had themselves become infected. And the US Food and Drug Administration is testing what\u2019s known as flash pasteurization after recent studies raised questions about whether the method neutralizes all infectious virus in milk. The projects are part of a suite of new research announced by federal agencies on Tuesday to understand the dynamics of H5N1 bird flu, which for the first time jumped from birds to dairy cattle around the beginning of the year.\u00a0 Since late March, more than 120 herds across 12 states have tested positive for the highly contagious infection, which appears to be spreading through contact with raw milk, the US Department of Agriculture confirmed. \u201cWe know this to be spread by contact with milk,\u201d said Dr. Eric Deeble, who is the acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA. Deeble said that early on, the movement of cattle was largely driving spread of the infection. But since the USDA ordered cattle to be tested before they could be moved state-to-state in late April, the infection has been ferried between farms on shared equipment and shared workers, according to a recent epidemiological study by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, or MDARD. \u201cWe know that milk has really high viral loads, and so when we\u2019re looking at transmission patterns,\u00a0that\u2019s a really high risk, it seems,\u201d MDARD Director Dr. Tim Boring said. How\u00a0the virus is using humans to hitch a ride \u2014 whether through infection or contaminated clothing or skin \u2014 isn\u2019t clear yet, Boring said. \u201cMy guess it\u2019s perhaps not truly binary, whether it is on people or in people,\u201d Boring said. Dairy farmers have been reluctant to let government officials onto their farms forwidespread testing of their herds, and farm workers have shied away from testing, even when they have symptoms.\u00a0 Advocates say workers are reluctant to test since it might mean missing work and pay. Last week, Michigan said it would\u00a0pay up to 20 dairy farms\u00a0a maximum of $28,000 each to participate in research.\u00a0That financial assistance is on top of funds\u00a0the federal government is offering. The offer seems to have worked.\u00a0 On Tuesday, the CDC announced that it had partnered with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to launch a study to test the blood of farm workers for antibodies to the H5N1 virus. \u201cThe point of this study is to determine if there is asymptomatic infection\u201d of workers who have been exposed to cows infected with the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis,\u00a0 director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The FDA also announced Tuesday that it has started another round of dairy product sampling to address gaps in its previous testing.\u00a0 This time, the 155 products it\u2019s plucking from store shelves will include raw milk cheeses, cream cheese, ice cream and butter, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Earlier this year, FDA\u2019s initial testing of milk and sour cream and other and other kinds of dairy products purchased at grocery stores found traces of virus in 1 out of 5 items sampled. Further testing confirmed, however, that those viral fragments were inactive and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick, leading the agency to declare milk and other dairy products safe to consume, as long as they\u2019re pasteurized. But\u00a0two recent\u00a0lab studies\u00a0published in the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine raised new questions. The studies\u00a0heated raw, infected milk to the times and temperatures used for flash pasteurization \u2014 the most common form of pasteurization in the US \u2014\u00a0and found that while it greatly reduced levels of infectious virus in milk, it didn\u2019t completely neutralize all of it. Scientists cautioned, however, that because the experiments didn\u2019t replicate the full flash pasteurization process, including a pre-heating step, more research was needed. Prater said the FDA believes its experiments are closer to the method used in commercial milk processing. Also on the FDA\u2019s\u00a0to-do list\u00a0are studies to measure the persistence of the virus in cheese as it ages, and pooled testing of raw milk samples from dairies. Prater didn\u2019t give a specific timeline for when the agency would have results from those studies, but said it hope to have the information in the very near future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/new-studies-bird-flu-dairy-workers-and-dairy-products/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_birth-control-drops-after-abortion-bans", "text": "Women in states with the most restrictive abortion laws have also become less likely to access prescription birth control, a new study suggests. In a dozen states that have enacted near-total abortion bans, monthly prescription rates for birth control pills and emergency contraceptives were significantly lower in the second half of 2023 than they were before the US Supreme Court Dobbs decision that revoked the federal right to abortion, according to the study published Wednesday in the JAMA Network Open medical journal. The researchers point to the closures of some family planning clinics and broad public confusion about what options remain legal in the wake of the June 2022 Dobbs decision as key factors contributing to this trend. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to recognize that these issues all fall under the scope of reproductive health care,\u201d said Dr. Michael Belmonte, an Ob-Gyn and fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists focused on complex family planning. He was not involved in the new research. \u201cWhen something touches on abortion care, that will ultimately have ripple effects for miscarriage care, for contraception and emergency contraception, and, quite frankly, access to general medical health care for many women across the United States.\u201d For the new study, researchers tracked trends in monthly birth control prescription rates from March to November 2021 \u2013 a period before the Dobbs decision leaked \u2013 and after the decision, from July 2022 to October 2023. They compared rates in a group of 12 states that enacted the most restrictive policies to a group of 14 states where abortion policy remained relatively consistent. The use of birth control pills has been trending down in the US overall \u2013 and other research suggests that use of IUDs, a longer-acting form of birth control, has been growing for decades \u2013 but the prescription fill rate fell about 4% more than expected in states with the most restrictive laws post-Dobbs, according to the new research. States with abortion bans saw an even more significant drop in prescriptions for emergency contraception \u2013 including levonorgestrel, such as Plan B, and ulipristal, such as Ella. Both groups of states studied \u2013 those that enacted bans and those where abortion policies stayed more consistent \u2013 had a similar prescription fill rate pre-Dobbs and both and saw an initial spike following the decision.\u00a0But by the second half of 2023, the prescription rate for emergency contraception in the states with bans was less than half of what it was before the Dobbs decision \u2013 dropping from about 20 fills for every 100,000 women of reproductive age each month down to eight fills. In states where abortion policies stayed consistent, the rate actually ticked up in the same timeframe \u2013 from 20 to 21 fills. \u201cThese findings suggest that efforts to protect and improve access to oral contraceptives are needed, especially for emergency contraceptives in states where abortion is most strongly restricted,\u201d the study authors wrote. Emergency contraception has become enmeshed in the abortion debate, and survey data suggests that there was widespread public confusion around the legality of emergency contraception months after the Dobbs decision and how it differed from medication abortion. Nearly a third of adults were \u201cunsure\u201d if emergency contraceptive pills were legal in their state, according to a KFF survey from January 2023. The confusion was even greater in states with abortion bans, where half of women either incorrectly thought that it was illegal or were unsure. \u201cThis drives home the importance for proper and accurate patient education, consumer education, and the need to combat disinformation and misinformation about the conflation and confusion between (emergency contraception and abortion,\u201d said Karen Diep, a women\u2019s health policy analyst with KFF who was not involved in the new research. In December 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration adjusted the Plan B label to explicitly state that it \u201cdoes not terminate pregnancy.\u201d All while reproductive health care deserts are getting worse. About 1 in 9 women of reproductive age in the US \u2013 and closer to 1 in 5 Black and Hispanic women \u2013 rely on family planning clinics to get contraception, according to a KFF analysis from 2022. But dozens of clinics closed post-Dobbs \u2013 and the new study found that declines in emergency contraception prescriptions were greatest in states that saw more widespread closures of family planning clinics. And the landscape continues to change rapidly, adding to the confusion and challenges around access. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted to block a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to contraception nationwide. But the Biden administration has \u201credoubled\u201d commitments to protect access to reproductive health care, including support for Title X family planning clinics and work to ensure birth control remains accessible under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIn the two years since\u00a0Dobbs, we have witnessed the devastating impacts. Many women, especially those in states with stringent abortion\u00a0restrictions, have found themselves navigating care deserts, forced to travel great distances to\u00a0receive essential services. These barriers disproportionately affect marginalized communities,\u00a0exacerbating existing health disparities,\u201d US Department of Health and Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration stands firm in its commitment to defending reproductive rights. We believe that no woman should have fewer rights than her mother and that women must have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies without fear or interference from politicians,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/birth-control-drops-after-abortion-bans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness", "text": "Scientists have found microplastics in human penises for the first time, as concerns over the tiny particles\u2019 proliferation and potential health effects mount. Seven different kinds of microplastics were found in four out of five samples of penis tissue taken from five different men as part of a study published in IJIR: Your Sexual Medicine Journal on Wednesday. Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. They form when larger plastics break down,\u00a0either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. Some minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, and evidence is mounting that they are increasingly present in our bodies. Study lead author Ranjith Ramasamy, an expert in reproductive urology who conducted the research while working at the University of Miami, told CNN that he used a previous study that found evidence of microplastics in the human heart as a basis for his research. Ramasamy said he wasn\u2019t surprised to find microplastics in the penis, as it is a \u201cvery vascular organ,\u201d like the heart. The samples were taken from study participants who had been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction (ED) and were in the hospital to undergo surgery for penile implants to treat the condition at the University of Miami between August and September 2023. The samples were then analyzed using chemical imaging, which revealed that four of the five men had microplastics in their penile tissue. Seven different types of microplastics were detected, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) the most prevalent, according to the study.  Now their presence has been confirmed, more research is needed to investigate potential links to conditions such as ED, Ramasamy said. \u201cWe need to identify whether microplastics are linked to ED and if there is a level beyond which it causes pathology and what types of microplastics are pathologic,\u201d he said. As for the wider implications of the findings, Ramasamy said he hoped the study would \u201ccreate more awareness about the presence of foreign bodies within human organs and foster more research surrounding this topic.\u201d Prior research has found that one liter of bottled water \u2014 the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters \u2014 contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles. \u201cI think we need to be mindful about consuming water and food from plastic bottles and containers and try and limit the use until more research is done to identify levels that could cause pathology,\u201d Ramasamy said. Toxicologist Matthew J. Campen told CNN that this is \u201can interesting study that confirms the ubiquity of plastics in the body.\u201d \u201cAs we are trying to understand the potential health effects of plastics, this is another concerning paper,\u201d said Campen,\u00a0a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cPlastics are generally non-reactive with the cells and chemicals of our bodies, but they could be physically disruptive to the many processes our bodies undertake for normal function, including functions related to erection and sperm production.\u201d Campen coauthored a study published in May that found that human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas. The study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers of males who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said at the time the study was published. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d There are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to microplastics. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_world_german-cockroach-origins-scn", "text": "The cockroach that emerged from your sink drain and scuttled under the fridge? The nocturnal critter was most likely a German cockroach, and its ancestors were pestering people more than 2,000 years ago in southern Asia, a new study found. The research, published May 20 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the insects\u2019 journey from scavenging in ancient Asian civilizations to getting cozy beneath your kitchen floor closely aligns with major historical shifts in global commerce, colonization and war. German cockroaches, scientifically known as Blattella germanica, are ubiquitous in cities in the United States and around the world. The hardy pests first appeared in scientific records from 250 years ago in Europe, hence the German moniker, but little is known about their origin. To figure out how cockroaches got there and spread to other parts of the world, first study author Dr. Qian Tang and his collaborators asked scientists and pest control experts around the globe for local specimens. The research team received 281 German cockroach samples from 57 sites in 17 countries and studied their DNA to trace their evolution. \u201cOur main purpose was to show how a species can travel with humans and how genetics can make up the missing part of historical records,\u201d said Tang, an evolutionary biologist who is now a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard University. Using genomic data from the samples, Tang was surprised to learn that the modern cockroach\u2019s lineage goes back much further than 18th century Europe. The insect evolved from the wild Asian cockroach, scientifically known as Blattella asahinai, 2,100 years ago, according to his research. Cockroaches and trade routes Around that time, Tang and his colleagues speculate, people in what is now India or Myanmar began planting crops in the Asian roach\u2019s natural habitat. The insects adapted \u2014 shifting their diets to include human food \u2014 and then shifted their territory into human households. A millennium later, as trade and military activity grew between southern Asia and the Middle East and later Europe, domesticated cockroaches spread westward, probably hitching rides in soldiers\u2019 and travelers\u2019 lunch baskets. The study team\u2019s genetic analysis puts the insects\u2019 first entry into Europe around 270 years ago. That estimate comes close to when famed Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described them in 1776, about a decade after the Seven Years\u2019 War raged across Asia, Europe and North America. The cockroaches then made it from Europe to the Americas about 120 years ago, the study found. \u201cInsects are part of the fabric of human culture,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Ware, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the research. \u201cFor the longest time, we\u2019ve kind of known that people are moving around a lot of pest species. And we know that transatlantic trade routes probably were the culprit for the spread of German cockroaches. But to actually see this reflected in the genetic signature of these populations, that was very exciting.\u201d Humans have been making them at home ever since, she said. \u201cThe things that have allowed humans to thrive \u2014 indoor plumbing, indoor heating \u2014 are things that have also allowed cockroaches to thrive,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBy creating sewers underneath our cities, we couldn\u2019t have provided a better buffet.\u201d Next, Tang wants to sequence the full genomes of his hundreds of specimens to learn how German cockroaches have adapted so successfully to the human environment. \u201cFor example, the German cockroach has insecticide resistance that is not detected in many other pests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can they evolve so fast? Is it something that\u2019s already in their genes, but has become revealed because of anthropogenic pressures?\u201d The insects also demonstrate social behaviors, communicating with one another about where to find food. Tang wants to find out if this ability, too, is a survival trait for which roaches have humans to thank.

{"id": "2024_06_18_health_resistance-training-older-adults-wellness", "text": "Retirement should be filled with time with loved ones, relaxation and\u2014according to new research\u2014heavy lifting. As people get older, their skeletal muscle function declines, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine. \u201cIf you do resistance training at this age, benefits in some parameters may last several years,\u201d said lead study author \ufeffMads Bloch-Ibenfeldt, a doctoral student at the Institute of Sports Medicine at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. To investigate whether resistance exercise programs could be helpful in the long term, researchers performed a randomized control trial with 369 recently retired and healthy adults who were between 64 and 75 years old. The participants were assigned one of three exercise programs for a year. They either lifted weights three times a week, did moderate-intensity training using their body weight and resistance bands three times a week, or did not change their usual exercise routines, the study said. Researchers measured their bone and muscle strength as well as body fat levels at the start of the trial at the end of the one-year program and then two and four years later, according to the study. It was up to the individuals whether they continued their strength training regimen or went back to their normal exercise level, Resistance training with heavy loads yielded the greatest long-lasting benefit in leg strength, the study showed. Even four years after the training, their leg strength was unaltered, whereas the moderate-intensity group did see a decrease \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t significant, the study showed. \u201cExercise is critically important across the life span. This study does show that even in those engaging in activity later in life around retirement can lead to marked benefits to one\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the School of Medicine (Geriatric Medicine) and in the Gillings School of Global Public Health (Nutrition). He was not involved in the research. What counts as resistance training? The umbrella of exercise includes aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance activities, Batsis said. \u201cEach of these have important consequences if one regularly performs them or does not on overall health (including cognition) and physical function,\u201d Batsis\ufeff said in an email. You can think of resistance training as \u201cexercises that improve strength by making muscles work against a force,\u201d said CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a mind-body coach for professional athletes. That force can include weights, resistance bands or your own body weight\u2014like with pushups or squats, she added. \u201cFor older adults, resistance training is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, and mobility,\u201d she said. According to the recent study, adding heavier weight seems to be important, Bloch-Ibenfeldt said. What you can do at home One limitation of the exercise proposed in the recent study is that the weighted exercises were done at a gym, which is something not everyone has the time, money or transportation to do, Batsis said. While you should consult a certified trainer or physical therapist to ensure\ufeff you are exercising safely, there are things you can do from home, Santas said. For older adults, it is important to strengthen in ways that are important to functional movements of everyday living, she added. Santas recommends box squats, where you sit lightly on a chair seat and stand back up. If you don\u2019t need to hold the arms of the chair for support, add some dumbbells, Santas said. The added weight gives \u201cadditional resistance while also improving\u00a0grip strength, which is essential for functional independence and serves as (a) marker for heart health,\u201d she added. You can also increase strength in functional movements, protect your knee joints and prevent injury by placing a resistance band around both of your legs and doing side steps,\u00a0side lunging\u00a0or\u00a0reverse lunging, she said. Try to do two or three sets of eight to 12 of each activity at least a couple of times a week, Santas said. Regular maintenance of exercise and other health factors are important for independence later in life, Batsis said. \u201cThe basics of lifestyle changes, including nutrition and exercise are a major key to healthy aging,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/resistance-training-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness", "text": "When her daughter was 6 years old, Kelceymarie Warner began to notice her child\u2019s hesitation before bedtime. \u201cHer body would be a little more tense, and she would hyperventilate if you pushed the subject too soon, she really needed to be slowly moved into the cycle.\u201d Warner, who is a parent to four young daughters, believes that sticking to a nightly routine is the best way for her kids to have an easy transition to bedtime. But when her 6-year-old was experiencing bedtime anxiety, Warner had to make some additions to her routine. Warner is not the only one \u2014 many parents know all too well what can be a nightly struggle to get their young children to bed. A new C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health reinforces this common difficulty, revealing that 1 in 4 parents said their child has trouble getting to sleep because they are anxious or worried. Over one-third of parents reported that their child doesn\u2019t stay asleep throughout the night and often or occasionally wakes up upset or crying. \u201cFrom 1 year of age to 6 years of age, kids change a lot. The different phases that they go to are often pretty predictable: They\u2019re scared of the dark, or as kids develop and their imagination develops \u2026 now they\u2019re scared of monsters,\u201d said Sarah Clark, Mott poll co-director and a research scientist in pediatrics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt can be all sorts of things, and so often with kids, and I would argue adults too, some of those anxieties seem to come out at night.\u201d The Mott Poll was conducted in February with 781 parents who have at least one child age 1 to 6 years old. Almost half reported their child leaving their bed and moving to the parent\u2019s bed some or most nights, while 1 in 3 parents said their child often or occasionally insists that they stay in the room until the child falls asleep. But some of these habits may be causing more trouble than the temporary relief they provide, Clark said. While a child may feel safe knowing the parent is in the room, they could later wake up and not be able to go back to sleep on their own, she added. How to help an anxious child with bedtime Warner said her child\u2019s bedtime anxiety may have been caused by the major changes that happened when her youngest daughter was in the neonatal intensive care unit for three months. \u201cMy husband and I were gone for extended periods during the day and even during the night because we wanted to be with a new baby who was born three months early \u2014 but we also needed to be there with our other children. I think she really struggled with a major change in her routine, and it just kind of triggered this very difficult time for her especially.\u201d Warner began incorporating activities into her daughter\u2019s bedtime routine that would promote relaxation and reassurance, such as drinking herbal tea after bathtime, reading a story together and saying nightly affirmations like \u201cI am loved\u201d and \u201cI am important.\u201d The new routine took longer than usual, sometimes up to an hour, but now, a little over a year later, her daughter is able to go through some parts of the routine on her own, and is able to better self-soothe, Warner said. She had posted her advice for other parents that may be facing a similar scenario\u00a0on her TikTok\u00a0account in 2023. The most important factor in getting kids to bed is consistency and sticking with a bedtime routine, Mott Poll co-director Clark said. Ninety percent of polled parents reported having an established and consistent bedtime routine. But some 27% described getting their child to bed was difficult, and those parents were more likely to not have a bedtime routine, stay in the room until the child fell asleep and keep the television or a video on. \u201cWe know that young children really resonate with consistency and routine, and getting ready for bed helps their body and their brain know that this is the time to start winding down,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Hartstein, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. She studies sleep and circadian health in early childhood and was not involved in the Mott poll. Hartstein recommends limiting media use at night, especially avoiding exciting content that could stimulate the child\u2019s brain and make it harder to wind down. A\u00a0January 2022 study\u00a0that Hartstein led found that children around this age group were more sensitive to light at night than adults are, and it could interfere with a child\u2019s production of natural melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Parents could find it beneficial to dim the lights an hour before bed, which would trigger a mental cue that it\u2019s time to get ready to sleep soon, she added. As for staying in the child\u2019s bedroom until they fall asleep, Clark recommends leaving the room and returning to check in every few minutes, which lets the child know that someone will be making sure they are safe every so often, but not staying in the room indefinitely. It\u2019s common for young children to experience sleep issues, especially as preschool-age children begin to reduce or drop naptime, Hartstein said. If parents are especially worried or see their child struggling during the day because they are sleepy, they should talk with their pediatrician, she added. Giving melatonin to young children The poll also found 1 in 5 parents often or sometimes give their child melatonin before bedtime, which came as a surprise given the younger age range of 1 to 6 years old, Clark said. \u201cClearly, this is something that people are feeling the need to try with younger kids. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a signal of how disruptive sleep problems can be for the whole family.\u201d It isn\u2019t recommended to give melatonin to children younger than age of 3, since many sleep issues with children that age are behavioral, according to\u00a0Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0If a parent is considering giving melatonin to their child, they should speak with their pediatrician first, Hartstein said. \u201c(One) concern is that what you\u2019re teaching them is that if they can\u2019t sleep, they should just take a medication, at a time when they should really be developing these healthy sleep habits that will carry them through childhood,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_depression-types-brain-treatments-study-wellness", "text": "For some people with depression, finding the right medication can be a process of trial and error lasting for months or even years, which can worsen symptoms. But what if doctors, when diagnosing someone with depression, could assess exactly how depression is affecting a patient\u2019s brain and prescribe a treatment that gets it right the first time? Scientists may be a step closer to that reality, thanks to new research that has identified six subtypes \u2014 or \u201cbiotypes\u201d \u2014 of major depression via brain imaging combined with machine learning. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, also tested how three of those biotypes responded to different antidepressants and therapies. \u201cThere are currently no tests available to help pinpoint what type of depression (people) have, or, I think especially importantly, what treatment might be most suitable for them,\u201d said Dr. Leanne Williams, the study\u2019s senior author and the Vincent V.C. Woo Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. \u201cThe current situation is we rely on a person to tell us what they\u2019re experiencing and for the physician or therapist to observe symptoms and come to a diagnosis.\u201d About 280 million people worldwide and 26 million people in the United States have depression, which is a leading cause of disability. Some 30% to 40% of people with depression do not experience symptom improvement after trying one treatment, according to the study. And about 30% of people diagnosed with depression go on to experience treatment-resistant depression when the disorder doesn\u2019t improve after multiple treatment attempts. \u201cThat motivated this study \u2014 to have a whole new way to more quickly get the right treatment, to figure out the right treatment for each person the first time,\u201d said Williams, who is also the director of the Stanford Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness. Williams lost her partner to a decades-long struggle with depression in 2015 and for more than 20 years has focused her work on individualized mental health care.\u00a0 Mapping depression in the brain The authors used data from 801 adult participants who were previously diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and 137 healthy control group participants. The authors used functional MRI \u2014 magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 to measure participants\u2019 brain activity when they were at rest doing nothing, focusing on brain regions already known to play a role in depression, and on the connections between those regions. They also monitored brain activity when participants, who were in their mid-30s on average, engaged in various tests that evaluated their cognitive and emotional functioning. The authors also randomly assigned 250 of the participants to receive behavioral talk therapy or one of three commonly used antidepressants: venlafaxine, escitalopram or sertraline. The six biotypes of depression the authors found include one characterized by hyperactivity in cognitive regions, which was associated with more anxiety, negative bias, threat dysregulation and anhedonia than other biotypes. Threat dysregulation refers to how people manage their reactions to their fears, such as social interactions, Williams said. Anhedonia is the lack of interest in or enjoyment of life experiences. Participants with this biotype also performed worse on executive function tasks that assessed how well they could manage thoughts or behaviors, make decisions or suppress distraction, Williams said. They also had the best response to the antidepressant venlafaxine. Another biotype was marked by higher levels of brain connectivity in three regions associated with depression and problem-solving. Those with this biotype also made errors in executive function tests but did do well on cognitive tasks. They found their symptoms better alleviated by behavioral talk therapy, which teaches skills for better addressing daily problems. The higher connectivity in these brain regions might be what helped participants with that biotype more readily adopt new skills, study coauthor Dr. Jun Ma said in a news release. There was also a biotype distinguished by lower levels of activity in the brain circuit that manages attention. This biotype was linked with more mistakes on tasks requiring sustained attention, and less of a chance of improving with therapy. People with this biotype may need medication for the dysfunction first so they can gain more from therapy, said Ma, the Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago. The authors also found a biotype characterized by high emotional reactivity, meaning the brains of participants in this group were more affected by emotional inputs such as their own emotions or people\u2019s facial expressions, Williams said. One other biotype was associated with lower activity in cognitive brain regions and less connectivity in emotional regions, meaning these participants had difficulty responding to cognitive information and regulating negative emotions. Those last two biotypes didn\u2019t respond to the medications or therapy, which suggests other options may be needed for people with those types, Williams said. \u201cIn other studies, we\u2019re finding they respond to some of the newer treatments being developed.\u201d The sixth biotype identified didn\u2019t differ from brain scans of the same region in people without depression. Williams said she thinks this finding could mean the full range of brain biology underlying depression hasn\u2019t been entirely discovered. \u201cDepression is a lot of different things with a lot of different causes, biological changes and treatments,\u201d said Dr. Richard Keefe, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study \u201ctakes a positive step in the direction\u201d of figuring these things out, Keefe added via email. Hurdles and next steps The study, though \u201csophisticated and very well done,\u201d does have several key problems, including the low number of people enrolled in treatment, said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, the Dorothy and Marty Silverman Chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \u201cIt needs to be thought of as a very preliminary study that needs to be replicated.\u201d Additionally, more diverse samples are needed, said Alpert, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study and is a professor of psychiatry, neuroscience and pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Most participants were White, and 2% were Black. But the most important next step is a study that tests the authors\u2019 hypothesis \u2014 that if patients have particular biotypes, they\u2019ll do better on a specific treatment \u2014 and tracks participants over time, said Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Council on Research. The 250 treatment participants weren\u2019t randomized on the basis of their biotypes. So, what Alpert recommends the authors do next is assign people to treatments based on their biotypes and see whether those participants have better outcomes from that method than if they had been assigned to a treatment according to clinical judgment without knowledge of their biotype. Another issue is that the study investigated only one form of psychotherapy and three medications; in the real world, there are many of each, Alpert said. The medications were also all serotonin-based, but there are a few other classes of antidepressants. Studies can only do so much at a time, Alpert acknowledged, but addressing these shortcomings incrementally would help continue advancements toward precision psychiatry. What these findings mean for you The study\u2019s methods and findings are years away from being applied to direct patient care, experts said, but there is funding for such efforts. \u201cSince 2009, the National Institute of Mental Health has been invested in using basic science, including functional brain imaging like in this study, for identifying the causes of mental illness through approaches that delve deeper than the traditional diagnostic approaches,\u201d Keefe said. This month, Williams was awarded an $18.8 million grant as part of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Individually Measured Phenotypes to Advance Computational Translation in Mental Health Initiative. The grant supports a five-year project involving 4,500 participants, which is centered on the development of a better diagnosis and treatment tool for depression biotypes. The new study\u2019s approach has begun to be experimentally implemented at a Stanford clinic, Williams said. \u201cWhen we use it in that setting, we can effectively double the chance of someone getting better,\u201d she said, taking the odds from around 30% of people improving with the traditional approach to about 75% with the more precise method. This method isn\u2019t intended to replace or be the primary choice for assessments of individual cases of depression, Williams said. It\u2019s another piece that can be added to the puzzle that also includes symptom information, clinical interviews and more. For now, people with depression should know \u201cthere is continued progress being made\u201d toward efficiently getting patients effective treatment, Alpert said. If you\u2019re struggling, talk with a mental health professional about your options. One powerful effect these findings could have immediately is to reduce stigma, Williams said. For people who think their depression is just due to them \u201cnot trying hard enough,\u201d she added, understanding the disorder through the lens of objective measures of brain function could be \u201cdeeply helpful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/depression-types-brain-treatments-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_telling-lies-partner-content-wellness", "text": "Prominent cases of purported lying continue to dominate the news cycle. President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden was\u00a0found guilty of lying on a government form\u00a0while purchasing a handgun. Republican Representative George Santos\u00a0allegedly lied in many ways, including to donors through a third party in order to misuse the funds raised. The rapper Offset\u00a0admitted to lying on Instagram\u00a0about his wife, Cardi B, being unfaithful. There are a number of variables that distinguish these cases. One is the audience: the faceless government, particular donors and millions of online followers, respectively. Another is the medium used to convey the alleged lie: on a bureaucratic form, through intermediaries and via social media. Differences like these lead researchers like me to wonder what factors influence the telling of lies. Does a personal connection increase or decrease the likelihood of sticking to the truth? Are lies more prevalent on text or email than on the phone or in person? An emerging body of empirical research is trying to answer these questions, and some of the findings are surprising. They hold lessons, too - for how to think about the areas of your life where you might be more prone to tell lies, and also about where to be most cautious in trusting what others are saying. As the recent director of\u00a0The Honesty Project\u00a0and author of \u201cHonesty: The Philosophy and Psychology of a Neglected Virtue,\u201d I am especially interested in whether most people tend to be honest or not. READ MORE: Are people lying more since the rise of social media? Figuring out the frequency of lies Most research on lying asks participants to self-report their lying behavior, say during the past day or week. (Whether you can trust liars to tell the truth about lying is another question.) The classic study on lying frequency was conducted by psychologist\u00a0Bella DePaulo\u00a0in the mid-1990s. It focused on face-to-face interactions and used a group of student participants and another group of volunteers from the community around the University of Virginia. The community members\u00a0averaged one lie per day, while the students averaged two lies per day. This result became the benchmark finding in the field of honesty research and helped lead to an assumption among many researchers\u00a0that lying is commonplace. But averages do not describe individuals. It could be that each person in the group tells one or two lies per day. But it\u2019s also possible that there are some people who lie voraciously and others who lie very rarely. In an influential 2010 study, this second scenario is indeed what Michigan State University communication researcher\u00a0Kim Serota\u00a0and his colleagues found. Out of 1,000 American participants,\u00a059.9% claimed not to have told a single lie\u00a0in the past 24 hours. Of those who admitted they did lie, most said they\u2019d told very few lies. Participants reported 1,646 lies in total, but half of them came from just 5.3% of the participants. This general pattern in the\u00a0data has been replicated\u00a0several times. Lying tends to be rare, except in the case of a small group of frequent liars. READ MORE: Watching children learn how to lie Does the medium make a difference? Might lying become more frequent under various conditions? What if you don\u2019t just consider face-to-face interactions, but introduce some distance by communicating via text, email or the phone? Research suggests the medium doesn\u2019t matter much. For instance, a 2014 study by Northwestern University communication researcher\u00a0Madeline Smith\u00a0and her colleagues found that when participants were asked to look at their 30 most recent text messages,\u00a023% said there were no deceptive texts. For the rest of the group, the vast majority said that 10% or fewer of their texts contained lies. Recent research by David Markowitz\u00a0at the University of Oregon successfully replicated earlier findings that had compared the\u00a0rates of lying using different technologies. Are lies more common on text, the phone or on email? Based on survey data from 205 participants, Markowitz found that on average, people\u00a0told 1.08 lies per day, but once again with the distribution of lies skewed by some frequent liars. Not only were the percentages fairly low, but the differences between the frequency with which lies were told via different media were not large. Still, it might be surprising to find that, say, lying on video chat was more common than lying face-to-face, with lying on email being least likely. A couple of\u00a0factors could be playing a role. Recordability seems to rein in the lies \u2013 perhaps knowing that the communication leaves a record raises worries about detection and makes lying less appealing. Synchronicity seems to matter too. Many lies occur in the heat of the moment, so it makes sense that when there\u2019s a delay in communication, as with email, lying would decrease. READ MORE: The truth about reading body language\u00a0 Does the audience change things? In addition to the medium, does the intended receiver of a potential lie make any difference? Initially you might think that people are more inclined to lie to strangers than to friends and family, given the impersonality of the interaction in the one case and the bonds of care and concern in the other. But matters are a bit more complicated. In her classic work, DePaulo found that people tend to tell what she called \u201ceveryday lies\u201d\u00a0more often to strangers than family members. To use her examples, these are smaller lies like \u201ctold her (that) her muffins were the best ever\u201d and \u201cexaggerated how sorry I was to be late.\u201d For instance, DePaulo and her colleague Deborah Kashy reported that participants in one of their studies lied\u00a0less than once per 10 social interactions\u00a0with spouses and children. However, when it came to serious lies about things like affairs or injuries, for instance, the pattern flipped. Now,\u00a053% of serious lies were to close partners\u00a0in the study\u2019s community participants, and the proportion jumped up to 72.7% among student volunteers. Perhaps not surprisingly, in these situations people might value not damaging their relationships more than they value the truth. Other data also finds participants tell\u00a0more lies to friends and family members\u00a0than to strangers. READ MORE: With so many people speaking \u2018their truth\u2019, how do we know what the truth really is?\u00a0 Investigating the truth about lies It is worth emphasizing that these are all initial findings. Further replication is needed, and cross-cultural studies using non-Western participants are scarce. Additionally, there are many other variables that could be examined, such as age, gender, religion and political affiliation. When it comes to honesty, though, I find the results, in general, promising. Lying seems to happen rarely for many people, even toward strangers and even via social media and texting. Where people need to be especially discerning, though, is in identifying \u2013 and avoiding \u2013 the small number of rampant liars out there. If you\u2019re one of them yourself, maybe you never realized that you\u2019re actually in a small minority.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/telling-lies-partner-content-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_gun-violence-stop-the-bleed-children-gupta", "text": "When I visited Rocklin Elementary school, I sat in on a lesson with a third-grade class \u2013\u00a0a lesson I would never have imagined as a father, a journalist or a trauma surgeon. \u201cChances are, you\u2019re never ever going to have to use this. If you do, it\u2019s gonna be scary,\u201d Kate Carleton told the 20 or so 8- and 9-year-olds. \u201cBut because we\u2019ve taught you what to do, it makes it a little less scary.\u201d She spent the next 30 minutes teaching them how to stop a wound from bleeding out. The lesson is appropriately titled \u201cStop the Bleed.\u201d Carleton is a trauma nurse at Sutter Roseville Medical Center, a level 2 trauma center in Rocklin,\u00a0California, a northern suburb of Sacramento. At the beginning of her 17-year career, she saw a lot of car crashes, motorcycle accidents and falls. More recently, the number of gunshot wounds coming through her hospital has increased, most often from domestic violence or suicide. On this day, she was\u00a0kneeling on the ground\u00a0to show these little kids the techniques paramedics often use in the field to stop bleeding. And as I looked around the classroom, I could tell that the kids were really listening. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ve got that bleeding to stop on that person, what did you do for their life?\u201d she asked the kids. Hands flew up. \u201cYou saved their life,\u201d answered one little girl. Born out of tragedy A litt\ufeffle\u00a0more than\u00a0seven years ago, Carleton was watching a special about the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, and like so many parents, she wondered about her own children, then in kindergarten and second grade. Was there anything she could do to make a difference and help keep them safer in a moment like that? Carleton\u00a0approached her daughter\u2019s kindergarten teacher and asked whether it was possible to create a curriculum to teach them how to handle these injuries. She wasn\u2019t sure what the response would be because after all, these were young children. But as the number of mass shootings continued to grow, so did the realization that anyone could suddenly become a first responder \u2014 even a child. The proposal was approved, and since then, she has been teaching classes to students throughout the Rocklin school district on the basics of bleeding control. Carleton is part of a larger movement also known as \u201cStop the Bleed,\u201d a campaign that was born out of the tragedy at Sandy Hook. Hartford Hospital trauma surgeon Dr. Lenworth Jacobs was tasked with reviewing the autopsies of the 20 children and six adults killed that day,\u00a0to find any lessons\u00a0that could be\u00a0learned out\u00a0of the horror. \u201cYou cannot imagine what the kinetic energy of an AR-15 does, or a bullet does, to a 6-year-old,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThis is not civilized.\u201d School shootings are rare, but gunshot injuries are not Although a child dying at school in a mass shooting may be unlikely, a child dying from a gunshot is not. Firearms are the leading cause of death among people 18 and\u00a0younger\u00a0in the US, accounting for nearly\u00a019% of all childhood deaths. The\u00a0most recent data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that both the rate and the number of children dying from gunshot wounds are the highest they have been since 1999, when data on children\u2019s mortality and firearms was first collected. And although firearm mortality in the adult population is most often from suicide, for children, homicide is driving the deaths. After poring over the autopsies, Jacobs gathered trauma specialists from across the country and developed \u201ca protocol for national policy to enhance survivability from active shooter and intentional mass casualty events,\u201d known as the\u00a0Hartford Consensus. The nearly 100-page document included a letter from then-Vice President Joe Biden, who said the report was a \u201ccall to action.\u201d \u201cWith very little training and equipment, the individuals\u00a0closest to the scene of an accident or mass casualty situation can control bleeding until first responders arrive to take over treatment,\u201d Biden wrote. Much of the Hartford Consensus was adopted from lessons learned in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the military, it\u2019s known as\u00a0\u201cbuddy aid\u201d: the practice of fellow troops being trained in first aid to help wounded colleagues on the battlefield. The practices are basic, but stopping bleeding, using a tourniquet and putting these steps into practice before a wounded soldier reaches the hospital greatly improves their chances of survival. Those troops who had tourniquets applied before their bodies went into shock had\u00a0a survival rate of 96%, compared with just 4% of those who got a tourniquet after blood loss caused them to go into shock. A driving tenet of the Hartford Consensus was time. \u201cPretty much all of these (mass casualty) events are over in 15 minutes, and it takes more than that to get the system to respond to you,\u201d Jacobs explained. Experts say that the average response time for an ambulance in urban areas in the US is\u00a0about eight minutes\u00a0\u2014 more time than it takes for a person to bleed out from a gunshot wound. Turning bystanders into first responders To give a person the best chance at survival after being shot, the priority is simple. \u201cStop the bleeding. Keep the blood inside the body,\u201d Jacobs said. The most efficient and quickest way to do that: turn bystanders into immediate responders by teaching them to pack a wound and use a tourniquet. \ufeffEleven years\u00a0after Jacobs and other experts first met to discuss what would ultimately become the Hartford Consensus,\u00a0more than 3 million people\u00a0worldwide have learned the basic principles of \u201cStop the Bleed\u201d through a certification program developed by the American College of Surgeons and the\u00a0American\u00a0Red Cross. According to the ACS, bleeding control kits containing gauze and tourniquets are now required in schools in at least\u00a010\u00a0states, and teachers and staff are required to be trained in at least\u00a0three\u00a0states. Two states require schools to offer Stop the Bleed training to students: in Arkansas for students in ninth grade and above and in Texas for those in seventh grade and above. After 19 fourth-graders and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022, a state representative introduced a bill proposing to lower the minimum grade for Stop the Bleed training to third grade. The bill never made it out of committee because of pushback. Carleton says she\u2019s not surprised. \u201cWhy it got started is frightening,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut I do think there\u2019s a way to teach the information where it\u2019s not.\u201d Meeting kids where they\u2019re at When Carleton speaks to the kids, she doesn\u2019t mention guns or violence at all. During the class I visited, she asked the kids how many of their parents use power tools or could be hurt working around the house. \u201cIf I\u2019m working in the kitchen and I\u2019m cutting vegetables, can I get cut? Can that cause me to bleed?\u201d she\u00a0asked the students. She uses language that kids can easily grasp: \u201cLook for when blood puddles or when it rains like a sprinkler. The first step, take any cloth you can find and stuff a corner of it into the wound as deep as you can.\u201d She was teaching them the basic principles of packing a wound. On the day I was there, she told the kids they could\u00a0use anything to pack a wound, even a \u201cdirty, smelly sock.\u201d \u201cStopping the bleeding was most important, and they could give antibiotics later in the hospital to prevent infections,\u201d she said. \u201cDo whatever you can to just stop the bleed.\u201d It\u2019s the same kind of approach that pediatric trauma nurse Missy Anderson takes when she teaches Scout troops and children\u2019s groups in Denver. Anderson is the pediatric trauma program manager at Denver Health and describes the tourniquets as \u201cmagical bracelets\u201d \u2014 a concept that most kids can immediately understand. Carleton stopped bringing up gun violence after a handful of parents complained, but she doesn\u2019t shy away\u00a0when someone raises it.\u00a0In a sixth-grade class I visited, a student asked, if someone was shot in multiple places, where should they try to stop the bleed? Carleton answered quickly, \u201cWhere they are bleeding the most.\u201d \u201cI try to acknowledge the kids on where they\u2019re at,\u201d she told me. \u201cI acknowledge it and we move on so that we can continue to talk about how to get the bleeding to stop.\u201d But\u00a0the topic of gun violence\u00a0gives her pause. \u201cIt tugs at my heartstrings a little bit, for sure,\u201d she said. Like Carleton, Anderson keeps the focus on safety, not violence. \u201cWhat if no guns existed in the whole world? We wipe them all out, there\u2019s not a single gun in the whole universe? People still get hurt, and they still can have bleeding,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThis course should not be affiliated with gun violence. This is about helping people that are bleeding in any scenario.\u201d The goal of the campaign has always been to train everyone, including children, said Dr. Kenji Inaba, chair of the Stop the Bleed Committee for the American College of Surgeons. Inaba said he taught his\u00a0now-teenage son, an avid mountain biker, how to pack a wound and use a tourniquet by the time he was 10 years old. \u201cHe\u2019s always in the middle of nowhere, by himself or with some friends, and I want him to know that knowledge.\u201d Inaba said that after discussion with pediatric surgeons, pediatricians and parents, the committee concluded that there really is no age limit on who should be taught these skills. \u201cEvery child is different in their development. Every child is different in their experience,\u201d he said. Inaba added that the group is in discussion with child development experts and teachers to create a curriculum for younger kids. Reaching kids where they are means designing education that meets not only their emotional needs but their physical needs. For example, Carleton explained to me that younger kids can more effectively put pressure and stop bleeding by using all of their body weight. She showed the kids how to put their knee directly on the wound. \u201cIt\u2019ll make it a little bit easier for you, and you won\u2019t get tired,\u201d she told them. I watched as she stood in front of the class and demonstrated how to apply pressure with a rubber dummy limb, the same kind used to train EMTs. Carleton explained that adults will typically use their hands and press down as hard as possible over a packed wound, \u201cbecause I\u2019m stronger than you,\u201d she said. One kid shouted out \u201cMom power!\u201d and the class giggled. Carleton then quickly divided the class into groups of four or five kids, led by volunteers from the fire department, to practice on dummy limbs. \u201cIf you were in that situation, do you think you could do it now? Does that make you nervous at all?\u201d I asked\u00a0Harlow, a third-grader. \u201cJust the feeling of how it would be an actual person instead of a fake leg. That\u2019s scary,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you think based on what you learned, if it was an actual person, you\u2019d be able to do that?\u201d\u00a0\ufeffI responded. \u201cYeah,\u201d Harlow responded confidently. Even young children know how to help Studies find that young people can learn lifesaving\u00a0lessons. Though they aren\u2019t as young as the students I visited, a 2019 study of high school students found that\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of them were able to position a tourniquet correctly after being taught either in person or online. A small\u00a02022\u00a0study of 11- and 12-year-olds found that\u00a097% of the students\u00a0grasped the lessons of bleeding control and tourniquet use after Stop the Bleed training. A recent study from the\u00a0American Heart Association\u00a0found that children as young as 4 know how to call for help in a medical emergency and that by age 10 to 12, children can administer\u00a0effective\u00a0CPR. Harlow\u2019s classmate Jeremy told me that the best part of learning all of this was that he was prepared to help anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling you get when you get to see them go to the hospital and know that they\u2019re OK and the feeling that you\u2019ve saved someone\u2019s life,\u201d he said. And the lessons seem to stick with them. A sixth-grader, Piper, told me that although she would probably be nervous to apply these skills in a \u201creal situation\u201d when someone was \u201cactually bleeding out and there was a puddle,\u201d she was glad they had a trial run through the lessons in the classroom. \u201cIt kind of loosens things up and doesn\u2019t make things so scary.\u201d Carleton\u2019s daughter and Piper\u2019s classmate, Quinn, agreed. \u201cWhen a situation comes for something like this, it won\u2019t be as scary, since we know what to do because we\u2019ve already practiced it,\u201d she said. A new \u2018stop, drop and roll\u2019 As impressed as I was with how quick and engaged the kids were, I couldn\u2019t help but feel sad that this is where we are\u00a0as\u00a0a country. A time when tourniquets and bleeding control kits are as routine as \u201cstop, drop and roll,\u201d the fire safety instructions that generations of children have learned in their classrooms. When I shared that with Carleton, she told me that she felt the same way at first, but she had to change her approach. \u201cWhen I would initially go into that with that kind of feeling, I just found that I couldn\u2019t teach the information in a way that it really resonated with them. It was being taught out of fear from me, and I don\u2019t want that,\u201d she said. It is hard, however, to disentangle gun violence from the situations where these lessons could be most impactful. Gun violence has become such a prevalent part of American life, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has now issued an\u00a0advisory\u00a0calling firearm violence an urgent public health crisis. The advisory notes that half of children ages 14 to 17 worry about school shootings and nearly 60% of them have thought about \u201cwhat would happen if a person with a gun entered\u201d their school. According to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive,\u00a0last year alone, 1,682 children died and another 4,512 were injured by gun violence. So a grass-roots movement to train elementary-age children continues, with people like Carleton leading the charge. \u201cWe can teach it, like teaching hands-only\u00a0CPR or how to use an AED. It just becomes part of what we do,\u201d Carleton told me. \u201cIt can be used in all situations, whether it\u2019s a violent situation or not. But either way, it\u2019s saving somebody\u2019s life.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/gun-violence-stop-the-bleed-children-gupta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_06_22_health_hiking-heat-safety-wellness", "text": "With summer officially here, many people are excited to go hiking along their favorite local trails or tackle an out-of-town bucket-list hike. But before you grab your backpack and race out the door, hiking and safety officials urge caution. Temperatures are already soaring in many parts of the nation and around the world, and high heat has the potential to make any hike risky \u2014 and even deadly. Earlier in June, a young couple was rescued on a hiking trail in the California desert after running out of water and becoming dehydrated. The boyfriend was conscious during the rescue, but the girlfriend appeared unconscious, and medical officials referred to her \u201csevere condition,\u201d according to KTLA in Los Angeles. Others have not been as fortunate. Last year, a 14-year-old boy died while hiking with two family members in Texas\u2019 Big Bend National Park. The temperature was 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius). In 2021, a couple, their 1-year-old child and their dog all died in California while hiking in Devil\u2019s Gulch Valley on an extremely hot day. Experts said they likely perished from hyperthermia (an abnormally high body temperature) and dehydration. In Phoenix, where more than 200 hikers are rescued every year \u2014 mostly due to hiking during the hottest part of the day \u2014 the city instituted a program to close certain trails when the heat reaches excessive levels. How to tackle hiking in the heat Despite these heat-related dangers, it\u2019s possible to hit the trails safely when temperatures soar. Here\u2019s how to do so, according to experts. Prepare for a hot hike ahead of time Whether it\u2019s hot or cool, you should be in reasonable shape before tackling any hike. If you\u2019re planning a hilly, 5-mile trek, for example, make sure you\u2019re able to hike 5 challenging miles before arriving at the trailhead. To prepare for heat, become acclimatized to hot weather. You can do so by taking short, easy hikes in warm weather, progressing up to longer, more difficult hikes in hot weather. If that\u2019s not possible and you\u2019re traveling to a hot locale for your hike, schedule the trek several days into the trip when your body will be more accustomed to the weather. It\u2019s also good to know your sweat rate, said Dr. Floris Wardenaar, an assistant professor of nutrition\u00a0at Arizona State University in Phoenix. Wardenaar, who studies the physiological aspect of hiking, recommended weighing yourself before and after several hikes, then comparing any weight loss with the amount of water you consumed during the hike. \u201cBody mass loss is a good proxy marker of sweat loss,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lose more than 2% of your body weight on a hike.\u201d If you\u2019re losing more weight than that, you should be drinking more fluids. Load up on water and carry a water filter Water is essential for any hike, no matter the season \u2014 but it\u2019s critical in hot weather. Unfortunately, many people underestimate the amount of water they\u2019ll need. \u201cAlways hike with a water treatment device, too, and carry electrolytes,\u201d Martinez said. Electrolyte tablets or drinks help replace the salts and minerals lost through sweat, which assists in preventing heat-related ailments such as heatstroke and heat exhaustion. \u201cBring extra water, even if it\u2019s heavy,\u201d said Teresa Ana Martinez, executive director and cofounder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition. The Continental Divide Trail stretches 3,100 miles (4,989 kilometers) from Mexico to Canada, including some 800 miles (1,287.5\u00a0kilometers) in New Mexico, where there\u2019s plenty of desert terrain. Hike in the morning, preferably on shady trails \u201cThe benefit of hiking earlier in the day versus later in the evening is that in the evening, the earth still holds heat from the day,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cIt will radiate from the rocks, too.\u201d If possible, select a trail that winds through shady woods, along water or even in a cool canyon or cave. This way, should you struggle with the heat, you can find shade and water for cooling off. Wear light, loose clothing that covers most of your skin A long-sleeve shirt and pants might seem counterintuitive on a hot day, but they\u2019ll prevent sunburn and stop your skin and body from heating up. A neck buff and hiking gloves are also a good idea, said Abe Christian, operations manager for the Florida Trail Association. The Florida Trail meanders more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) through the state, from Big Cypress Swamp on the southern tip of the peninsula to Fort Pickens in the panhandle. \u201cThere are plenty of places on the Florida Trail where the sun can beat you to death,\u201d Christian said. \u201cSo you need to cover your skin as best as possible.\u201d The buff can also double as a compress should the heat get to you. Just dip it in water and place on your head and neck. Take along a sun umbrella, phone \u2014 and a buddy Make sure you have a fully charged phone in case you need to call for help. A portable battery is helpful, too. Martinez swears by a sun umbrella, which keeps the sun\u2019s rays from heating your head. (Look for those with an ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF, label or a seal of recommendation from groups such as the Skin Cancer Foundation.) If possible, bring along a friend. Sometimes when you\u2019re experiencing dehydration, heat exhaustion or heatstroke, you\u2019re not thinking clearly and don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in danger. When in doubt, turn around \u201cIf you start your hike and think it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too hot,\u201d Martinez said. Just turn around and come back another day, she said. Another tip: Turn around when half of your water is gone, even if you haven\u2019t reached your goal. \u201cYour ego is your worst enemy,\u201d Martinez warned. \u201cPeople underestimate how quickly things can escalate. You don\u2019t know when your body will say, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/health/hiking-heat-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_exercise-summer-heat-wellness", "text": "For people in the Northern Hemisphere, it\u2019s summer and you might be inspired to get outdoors to move more.\u00a0But the weather is getting too warm in some places for people to exercise safely outside. We know that adults should aim for at least\u00a0150 minutes \u00a0of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly. This can include exercises such as brisk walking, biking, playing basketball, swimming and more vigorous household tasks like mowing the lawn and vacuuming, also called functional fitness.\u00a0But is that all safe to do at high temperatures? How hot is too hot for exercising outdoors? Is it safe to exercise outside at some times of the day? Should younger or older people take more precautions in the heat? What about people who have heart and kidney conditions or take certain medications? To help us stay fit and safe in the summer heat, I spoke with CNN wellness analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: What precautions should people take before exercising during the summer? Wen:\u00a0Summer can be a fantastic time to get outside and become more active, but as temperatures rise to unsafe levels,\u00a0people should be aware of the risk of\u00a0heat-related illnesses. I\u2019d advise that people look at the weather forecast before exercising. If a\u00a0heat wave\u00a0is expected, avoid exercising in the hottest part of the day and instead go out in the morning or evening. If it\u2019s going to be very hot all day and into the night, don\u2019t do your workout outside. CNN: What can happen if people work or exercise too much outside in the heat? Wen:\u00a0Someone working or exercising outside for prolonged periods of time may experience symptoms of heat exhaustion, including headache, weakness, dizziness\u00a0and nausea. When this happens, get out of the sun and into a cool, air-conditioned space. If symptoms worsen and the person develops confusion and vomiting, for instance, they may have\u00a0heat stroke, which is an emergency and requires immediate medical attention. CNN: Which people are most at risk during a heat wave?\u00a0 Wen:\u00a0\u00a0People who are the most vulnerable include those who are very young and elderly, and those who have chronic medical conditions. Several underlying conditions, such as heart, lung and kidney problems, can be exacerbated by heat. CNN: Do any medications make people more vulnerable during a heat wave? Wen:\u00a0Several medications can increase risk during times of extreme heat. Common blood pressure medications, like calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics, can have effects such as increasing the likelihood of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances during extreme heat. There are medications used for some mental health conditions that can affect the body\u2019s normal response to regulate temperature. That includes some antidepressants and stimulants used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Over-the-counter medicines can also have these effects. Diphenhydramine, for instance, and doxylamine are common antihistamines that can make people sweat less and affect temperature regulation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/exercise-summer-heat-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_obesity-genetic-wellness", "text": "Obesity isn\u2019t just a matter of food and exercise \u2014 it may be in your genetic code, according to new research. \u201cObesity\u2019s causes are very complex and in the majority of cases, the combination of many factors. In this study, however, we found a clear genetic trigger for obesity,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Mattia Frontini, British Heart Foundation senior fellow and an associate professor in cellular biology at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, in an email. Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that follows people long term, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Med. They compared data from people with two faulty copies of a particular gene (SMIM1) and those who did not have the two faulty copies. Women with the gene mutation weighed an extra 4.6 kilograms (10.14 pounds), and men with the variant weighed an extra 2.4 kilograms (5.29 pounds), according to the study. The faulty copies of the SMIM1 gene cause decreased function in the thyroid and declining energy expenditure, Frontini said, \u201cwhich means that given the same food intake, less energy is used and this excess is stored as fat.\u201d Not only is the correlation significant, but this study also identifies a specific gene mutation, which isn\u2019t always the case in research, said Dr. Philipp Scherer, director of the Touchstone Diabetes Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. He was not involved in the study. \u201cIt is an exciting study in that it puts a new gene on the map,\u201d Scherer said. \u201cIt\u2019s an actual gene, rather than just a genomic locus with a mutation somewhere where we don\u2019t understand. \u2026 We think we\u2019re looking at a gene here that we can further study.\u201d This genetic finding is \u2018pretty rare\u2019 This particular genetic finding doesn\u2019t apply to a large population of people with obesity \u2014 only about 1 in 5,000 people have this genetic makeup, Frontini said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty rare, but you multiply that to a population of 10 (million), 15 million and there\u2019s quite a few people out there that would walk around with that mutation and maybe weren\u2019t fully aware of the fact that there is a genetic explanation for their struggle with obesity,\u201d Scherer said. Dysfunction in the thyroid is common, affecting almost 2% of the population in the UK, Frontini said. And thyroid dysfunction is treated regularly with a relatively inexpensive medication, Frontini said. The next step in the research is to find out if people with the SMIM1 mutation qualify to treat their thyroid with medication, he added. \u201cIf they do, we plan to run a randomized clinical trial to determine if they would benefit from the treatment,\u201d Frontini said. \u201cThe hope is that they will, and we can improve their quality of life using a cheap, safe treatment.\u201d The best approach in the meantime Weight isn\u2019t just a matter of willpower or laziness. The size and shape of your body is determined by many factors \u2014 some of which you have control over and others you don\u2019t, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Among these factors are lifestyle habits, the amount of sleep you get, medications, health problems, where you live and work, and genetics, according to the institute. Research into genetic factors and potential treatments is still underway, but Scherer said the current best approach to medical treatment of obesity is GLP-1 medications. Severe restrictive dieting is not the answer, Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and author of \u201cThe Diet Detox: Why Your Diet Is Making You Fat and What to Do About It,\u201d said in an earlier CNN article. Demonizing foods too much may make you crave them more, and then the guilt you feel when you give in can lead to a cycle of fluctuating between restricting yourself and bingeing, she added. If you want to make changes to your lifestyle, it\u2019s best to try a gradual, sustainable approach while maintaining a healthy relationship with food, Emily Feig, a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in the same CNN report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/obesity-genetic-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_cancer-drug-shortages-continue", "text": "While a shortage of the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and carboplatin has improved in the United States, some of the nation\u2019s largest cancer centers now report additional concerns related to drug shortages, a new report finds. Among 28 large cancer centers across the country, 89% reported last month that at least one drug used to either treat cancer, its symptoms or the side effects of treatment was in short supply at their center, according to new survey results released Wednesday by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. That percentage has not changed much from last year, when about 86% of surveyed centers reported a shortage of at least one type of anti-cancer drug. But what has changed is specifically which cancer drugs are impacted. The new NCCN survey, conducted from May 28 to June 11 of this year, found that among 28 of the network\u2019s 33 cancer centers, more than half \u2014 57% \u2014 reported a short supply of the chemotherapy drug vinblastine, which is often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to treat Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and cancer of the testicles. The centers that participated in the survey also reported that several other key cancer medications are currently in short supply, with 46% reporting a shortage of the chemotherapy drug etoposide and 43% reporting a shortage of the chemotherapy drug topotecan. Dr. Crystal Denlinger, chief executive officer of the NCCN, said in an email that she was not surprised by the new survey results. \u201cSadly, as a practicing oncologist, I am well aware of and understand the challenges facing my patients and colleagues regarding oncology drug shortages, which have been going on for years. On the bright side, we have seen a new enthusiasm for both short- and long-term solutions since last year\u2019s survey came out. Our new survey shows the short-term solutions were fairly effective at meeting immediate needs,\u201d Denlinger said. However, long-term solutions are still needed, she said. \u201cThe current presidential administration and Congress have put forth various proposals. However, people with cancer don\u2019t always have the luxury of time. Given the results of this most recent survey, it is imperative to keep this issue top of mind as this is an urgent issue that requires sustained attention and solutions.\u201d Last year, 21% of surveyed centers reported a shortage of vinblastine, and etoposide and topotecan were not mentioned by name in the previous survey. But in that previous survey, 72% of centers reported a\u00a0shortage of the chemotherapy medication carboplatin, and 59% reported a\u00a0shortage of cisplatin. Carboplatin and cisplatin are\u00a0used in combination to treat many types of cancer. Cisplatin\u00a0and other similar platinum-based drugs are prescribed for an estimated 10% to 20% of all cancer patients,\u00a0according to the\u00a0National Cancer Institute. The new survey results suggest that the shortage of carboplatin and cisplatin has improved, as only 11% of surveyed centers reported a short supply of carboplatin and 7% reported a shortage of cisplatin. \u201cThanks to policymakers, patient advocates, healthcare professionals and health systems who went to extraordinary efforts to collaborate and mitigate harm, the shortages for carboplatin and cisplatin are mostly resolved at this time,\u201d Denlinger said. \u2018A significant and ongoing problem\u2019 The new survey also indicated that the current shortage of cancer drugs has not significantly disrupted patient care or clinical trials. But additional administrative work has been needed to ensure these things are not disrupted, according to NCCN. Among the centers reporting drug shortages, more than half \u2013 56% \u2013 indicated that their center still was able to treat patients who were receiving those medications by enacting \u201cmitigation strategies,\u201d such as limiting the use of medications that were in stock, adjusting doses, and implementing waste management strategies. Meanwhile, 37% of the centers with shortages reported still treating patients without mitigation strategies. But among the surveyed centers that reported drug shortages, 43% indicated that the shortages have impacted clinical trials at their center, leading to greater administrative burdens, reductions in trial enrollments, reductions in open trials, and budget changes, among other disruptions. It\u2019s not just the large cancer centers that are part of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network that are experiencing these drug shortages. Dr. Carolyn Hendricks, an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) board member, who was not involved in the NCCN report, said that smaller community cancer centers also are experiencing short supplies of critical cancer medications. \u201cI\u2019m in a community oncology practice. We in the community are experiencing the same types of shortages that the NCCN cancer centers are experiencing, and this survey data, which is an update of some prior surveys, really speaks to the fact that this is really a significant and ongoing problem, both in the cancer center environment and also in the community,\u201d Hendricks said. In Hendricks\u2019 practice in Maryland, she said that the center is currently experiencing a significant shortage of the chemotherapy drug etoposide, which was named in the new NCCN report. She added that the center received an alert Tuesday about the shortage. \u201cIt\u2019s more used for thoracic oncology, lung cancer \u2013 and the drugs that are incorporated in the lung cancer regimens are very important \u2013 and some testicular cancers and some other types of solid tumors,\u201d Hendricks said about etoposide. \u201cCancer care is complicated, but the vast majority of all cancer patients are treated with combination regimens, and so therefore it\u2019s critical that if one drug is in shortage, it becomes a challenge to administer the entire regimen to the patient and to afford either the highest chance of cure or the best quality of life in patients who have advanced disease,\u201d she said. In February, the chief medical officer and executive vice president of ASCO, Dr. Julie Gralow, testified before the US House Committee on Ways & Means about chronic drug shortages in the United States, calling the shortage a crisis. \u201cEvery day we hear from oncologists around the country about the challenges cancer patients and their providers are facing amid some of the worst oncology drug shortages to date,\u201d Gralow said at the time. \u201cThis crisis is forcing providers to make impossible choices, including having to decide which patients receive lifesaving and life-prolonging oncology drugs on schedule and in the established doses \u2014 and which ones won\u2019t.\u201d What needs to change The issue of cancer drug shortages continues to be driven by a combination of supply chain and economics, Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the new NCCN report, said in an email. He added that he was not surprised by the report\u2019s findings. \u201cMost older chemotherapy agents, particularly sterile injectable ones are produced in just a few settings, often times overseas. There is very little incentive financially for production. Therefore there is little redundancy and significant vulnerability if there is a manufacturing or supply chain issue,\u201d Dahut said. \u201cThe regulatory bodies can help signal the potential for shortages as well as help oversee the manufacturing, but without a change in the economic model shortages are likely to continue.\u201d Hendricks said that she thinks the way drugs are developed and then maintained in the supply chain are among the factors driving the ongoing drug shortage crisis. \u201cThe problem is the medications that are transitioned from a blockbuster drug into generic status,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cIn the United States, when new drugs come in development, they\u2019re under patent. They\u2019re usually blockbuster drugs \u2014 big in the news, high chance of cure \u2014 but mixed in amongst them are drugs that have come off the patent system and are classified as generics. The price goes down, which is good for the patients, but that means the supply chain of these generic medications is so vulnerable. They\u2019re not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t create a way to get pharmaceutical companies to want to make both the phenomenal blockbuster drugs we have and the generics then this problem will be chronic, and we won\u2019t be able to dig our way out or see a clear solution.\u201d Several generic cancer drug manufacturers have discontinued products over time for economic reasons, according to a White House statement last year. A Senate Finance Committee white paper from this year notes generics make up anywhere between 66-84% of drug shortages. In the new NCCN report, the surveyed centers called for solutions and noted concerns about how the marketplace currently operates. For instance, when asked what policy solutions they would like to see enacted to address oncology drug shortages, 75% of centers reported \u201ceconomic incentives to encourage high quality manufacturing of generics\u201d and 64% reported \u201cbetter information systems\u201d to accredit or rate generics suppliers so hospitals can contract with those using high-quality practices. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a marketplace that was designed in an unsustainable way. Generic medication manufacturers currently operate on very narrow margins, which are continually being squeezed. This may result in de-prioritization of generic drug manufacturing in favor of newer, and more expensive agents that remain on patent. This results in a fragile supply chain for older, but still critical, generic medications that can and does break frequently and recovers slowly,\u201d Denlinger said about the ongoing shortage. \u201cIt has also led to fewer companies in the generic market and demands extreme efficiency from those companies still in the market. When a supply issue occurs, it is difficult to ramp up additional capacity in the system. We need to invest in economic incentives for the generic drug market \u2014 which is distinctly different from the brand name drug market \u2014 to encourage the stable manufacturing of quality generic drugs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also need better systems to communicate information about impending shortages and other supply concerns with health care systems and providers so that health care providers can prepare in advance for anticipated shortages before it becomes a crisis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/cancer-drug-shortages-continue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_bids-for-connection-better-relationship-wellness", "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s a woodpecker over there!\u201d Alyssa Caribardi watched as her friend whipped her head around to look out the window and seek out the bird. And with that simple gesture, Caribardi knew their friendship would last. In what may seem like a small, everyday exchange, her friend\u2019s reaction was an important indicator for their relationship: She had responded to Caribardi\u2019s \u201cbid for connection,\u201d a term coined by relationship experts at the\u00a0Gottman Institute\u00a0in Seattle. Their interaction might not look important to outsiders, but Caribardi had given someone close to her an opportunity to connect, and her friend had reciprocated. \u201cBids for connection are when one partner reaches out to the other person for either interest, or a conversation or expressing a need,\u201d said Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, a clinical psychologist who has researched couples and long-lasting marriages alongside her husband, Dr. John Gottman, for more than 40 years. \u201cDepending on how the partner responds, the relationship either succeeds or doesn\u2019t do so well.\u201d The bids can be verbal or physical, such as pointing out a bird in a tree, repeating something heard on TV, asking for advice or even simply directing a smile at the other person. Whether the bid is big or small doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 what is important is the other person\u2019s response,\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said. And it\u2019s not just important for couples to know about these opportunities to connect \u2014 it also affects parent-child relationships, friendships, even business ties, she noted. How to recognize a \u2018bid for connection\u2019 The basis of \u201cbids for connection\u201d stems from the Gottmans\u2019 \u201cLove Lab\u201d research, which started\u00a0in 1986 and tracked couples for six years. At the end of that time, the couples still together were found to have responded to each other\u2019s bids 86% of the time, while those who split up only responded 33% of the time. Caribardi knows that feeling. The Leander, Texas, native said she thought the woodpecker was neat, partially because she had never seen one before. But the fun part was her friend\u2019s reciprocated interest that spiraled into a deep-dive Google session on the bird. \u201cWe can talk about literally anything and everything \u2014 a brick wall could talk to us. And the woodpecker showed me that,\u201d Caribardi said. \u201cBut even if she just said, like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that is really cool,\u2019 that\u2019s literally the only thing that you need. Just someone to acknowledge what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Caribardi posted her experience with the woodpecker on TikTok in October, referring to it as \u201cthe bird test,\u201d alongside others who took to the app to recount their experience with giving out small bids \u2014 such as pointing out cool birds \u2014 to their friends and partners. Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said this test is a good example of the importance of \u201cturning toward\u201d a partner, one of the three responses someone can have to a bid. If a partner responds to a bid, even with a simple acknowledgement that the other person was heard, it is the best and most beneficial response to have. If the partner were to ignore the other person and have no verbal response to the bid being made, she calls that \u201cturning away.\u201d But the worst response is what\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0calls \u201cturning against,\u201d which happens when there is hostility toward the bid. Partners may respond with a comment such as \u201cStop interrupting what I\u2019m doing,\u201d or another variation that tells the other person they don\u2019t care about the bid. \u201cMost of us, at the end of the day, want to be seen and understood and feel important. And so, when there are too many bids that are missed or rejected, it leaves you feeling the opposite: unseen, unimportant, misunderstood,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Fogel Mersy, a licensed psychologist and sex therapist based in Minnesota. \u201cIf that happens more often than not, it starts to erode connection and safety and trust in a relationship.\u201d What to do when your partner wants to connect While bids look to be crucial in a relationship, no one is perfect and should not be expected to answer a bid all the time, Fogel Mersy said. \u201cYou just want a ratio of more positive to negative responses to bids.\u201d If someone notices a partner has missed or continuously misses a bid, she recommends communicating the intent for attention by saying, \u201cHey, that was my way of trying to connect with you,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m looking to converse with you, or get some attention from you, is now a good time?\u201d Fogel Mersy also recommends people become more aware of their own responses when partners make a bid and even ask their partners directly if they feel they are getting responses to their calls for attention. The more direct a person is with a bid and its intent, the more likely the bid is to be reciprocated, she added. It\u2019s OK if a person notices that a partner is sending out a bid to connect but isn\u2019t feeling up to connecting at the moment, maybe because they are too tired or have a lot on their mind.\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0recommends communicating those feelings directly and honestly to the partner, instead of lashing out with a \u201cturning against\u201d response. \u201cMost of the time, if the response is positive, it\u2019s not really going to matter how small or big (the bid) is, but with negative \u2018turning away,\u2019 or \u2018turning against,\u2019 those can cause some real emotional damage in the relationship,\u201d\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said. The takeaway is \u201cthat turning toward one another is really the foundation of a good strong friendship \u2014 and also passion and romance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/bids-for-connection-better-relationship-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_firearm-injuries-cdc", "text": "Rates of emergency medical services encounters for firearm injuries spiked in 2021 to more than 25% over 2019 levels, but they began to fall in the following years. However, rates were still higher in 2023 than before the Covid-19 pandemic began, a new study says. Young Black men who live in urban areas with severe housing problems \u2014 such as overcrowding, high cost or a lack of functional facilities \u2014 and high unemployment and income disparities were the most vulnerable to that gun violence, according to the new research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The research was published Thursday in the agency\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The researchers took a closer look at data on people who sought help from EMS for a firearm injury in 858 counties in 27 states between January 2019 and September 2023. Because the study focused on these centers only, it cannot be generalizable and speak to trends nationally. However, it offers a good snapshot of the level of gun violence across the country and which people are most likely to be injured, at least in some areas. Compared with the year before the Covid-19 pandemic began, the report says, the rate of EMS encounters for firearm injuries was generally elevated through the fall of 2023. Rates were 22% higher in 2020, 27% higher in 2021, 17% higher in 2022 and 14% higher in 2023 than in 2019. Firearm injuries were highest among people ages 15 to 24, but the largest increase in injuries during this period was among children and teens up to age 14. The data doesn\u2019t capture how people were injured with firearms, so it could have been through self-harm, an accident or a crime. The researchers also couldn\u2019t say why the rate of firearm injuries had grown. One reason could be the number of guns in circulation. Previous research has showed that there was a significant spike in firearm purchases in 2020, and the number of purchases has remained higher than in pre-pandemic times, although there was a slight decline in 2023 from the year before. The study authors also noted that after stay-at-home recommendations were put in place to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, research showed an increase in domestic violence in the US. And the number of suicide attempts in the US increased during the pandemic, studies show. However, studies showed that violent crime \u2013 including crime that involved guns \u2013 declined significantly last year compared with the year before, with murder rates having some of the largest declines in history. The researchers on the new study say the data can\u2019t capture the number of people who immediately died from firearm injuries and thus didn\u2019t need help from an emergency medical service. The quality of the data can also vary, since it relies on EMS personnel to enter all the information accurately, according to the CDC. The CDC researchers said they hope the new report will encourage hospitals and community groups to promote secure firearm storage to help reduce the number of people injured by firearms. In a separate CDC survey released this month, firearm owners in eight states reported that many kept guns unlocked and loaded, including in homes with children. In Alaska, that was the case in more than 40% of homes in the survey with children. In Ohio, it was more than 25%. The new report also urged states and local communities to develop comprehensive firearm injury prevention strategies, such as addressing some of the potential underlying issues hinted at in the report. One such issue, access to affordable housing, has long been a problem in the US, and during the pandemic, rents increased about 24% government data shows. Such a lack of access can weaken social ties, potentially contributing to safety issues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/firearm-injuries-cdc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness", "text": "More water, please. Millions of Americans are experiencing a record-breaking heat wave that has continued for days on end. We know that keeping hydrated is important to staying healthy in the summer heat, but is water still the best drink during a heat wave? Or should people turn to sports drinks instead? What about soda, coffee and beer \u2014 is it advisable to keep drinking these beverages during extremely hot weather? To help guide us through drinks we should choose \u2014 and avoid \u2014 during hot weather events, I spoke with CNN wellness health expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: How much water should people normally drink, and does that change during extreme hot weather? Dr. Leana Wen: A quick rule of thumb that\u2019s often cited is the \u201c8 x 8 rule,\u201d which is eight 8-ounce glasses of water, or 64 ounces, of water per day for adults. That\u2019s half a gallon. This rule is not set in stone. There are many factors that influence how much water people need, including the type of food they eat, their body size and their physical activity. Other factors include air temperature and humidity, and, specifically, how much time you spend outdoors during hot weather. People working in the heat or otherwise engaging in physical activity should drink an 8-ounce cup of water every 15 to 20 minutes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This would total about 24 to 32 ounces per hour. People should also keep well hydrated before and after their outdoor time in the heat. CNN: Is it possible to drink too much water? Wen: Yes. The CDC guidance is that people should not drink more than 48 ounces (about 1.5 quarts) of water or other fluids in an hour. A large amount of fluid all at once can dilute the concentration of salts in our blood and be unsafe. CNN: When it\u2019s really hot outside, is water still the best fluid, or should people turn to sports drinks?  Wen: Sports drinks are beverages with added electrolytes. Their main purpose is to replenish water and electrolytes that are lost with sweating. These drinks contain electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Some have added sugars like fructose, glucose and sucrose.  Most people do not need drinks other than water. In general, adults engaging in mild to moderate physical activity and kids playing on the playground or doing recreational after-school sports do not need electrolyte replacement. The foods that we eat contain the electrolytes we need. People who could consider sports drinks are athletes who are engaging in vigorous exercise for at least an hour outdoors in hot weather. Again, though, not all these individuals will need electrolyte replacement beyond what they get from eating normally. Whether they do depends on factors such as how much they sweat, how hot and humid the environment is and how intensely they exercise. CNN: What\u2019s better, a sports drink that comes ready-made in a bottle or an electrolyte powder that you can add to make your own drink? Wen: Personally, I prefer the powder. There are also tablets that dissolve in water. These do-it-yourself options are cheaper, and I like to choose the brands that don\u2019t have much added sugar or chemicals. But this is a question of personal preference. Whatever you buy, make sure to look carefully at the ingredients. For instance, if you don\u2019t want added sugar or caffeine, make sure what you\u2019re drinking doesn\u2019t have these ingredients. CNN: What about energy drinks? Are these a good replacement for water? Wen: This is an important question. The short answer is no, energy drinks are not a replacement for water. They should be used with caution in adults, and children should not drink them. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which are meant to help you restore water and electrolytes. Energy drinks are not meant mainly to hydrate you. They often contain large amounts of caffeine and other legal stimulants such as L-carnitine and guarana. While caffeine can boost energy in the short term, it is also a diuretic, meaning that it causes someone to lose water. Too much caffeine also can cause jitteriness, anxiety and irregular heartbeats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against energy drinks for children and adolescents. In some studies, though, as many as 30% to 50% of adolescents report using energy drinks. I urge parents to be careful to distinguish between sports drinks and energy drinks. Neither are needed, but energy drinks, in particular, should be used with caution. CNN: What about other drinks with caffeine, like coffee? Is a cold brew or iced mocha a bad idea in hot weather? Wen: Not necessarily, though people should be aware that these caffeinated drinks may not hydrate you and may even dehydrate you further. This doesn\u2019t mean you should stop all coffee when it\u2019s hot outside. Just be aware of the effect of caffeine and consider drinking extra water while you are enjoying caffeinated beverages. CNN: What about sodas, punches and alcoholic beverages? Wen: Sodas and punches are considered ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to many adverse long-term health consequences, such as increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. Consumption should generally be kept at a minimum, and hot weather is no exception. Again, water is the preferred substance for hydration. Alcohol is best avoided when it\u2019s very hot outside. Be especially careful not to drink large amounts and become inebriated, as this could blunt your body\u2019s response to temperature regulation. You also may miss early signs of heat-related illnesses. Alcohol can be dehydrating as well. If you do choose to drink alcohol, limit your drinks, make sure there are people around you in case you get into trouble medically and be sure to drink plenty of additional nonalcoholic fluids. CNN: What about kids who are in all-day sports camps? Wen: It\u2019s hard to answer this without knowing exactly how the camp is structured. Many sports camps have indoor activities for at least a portion of the day, and even those that are predominantly outdoors should move their activities indoors during extreme heat warnings. When in doubt, it\u2019s advisable to speak with the camp director and ask about how much time will be spent outdoors. If the time is limited, there are regular breaks and much of the activity is low to moderate intensity, it\u2019s probably sufficient to hydrate with water and supplement with nutrient-dense snacks such as watermelon, coconut and avocado. Also focus on hydrating before and after camp. Sports drinks probably aren\u2019t needed, and, again, it\u2019s advisable for children to avoid energy drinks. CNN: What other precautions would you follow during extreme heat? Wen: Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Take extra care of children and the elderly, as well as people with chronic medical conditions that could be exacerbated by the heat. Be careful while exercising and try to move activities indoors or go in the early morning or late evening. And make sure to keep well-hydrated with the best substance for hydration \u2014 water!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_science_kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn", "text": "A lone diver first laid eyes on the ancient Kyrenia shipwreck off the north coast of Cyprus nearly 60 years ago. But when archaeologists attempted to determine the exact timeline of the vessel coming to a rest on the ocean floor, they were left to speculate based on the ship\u2019s cargo. Now, a\u00a0new study\u00a0published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One may have a better time estimate of the Kyrenia\u2019s demise \u2014 and the revelation came together thanks to newly cleaned wood samples from the ship, as well as clues provided by a twig, an animal bone and a cache of ancient almonds. Local diver Andreas Cariolou\u00a0first discovered the Kyrenia ship, one of the first major Greek Hellenistic-period ships to be found largely intact, in 1965, and a team led by the late marine archaeologist Michael Katzev excavated the wreck and its cargo in the late \u201960s.  The researchers originally believed the vessel sank around 300 BC. One text, the first volume of the site\u2019s final reports\u00a0published in 2022, estimated a range of 294 BC to 290 BC, based on pottery and some coins found on board. But there was no scientific dating available to back up the estimates, according to the latest study. By using radiocarbon dating \u2014 a method used to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood from trees \u2014 and dendrochronology, the science of dating tree rings, the researchers of the new study determined the Kyrenia\u2019s sinking occurred between 296 BC and 271 BC. And they found a strong probability that it happened between 286 BC and 272 BC, the study authors wrote. \u201cWe got dates that are very close to those that archaeologists have been recently suggesting but just ever so slightly more recent,\u201d said lead author Sturt Manning, distinguished professor of arts and sciences in classical archaeology\u00a0at Cornell University in New York. While an updated timeline supported by scientific data is important for the famous ship, the pivotal revelation is in new techniques and a revised radiocarbon calibration that can help scientists more accurately date structures and shipwrecks from this period, Manning said. Dating a Hellenistic-era ship Two main obstacles stood in the way of achieving a high-precision age estimate for the Kyrenia shipwreck, according to Manning. The first was that polyethylene glycol or PEG, a petroleum-derived compound used to conserve the ship\u2019s wood, was interfering with radiocarbon dating. Often, shipwrecks remain well preserved due to the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean. But once the materials are brought up to the surface, they quickly deteriorate, Manning explained. Injecting polyethylene glycol into the wood keeps the timber from crumbling and turning into powder, but it then becomes difficult to remove with time. \u201cYou only need to have literally a fraction of a percent of this stuff (polyethylene glycol) on there, and the date will be wrong, often by hundreds, if not thousands of years,\u201d said Manning, who had tried to date the Kyrenia ship 10 years ago but failed because of PEG. However, an international team of researchers developed a cleaning protocol, described in an\u00a0October 2021 study, that successfully removed the petroleum-based compound from wood that was fairly recently conserved, Manning said. To confirm that the protocol would work with something as old as the Kyrenia shipwreck, Manning and his colleagues applied the technique to a piece of PEG-preserved wood they knew to be from nearly 2,000 years ago and found accurate radiocarbon ages. Now with a solution to clean the wood, the researchers thought they would be able to date the ship\u2019s wood. But they encountered a second roadblock instead and kept receiving ages that did not match \u201cany possible archaeological solution around,\u201d Manning said. After investigating, he and his team determined that the Northern Hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve, the conversion of measurements to dates based on known tree rings, was outdated for the period between about 400 BC and 250 BC. The researchers were able to formulate their date estimate by recalibrating the curve using sequoia and oak samples of known age from this period. The revised curve was critical to homing in on an accurate time frame for the Kyrenia shipwreck and could further help researchers across the world facing similar problems when dating ancient structures, Manning said. A treasure of ancient almonds The radiocarbon ages from the wood gave the researchers an idea of when the ship was built, but it was a cargo of almonds that gave the study authors a date estimate for when the shipwreck happened, Manning said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got material like almonds \u2014 or you can imagine olives or anything like this which was being used as a food crop \u2014 and it was on the ship when it sank, it\u2019s got to have been there from probably about a year \u2026 or maybe it was two years older than when a ship went down.\u201d By using the organic materials from the cargo, such as the almonds, an unidentified wood twig that was not part of the ship\u2019s build, and an ankle bone of livestock, researchers were able to narrow the dates and estimate a range of years for when the Kyrenia ship\u2019s last voyage took place. \u201cPart of the value of this story is about process. \u2026 the (radiocarbon) dating and dendrochronology fields have grown, developed, refined their results over many decades,\u201d said Mark Lawall, a professor in the department of classics at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, in an email. \u201cScience \u2014 whether \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 \u2014 develops over time through a lot of work \u2018in the trenches\u2019. It takes time and it needs time.\u201d He was not involved in the new study. With the slight modification in the estimated sinking date, it\u2019s impressive that the original dates based on archaeological evidence of ceramics and coins were only off by a few years, said Lawall, who has studied amphorae,\u00a0ancient Greek containers\u00a0used\u00a0for shipping wine, olive oil and other goods, from the Kyrenia shipwreck. \u201cThe other part of the Kyrenia story is its window into past lives that are otherwise difficult to \u2018see\u2019 through the well-known ancient writers (or even less known),\u201d Lawall said. \u201cThe Kyrenia crew may have been a band of more marginal traders, taking up what they could, where and when they could, and hoping for a small profit at the end of the day.\u201d He added, \u201cThey dealt across cultures and in doing so were part of an immensely complex network that tied all parts of the Mediterranean together. In this way we start to understand the origins of the modern, multi-cultural, inter-linked Mediterranean world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/science/kyrenia-shipwreck-radiocarbon-dating-almonds-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_black-kidney-donations-bioethics-reaj", "text": "As one of the\u00a0leading causes of death\u00a0in the U.S., kidney disease is a serious public health problem. The disease is particularly severe among Black Americans, who are\u00a0three times more likely\u00a0than white Americans to develop kidney failure. While Black people constitute only 12% of the U.S. population, they\u00a0account for 35%\u00a0of those with kidney failure. The reason is due in part to the prevalence of diabetes and high blood pressure \u2013 the\u00a0two largest contributors\u00a0to kidney disease \u2013 in the Black community. Almost\u00a0100,000 people\u00a0in the U.S. are awaiting kidney transplantation. Though Black Americans are more likely to need transplants, they are also\u00a0less likely\u00a0to receive them. Making matters worse, kidneys from\u00a0Black donors\u00a0in the U.S. are more likely to be thrown away as a result of\u00a0a flawed system\u00a0that erroneously considers all Black donor kidneys as more likely to stop working after a transplant than kidneys from donors of other races. As a scholar of bioethics, health and philosophy, I believe this flawed system raises serious ethical concerns about justice, fairness and good stewardship of a scarce resource \u2013 kidneys. How did we get here? The U.S. organ transplantation system rates donor kidneys using the\u00a0kidney donor profile index, an algorithm that includes 10 factors, including the donor\u2019s age, height, weight and history of hypertension and diabetes. Another factor in the algorithm is race. Research on\u00a0previous transplants\u00a0shows that some kidneys donated by Black people are more likely to stop working sooner after transplantation than kidneys donated by people from other races. READ MORE: Biased AI can be bad for your health This brings down the average time a transplanted kidney from a Black donor can last for a patient. As a result, kidneys donated by Black people are\u00a0discarded at higher rates\u00a0because the algorithm downgrades their quality based on the donor\u2019s race. This means that\u00a0some good kidneys\u00a0may be wasted, raising several ethical and practical concerns. Risk, race and genetics Scientists have shown that races are\u00a0social constructs\u00a0that are poor indicators of human genetic diversity. Using a donor\u2019s race assumed people who belong to the same socially constructed group share important biological characteristics despite evidence that there is more genetic variation\u00a0within racial groups\u00a0than between other racial groups. Such is the case for Black Americans. It is possible that the explanation for observed differences in outcomes lies in genetics and not in race. People who have two copies of certain forms or\u00a0variants of the APOL1 gene\u00a0are more likely to develop kidney disease. About 85% of people with those variants never develop kidney disease, but 15% do. Medical researchers do not yet understand what is behind this difference, but genetics is likely only part of the story. Environment and exposure to certain viruses are also possible explanations. People who have two copies of the\u00a0riskier forms of the APOL1 gene\u00a0almost all have ancestors who came from Africa, especially from West and sub-Saharan Africa. In the U.S., such people typically are categorized as Black or African American. Research on kidney transplants suggests that kidneys from donors with two copies of the higher-risk APOL1 variants\u00a0fail at higher rates\u00a0after transplantation. This could explain the data on Black donor kidney failure rate. How might this practice change? Health care professionals decide how limited resources are used and distributed. With that comes an ethical responsibility to steward resources fairly and wisely, which includes preventing unnecessary loss of transplantable kidneys. Reducing the number of wasted kidneys is important for another reason. Many people agree to organ donations to help others. Black donors may be disturbed to learn that their kidneys are more likely to be discarded because they came from a Black person. This practice can further\u00a0decrease the trust\u00a0of Black Americans in a health care system that has a long history of mistreating Black people. READ MORE: How introducing race into clinical algorithms impacts health inequality Making organ transplantation more equitable could be as simple as\u00a0ignoring race\u00a0when evaluating donor kidneys, as some medical researchers have proposed. But this approach would not account for the observed difference in transplantation outcomes and could result in transplanting some kidneys that are at increased risk for early failure due to a genetic issue. And since Black kidney recipients are more likely to receive\u00a0kidneys from Black donors, this approach could perpetuate transplant disparities. Another option that would improve public health and reduce racial health disparities is to identify the factors that lead to some kidneys donated by Black people to fail at higher rates. One way researchers are working to identify higher risk kidneys is using the\u00a0APOLLO study, which assesses the impact of key variants on donated kidneys. In my view, using the variant instead of race likely would decrease the number of kidneys wasted while protecting recipients from kidneys that are likely to stop working sooner after transplantation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/black-kidney-donations-bioethics-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_surgeon-general-gun-violence-advisory", "text": "Gun violence in the United States is a public health crisis that demands urgent action, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declared in a major new advisory that pushes for more research and stronger laws designed to reduce harm. It\u2019s the first time a publication from the country\u2019s leading voice for public health\u00a0has\u00a0focused on firearm violence and its \u201cprofound consequences\u201d on survivors, communities, and mental health. \u201cOver the last decade or two, this problem has been worsening and we have now reached the point where gun violence is the leading cause of death among kids and teens \u2013 the leading cause of death. That is something that we should never take as the new normal. There\u2019s nothing normal about that,\u201d Murthy told CNN\u2019s John Berman. Guns have become a deeply polarizing issue, Murthy said, but the advisory is meant to \u201ctake it out of the realm of politics and put it into the realm of public health, which is where it belongs.\u201d The advisory lays out key preventive steps and regulatory measures that Murthy says can turn the tide on gun violence \u2014 just as they did for tobacco-related disease and motor vehicle crashes. \u201cMany people I\u2019ve talked to around the country worry that this may be an intractable problem, that there\u2019s no way to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Record-breaking level of gun deaths Tuesday\u2019s advisory spells out how devastating gun violence has been in the United States and details how public health strategies can help. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced so many mass shootings, so many incidents of gun violence in our neighborhoods and communities, that it has really pervaded the psyche of our country. It has induced fear in people about regular day-to-day activities, like going to the grocery store, going to school, going to work,\u201d Murthy said. In 2022 alone, more than 48,000 people in the US died from firearm-related injuries,\u00a0according to provisional data.\u00a0That number included homicides, suicides and unintentional deaths. The rate of firearm-related deaths in the US has been rising,\u00a0according to the advisory, reaching a three-decade high in 2021. Since then, data has shown a decrease in gun-related homicides, while the number of gun-related suicides have stayed about the same, the advisory says. While mass shootings are still rare, making up just about 1% of gun deaths, the number of mass shooting incidents has been rising, according to the advisory. A\u00a0KFF poll in April last year\u00a0also showed that gun violence is all too common in the lives of Americans. More than half of adults that live in the US report that they or their loved ones have experienced a firearm-related incident. One in five adults say they have personally been threatened with a gun, and nearly the same number said that a family member was killed by a gun. That last number included those who used a gun in a suicide. People of color are disproportionately impacted by gun violence, the\u00a0surgeon\u00a0general\u2019s advisory says. In 2022, Black people saw the highest rates of firearm-related homicides across all ages. That same year,\u00a0Black children and adolescents made up half of all firearm deaths, despite being only 14% of this demographic, the advisory says. The violence isn\u2019t just a direct physical threat:\u00a0It can threaten an entire communities\u2019 sense of well-being and can lead to elevated levels of stress and mental health problems. Children\u00a0ages\u00a01 to 19\u00a0die from guns\u00a0more\u00a0than anything else in the US,\u00a0studies show. Children, in general, faced the highest gun violence mortality rate among peer countries by far.\u00a0In the US,\u00a0there were 36.4 deaths per million people ages 1\u00a0to\u00a019;\u00a0in Canada, its 6.2 per million, in Australia, it\u2019s 1.6 per million and in the UK, it\u2019s 0.5 per million. An analysis of unintentional firearm deaths among children and adolescents found that 56% of these incidents happened in the child\u2019s own home. Part of the problem is the way firearms are kept: Among the incidents where the details were known, 74% of the firearms were stored loaded and 76% were stored unlocked. Most commonly, guns were found in sleeping areas, such as in nightstands, under a pillow or mattress or on a bed. In addition to the physical problems such violence can cause, firearm violence can also take a toll on mental health, the advisory says. Fears about gun violence are particularly common among children, the advisory says, and many worry that they will experience such violence at school. Public health leaders will have to address the country\u2019s high suicide rate, according to the advisory. More than half of gun deaths in 2022, 56%, were from suicide. Unlike with homicides, the highest rate of gun suicides for adults 45 years and older involved White people. For younger people, those who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native had the highest rate of gun suicides. In\u00a02021, the suicide rate for men who are veterans\u00a0was 62.4% higher\u00a0than for men who are not veterans. It was 281.1% higher for women who\u00a0are veterans\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0women who\u00a0are not. A public health approach to gun violence The advisory\u00a0says\u00a0more money needs to be dedicated to firearms\u00a0research to understand how to reduce and prevent firearm violence in the US, and investments must\u00a0target better data collection and prevention strategies. The advisory urges communities and health-care systems to step up to help populations that are particularly vulnerable to this kind of violence. The advisory also calls for more gun laws, including\u00a0requirements for safe and secure firearm storage, a ban on assault weapons, universal background checks and effective firearm removal policies. It also says firearms should be\u00a0treated\u00a0like any other regulated consumer products,\u00a0such as\u00a0cars or pesticides. \u201cThere are no federal standards or regulations regarding the safety of firearms produced in the US,\u201d the advisory says. \u201cFirearms manufactured and sold in the US may not undergo safety testing or include safety features like warning labels related to associated risk or authorized-use technology (\u201csmart\u201d firearm technology) for firearm access. Treating firearms as a consumer product could result in changes which may enhance safety.\u201d Gun advocates pushed back against the report. In a tweet, the NRA said \u201cThis is an extension of the Biden Administration\u2019s war on law-abiding gun owners. America has a crime problem caused by criminals.\u201d Gun violence prevention advocates welcomed the attention this advisory would bring to the issue. \u201cThis advisory not only sounds the alarm for all Americans, but it signals there must be greater investments in research and violence prevention solutions,\u201d said Dr. Joseph V. Sakran, Brady board chair and chief medical officer\u00a0in an email. Sakran, a survivor of gun violence and trauma surgeon who leads the group that has been advocating for more of a public health response to gun violence for years, labeled the advisory \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d \u201cHistorically, we have seen how the release of Surgeon General reports on public health issues such as the dangers of smoking ignited a wave of policy, legal, and public health initiatives that saved countless American lives and in this case led to deprogramming our nation from the tobacco industry\u2019s lies. We hope this report will have the same resounding impact on the gun violence epidemic.\u201d The American Psychological Association also applauded the effort to put gun violence \u201cfront and center\u201d on American minds. \u201cThe picture is appalling,\u201d Arthur C. Evans Jr, the CEO of the American Psychological Association said in a news release. \u201cThe impact of gun violence reverberates across communities, leading to collective trauma, stress, and anxiety.\u201d This is not the first advisory Murthy has issued. A 2021 advisory detailed the spate of\u00a0mental health problems\u00a0people faced, and a separate advisory explained how Americans could confront a rash of\u00a0health misinformation.\u00a0Last year, Murthy issued another advisory on the effects of social media on youth mental health. \u201cIt is up to us to take on this generational challenge with the urgency and clarity the moment demands,\u201d the advisory says. \u201cThe safety and well-being of our children and future generations are at stake.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/surgeon-general-gun-violence-advisory/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning\u00a0to doctors on Tuesday to be on the look out for cases of dengue. A surge in dengue cases globally is raising the risk that people could catch the disease in the US. The number of people who develop the mosquito-borne disease has been increasing globally as the world\u2019s climate warms due to the human-made climate crisis. The infected mosquitos that spread the disease, the Aedes aegypti, and sometimes\u00a0Aedes albopictus, mosquitoes like warmer and wetter weather. Generally, dengue had been relatively rare in the continental US with most people getting sick after having traveled to popular destinations overseas where the disease is more common. So far this year, a higher-than-expected number of dengue cases have been identified among US travelers, with 745 cases in records kept through June 24, the CDC said. In 2023, 1,829 travel-associated cases were reported by US travelers, the highest number of travel-associated cases since dengue became reportable in the US in 2010, according to the CDC.  Twenty-three countries reported outbreaks last year with more than 5 million cases reported to the World Health Organization and 4,000 deaths in the Americas alone. Over the years there have been a handful of outbreaks in locally-transmitted cases in states with warmer climates and habitat friendly to the kind of mosquito that spread dengue like Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona. California reported its first locally transmitted case in Pasadena last year. Tuesday\u2019s warning from the CDC says that the number of global infections in 2024 have been the highest on record. Cases in the Americas have already exceeded the highest number ever recorded in a single year,\u00a0with more than 9.7 million people getting sick with dengue; that\u2019s twice as many cases in all of 2023. So many people have gotten sick with dengue in Puerto Rico, local public health officials declared a public health emergency. Other areas with frequent dengue transmission associated with the US include American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. The CDC warning instructs doctors to test patients with symptoms that look like dengue, especially those patients who have traveled to a part of the world where the disease is more common. Symptoms typically start about a week after the person has been bitten by the infected mosquito, although 40 to 80% of infections are asymptomatic, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA). Symptoms of dengue can include a fever, vomiting, muscle aches, joint and bone pain, pain behind the eyes, headache, nausea, low white blood cell counts and a fever. Most people recover after about a week. The CDC said warning signs that the dengue is progressing to a more serious form of the disease include persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, bleeding from the nose or gums, liver enlargement, being tired and abdominal pain. Severe disease can bring with it severe bleeding, respiratory distress, and a person\u2019s organs can start shutting down and people can die. Mortality can be as high as 13% in untreated patients, the IDSA said. Infants, pregnant people and the elderly are at an increased risk for severe dengue, along with people who have certain underlying medical conditions. Other than supportive care including treatment with fluids and rest, there are no specific medicines to treat dengue. There is no dengue vaccine recommended for travelers or for adults. There was a vaccine, Dengvaxia, but Sanofi Pasteur stopped making it citing a lack of demand. The public health departments in Puerto Rico will still be giving the shots to children aged 9 to 16 years with a lab-confirmed case who live in areas with frequent transmission until the doses expire in 2026. In April of this year the CDC had launched an emergency response that addresses the increasing dengue caseload in the US. It also expanded lab capacity and is working with local leaders to strengthen surveillance for the disease. To prevent dengue, use bug spray when outside, particularly when traveling to parts of the world where dengue is common. Wear loose-fitting and long-sleeved shirts and pants. Run the air conditioning or use window screens so mosquitos stay outside.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}

The Maryland-based company halted ice cream production and distribution and recalled the products after FDA sampling revealed potential traces of Listeria monocytogenes.

Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can cause listeriosis, the\u00a0third leading cause\u00a0of death from foodborne illness in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Listeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in pregnant women, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, while healthy people may experience short-term symptoms like high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, according to the recall notice. The infection can manifest as a fever, muscle aches, excessive tiredness, severe headache, nausea, stomachache, or diarrhea. Symptoms typically begin within two weeks after eating contaminated food but may start as early as the same day or as late as 10 weeks after, according to the CDC.  Earlier this year, the CDC investigated a deadly outbreak of Listeria linked to\u00a0queso fresco and cotija cheese\u00a0that led to 23 hospitalizations and two deaths.

{"id": "2024_06_07_health_alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Looking back, Tammy Maida, 67, said things started to change in her late 50s. At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_health_loneliness-stroke-wellness", "text": "Lonely isn\u2019t just how many people are around \u2013 it\u2019s how you feel. And it may impact your stroke risk, according to a new study. In fact, older adults who reported being chronically lonely had a 56% higher risk of stroke than those who were consistently rated low on the loneliness scale, according to a new study. \u201cIt is important to routinely assess loneliness, as the consequences may be worse if unidentified and/or ignored,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Yenee Soh, research associate in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an email. The study, which published Monday in the journal eClinicalMedicine, looked at data collected between 2006 to 2018 as part of the Health and Retirement Study. More than 12,000 participants age 50 years or older were initially surveyed between 2006 and 2008, according to the study. When researchers followed up four years later, nearly 9,000 participants remained in the study. They responded to questions on the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale and were given loneliness scores for both points in time. Researchers also tracked the participants\u2019 instances of stroke and analyzed the data against their loneliness scores, according to the study. While there was a strong increase in risk for people who scored high on loneliness at both points of the survey, there was not a clear association with stroke risk in those who only scored high at one point in time, Soh said. This suggests that the biggest impact on stroke risk occurs over the long term. \u201cWe have known for a while that loneliness is a risk factor for many conditions,\u201d said Dr. Matt Pantell, associate professor in the department of pediatrics and core faculty member of the Center for Health and Community at the University of California, San Francisco. He was not involved in the research. Prior research has linked loneliness and isolation\u00a0to sleep problems, inflammation and other symptoms in young adults, and linked them to a shorter life span, insomnia, depression and other symptoms in older adults. Loneliness and social isolation may be connected to higher risks of heart disease, dementia, diabetes, addiction, self-harm and suicidality in people of all ages. \u201cThis (new study) has implications for clinicians and health systems in that understanding whether or not a person is lonely, and for how long, may be able to help identify those at higher risk of stroke,\u201d Pantell added. Are you lonely or alone? Being on your own often doesn\u2019t mean you will always feel lonely. Being alone means not having many people around, while being lonely is a feeling of isolation you can have regardless of the people around you. And that feeling of loneliness is what the study found to be correlated to the increased risk of stroke, Soh said. \u201cGiven that loneliness is a highly subjective experience, seeking help to address and intervene to one\u2019s specific personal needs is important,\u201d she said. Health care providers can play a part by screening for loneliness and referring patients to therapists and behavioral health clinicians, Soh added. \u201cIndividuals may be unaware or reluctant to admit feeling lonely,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be helpful to take self-administered questionnaires that assess loneliness by oneself or when in a healthcare setting to first identify and acknowledge that one is feeling lonely.\u201d It is important to note that this study is observational, meaning that it can\u2019t say that the feeling of loneliness was the direct cause of the strokes, just that they were correlated, Pantell said. People who feel lonely may share demographic factors or health characteristics that also make them more likely to have a stroke, he said. However, the researchers conducted a strong study and did control for other explanations, Pantell added. Feeling more connected What makes someone feel lonely is often unique to them, meaning that the changes they need to feel more socially integrated will be individual as well, Soh said. Loneliness impacts people of all ages in the United States, a country in an \u201cepidemic of loneliness and isolation,\u201d said US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy in 2023. \u201cMake it be known that you are experiencing feelings of loneliness, and also identify what would be helpful for you specifically to address the feelings of loneliness,\u201d Soh said. A wide range of organizations provide resources to help combat loneliness, so it may help to get involved in those in your community, Soh added. Scrolling through social media may feel like involving oneself in community, but it may take a bit more interaction to combat loneliness, said Dr. Olivia Remes, a mental health researcher at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, in a previous CNN story. Remes was not involved in the latest research. Interact with friends\u2019 posts or send a private message, she said. Better yet, make interacting in-person with those in your community a part of your daily routine. \u201cTaking the steps to practice chatting with those you encounter as you go about your day can pay off. It can make you feel better, boost your mood, and even stave off loneliness,\u201d she said. If you find yourself having a hard time putting yourself out there to make the connections you need, or getting caught in patterns of thinking that you won\u2019t be received well, it might be time to seek the help of a mental health professional, said Dr. Louise Hawkley, a principal research scientist in the Academic Research Centers, NORC, at the University of Chicago in a previous CNN story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/health/loneliness-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "health"}}
