{"id": "2024_06_04_health_cardiovascular-disease-report-2050", "text": "About 61% of US adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, new research from the American Heart Association predicts. The biggest driver of this trend will be the large number of people who have or will develop high blood pressure, which makes them much more likely to develop dangerous problems like a heart attack or stroke. Other cardiovascular problems include heart attacks, arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or a-fib, heart failure and congenital heart disease. Despite innovations in treatments, heart disease has been the leading killer of Americans for decades, responsible for more than 800,000 deaths every year. In the research published Tuesday, the association predicts that 45 million adults will have some form of cardiovascular disease \u2013 excluding high blood pressure \u2013 or will have a stroke in 2050, up from 28 million in 2020. An aging population will be another force behind these trends, as the older you get, the more likely you are to have heart problems. By 2050, 22% of the US will be over the age of 65, whereas seniors made up just 13% of the population 10 years ago, studies say. The median age in the US is projected to increase from 37 in 2010 to 41 in 2050, other research shows. The American population is also becoming more diverse, and communities of color tend to have a disproportionate number of heart problems. By 2050, people who identify as Hispanic will make up about a quarter of the US population, vs. about 20% today, and people who identify as Black will be 14.4% of the country, up from 13.6% today. The number of people who identify as Asian will also increase, from 6.2% of the population to 8.6%, according to US Census predictions. People who identify as Hispanic are projected to have the greatest population growth for cardiovascular disease or stroke, the new research says. Black adults now have the highest number of heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, the association\u2019s research shows. They also are projected to have the most problems with poor diet and an inadequate amount of sleep, both behaviors contribute to heart problems. The biggest overall increase among cardiovascular conditions will be in the number of people who have a stroke, the American Heart Association predicts, jumping from 3.9% to 6.4%. That would nearly double the number of people who have a stroke from 10 million to 20 million adults between 2020 and 2050. In terms of risk factors, growing numbers of people with obesity and/or diabetes will also raise the risk of heart problems. Poor diet, which can hurt heart health, is projected to be the health behavior that will affect the most people. The report suggests that nearly 70 million young adults alone will be eating poorly in 2050. The new research predicts that the number of people with obesity will increase from 43.1% to 60.6%, affecting more than 180 million people by 2050. The number with diabetes will increase from 16.3% to 26.8% and impact more than 80 million in that period, the report said. The report also offers a closer look at the heart health of children. It finds \u201cconcerning trends\u201d in key risk factors, including a predicted increase in the number of kids living with obesity, in large part due to a lack of exercise and poor diet. The report projects that the number of US children with obesity will jump from 20.6% in 2020 to 33% in 2050, meaning 26 million kids will have obesity by that time. There\u2019s one positive heart health note, the researchers said: The number of people with high cholesterol is projected to decline. It\u2019s been falling for years, studies show, due in part to the sharp increase in the number of people who take drugs called statins, which can reduce the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver. A 2023 study found that more than 92 million adults in the US \u2013 more than a third of the population \u2013 took a statin in 2018-19, a 197% increase from 2008-09. \u201cClinical and public health interventions are needed to effectively manage, stem, and even reverse these adverse trends,\u201d the researchers wrote. One significant change they suggest is the creation of clinical and policy interventions specifically to help people of color, who are already disproportionally affected by heart problems and who tend to have less access to basic affordable health care. Prevention efforts to improve population health would also be important, the researchers said, and would save the US a significant amount of money. The costs of cardiovascular problems \u2013 including direct health care costs and productivity losses \u2013 are expected to almost triple to more than $1.8 trillion by 2050.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/cardiovascular-disease-report-2050/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_health_mediterranean-diet-women-early-death-risk-wellness", "text": "Women who closely followed a Mediterranean diet lived much longer than those who did not, according to a new study that followed more than 25,000 women for 25 years. \u201cFor women interested in longevity, our study shows that following a Mediterranean dietary pattern could result in about one quarter reduction in risk of death over more than 25 years with benefit for both cancer and cardiovascular mortality, the top causes of death,\u201d senior study author Dr. Samia Mora, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said in an email. The Mediterranean diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with much of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods should be avoided. Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. \u201cIn this study, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was a proxy for diet quality. Those who adhered most closely were eating more legumes, more vegetables, more fruits, less meat, and less processed meats,\u201d said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit\u00a0True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. While the study was observational and thus could not show a direct cause and effect, \u201cthe finding is entirely consistent with many other studies of the now famously healthful Mediterranean diet,\u201d said Katz, who was not involved in the research. \u201cWe may be comfortable inferring that a high quality diet did, indeed, \u2018cause\u2019 a lower risk of death,\u201d Katz said in an email. Why studying women is important The Mediterranean diet has a long list of scientific kudos: The Mediterranean style of eating may reduce the risk for breast cancer,\u00a0dementia, depression,\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0high cholesterol and memory loss. Adherence to the diet can also lead to stronger bones, a\u00a0healthier heart and\u00a0longer life. It\u2019s also good for healthy weight loss. In all that data, however, are few details on the specific ways the Mediterranean diet may affect women, especially long-term. That\u2019s important, experts say, because women are not little men. A woman\u2019s brain works differently on a molecular level than a man\u2019s brain. The size of a woman\u2019s heart may differ from a man\u2019s, and women have completely different symptoms for a heart attack than men. Women\u00a0metabolize alcohol and medications differently than men. And then there\u2019s the obvious difference of menarche and menopause, which creates an entire class of health risks specific to women. Every bite counts In the new study, published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open, researchers asked 25,315 healthy women participating in the Women\u2019s Health Study about their diet and collected blood and other biomarkers between 1993 and 1996. Those women were reevaluated between 2018 and 2023. Not only did closely following the Mediterranean diet cut the risk of early death by 23%, it lessened the risk of dying from cancer by 17% and dying from cardiovascular disease by 20%, the study found. \u201cThere was a graded stepwise increase in benefit \u2014 the more committed the more benefit,\u201d said lead author Shafqat Ahmad, an associate professor of molecular epidemiology at Uppsala University in Sweden, in an email. Each increase in adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a 6% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 5% reduced risk of dying from either heart disease or cancer, Ahmad said. \u201cWhat might be worth noting is that the adherence measure \u2018corrects\u2019 for distortions of the Mediterranean diet,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIn the US, simply adding olive oil to French fries might result in someone claiming to be \u2018on\u2019 the Mediterranean diet.\u201d However, the study corrects for distortions by looking at all the \u201ckey features of a \u2018true\u2019 Mediterranean diet, and thus precludes that kind of misrepresentation,\u201d Katz said. Want to start the Mediterranean diet? It\u2019s not hard to incorporate a Mediterranean style of eating into your life, experts say. Start by adding more veggies and legumes to each meal and use all kinds and colors to get the broadest range of nutrients, phytochemicals and fiber. Cook, roast or garnish them with herbs and a bit of extra-virgin olive oil. Add whole grains and fruit to every meal, but use nuts and seeds as a garnish or small snack because of their higher calorie and fat content. Cut way back on the use of red meat. Instead turn to fish and other seafood, which are often consumed at least twice a week. Get as much protein as you can from beans and other legumes. Start with one bean-based meal a week, then add two and build your nonmeat meals from there. Mix in cheese and yogurt daily to weekly in moderate portions. Chicken, pork and eggs are OK on occasion. Keep sweets for special occasions and satisfy your sweet tooth with fresh and frozen fruit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/mediterranean-diet-women-early-death-risk-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_science_genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn", "text": "For more than a century, scientists have been unsuccessfully hunting for skull fossils for the thunder bird species Genyornis newtoni. About 50,000 years ago, these titans, also known as mihirungs, from an Aboriginal term for \u201cgiant bird,\u201d tramped through the forests and grasslands of Australia\u00a0on muscular legs. They stood taller than humans and weighed hundreds of kilograms. The last of the mihirungs\u00a0went extinct around 45,000 years ago.\u00a0The only skull, found in 1913, was incomplete and badly damaged, raising questions about the giant bird\u2019s face, habits and ancestry. Now, the discovery of a complete G. newtoni skull has resolved this longstanding mystery, giving\u00a0scientists their first face-to-face encounter with the massive mihirung. And it has the face of a very strange goose. G. newtoni was about 7 feet (2 meters) tall and weighed up to 529 pounds (240 kilograms). It belonged to the family Dromornithidae, a group of flightless birds known from fossils found in Australia. Between 2013 and 2019, a team of paleontologists unearthed a G. newtoni fossil jackpot in southern Australia\u2019s Lake Callabonna, discovering multiple skull fragments, a skeleton and an articulated skull providing the first evidence of the bird\u2019s upper bill. This bonanza shed new light not only on G. newtoni, but also on the entire dromornithid group, connecting it to modern waterfowl such as ducks, swans and geese, scientists reported Monday in the journal Historical Biology. Though scientists have known about Genyornis for well over a century, the new fossils and reconstruction supply critical missing details, said Larry Witmer, a professor of anatomy and paleontology at Ohio University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe skull is always the prize simply because so much important information is in the head,\u201d Witmer said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s where the brain and sense organs are located, it\u2019s where the feeding apparatus is located, and it\u2019s typically where the display organs (horns, crests, wattles and combs, etc.) are located,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, skulls tend to be dripping with structural characteristics that give us clues about their genealogy.\u201d In the new study, \u201cthe authors milked these new fossils for all they had,\u201d said Witmer. The researchers not only modeled the bones in the skull; they also analyzed placement of jaw muscles, ligaments,\u00a0and other soft tissues that hinted at the bird\u2019s biology. \u201cThis latest discovery of new Genyornis skulls has really helped fill in the blanks,\u201d Witmer said. \u2018Very goose-like\u2019 The newfound skull takes center stage in a digital reconstruction, supplemented by other skull fossils and data from modern birds, and it offers previously unknown clues about G. newtoni\u2019s appearance, said lead study author Phoebe McInerney, a vertebrate paleontologist and researcher at Flinders University in South Australia. \u201cIt is only now, 128 years after its discovery, that we can say what it actually looked like,\u201d McInerney said in an email. \u201cGenyornis has a very unusual beak which is very goose-like in shape.\u201d Compared with the skulls of most other birds, G. newtoni\u2019s skull is quite short. But the jaws are massive, supported by powerful muscles. \u201cThey would have had a very wide gape,\u201d McInerney said. The skull also hinted at G. newtoni\u2019s diet. A flat gripping zone in the beak was suited for ripping up soft fruits and tender shoots and leaves, and a flattened palate on the underside of the upper bill may have been used for crushing fruits to a pulp. \u201cWe knew from other evidence that they likely ate soft food, and the new beak supported that,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThe skull also showed some evidence of adaptations for feeding in water, maybe on freshwater plants.\u201d This suggestion of underwater feeding is unexpected, given G. newtoni\u2019s massive size, Witmer said. \u201cMaybe that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that dromornithids like Genyornis are related to the group including ducks and geese, but Genyornis was six or seven feet tall and weighed maybe as much as 500 pounds,\u201d Witmer said. Additional fossil discoveries could help resolve whether such adaptations were unused features inherited from aquatic ancestors, \u201cor whether these giant birds were wading into the shallows in search of soft plants and leaves.\u201d \u2018A strange amalgamation\u2019 The reconstruction helped scientists resolve the conflicted lineage of dromornithids, placing them within the waterfowl order Anseriformes, the study authors reported. Based on bone structures and associated muscles, dromornithids were likely close relatives to ancestors of modern South American screamers,\u00a0ducklike birds inhabiting wetlands in southern South America. While G. newtoni had a gooselike beak, its face wasn\u2019t a perfect match to those of modern geese, said study coauthor and avian paleontologist Jacob Blokland. A researcher with the Flinders Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, Blokland illustrated reconstructions of the skull and of G. newtoni in life. \u201cIt surprised me how superficially goosey it looked, with its large spatulate bill, but definitely unlike any goose we have today,\u201d Blokland said in an email. \u201cIt has some aspects reminiscent of parrots, which it is not closely related to, but also landfowl, which are much closer relatives. In some ways it appears like a strange amalgamation of very different looking birds.\u201d For the new reconstruction, Blokland began with the bony external ear region, \u201cas there were several specimens that preserved this part,\u201d he said. From there, he constructed a scaffold that was consistent across multiple skull fossils. Some areas of the reconstruction were based on skulls belonging to other dromornithids or to modern waterfowl, and anatomical studies of modern birds hinted at how muscles and ligaments might move the bones. One previously unknown detail was a wide triangular bony shield called a casque on the upper bill, which may have been used for sexual displays, the study authors reported. Big, flightless emus and cassowaries (which are not close relatives of thunder birds) currently roam Australia, but cast a far smaller shadow than the long-lost mihirungs, which still loom large in the popular imagination, McInerney said. There is much about the anatomy of these extinct giants that is yet to be discovered, she added, such as how inner ear structures associated with head stabilization and locomotion may have been affected by gigantism and flightlessness. And while the new perspective on G. newtoni is the most accurate to date, additional fossils will more sharply focus the portrait of this unusual gargantuan goose \u2014 the last of the mighty thunder birds \u2014 and of its vanished habitat, Blockland said. \u201cSuch a giant and unique bird undoubtedly affected the environment and other animals it interacted with \u2014 large or small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only through study that we can build a bigger picture, and discover what we are now missing.\u201d Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/science/genyornis-newtoni-skull-thunder-bird-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_07_11_health_conjoined-twins-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at conjoined twins. Conjoined twins are physically connected to one another at some point on their bodies. Conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births, according to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. About 70% of conjoined twins are female. Conjoined twins are identical - they are the same sex. According to the Mayo Clinic, conjoined twins may be joined at any of these areas: chest, abdomen, spine, pelvis, trunk or head. Scientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.    The term \u201cSiamese twins\u201d originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, a set of conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. They lived to age 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them. In 1955, neurosurgeon Dr. Harold Voris of Mercy Hospital in Chicago performed the first successful procedure separating conjoined twins.  Selected Cases Lea and Tabea BlockBorn August 9, 2003, in Lemgo, Germany, to Peter and Nelly Block. They are joined at the head. On September 16, 2004, the girls are separated. Tabea dies shortly thereafter. Jade and Erin BucklesBorn February 26, 2004, to Melissa and Kevin Buckles at National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. They share a liver. On June 19, 2004, they are successfully separated. Tatiana and Anastasia DogaruBorn January 13, 2004, in Rome to Romanian parents Claudia and Alin Dogaru. They are connected at the head. In August 2007, doctors at University Hospital\u2019s Rainbow Babies & Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland announce that they will not perform a separation of the girls because the surgery is too risky. Abbigail and Isabelle CarlsenBorn November 29, 2005, in Fargo, North Dakota, to Amy and Jesse Carlsen. They are joined at the abdomen and chest. On May 12, 2006, a team of 30 people, including 18 surgeons from various specialties at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, perform a successful operation to separate the girls. Regina and Renata Salinas Fierros Born August 2, 2005, in Los Angeles to Sonia Fierros and Federico Salinas. Born facing each other and joined from the lower chest to the pelvis, they are fused in several places including the liver and genitals, and they share a large intestine. Regina is born with one kidney. On June 14, 2006, the twins are separated during a day-long surgery at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles. Abygail and Madysen FittererBorn August 8, 2006, to Stacy and Suzy Fitterer from Bismarck, North Dakota. They are born joined at the abdomen and share a liver.

{"id": "2024_05_31_health_art-live-longer-wellness", "text": "Most people don\u2019t pick up a coloring book, paintbrush, poetry collection or museum membership for the health benefits \u2014 but maybe it\u2019s time to start. Research shows that art experiences, whether as a maker or a beholder, transform our biology by rewiring our brains and triggering the release of neurochemicals, hormones and endorphins. In response to a growing body of evidence that art can radically improve both physical and mental health in effective and measurable ways, more health care practitioners are prescribing arts engagement as part of treating a wide array of conditions, including: obesity, heart disease, chronic pain, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, loneliness and depression. The power of diverse arts practices to promote healing, well-being and even longevity provides benefits that rank right up there with exercise, nutrition and sleep, argued Susan Magsamen in her bestseller, \u201cYour Brain on Art: How the Arts Transform Us,\u201d coauthored with Ivy Ross. Could this be why the arts have evolved over millennia to become central to human experience? \u201cI always thought of art as a luxury,\u201d conceded Bianca Bosker in her new book, \u201cGet the Picture: A Mind-Bending Journey among the Inspired Artists and Obsessive Art Fiends Who Taught Me How to See.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t feed you, house you or be used to kill predators.\u201d But she discovered that many scientists consider art a basic human need. \u201cArt is one of our oldest creations (humans invented paint long before the wheel), one of the earliest means of communication (we drew long, long, long,\u00a0long\u00a0before we could write), and one of our most universal urges,\u201d she wrote. Both Bosker and Magsamen recommend that everyone make art a daily practice, based on evidence and experience. Here\u2019s why they see art as anything but a luxury. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: You both argue that art is fundamental to human existence. How do you explain that to skeptics? Susan Magsamen: We are literally physiologically wired for the arts. Input from our senses builds connections among our brains\u2019 86 billion neurons. Engaging with art, whether as a spectator or creator, actually brings information into our bodies and profoundly impacts our biological circuitry. Art\u2019s simultaneous activation of multiple neurological and physiological systems \u2014 a unique evolutionary phenomenon \u2014 involves the entire brain, body and spirit. The next time you feel moved by your favorite song, consider that an artist\u2019s choices are changing you on a cellular level. Bianca Bosker: Many experts agree that art is both an innate human impulse and a biological predisposition that has helped our species survive. It\u2019s only a modern-day misconception that looking at art is purely philosophical or intellectual. At its core, art is a physical experience \u2014 and that applies not only to music \u2014 with its thrumming bass that you can feel \u2014 but also to painting and visual arts as well. For the past 100 years or so, society has focused on the ideas behind artwork \u2014 that the thought trumps the thing. But when you watch artists making art, it is a physical experience. It\u2019s practically athletic. Engaging with artwork in person, as two bodies in space, is crucial. Research shows that factors like an artwork\u2019s size, or how we move around it, can change how we value art. \u00a0You can think about connecting with art the way you do with people. Just as a virtual meeting with someone is different from sitting across the dinner table, it\u2019s very different to look at a tiny image of an artwork on Instagram than it is to be body to body with, for example, a huge Mark Rothko painting. There\u2019s fascinating anecdotal evidence of how artworks can act on people at a physical level. The term \u201cStendhal syndrome\u201d describes people going to pieces \u2014 struck with dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, fainting spells or crying \u2014 in front of pieces of art. Stories like how a woman in a museum in Houston stripped naked in front of a Cy Twombly\u00a0\u00a0 painting suggest that, on a physical level, art can move us to do some incredible things. Magsamen: Not all artworks are positive, of course. It\u2019s critical to consider the kinds of sensorial experiences you bring into your life because of their power to make you feel, change your mood and affect your body. CNN: Bianca, you discuss finding value in some art experiences that might be considered unpleasant. What are the benefits of work that confuses us or makes us uncomfortable? Bosker: The fact that art isn\u2019t always pleasant is often part of its power. Scientists have puzzled over this question of why, over the last many thousands of years, humans have continued to keep engaging with art, even when, as they put it, it can \u201churt our sense of beauty.\u201d One compelling explanation is that we\u2019re drawn to uncomfortable, confounding images and experiences because our brains love the prediction errors they offer, aka surprises. Some researchers think art helps us fight the reducing tendencies of our minds. Contrary to common assumptions, we do not see the world like a video camera, dispassionately recording what\u2019s around us. Instead, our brains evolved to compress reality, acting like trash compactors, and for good reason. Oversimplifying our view of the world enabled us to spot the lion jumping out to eat us. But that ability also comes with risks. As some scientists put it, vision is a hallucination. What we\u2019re seeing is a construction based on our own individual filters of expectation that preemptively sort, dismiss and prioritize all the raw data coming in, even before we get the full picture. Looking at art can yank off those filters, surprising us and knocking our brains off their well-worn pathways. The glitch that art introduces is a gift that opens us to experiencing more nuance and beauty in the world around us. Magsamen: Art that pushes us beyond our limits helps form new neural pathways that might not otherwise develop in our day-to-day. Exercising these through art can help build resilience to get us through the suffering and uncertainties of life. When you\u2019re in despair, entering a church or other grand building can evoke awe, wonder and the sense of something bigger than you. Similarly, art, music and design\u00a0\u00a0 can alter our moods, taking us outside of ourselves. Building that capacity is an evolutionary imperative. CNN: What physiological benefits do the arts bring? Magsamen: Pinning down a definition of art can make some of the research tricky, but what we know suggests that artworks have very real effects on our mental and physical well-being. Physicians around the world prescribe visits to museums, engagement with arts and encounters with beauty. Different art forms affect the brain and body in different ways. Just as when we are prescribed medications, (it\u2019s true that) types, doses and durations of art work differently for different people. Doctors, social workers and public health practitioners are beginning to understand enough to collaborate with their clients to personalize their recommendations of particular artistic endeavors in specific frequencies and amounts to effect beneficial outcomes. Like exercise and good nutrition, engaging in the arts routinely will support your health. CNN: How can people develop an art practice to get those benefits? Bosker: Everything you need to have a meaningful experience with art is right in front of you. You don\u2019t need to have studied art history or spent years going to art fairs. You need attention and curiosity. An artist gave me great advice on how to engage with a work\u2014just try to notice five things about a piece, either in the work or in how it makes you feel.\u00a0Like,\u00a0\u201cThis pink makes me want to lick it\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201cThis green won\u2019t let me look away.\u201d The other foundational advice I give is to slow down. Many museum\u00a0visitors spend more time reading the description of the art than looking at the art itself, with the median time we spend with a work of art, both the piece and the label, being\u00a0just 21 seconds. Try \u201cslow looking.\u201d And pay attention to the physical form. Examining the artist\u2019s decisions offers you a pathway into the piece and a way to engage with art on your own terms. I used to take a scorched-earth approach to visiting museums with the attitude that seeing every single thing was how I\u2019d get my money\u2019s worth. That\u2019s the visual equivalent of binging at an all-you-can-eat buffet and then wondering why you feel ill. Instead of racing between masterpieces, spend more time with art that surprises you. And look for art everywhere, observing the everyday with an art mindset to counteract the reductionist tendencies of our brains. CNN: Do we have to be \u201cgood\u201d at art to reap its benefits? Magsamen: No. The art you\u2019re making doesn\u2019t have to be good for it to be valuable for you. One study showed that doing just 45 minutes of any kind of art lowered the stress hormone cortisol by as much as 25%.\u00a0\u00a0 Other research suggests artmaking builds skills in executive function, decision-making and, if you\u2019re working with others, collaboration. Playing music builds cognitive skills and enhances learning. And just one art experience per month can extend your life by 10 years. The process, not the product, is what\u2019s important. Bosker: You do not need any sort of license to engage with art. Art is a choice. It\u2019s a decision to fight against complacency and forge a life that\u2019s richer, more uncomfortable, more mind-blowing, more uncertain and ultimately, more beautiful.

{"id": "2022_07_18_health_how-to-stay-cool-without-air-conditioning-wellness", "text": "Whether you\u2019re without power, enduring extreme heat or trying to save money, there are ways to feel comfortable without artificial cooling.  Heat can foster fun summer activities, but the body shouldn\u2019t be too hot for too long, as too much heat can harm your brain and other organs, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Sweating is the body\u2019s natural cooling system, but when that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s increased risk for developing the heat-related illness hyperthermia \u2014 signs of which include heat cramps, heat edema and heat stroke. Heat combined with high humidity exacerbates this risk, since the air\u2019s saturation level makes sweat accumulate on the skin, preventing the body from cooling naturally.     Staying cool can be done by using some basic supplies and knowing how to manipulate your home to control its temperatures. Here are 14 methods for doing so.   Stay hydrated When you\u2019re hot and flushed, hydrating yourself is the first and foremost step to cooling down, said Wendell Porter, a senior lecturer emeritus in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida.  The temperature of the water doesn\u2019t matter since your body will heat it, he added. If your body is suffering from the heat and needs to cool itself, it can\u2019t do that without enough moisture, since the body cools itself by sweating.  Take a cold shower or bath Taking a cold shower or bath helps cool your body by lowering your core temperature, Porter said. For an extra cool blast, try peppermint soap. The menthol in peppermint oil activates brain receptors that tell your body something you\u2019re eating or feeling is cold.  Use cold washrags on your neck or wrists  Place a cold washrag or ice bags (packs) on your wrists or drape it around your neck to cool your body. These pulse points are areas where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you\u2019ll cool down more quickly.  Use box fans  Place box fans facing out of the windows of rooms you\u2019re spending time in to blow out hot air and replace it with cold air inside.  If the weather in your area tends to fall between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings, opening the windows on both sides of the house during those times can facilitate a cross-flow ventilation system. If you do this, you can opt to use or not use the fans, but the fans would help cool the house faster, Porter said. The outdoors can pull the hot air from your home, leaving a cooler temperature or bringing in the breeze. Just be sure to close windows as the sun comes out, then open them when the weather is cool again. Just resting near a fan would reduce your body temperature as well.  Close your curtains or blinds If you have windows that face the sun\u2019s direction in the morning through afternoon, close the curtains or blinds over them to \u201ckeep the sun from coming directly into the house and heating up (the) inside,\u201d Porter said.  You could also install blackout curtains to insulate the room and reduce temperature increases that would happen during the day.  If you do turn the air conditioning on, don\u2019t set it below 70 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to cool the house faster, said Samantha Hall, founder of Spaces Alive, an Australia-based design research company helping to create healthy, sustainable buildings.  \u201cIt just runs for longer to reach that temp and will keep going until you start to feel a bit chilly and is then hard to balance,\u201d she added. Instead, keep the unit temperature as high as possible while still comfortable.  Sleep in breathable linens Cotton is one of the most breathable materials, so cotton sheets or blankets could help keep you cool through the night.  The lower the thread count of the cotton, the more breathable it is, Porter said. That\u2019s because higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.  Sleep in the basement  If you can\u2019t sleep through the night because you\u2019re too hot, try sleeping somewhere besides your bedroom, if that\u2019s an option. Heat rises, so if you have a lower or basement level in your home, set up a temporary sleeping area there to experience cooler temperatures at night.  Don\u2019t refrigerate or freeze blankets or clothing  Common advice for staying cool without air conditioning includes refrigerating or freezing wet socks, blankets or clothing then ringing them out to wear while you sleep. But this isn\u2019t a good idea, Porter said.  Because of \u201cthe amount of energy they can absorb from your body that night, they will be warm in just a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019d have damp stuff that would mold your mattress. So you definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d  Close the doors of unused rooms  If no one\u2019s using a room that doesn\u2019t have vents or registers, close the door to that area to keep the cool air confined to only occupied areas of the house.  Use the exhaust fan in your kitchen and/or bathroom  Flip the switch for the exhaust fan in your kitchen to pull hot air that rises after you cook or in your bathroom to draw out steam after you shower.  Install energy-efficient light bulbs Incandescent light bulbs generate a higher temperature than LED light bulbs do. To make the switch, watch for sales on energy-efficient bulbs, then slowly replace the bulbs in your house, Porter said.  Switching light bulbs can save money but won\u2019t reduce a lot of heat in the home, Hall said. However, if you focus on switching the bulbs in areas you\u2019re sitting near, that would make a more noticeable difference, Porter said.  Cook in the morning, with a slow cooker or outside Oven heat can spread throughout your house. Keep the heat centralized in one area, such as a slow cooker. Or, cook outdoors on a grill to keep the heat outside.  Enjoy frozen treats Eating an ice pop or ice cream to cool down may help for a moment. But don\u2019t go overboard on the sugar if you\u2019re overheated or at risk of being overheated, Porter said.  \u201cSugar would run your metabolism up and you\u2019d start feeling internally hot,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the cool treat might be good, but the extra sugar might not.\u201d  Research what your state offers If you\u2019ve tried everything and still can\u2019t beat the heat at home, you could look online for any local programs that are offering ductless air conditioners.  Depending on your state, some cooling centers \u2014 air-conditioned public facilities where people might go for relief during extremely hot weather \u2014 may be open and taking precautions to ensure they\u2019re as safe as possible. You could start by checking with your local utility offices, as they would know who is offering certain programs, Porter recommended.

{"id": "2024_06_05_health_cucumber-recall-salmonella-fda-cdc", "text": "Recalled cucumbers might be linked to a multistate salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 160 people. The US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local partners are investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Africana that has led to 162 illnesses in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Among those cases, 54 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Out of 65 people interviewed for the investigation, 47 reported eating cucumbers, the FDA said Wednesday, and testing by state partners had identified salmonella in a cucumber sample. More testing is underway. The agencies are also investigating an outbreak of Salmonella\u00a0Braenderup to determine whether it\u2019s related to the\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0Africana outbreak. The\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0Braenderup outbreak has led to 158 illnesses in 23 states. \u201cThe two outbreaks share several similarities, including where and when illnesses occurred and the demographics of ill people,\u201d the FDA said Wednesday. Late last month, Florida-based Fresh Start Produce recalled fresh cucumbers shipped distribution centers, wholesalers and food service distributors in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Sellers may have shipped to more states or repackaged cucumbers for stores, the CDC said. Mini cucumbers and English cucumbers are not included in the recall. Symptoms of a salmonella infection\u00a0include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that can start within hours or days of consuming the bacteria. Most people will recover without treatment but should seek immediate attention from a health-care provider if they have severe symptoms, symptoms that don\u2019t improve after a few days or signs of dehydration. Children, elderly people and those with weakened immune systems are more likely to become severely ill. The CDC says people should not eat recalled cucumbers, and they should wash items and surfaces that may have touched the cucumbers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/cucumber-recall-salmonella-fda-cdc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_health_prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness", "text": "Chemical toxins are everywhere \u2014 in our water, food, air and soil. Exposure to those toxins during pregnancy can create serious health issues in elementary school children that can affect their lives for years to come, a new study found. Children born to European mothers exposed to four families of chemicals that disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine (hormone) system had elevated levels of metabolic syndrome at ages 6 to 11. Metabolic syndrome can include obesity, elevated blood pressure, and abnormally high cholesterol and insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Within the group of children exposed to the highest levels of chemicals, 62% were overweight or obese, compared with 16% of children within the low-risk group, said first author Nuria Gu\u0308il-Oumrait, a Fulbright scholar at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cMoreover, the levels of blood insulin and triglycerides, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group,\u201d G\u00fcil-Oumrait said in an email. \u201cIn contrast, HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group.\u201d HDL cholesterol is considered a \u201cgood\u201d blood fat as it helps clear ateries. Metabolic syndrome is typically associated with adult cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, but the growing epidemic of childhood obesity has seen symptoms appearing in kids at younger and younger ages. Having metabolic syndrome as a child is highly predictive of chronic disease as an adult, experts say. \u201cThis research stands out as one of the most comprehensive endeavors delving into early-life environmental origins of metabolic risk, further bolstering prior toxicological and epidemiological evidence in this area,\u201d said Vicente Mustieles, Mariana Ferna\u0301ndez and Carmen Messerlian in an editorial published with the study that appeared Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open. Mustieles and Fern\u00e1ndez are investigators at the Biomedical Research Center at the University of Granada, Spain. Messerlian is an assistant professor of environmental reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. CNN reached out to the International Council for Chemical Associations for comment but did not hear back before publication. A spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, however, provided the following statement. \u201cWe will review the details of this study once it\u2019s released. ACC\u2019s members are serious about their responsibility to produce chemistries that offer important safety, product performance and durability benefits and that can be used safely. Our members undertake extensive scientific analyses to evaluate potential risk of their chemicals, from development through use and safe disposal.\u201d Dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals The research team behind the new study performed blood and urine tests on 1,134 mothers during their pregnancies and later repeated those tests on their children between the ages of 6 and 11. The tests were looking for mixtures of nine chemical classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals commonly found in the environment. Endrocrine-disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants with the \u201cability to cross the blood-placenta barrier and interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance,\u201d the study said. These and other chemicals \u201cend up in the blood, tissue, and organs of fetuses and infants through maternal transplacental and breastfeeding pathways in a never-ending cycle,\u201d Mustieles, Fern\u00e1ndez and Messerlian wrote. The study tested for pesticides; heavy metals; flame retardants; plasticizers such as phthalates and phenols; and PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are found in surface and groundwaters around the world at levels much higher than many international regulators allow. Called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because\u00a0they fail to break down fully in the environment, PFAS have been used since the 1950s to make consumer products nonstick, oil- and water-repellent, and resistant to temperature change. Some of the most studied PFAS, such as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, obesity, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage and hormone disruption,\u00a0according to the EPA. Toxic heavy metals in the soil and water include lead and arsenic  \u2014 studies have found alarming levels in manufactured baby food. There is no safe level of lead, while arsenic, mercury and other heavy metals can harm the body and brain at relatively low doses, experts say. A December 2014 meta-analysis of studies on arsenic\u00a0found that a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15. Flame retardants have been linked to a 300% higher risk of cancer. These chemical toxins are the greatest contributor to intellectual disability in children worldwide, resulting in a total loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability, according to an\u00a0August 2020 study. Phthalates, found in hundreds of consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children\u2019s toys, have been connected to premature death among people ages 55 to 64\u00a0in the United States. Prior research has connected phthalates with\u00a0reproductive problems, such as\u00a0genital malformations\u00a0and\u00a0undescended testicles in baby boys and\u00a0lower sperm counts\u00a0and testosterone levels in adult males. Phthalates are also linked in studies to\u00a0childhood obesity,\u00a0asthma,\u00a0cardiovascular issues\u00a0and\u00a0cancer. In the study, phthalates were the only group of chemicals that were associated with a lower level of metabolic syndrome. All of the other chemical families increased risk. People are exposed to a mixture of chemicals daily Chemicals may vary in their impact on the body. For example, certain PFAS compounds tend to accumulate in the liver, contributing to fatty liver disease and high cholesterol. And flame retardants and other chemicals may be stored in body fat, contributing to obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, according to the editorial. Since people are exposed to numerous types of potentially toxic substances each day, designing a study that could capture the cumulative impact on different parts of the body would provide a more realistic picture of any potential health impact. By focusing on metabolic syndrome, which combines measurements of blood sugars, lipids such as cholesterol, the existence of fat tissue and the impact on the heart, the current study was one of the first to accomplish this goal, the editorial said. \u201cWe almost always consider health risks from single chemicals, one at a time, as if we are exposed to just one chemical at a time,\u201d said Jane Houlihan, the national director of science and health for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies\u2019 exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. \u201cHere the research team shows that children\u2019s risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life can be driven by the complex mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the body at any moment and it highlights the particular risk of chemical exposures during pregnancy,\u201d she said. Healthy Babies Bright Futures\u00a0published a report in 2019\u00a0that found toxic metals in 95% of the baby foods randomly pulled off supermarket shelves, which led to the introduction of The Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, a bill that would allow the US Food and Drug Administration to set stricter standards and allow the FDA to monitor these standards through access to the records of food suppliers and manufacturers. \u201cGiven the steep rise in metabolic syndrome in the US, health officials and companies should be doing all they can to tighten safety standards and to get these chemicals out of commerce and out of our everyday products,\u201d Houlihan said. How to limit exposure There are ways to minimize exposure to plastics and other toxins, which is especially critical during pregnancy and childhood as developing fetuses and small bodies are more easily damaged, Houlihan said. Reduce rice intake for infants and children, and be sure to rinse grains well before using as this removes up to 60% of the arsenic, she said. Limit juice and be sure to carefully wash and peel vegetables and fruits, and if possible, buy organic. Stay away from stain-resistant carpets and upholstery, and don\u2019t use waterproofing sprays. Check your local area for levels of PFAS and other chemicals in your drinking water. The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy nonprofit, has created a national tap water database\u00a0searchable by zip code\u00a0that lists PFAS and other concerning chemicals, as well as a\u00a0national map\u00a0that illustrates where PFAS has been detected in the US. If your drinking water is of concern, consider purchasing a reverse osmosis filter, the most effective kind, EWG said. NSF, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, has\u00a0a list of recommended filters. Tap water is often a better choice than bottled water, however, which is packed with nanoplastics that can invade cells and tissues and leach toxic chemicals into the body. At home, one easy change is to use glass or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones when heating food. If possible, try to cook with ceramic, cast iron, or stainless-steel pans and avoid cookware treated with chemicals to avoid food sticking. Another good choice is to use stainless steel or glass bottles instead of plastic ones. \u201cChoose cosmetics that are free from endocrine disruptors such as parabens, benzophenone, triclosan, and phthalates,\u201d Gu\u0308il-Oumrait suggested. Consider the same for food, sunscreens, household cleaners and other everyday products encased in plastic. The EWG has several consumer databases that provides links to consumer products with fewer chemicals, including food scores, personal care products, sunscreen recommendations and a healthy living app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/health/prenatal-exposure-toxins-child-health-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2023_02_13_health_adhd-body-doubling-productivity-benefits-wellness", "text": "Once a week, ADHD coach Robin Nordmeyer joins a Zoom meeting with other coaches while she writes blogs, does administrative tasks or works on content for presentations she has been putting off.  Nordmeyer, who has ADHD, isn\u2019t necessarily using the meeting to collaborate with others \u2014 she just needs their presence as a motivator to help her get things done.  \u201cI run a business, and I have to balance lots of different areas of the business,\u201d said Nordmeyer, cofounder and managing director of the Center for Living Well with ADHD-Minnesota, an ADHD coaching group near Minneapolis serving all ages.  \u201cSome of those things come very easy \u2014 like, they\u2019re in my wheelhouse, they energize me, I can\u2019t wait to get to them,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cAnd some of those things are a little more tedious, or I have some resistance around them.\u201d  What Nordmeyer does to get through those tougher tasks is sometimes known as \u201cbody doubling,\u201d a productivity and self-help strategy that involves working with another person around to help improve motivation and focus. It has been popular for some time among people with ADHD \u2014 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \u2014 especially during the pandemic.  \u201cThe idea is that the presence of another is essentially a gentle reminder to stay on task,\u201d said Billy Roberts, clinical director of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cFor folks (with) ADHD whose minds tend to wander and get off task, the body double somehow works as an external motivator to stay on task.\u201d  Body doubling isn\u2019t just for people with ADHD, but like many \u201ccoping strategies, something that can be helpful for anybody is more central and important for folks with ADHD,\u201d said Dr. J. Russell Ramsay, founding codirector of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s ADHD Treatment and Research Program.  Why body doubling works A neurodevelopmental disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood but lasting into adulthood, ADHD stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University\u2019s Center on the Developing Child. Those skills help us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and multitask. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity \u2014 so people with this disorder might have trouble concentrating, staying organized, managing their time or controlling their impulses, which can affect both their work and personal lives, Roberts said.  If people with ADHD have no intrinsic interest in a task, Roberts said, they typically struggle with a lack of internal motivation to complete it or even to get started. Body doubling provides that motivation, experts said.  \u201cIt also draws on our social selves,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cA lot of people with ADHD will say, \u2018I have a hard time getting started on this if I\u2019m doing it for myself, but if I know somebody else is relying on me, if somebody else is waiting outside for me to show up to go for our walk, I\u2019m more likely to go and be there because I don\u2019t want to let them down.\u2019\u201d  There doesn\u2019t appear to be extensive research on body doubling for productivity, according to Roberts and other experts. \u201cBut I do know that the idea of externalizing motivation is a long-standing, evidence-based mechanism for managing ADHD,\u201d Roberts said.   In theory, the method is pretty straightforward, but there a few factors to keep in mind to make the most of it. How to use body doubling effectively Body doubling can help with pretty much any task you\u2019re having a hard time getting done \u2014 whether that\u2019s work, chores, exercise, schoolwork or paperwork. The other person doesn\u2019t have to be doing the same thing as you, unless the activity you need body doubling for \u2014 such as exercising \u2014 requires that assistance.   Be choosy about whom you ask to be your body double. The person should be as committed to you completing your work as you are, Roberts said \u2014 not distracting you with conversation or anything else. Choose someone who usually makes you feel comfortable and safe, and who can encourage you when necessary.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep a body double session focused on its purpose,\u201d Nordmeyer said. If conversations do come up, table them for later, perhaps during a break or dinner. Asking someone to be your body double might feel awkward, but Roberts said the best approach is often a straightforward one. You could say, \u201cIt\u2019s something I heard can help with productivity. Would you mind just being around me while I work on this? Maybe you have something you could work on, too.\u201d  You could also barter with them, in a sense, by making an offer such as, \u201cYou help me organize my garage on Saturday; I\u2019ll help you organize your home office on Sunday,\u201d Ramsay said.  Those small first steps of seeking a partner and setting up the session get you started and keep you going, he added. Scheduling regular body doubling sessions is one option, Nordmeyer said, or just ask whenever the need arises. How transparent you are about why you need a body double is up to you, as is whether you have more than one body double. \u201cIt depends on the individual,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf it turns into a distraction more than mindfulness, accountability or behavioral support, then you just want to rework things. You can kind of tinker with things until you find what works.\u201d  Virtual body doubling If you don\u2019t have a friend or colleague to be your body double, you aren\u2019t out of luck.  Some TikTok users, such as Allie K. Campbell, regularly go live while they\u2019re working so others can use them as a virtual body double. There are also body doubling or coworking platforms or apps such as Flown, Focusmate or Flow Club.  In virtual sessions, \u201cmost body doubles ask you to share your camera, and a lot of people are real nervous about being visible,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cThe purpose of that is to make sure you\u2019re still in your chair working. \u2026 But there might be other ways you can create that accountability through a chat feature.\u201d  The benefits of body doubling are likely why some people like working on things in coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces \u2014 which can be sources of passive body doubling if you don\u2019t have someone to ask, Roberts said. \u201cSome people work better with community support and just the awareness of other people around them,\u201d he added. \u201cYou saw that a lot with the pandemic, like people learning more about the kinds of structure they needed.  \u201cWe all think and work differently, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d Roberts said.

{"id": "2024_06_05_health_antidepressant-discontinuation-withdrawal-symptoms-wellness", "text": "Antidepressants can do wonders for persistent mental health problems. But some people may be reluctant to take the medications, fearing what could happen if they want to stop taking them one day. That risk has now been quantified, thanks to a new review of 79 studies \u2014 known as a meta-analysis \u2014 totaling 21,002 adult participants age 45 on average. Roughly 15% of participants who discontinued antidepressants experienced withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, insomnia and irritability, according to the review published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry. One in 35 participants experienced severe symptoms once they stopped taking antidepressants. The review is the first publication of a larger project on antidepressant withdrawal symptoms, the authors said. \u201cThere is strong evidence that antidepressants can be effective for many people who are experiencing a depressive disorder, either alone, or alongside other treatments such as psychotherapy,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Henssler, senior author of the study and senior physician in the department of psychiatry and neurosciences at Charit\u00e9 \u2014 University Medicine in Berlin, in a news release. \u201cHowever, they do not work for everyone, and some patients may experience unpleasant side effects. In patients who have recovered with the help of antidepressants, the decision from doctors and patients may be to stop taking them in time,\u201d Henssler added. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s important both doctors and patients have an accurate, evidence-based picture of what might happen.\u201d The occurrence of withdrawal symptoms was reported or described as early as 1959, but researchers neglected those reports until the late 1990s, according to the review.\u00a0 Until now, \u201cthere has been a lot of \u2018debate\u2019 about the important problem of antidepressant withdrawal in the last few years, which has appeared within print and social media, with very high estimates of withdrawal being pronounced at around 50% and half (considered) as severe,\u201d said Dr. Sameer Jauhar, senior clinical lecturer in affective disorders and psychosis at King\u2019s College London, in a news release. Jauhar wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis was based on a very unconventional review,\u201d Jauhar added, \u201cwhich included data from online surveys, which are notoriously difficult to interpret (ask anyone involved in election polling).\u201d To determine the risk of withdrawal more accurately, the authors reviewed data from 44 randomized controlled trials and 35 observational studies published between 1961 and 2019. These studies investigated abrupt cessation or tapering of an established antidepressant or placebo. More than half of these studies focused on mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, and more than a fourth concentrated on anxiety disorders. \u00a0 The authors also discovered the medications most often linked with withdrawal symptoms were desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, imipramine and escitalopram. Those with the lowest rate of discontinuation symptoms were fluoxetine and sertraline. Pharmaceutical companies funded 45 of the studies, but this backing didn\u2019t appear to influence the overall results, according to the review. The rate of withdrawal symptoms in pharma-funded studies was about the same as trials not funded by pharmaceutical companies. \u201cThis work is a salutary lesson, as some people may have been dissuaded from taking a potentially effective treatment, based on poor quality evidence,\u201d Jauhar said. \u201cScience does correct itself, and the authors are to be congratulated on this work.\u201d The findings are also an important first step to helping patients responsibly discontinue taking antidepressants, said Dr. Christiaan Vinkers, a psychiatrist and full professor in the department of psychiatry at Amsterdam University Medical Center, in a news release. What these findings mean for patients Another weakness of the review was that many of the included studies weren\u2019t primarily focused on antidepressant discontinuation, but rather the efficacy of antidepressants versus placebos, Dr. Tony Kendrick, professor of primary care at the University of Southampton in England, said in a news release. These studies \u201calso happened to observe patients in the wash-out period coming off the drugs at the end of the trials. Consequently, the period of taking the antidepressant was 12 weeks or less in 36 out of the 79 included studies,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cSevere discontinuation symptoms would not usually be expected to arise after only a few weeks of antidepressant use.\u201d Some of the other included studies had much longer treatment periods \u2014 some up to a year or longer. Regarding why antidepressant discontinuation sometimes leads to withdrawal symptoms, it\u2019s important to note these medications aren\u2019t addictive, Henssler said. The effects could be due to the suddenly lower amount of neurotransmitters in your brain, according to the Cleveland Clinic. In the review, there was no difference between studies on tapered or abrupt discontinuation. But the authors cautioned that finding isn\u2019t a firm conclusion due to variation in study designs. And other research still indicates tapering can be helpful for reducing the chances and severity of symptoms, they said. Though the rates of withdrawal aren\u2019t nearly as high as previously reported, when it comes to patients wanting to quit their antidepressants, doctors should still have conversations about what doing so would mean for the patient and how to do it safely, Jauhar said. \u201cThe doctor should help them to do so slowly and in a controlled manner that limits the impact of any potential withdrawal symptoms \u2026 at a pace that suits them and their individual needs,\u201d said Dr. Oliver Howes, chair of the psychopharmacology committee at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom, said in a news release. Howes wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Carefully strategizing is important also because of the risk of relapsing into the condition being treated, depending on a person\u2019s mental health history, Dr. Paul Keedwell, a consultant psychiatrist and member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said in a news release. The study didn\u2019t provide information on the duration of withdrawal symptoms, but other research suggests they can last for up to two weeks in most cases, Keedwell said. Discontinuation is more difficult for people who have been on their medications for a year or more, he added \u2014 in that case withdrawal symptoms can last for months but rarely up to a year. However, \u201cit is important to say that withdrawal symptoms are not dangerous, and the risk of experiencing them at some future date should not be a reason for refusing antidepressant treatment,\u201d Keedwell said. \u201cThe pros and cons of treatment should always be discussed with your doctor.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/antidepressant-discontinuation-withdrawal-symptoms-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_health_anxiety-positive-energy-wellness", "text": "(CNN) \u2014  Tossing and turning in the wee hours. A low but constant buzzing in the brain that thwarts concentration. A feeling of tense restlessness. Most have experienced this sort of anxiety \u2014 not clinical anxiety, which might result in a full-on panic attack, but the run-of-the-mill kind that leaves you feeling uncomfortable. \u201cAnxiety is this simple definition: that feeling of fear or worry that comes in situations of uncertainty,\u201d neuroscientist Dr. Wendy Suzuki\u00a0recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life. \u201cThat\u2019s my simplistic definition of everyday anxiety.\u201d That experience is not pleasant. \u201cThe general feeling is, \u2018I just want to get rid of it,\u2019\u201d said Suzuki, a professor of neural science and psychology at New York University as well as dean of the school\u2019s College of Arts and Science. She is also the author of \u201cGood Anxiety: Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion.\u201d \u201cThe misunderstanding is that it is valuable,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning system that we all need. It is a tool that helps us figure out what we hold dear. If we don\u2019t have that, I think something important will be taken away from our lives.\u201d You can listen more on how anxiety can be good here. Suzuki explained how anxiety evolved to protect us. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that in this day and age,\u201d she said. But 2.5 million years ago, \u201can ancestor with a little baby (was) walking around trying to find food, and there\u2019s a crack of a twig and that could either be \u2026 a big animal coming to eat her or it could be the crack of a twig.\u00a0She better be ready, or we\u2019re not going to have any ancestors after her.\u201d The crack of the twig left her anxious but alert to danger. \u201cAnd then her body is (in) the fight-or-flight response,\u201d she said. \u201cThat same response, including all of the fight-or-flight (reaction), gets activated when we look at the news, when we look at social media, at what\u2019s going on today,\u201d she said. \u201cOur heart rates are going up, our respiration rates are going off \u2014 that is not good physiologically for us. And so \u2026\u00a0that is your No. 1 reason to learn how to modulate that stress response.\u201d The first step toward getting to \u201cgood\u201d anxiety, Suzuki said, is learning how to lower your level of everyday anxiety. So, what can you do to ratchet it down? Here are Suzuki\u2019s top five tips: Take a deep breath Practice breath meditation. \u201cBreath meditation is the oldest form of meditation and can be so effective in really calming ourselves down \u2014 and immediately,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cThat\u2019s my No. 1 go-to for people who say, \u2018I just need something right now.\u2019\u201d One calming pattern is box breathing. To do it, inhale deeply for four counts, hold for four counts, exhale for four counts and hold again for four counts. \u201cRepeat to calm your mind and body,\u201d she said. Get moving Go for a short walk, Suzuki recommended. \u201cDid you know that just 10 minutes of walking can significantly reduce anxiety and depression levels in people? You don\u2019t even have to change your clothes to get that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat that\u2019s doing is stimulating the release of neurotransmitters that don\u2019t necessarily decrease your anxiety, but they increase your feelings of reward and happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cThose neurotransmitters that go up include dopamine and serotonin and noradrenaline and endorphins.\u00a0Every single time you move your body, it\u2019s like giving your brain a wonderful bubble bath of neurochemicals, and it works immediately.\u201d Reframe your anxiety Turn anxiety-inducing situations into personal challenges to foster growth and resilience \u2014 and enjoy the newness of uncertain circumstances. Paraphrasing Deepak Chopra, Suzuki recommended embracing uncertainty because it can make life interesting to live. \u201cIn my life, the uncertainty can be something that brings excitement, can bring joy. Not all the time, but maybe you can take part of that and embrace it as something useful,\u201d she said. For example, she said, \u201cIf the same thing happened every single time I went on vacation, that would not be a fun vacation. I like the newness; I like learning new things and being exposed to new things. And I can\u2019t control that by definition.\u201d Spin straw into gold Turn your worry into action. To enhance productivity and reduce worry, transform your anxious what-if list into a productive to-do list, Suzuki advised. \u201cI like to say that there are gifts that come with your anxiety,\u201d she said, citing what often happens to her right before she goes to sleep. \u201cI have this worry list that hits me right before I\u2019m going to go to sleep. And so what do I do? I turn that what-if list into a to-do list,\u201d she said. \u201cI just say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to remember these things, so Wendy, you can go to sleep now.\u2019 But the next morning I go and take all those things that made me not sleep the night before, and I go do something about them. \u2026 In that way, I make myself more productive. And I use my anxiety as the tool that it\u2019s supposed to (be).\u201d Practice compassion Support others, Suzuki said, letting them know they are not alone. \u201cReach out with a kind word to someone experiencing similar anxiety,\u201d she said, noting that some people feel shame about being anxious over a certain situation. \u201cThis simple act can release dopamine and improve your own mood.\u201d We hope these five tips help you turn your anxiety into something more productive. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week on the Chasing Life podcast when we delve into therapy and learn what it can and can\u2019t do to increase your happiness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/health/anxiety-positive-energy-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_07_05_health_stem-cells-fast-facts", "text": "Here is some background information about stem cells. Scientists believe that stem cell research can be used to treat medical conditions including Parkinson\u2019s disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  About Stem Cells Sources: National Institutes of Health, Mayo Clinic Stem cell research focuses on embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.  Stem cells have two characteristics that differentiate them from other types of cells: - They are unspecialized cells that can replicate themselves through cell division over long periods of time. - Stem cells can be manipulated, under certain conditions, to become mature cells with special functions, such as the beating cells of the heart muscle or insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. There are many different types of stem cells, including: pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells.- Pluripotent stem cells (ex: embryonic stem cells) can give rise to any type of cell in the body. These cells are like blank slates, and they have the potential to turn into any type of cell.- Adult stem cells can give rise to multiple types of cells, but are more limited compared with embryonic stem cells. They are more likely to generate within a particular tissue, organ or physiological system. (Ex: blood-forming stem cells/bone marrow cells, sometimes referred to as multipotent stem cells) Embryonic stem cells are harvested from four to six-day-old embryos. These embryos are either leftover embryos in fertility clinics or embryos created specifically for harvesting stem cells by therapeutic cloning. Only South Korean scientists claim to have successfully created human embryos via therapeutic cloning and have harvested stem cells from them. Adult stem cells are already designated for a certain organ or tissue. Some adult stem cells can be coaxed into or be reprogrammed into turning into a different type of specialized cell within the tissue type - for example, a heart stem cell can give rise to a functional heart muscle cell, but it is still unclear whether they can give rise to all different cell types of the body. The primary role of adult stem cells is to maintain and repair the tissue in which they are found. Uses of Stem Cell Research Regenerative medicine uses cell-based therapies to treat disease. Scientists who research stem cells are trying to identify how undifferentiated stem cells become differentiated as serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are due to abnormal cell division and differentiation. Scientists believe stem cells can be used to generate cells and tissues that could be used for cell-based therapies as the need for donated organs and tissues outweighs the supply. Stem cells, directed to differentiate into specific cell types, offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s diseases. Policy Debate Cloning human embryos for stem cells is very controversial. The goal of therapeutic cloning research is not to make babies, but to make embryonic stem cells, which can be harvested and used for cell-based therapies. Using fertilized eggs left over at fertility clinics is also controversial because removing the stem cells destroys them. Questions of ethics arise because embryos are destroyed as the cells are extracted, such as: When does human life begin? What is the moral status of the human embryo? Timeline 1998 - President Bill Clinton requests a National Bioethics Advisory Commission to study the question of stem cell research. 1999 - The National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommends that the government allow federal funds to be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells. 2000 - During his campaign, George W. Bush says he opposes any research that involves the destruction of embryos. 2000 - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) issues guidelines for the use of embryonic stem cells in research, specifying that scientists receiving federal funds can use only extra embryos that would otherwise be discarded. President Clinton approves federal funding for stem cell research but Congress does not fund it. August 9, 2001 - President Bush announces he will allow federal funding for about 60 existing stem cell lines created before this date. January 18, 2002 - A panel of experts at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommends a complete ban on human reproductive cloning, but supports so-called therapeutic cloning for medical purposes.

July 11, 2002 - The President\u2019s Council on Bioethics recommends a four-year ban on cloning for medical research to allow time for debate. February 2005 - South Korean scientist Hwang Woo Suk publishes a study in Science announcing he has successfully created stem cell lines using therapeutic cloning. December 2005 - Experts from Seoul National University accuse Hwang of faking some of his research. Hwang asks to have his paper withdrawn while his work is being investigated and resigns his post. January 10, 2006 - An investigative panel from Seoul National University accuses Hwang of faking his research. July 18, 2006 - The Senate votes 63-37 to loosen President Bush\u2019s limits on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research. July 19, 2006 - President Bush vetoes the embryonic stem-cell research bill passed by the Senate (the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005), his first veto since taking office.  June 20, 2007 - President Bush vetoes the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. January 23, 2009 - The FDA approves a request from Geron Corp. to test embryonic stem cells on eight to 10 patients with severe spinal cord injuries. This will be the world\u2019s first test in humans of a therapy derived from human embryonic stem cells. The tests will use stem cells cultured from embryos left over in fertility clinics.  March 9, 2009 - President Barack Obama signs an executive order overturning an order signed by President Bush in August 2001 that barred the NIH from funding research on embryonic stem cells beyond using 60 cell lines that existed at that time. August 23, 2010 - US District Judge Royce C. Lamberth issues a preliminary injunction that prohibits the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. September 9, 2010 - A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit grants a request from the Justice Department to lift a temporary injunction that blocked federal funding of stem cell research. September 28, 2010 - The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit lifts an injunction imposed by a federal judge, thereby allowing federally funded embryonic stem-cell research to continue while the Obama Administration appeals the judge\u2019s original ruling against use of public funds in such research. October 8, 2010 - The first human is injected with cells from human embryonic stem cells in a clinical trial sponsored by Geron Corp. November 22, 2010 - William Caldwell, CEO of Advanced Cell Technology, tells CNN that the FDA has granted approval for his company to start a clinical trial using cells grown from human embryonic stem cells. The treatment will be for an inherited degenerative eye disease.

According to a report published in The Lancet, the researchers transplanted stem cells into 18 patients with severe vision loss as a result of two types of macular degeneration. May 2, 2018 - The science journal Nature reports that scientists have created a structure like a blastocyst \u2013 an early embryo \u2013 using mouse stem cells instead of the usual sperm and egg. June 4, 2018 - The University of California reports that the first in utero stem cell transplant trial has led to the live birth of an infant that had been diagnosed in utero with alpha thalassemia, a blood disorder that is usually fatal for fetuses. January 13, 2020 - In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers announce they have created the world\u2019s first living, self-healing robots using stem cells from frogs. Named xenobots after the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), the machines are less than a millimeter (0.04 inches) wide, small enough to travel inside human bodies. Less than two years later, scientists announce that these robots can now reproduce.

{"id": "2024_06_05_health_bird-flu-mexico-human-h5n2", "text": "Even as the United States grapples with an outbreak of H5N1 flu in dairy cattle, the World Health Organization has announced the first known human infection with a different strain, H5N2, in a person in Mexico who died of complications of their infection. Both of these strains of the influenza A virus have primarily affected farmed and wild birds, infecting flocks around the world. About 900 human cases of H5N1 have been reported since 1996, and about half of people known to be infected have died.\u00a0On Wednesday, WHO said it had confirmed the first case of human infection of H5N2 in a 59-year-old resident of Mexico. The source of the person\u2019s infection is unknown, although WHO noted that H5N2 viruses had been reported in poultry in Mexico. Because any new influenza A infection in people has the potential for high public health impact, it must be reported to WHO.\u00a0The organization said that based on current knowledge, the risk to the general public from H5N2 is low, since other H5 subtypes are known to infect humans but none has been shown to cause sustained human-to-human spread. The person, who had multiple underlying medical conditions, had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before they developed new symptoms. In mid-April, they developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness.\u00a0On April 24, they sought medical attention and were hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. The person died of complications that day. On May 8, a sample sent for specialized testing indicated that it was positive for H5N2, and the result was subsequently confirmed by a different lab. Of 17 people at the hospital who\u2019d been in contact with the patient, no further cases were identified. Twelve additional contacts were identified near the person\u2019s residence, and seven of those had symptoms, but testing of samples from these cases didn\u2019t identify Covid-19 or any type of flu.\u00a0Scientists are now testing blood samples to see whether they can find antibodies that would point to past infections. In March, an H5N2 outbreak was reported in a backyard poultry farm in a neighboring state to the one where the person lived.\u00a0According to WHO, it hasn\u2019t been possible to establish whether this case is related to recent poultry outbreaks. Flu viruses normally circulate in birds but occasionally can jump to other species, including humans.\u00a0People catch the viruses from direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, type A flu strains can be classified as bird flu, swine flu or other types of animal influenza viruses. Bird flu infections in humans can cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal.\u00a0 Eye infections like conjunctivitis, gut symptoms and brain swelling are also possible.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/bird-flu-mexico-human-h5n2/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness", "text": "A low-calorie sweetener called xylitol used in many reduced-sugar foods and consumer products such as gum and toothpaste may be linked to\u00a0nearly twice the risk of heart attacks, stroke and death in people who consume the highest levels of the sweetener, a new study found. \u201cWe gave healthy volunteers a typical drink with xylitol to see how high the levels would get and they went up 1,000-fold,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic\u00a0Lerner Research Institute. \u201cWhen you eat sugar, your glucose level may go up 10% or 20% but it doesn\u2019t go up a 1,000-fold,\u201d said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Center for Microbiome and Human Health. \u201cHumankind has not experienced levels of xylitol this high except within the last couple of decades when we began ingesting completely contrived and sugar-substituted processed foods,\u201d he added. Worrisome blood clots occur In 2023, the same researchers found similar results for another low-calorie sweetener called erythritol, which is used as a bulking sugar in stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products. Additional lab and animal research presented in both papers revealed erythritol and xylitol may cause blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke. In the new study\u00a0 on xylitol, \u201cdifferences in platelet behavior were seen even after a person consumed a modest quantity of xylitol in a drink typical of a portion consumed in real life,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThese experiments are interesting but alone do not prove that platelet abnormalities are to account for a linkage between xylitol and clinical events,\u201d said Tomey, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Some 61% of American adults will have cardiovascular disease by 2050, according to a recent prediction by the American Heart Association. Reducing clotting activity is a key treatment used by cardiologists, so any additional clotting in platelets is a bad sign, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. \u201cWhen someone has a heart attack, we give them aspirin or drugs like clopidogrel, or Plavix, to counter platelet activity.\u00a0 These sugar alcohols appear to be enhancing platelet activity, which is concerning,\u201d said Freeman, who was not associated with the new research. \u201cThis is another warning we ought to switch to water, with a close second being unsweetened tea or coffee,\u201d he said. Carla Saunders, president of the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that the study results \u201care contrary to decades of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of low-calorie sweeteners such as xylitol by global health and regulatory \u200eagencies. These findings are a disservice to those who rely on alternative sweeteners as a tool to improve their health.\u201d What is xylitol? As sweet as sugar with less than half the calories, xylitol is often used in sugarless gum, breath mints, toothpaste, mouthwash, cough syrup and chewable vitamins. It is frequently added in larger quantities to candy, baked goods, cake mixes, barbecue sauces, ketchup, peanut butter, puddings, pancake syrup and more. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, a carbohydrate found naturally in foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, mushrooms, spinach, plums, raspberries and strawberries. However, the amount of xylitol found in such natural sources is tiny, Hazen said. \u201cIf you actually do the calculation, it literally takes a tonnage of fruit to be equivalent to one diabetic cookie that can have like nine grams of xylitol, which is a typical label amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like eating salt at the level of a salt lick.\u201d For commercial use, however, xylitol is made from corncobs, birch trees or genetically engineered bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s sold as a so-called natural sweetener, and because xylitol doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar levels, it\u2019s also marketed as low carb and keto friendly,\u201d Hazen said. Many professional associations also recommend xylitol as a sugar substitute for patients with obesity, diabetes or prediabetes to improve glycemic control, he added. \u201cYet people at risk for diabetes are among the most vulnerable for clotting events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting the wrong people.\u201d Exposure has increased over the last two decades, Hazen said, because the US Food and Drug Administration recognizes sugar alcohols as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d \u201cXylitol is cheaper to make than cane sugar and so more and more keeps getting incorporated as a sugar substitute into food. Some 12-ounce drinks that use xylitol as a major artificial sweetener can contain 30 grams or more,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even buy it in bulk at the grocery store where you\u2019re told to use as a one-to-one substitute for sugar in home cooking.\u201d Research has shown some artificial sweeteners may create a backlash in the metabolic system, triggering the body to expect more calories, thus making weight loss more difficult. Only two of many alcohol sugars The study, published Thursday in the European Heart Journal, began as a way of finding unknown chemicals or compounds in a person\u2019s blood that might predict the risk for a heart attack, stroke or death within the next three years. To do so, Hazen and his team analyzed 1,157 blood samples from people who were undergoing assessment for heart disease that had been collected between 2004 and 2011. They also examined another batch of blood samples from more than 2,100 people who may also have had high risk for heart disease. They found a number of alcohol sugars that appeared to have an impact on cardiovascular function, including xylitol and erythritol. Erythritol is the predominant ingredient by weight in many stevia and monkfruit products. The February 2023 erythritol in study found the risk of heart attack and stroke nearly doubled within three years when people had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood. For the new study on xylitol, the results were basically the same \u2014 people with the highest levels of xylitol compared to those with the lowest levels had nearly twice the risk of heart attack, stroke and death, Hazen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a receptor on our platelets, which we as yet don\u2019t understand, that is recognizing this molecule and signaling to the platelet to be more prone to clot,\u201d he said. \u201cOur tastebuds can\u2019t tell the difference in the structures between sugar and these other sweeteners, but clearly our platelets can.\u201d The World Health Organization warned consumers in 2023 to avoid artificial sweeteners for weight loss, and has called for additional research on the long-term toxicity of low- and no-calorie sweeteners, the study said. \u201cThrough their work, the investigators have shined a light on the safety of sugar substitutes. There is more to learn,\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s Tomey said. \u201cIn the meantime, it is worth remembering that sugar substitutes are no substitute for a sincere commitment to the several elements of a healthy diet and lifestyle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/xylitol-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_health_reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness", "text": "Knee pain is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Whether it\u2019s due to past or current injury, arthritis or simply the wear and tear of aging, the discomfort can be debilitating. In most cases, proactive ways can help you soothe and strengthen your knees. As a mobility coach, I teach people how to use movement as medicine. In the case of knee pain, there\u2019s one simple yet effective exercise I favor to help alleviate pain and strengthen the muscles around your knees: the reverse lunge. Unlike traditional lunges, the reverse lunge is gentler on your joints. This lunge variation not only has the power to strengthen your knee function but also enhances overall lower body strength and stability. Read on to learn how incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness regimen can help you move past the pain and build a stronger foundation for knee health. Understanding your knee pain Knee pain is hard to ignore as it affects your ability to perform everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs and even sitting and standing. The knee joint is a complex structure made up of bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons, all working together to provide stability and movement. When any of these components are compromised, pain can ensue. It may be experienced as a constant or intermittent ache, throbbing or even stabbing pain that may or may not come with swelling. Common causes of knee pain include: \u2022\u00a0 Osteoarthritis: a degenerative joint disease that results in the breakdown of cartilage. \u2022\u00a0 Patellar tendinitis: inflammation of the tendons connecting the kneecap to the shinbone. \u2022\u00a0 Meniscus tears: injuries to the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee. \u2022\u00a0 Ligament injuries: tears or strains to any of the four main knee ligaments (ACL, MCL, PCL and LCL). \u2022\u00a0 Bursitis: Inflammation of the bursae, small sacs of fluid that cushion the knee joint. It\u2019s important to determine the cause of your knee pain before attempting any specific rehab plan. Addressing knee pain often requires a multifaceted approach that may include physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, medication and targeted exercises such as the reverse lunge. Before adding reverse lunges to your fitness regimen or beginning any new exercises or therapies, check with your doctor or other health care professionals you are seeing for help with your knees. Benefits of the reverse lunge The reverse lunge is a basic yet powerful exercise that strengthens the muscles around your knees, improves your core strength and enhances overall lower body strength, mobility and stability. Here are some key benefits: \u2022\u00a0 Reverse lunging strengthens muscles that support your knees. Building stabilizing muscles around the knee joints improves movement quality and reduces pain and injury risk. \u2022\u00a0 The dynamic movement of reverse lunging increases joint lubrication by stimulating the production of synovial fluid. Lubricating the knee joint reduces friction and promotes smoother, pain-free motion. \u2022\u00a0 Unlike forward lunging and other forward stepping exercises, the backward motion of reverse lunges puts less strain on the knees and emphasizes more stability, making them an ideal choice for individuals with knee pain. \u2022\u00a0 Practicing reverse lunges improves balance and stability. Because reverse lunges are unilateral, they are a balance training exercise that strengthens your core and stabilizing\u00a0 muscles to reduce the risk of injury by \u201cmoving wrong.\u201d \u2022\u00a0 They enhance mobility. Regularly practicing reverse lunges improves hip, knee and ankle mobility. \u2022\u00a0 They aid in functional activities. The movement mimics everyday activities, such as kneeling down to tie your shoes or picking something up off the floor. How to perform a reverse lunge Performing a reverse lunge correctly is crucial to reaping its benefits and avoiding injury. Follow these steps for proper form: 1.\u00a0 Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, shoulders relaxed, and arms at your sides or on your hips. Engage your core to maintain balance. 2.\u00a0 Take a step backward with your right foot, landing on the ball of your foot. Your left foot should remain in place, fully connected with the floor. 3.\u00a0 Bend both knees to lower your body until your left thigh is parallel to the ground and your right knee is either lightly touching or nearly touching the floor. 4.\u00a0 Keep most of your weight in your front foot and leg and ensure that your left knee is aligned over your left ankle, not pushed too far forward beyond your toes. 5.\u00a0 Maintain good upper-body posture with your shoulders back and chest open. Avoid leaning forward. 6.\u00a0You do not need to hold the lunge position for any specified length. Go at your own pace, returning to the starting position by pushing through your left heel to lift your body back to standing. Repeat the movement with the opposite leg. Aim for two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions on each leg, depending on your fitness level. Need to modify or want to progress? The intensity of reverse lunging can be varied to accommodate different fitness levels. Beginners or anyone struggling with balance should place one hand on a stable support, such as a chair or wall. For those wanting an advanced variation, hold dumbbells at your sides or a kettlebell at your chest or in one hand at your side or overhead to add resistance and increase the intensity. Use an appropriate weight for your fitness level and goals. To get the most out of practicing reverse lunges, keep these tips in mind: Consistency is key. Regular practice yields the best results. Aim to include reverse lunges in your routine at least two to three times per week. Focus on form. Quality over quantity. Proper form maximizes effectiveness while preventing injury. Listen to your body. If you experience any painful sensation beyond normal muscle fatigue, stop and reassess your form. Consult a health care professional if necessary. Knee pain doesn\u2019t have to sideline you from staying active and enjoying life. By incorporating reverse lunges into your fitness routine, you can take proactive steps toward healthier, pain-free knees. So, step back, lunge and move forward with stronger, more resilient knees.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/health/reverse-lunge-knee-pain-relief-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_health_marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness", "text": "It\u2019s a true blessing to have great friends who frequently get together. At times, however, those blessings may overflow, according to \u201cB,\u201d a 43-year-old Atlantan who CNN is not identifying for privacy reasons. \u201cI love Champagne bubbles and having Champagne on a patio on Sunday with friends \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0it\u2019s an ideal day,\u201d B said. \u201cBut my friends hang out all the time, and even on a weeknight, it would end up being bottles of wine. I felt like I should have invested in box wine, especially during the pandemic.\u201d Today, B has given up alcohol, turning instead to marijuana gummies when she wants a buzz. The use of weed to replace alcohol is a growing trend in the United States. In fact, a recent study found \u2014 for the first time ever \u2014 the daily use of cannabis of any kind among Americans surpassed the daily use of alcohol. In sheer numbers, of course, many more people still drink alcohol on occasion than use marijuana, which is now legal for recreational use in\u00a024 states and Washington, DC, and for medical use in\u00a038 states\u00a0and DC. Still, nearly 18 million people age 12 and older reported using marijuana daily or near daily in 2022, compared with about 15 million who said they used alcohol with the same frequency, according to the study\u2019s analysis of the most recent data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual government survey. \u2018My heart was racing\u2019 For B, giving up alcohol was a necessity. Her periodic binge drinking with friends was taking a toll. Hangovers and an increasing sense of anxiety on the mornings after affected her work performance and her ability to exercise, an enjoyable part of her life. \u201cI\u2019m really healthy, I eat clean and work out all the time, and I just was not feeling good anymore,\u201d B said. \u201cThen one day I was laying on my couch, and my heart was racing like it was coming out of my chest.\u201d Both alcoholism and heart disease ran in B\u2019s family: \u201cI\u2019ve had relatives that have dropped dead of a heart attack in their driveway.\u201d Simply drinking less wasn\u2019t an option for her. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to moderate in the past, but it\u2019s hard to do that when you\u2019re around people who are drinking,\u201d B said. \u201cSo I decided to quit alcohol completely. My friends were really supportive, and it was easier than I thought it would be.\u201d After a few months of total sobriety, however, B began to experiment with cannabis gummies and found them easy to incorporate with a nonalcoholic drink or two. \u201cI don\u2019t like getting super high,\u201d B said. \u201cI\u2019ll just cut off a fourth of a gummy to take the edge off after a long day at work. If I\u2019m with friends at a party where I know I\u2019ll be there awhile, I might take a half or even a whole one.\u201d Weed or alcohol: Which is better? Is replacing alcohol with weed a healthier option? It depends, experts say. \u201cQuestioning one\u2019s relationship with alcohol is a very healthy trend,\u201d said Carol Boyd, founding director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was not involved in the analysis. \u201cWe know that moderate alcohol consumption has health risks, and risk increases as alcohol consumption increases,\u201d Boyd said in an email. Just one drink a day can raise blood pressure, trigger a dangerous irregular heartbeat or even shrink your brain, studies have found. Those are just a few of the many pitfalls of alcohol use, including the risk of cancer. Binge drinking, defined as consuming four or more drinks in two hours for women (five or more for men) was on the rise during the pandemic. Binging was higher in women, sending twice as many to the emergency room during the pandemic than before. In fact, the alcohol-induced death rate for both sexes jumped 26% between 2019 and 2020, the first year of the pandemic. At first glance, the harms of marijuana appear equally worrisome. By using cannabis before the age of 25, young people can permanently damage their brains, wreaking havoc with their ability to learn, remember, solve problems and pay attention, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Daily marijuana use\u00a0raises the risk of stroke by 42%\u00a0and heart attack by 25%, even if there is no prior history of heart disease and the person has never smoked or vaped tobacco, according to a February 2024 study. Weed has\u00a0also been linked\u00a0to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation; myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle;\u00a0spasms of the heart\u2019s arteries\u00a0and a higher risk of\u00a0heart failure. However, many participants in those cardiovascular studies are smoking or vaping marijuana instead of ingesting it, said Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician and cannabis specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who authored \u201cSeeing\u00a0 Through the Smoke: A Cannabis Specialist Untangles the Truth About Marijuana.\u201d \u201cNo doctor recommends smoking marijuana, unless someone is in acute pain or has cancer and is on chemotherapy, when they might want the faster pain relief that comes from inhaling,\u201d Grinspoon said. Burning anything, whether it is tobacco or cannabis, creates\u00a0toxic compounds that are harmful to health when inhaled, said marijuana reseracher Dr. Beth Cohen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cCannabis smoke contains toxins, carcinogens, and particulate matter that have been linked to cancer, lung damage, and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cWith potential harms for any substance, we would expect to see a dose response. So, I\u2019m particularly concerned about the increases in daily or near daily use of cannabis.\u201d In fact, marijuana smoke may even be more harmful than tobacco because users hold the hot smoke in their lungs longer to maximize their high. A March 2021 study by Boyd found teens twice as likely to report \u201cwheezing or whistling\u201d in the chest after vaping marijuana than after smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes. \u201cNew data is beginning to show\u00a0that secondhand marijuana smoke may be just as dangerous as the primary smoke,\u201d Robert Page II, a\u00a0professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora, told CNN in a prior interview. However, there are many other options than inhaling marijuana smoke, Grinspoon said, including \u201cusing topicals like oils, lotions or a skin patch, or a suppository, or a tincture put under the tongue or in tea, or an edible. You don\u2019t have to smoke the cannabis.\u201d There is a problem, however. Research on edibles, such as baked goods, candies and beverages, and other methods of using cannabis is in its infancy. Whether there are longer-term impacts on human health than ingesting too much at one sitting and getting an uncomfortable high are unknown. \u201cWe do not yet know risks of daily use of edibles \u2014 thus, I cannot say whether the trend will end up as a healthy one,\u201d Boyd said in email. \u201cRegulation is uneven, products vary, and use is still illegal under federal law. We need better data!\u201d \u2018Like the Wild West\u2019 B lives in Georgia, a state where only medical marijuana is allowed. Therefore, B began using hemp-based gummies laced with delta-9, the most abundant form of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the part of the cannabis plant that creates a high. The synthetic form used in edibles is called delta-9 THC-O acetate. With the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which removed the hemp plant from the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s schedule of controlled substances, B can buy numerous brands of hemp gummies nearly everywhere, including her local gas station. \u201cFirst, I want to commend her for giving up alcohol,\u201d said Grinspoon, who is on the board of the advocacy group Doctors for Drug Policy Reform, which addresses cannabis, psychedelic and drug regulation in general. \u201cBut the hemp products she buys at the gas station or liquor store or the like are completely unregulated, sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids like delta-8, delta-9 and delta 10 that are pretty cheap to make. \u201cThat\u2019s really dangerous for a million reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in these new synthetic cannabinoids. You can get all kinds of industrial byproducts, a mixture of all kinds of synthetics, or an extremely high or low dose of the synthetic. It\u2019s like the Wild West out there.\u201d \u201cPotentially harmful chemicals \u201care needed to convert cannabinoids in hemp into synthetic products like delta 8, according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while manufacturing may \u201coccur in uncontrolled or unsanitary settings.\u201d Of the nearly 2,400 calls about delta 8 to the National Poison Center in one year from 2021 to 2022, 70% required a doctor\u2019s care and 8% were admitted, the FDA said. One child died. A June 2018 review of existing literature on synthetic versions of cannabis found they may cause more severe adverse effects, which could include breathing problems, a spike in blood pressure, chest pain and a rapidly beating heart, cognitive impairment. anxiety, agitation, suicidal ideation, and even death. \u201cIn and of itself, it\u2019s not good that more people are using cannabis,\u201d Grinspoon said. However, If they are going to use it to replace alcohol, he added, \u201cpeople should be buying marijuana and hemp cannabis products at a legal, regulated dispensary in a state where the product is tracked from beginning to end and tested along the way.\u201d If a person chooses to buy weed or hemp online or at a smoke shop, be sure to choose a product with a label that shows they have paid an independent outside company to assure the purity of their products, he said. \u201cMy other advice for people who want to use weed is to get educated,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t smoke it. Start at a very low dose and go slow. Don\u2019t use it before driving. And get it from a medical marijuana dispensary or well-regulated legal shop, as that is much safer than these hemp-derived products that are unregulated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/marijuana-versus-alcohol-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_male-birth-control-gel-wellness", "text": "After decades of false starts, researchers say they are finally making progress on a long-acting and reversible birth control option for men. The experimental product is a hormonal gel that men rub on their shoulders once daily. Over time, it blocks the production of sperm in the testes. The gel was developed by the National Institutes of Health and the nonprofit Population Council, and it takes much the same approach as birth control pills for women. It uses two hormones: nestorone, a progestin, and testosterone, the male sex hormone.\u00a0The nestorone suppresses the production of testosterone in the testes and, with it, the development of sperm. But testosterone serves many functions in the body: It is responsible for muscle maintenance and libido, for example, and men need some in their circulation to function normally. The gel replaces enough to keep them healthy but not so much that they make enough sperm to get someone pregnant. Researchers have been formulating and refining the dose and concentration of the gel since 2005.\u00a0In this latest test, which included more than 300 couples, they think they got it right. Normal sperm counts range from about 15 million to 200 million sperm per milliliter of semen, and studies have shown that sperm counts of less than 1 million per milliliter are low enough to prevent pregnancy. In a clinical trial, 86% of men achieved these low sperm counts by 15 weeks of using the gel.\u00a0For some, it worked even faster, suppressing sperm production within four to eight weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been just really excited by the results. The combination seems to provide better, faster suppression than we expected,\u201d said Diana Blithe, branch chief of the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who gave an update on the trial results this week at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Boston. Blithe declined to say whether there were any unintended pregnancies during the trial.\u00a0The researchers hope to have the final data published in a medical journal, and she said she didn\u2019t want to give away the results. \u201cI would say our expectation was that it would be similar to hormonal birth control pills. And I can just say that it\u2019s much, much better than that,\u201d she said. With typical use, birth control pills, rings and patches for women have failure rates of about 7%, meaning 7 women of every 100 who use the method for a year will get pregnant.\u00a0Condoms have a failure rate of about 13%. The gel also seems to have other advantages over female birth control. For example, if a woman misses a day or two of the pill, she can ovulate, making it more likely that she\u2019ll have an unintended pregnancy. With the gel, if a man\u2019s sperm production is fully suppressed and he misses a day or two of usage, his hormones would start to recover, but it takes about 8 to 10 weeks for a man\u2019s sperm count to recover to levels that would cause a pregnancy. Blithe says that in clinical trials, the researchers are not seeing the kind of mood swings and depression that women can experience with birth control pills, either. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s a small percentage who have mood swings that they don\u2019t like, but that\u2019s it\u2019s a relatively small number. And we\u2019ve actually been surprised at how few,\u201d she said. The World Health Organization tested injections that used a similar combination of hormones. The approach seemed effective, but the study enrollment was stopped early, in 2011, because the shots caused too many side effects, including serious depression. Blithe said that was because the hormones were clearing at different rates when injected.\u00a0With the gel, a concentration of hormones seems to build up in the skin and create a reservoir that releases more slowly. \u201cThat fluctuation is not really happening, so we\u2019re not creating ups and downs,\u201d she said. Matthew Trevi\u00f1o, 35, of Sacramento, California, participated in the study. He rubs a little gel on each shoulder first thing in the morning and says it\u2019s become as routine as showering and brushing his teeth. Aside from a little weight gain, he\u2019s had no complaints, he said.\u00a0If anything, his sex drive has increased. \u201cI\u2019ve only experienced increased libido,\u201d he told the \u201cUnfold\u201d podcast, which is produced by the University of California at Davis, which was also one of the study sites.  \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just lucking out, but I hope this is the case for the majority of participants. If it is, it\u2019s definitely going to change contraception as a whole.\u201d To participate in the study, couples had to be in committed relationships, and they signed on for a two-year commitment to the research. Men are warned that they could experience a number of side effects from the gel, including dry or oily skin, increased or decreased libido, hair growth or loss, and mood swings. For Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s partner, Emily Fletcher, 28, participating in the research meant giving up her own birth control \u2013 an IUD \u2013 and taking a big leap of faith right around the time the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. \u201cI was worried,\u201d she told \u201cUnfold.\u201d \u201cThere was still a thought in the back of my mind that \u2018maybe this will be an issue if the drug doesn\u2019t work, and I get pregnant.\u2019 \u201c Fletcher and Trevi\u00f1o, who are both researchers at UC Davis, ultimately felt like it was important to participate in the study. Trevi\u00f1o told the podcast he\u2019s been interested in a male contraceptive for a long time. To him, it doesn\u2019t feel fair that his partner has to shoulder the burden of birth control. Women release an egg only once a month, on average, whereas men produce about 1,000 sperm every second. \u201cMaybe the burden is on the wrong side,\u201d Trevi\u00f1o said. \u201cI kind of think it\u2019s unfair that it only lands on the women.\u201d  After men stop using the gel, their sperm count returns to normal levels within two or three months.\u00a0After the recovery phase of the trial, many of the participants went on to become fathers, proving that the method is fully reversible, Blithe said. That\u2019s a big step forward. Right now, the only birth control options for men are condoms, which have a high failure rate, and vasectomy, a surgical procedure that can be hard to reverse. The researchers have started a conversation with the US Food and Drug Administration about how to test the gel in a final definitive trial.\u00a0No male contraceptive method has ever made it this far, Blithe said. Normally, drugs that make it to this stage have to be compared head-to-head against a placebo. But testing a true placebo in research where the goal is to prevent pregnancy just wouldn\u2019t be ethical, said Dr. Christina Wang, a co-principal investigator on the trial, who specializes in male reproductive biology at the Lundquist Institute at UCLA\u2019s Harbor Medical Center. If the researchers get the FDA\u2019s nod for a trial, they hope to start the final phase of testing in 2025.\u00a0It will take another couple years, and Wang said they\u2019ll probably expand the study to more locations and recruit more couples.

The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET). The climate science mission, known as Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment, or PREFIRE, aims to improve scientists\u2019 understanding of how water vapor, clouds and other elements of Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap heat and keep it from radiating into space. The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors. The launch date for the second satellite will be announced shortly after the launch of the first satellite, NASA said. Once they\u2019re both launched, the two satellites will be in asynchronous near-polar orbits \u2014 passing over a specific spot at different times, looking at the same area within hours of each other. Doing so should allow the satellites to collect data about phenomena that take place on a short time scale and require frequent measurements \u2014 such as how the amount of cloud cover affects the temperature on Earth beneath it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/world/nasa-prefire-mission-launch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_08_23_health_avian-flu-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds.   There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called \u201cInfluenza A (H5N1),\u201d or the \u201cH5N1 virus.\u201d Diagnosis/Treatment Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces.  Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia.   The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans. Timeline Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa.

{"id": "2024_05_31_health_pig-kidney-transplant-removal", "text": "A genetically engineered pig kidney has been removed from a transplant patient\u00a0after it started losing function, according to a statement on Friday from NYU Langone Health. The patient, 54-year-old Lisa Pisano of New Jersey, is stable and has started dialysis, her doctors said. Pisano first received a mechanical heart pump, called an LVAD, on April 4 and then, on April 12, received a kidney and thymus gland from a gene-edited pig. Her case is the first reported organ transplant in a person with a mechanical heart pump, NYU Langone said, and it was the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living recipient and the first transplanted along with the thymus. The kidney had to be removed due \u201cunique challenges in managing both her cardiovascular health and kidney function\u201d 47 days after the transplant, NYU Langone Health said. There were multiple episodes where \u201cthe blood pressure she could generate from the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was not adequate to provide optimal perfusion to the kidney, causing cumulative reduction in her kidney function,\u201d said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, in the statement. \u201cOn balance, the kidney was no longer contributing enough to justify continuing the immunosuppression regimen.\u201d There were no signs of rejection after a recent biopsy of the kidney, according to Montgomery, but there was \u201csignificant injury to the kidney from episodes of insufficient blood flow.\u201d Pisano\u2019s heart pump is continuing to function. \u201cLisa is a pioneer and a hero in the effort to create a sustainable option for people waiting for an organ transplant. Her strength and bravery in the face of adversity inspires and drives us as we continue pursuing the hope and promise of xenotransplantation,\u201d said Montgomery. The need for organs far outstrips the number available.\u00a0Every day, 17 people die in the US waiting for an organ, and kidneys are in shortest supply.\u00a0According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, roughly 27,000 kidneys were transplanted in 2023, but nearly 89,000 people were on the waiting list for those organs. Experts say xenotransplants \u2013 transplants of animal organs into people \u2013 are crucial to solving the organ shortage. Gene editing makes precise edits to a pig\u2019s DNA to help keep the human body from recognizing the animal\u2019s organs as foreign and rejecting them. Pisano\u2019s doctors received permission from the US Food and Drug Administration to do the new procedures under its expanded-access or \u201ccompassionate use\u201d policies, which give terminally ill patients without other options access to investigational medical products outside of clinical trials. The kidney came from a pig genetically engineered to disrupt a gene responsible for the production of a sugar, called alpha-gal. It\u2019s found on the surface of animal cells and\u00a0can be recognized and attacked by human antibodies. The pig\u2019s thymus gland, which plays a role in immunity, was placed under the cover of the kidney in an attempt to help Pisano\u2019s immune system recognize the organ. While the kidney ultimately had to be removed from Pisano, Montgomery said the kidney would be studied for further insights and\ufeff stressed the importance of her contribution to the larger goal. \u201cLisa knew the world would learn a great deal through her altruism, and we will apply what she has taught us as we seek to make xenotransplantation a solution for the inadequate supply of human organs,\u201d Montgomery said in the statement.

{"id": "2024_06_06_health_mpox-vaccine-lgbtq-pride-month", "text": "As the LGBTQ+ community gears up for Pride celebrations this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hopes people will get more than just their rainbow gear and sunscreen ready. The agency is urging more people \u2013 particularly some gay and bisexual men \u2013 to get the mpox vaccine. The US Department of Health and Human Services plans to be at dozens of Pride and community events across the country to remind people that mpox is still a problem in the United States, but with vaccination, it doesn\u2019t have to be. Anyone can get sick with mpox, the painful and sometimes deadly disease formerly known as monkeypox. But in the global outbreak that started in 2022, certain members of the LGBTQ+ community are considered especially vulnerable. According to recent case reports, 90% of those who got mpox in the US during this outbreak who reported their sexual orientation were men who identified as gay or bisexual. And nearly all of those who got sick were unvaccinated. \u201cFor folks who have not yet gotten two doses of the Jynneos vaccine, it\u2019s really important for protecting them from this disease,\u201d said Alex Tuttle, an epidemiologist with the Poxvirus and Rabies Branch of the CDC. \u201cAbout a quarter of the population that we believe is at risk is currently vaccinated, so we really want to push that up, especially as we\u2019re going into these summer months where risk might be heightened a little bit.\u201d Mpox is a viral disease that can spread easily between people and from infected animals. It can spread through close contact such as touching, kissing or sex, as well as through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles, according to the World Health Organization. Symptoms include a fever, a painful rash, headache, muscle and back pain, low energy and enlarged lymph nodes. For decades, the disease had largely been found in Central and West Africa, but in the 2022 outbreak, cases also began spreading in Europe and North America. Case numbers in the US remain stable and are nowhere near as high as in 2022, when WHO declared the outbreak in North America and Europe a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But there were about 59 new cases a week reported in the US as of the end of April, according to a report published in May, which Tuttle co-authored. By comparison, at the height of the outbreak in 2022, there were about 3,000 new cases reported per week in the US. Another report published by the CDC Thursday looked at the kinds of patients who were seeking care at their local emergency room for mpox between June and December of last year. Of the 196 patients with rashes that doctors suspected could be mpox, three actually were infected. All three were gay or bisexual men who who engaged in sex with one or more partners that they initially met through dating apps. None had been vaccinated. Other studies have shown that the vaccine, which is now commercially available, can help keep people safe. A recent report confirmed that two doses of the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic are highly effective in preventing many mpox cases. If someone who was vaccinated did get sick, the vaccine can reduce the severity of symptoms. There have been scattered reports of infections among vaccinated people, including one cluster in May 2023 in Chicago, but these cases are rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases, the CDC said. Mpox isn\u2019t just an uncomfortable inconvenience. About 10% of people who got sick with mpox in the US in the latest outbreak were hospitalized, and five have died since October. People with compromised immune systems, particularly those with advanced HIV, have more severe infections, the CDC says. Another reason to get the vaccine is the threat of a deadlier version of the virus known as clade I, which carries a case fatality rate of up to 10%, compared with 0.1% to 3.6% for clade II, the version currently in circulation in the US. This version of the disease, the CDC said, is also more transmissible. It hasn\u2019t made its way to the US yet, but it is at the heart of an outbreak that the CDC is monitoring in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tuttle said the Jynneos vaccine should protect against clade I as well as clade II. \u201cThe measures that we have right now, both the vaccine and any of the antivirals, are expected to work on both clade I and clade II of the virus, should it come here,\u201d Tuttle said. Brian Hujdich, executive director of the\u00a0National Coalition for LGBT Health, said his organization and others will continue to work hard to encourage mpox vaccination. \u201cWith all the Pride events over the summer and just being summertime, there\u2019s going to be more interaction. And we\u2019ve seen already that there has been an increase in Virginia and in New York City and in some other locations,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it might not be in numbers that get a lot of attention, but even a small increase can be a preamble to an outbreak.\u201d The CDC is working with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, local organizations and community health partners on what it calls the Summer of Pride initiative, which includes a campaign to remind people that although mpox case numbers have declined significantly, the threat has not disappeared. \u201cI do think some people are surprised that it is still a problem,\u201d said Adrianna Boulin, director of racial equity, social justice and community engagement at Fenway Health, an organization that advocates for and delivers equitable care focused on the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cLast year, we had such a robust program of getting education and information out to people, and we saw mpox rates decline initially, so everyone is surprised, like \u2018wow, this is still an issue.\u2019 It\u2019s important for everyone to know about it, because it can impact all of us.\u201d Boulin, who is also president of Boston Pride of the People, the group that puts on that city\u2019s Pride parade and celebrations on June 8, said there is a health corner at the festival where a number of organizations will talk about the programs and services they offer, including information about the mpox vaccine. Fenway had been running mpox vaccination clinics when the outbreak started, but as the number of cases declined, fewer people were showing up, so it now offers the vaccine by appointment only. Across the country, doses have become much more readily available than early in the outbreak, when people had to stand in long lines at special clinics. Now, pharmacies and many regular medical providers have the vaccine. In addition to the big Pride festival, Fenway Health plans to be at several other LGBTQ events, Boulin said, and at each, workers will talk about mpox. \u201cPeople are excited that they\u2019re outside at these events and they\u2019re motivated, they\u2019re open, they\u2019re listening, and so those are all recipes for really getting information out to folks that they need to help their health,\u201d Boulin said. Key West Pride, which is one of the first of the year and runs from from June 5 to 9, said it will also have a visible health organization presence that will offer educational materials at its Street Fair/Dance Party about mpox and the benefits of the mpox vaccine. The local department of health also provides resources on mpox and vaccination, he said. Hujdich said an important message that health organizations will want to emphasize is that mpox vaccines provide not only protection but real peace of mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be worried about being in contact with people if you\u2019ve been vaccinated,\u201d Hujdich said, \u201cSo it gives you the freedom to enjoy and be proud during Pride.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/mpox-vaccine-lgbtq-pride-month/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_h5n1-bird-flu-in-wastewater", "text": "Results from recent wastewater testing across the US suggests that H5N1 bird flu may not be as widespread as first feared. The data, released Monday by the nonprofit WastewaterSCAN network, showed detections of the H5 protein portion of the flu virus in sewage from 14 water treatment plants in five states, mostly in Texas and Michigan, suggesting that an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle may largely be confined to states that have already been identified as having affected herds. \u201cWe\u2019re not detecting H5 everywhere. We\u2019re only detecting it in certain locations,\u201d said Dr. Alexandria Boehm, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. The test for H5 was run in 190 monitoring sites across the US over the past two weeks.\u00a0Nine states are not enrolled in the WastewaterSCAN network and so are not included in the surveillance: South Carolina, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. There were detections in two states where no affected dairy herds have been identified: Iowa and Minnesota.\u00a0However, both states have seen recent outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry. Boehm explained that the researchers aren\u2019t sure exactly what the sources of H5 in wastewater may be. It could be from permitted discharges of unused or leftover raw milk to wastewater treatment plants where the samples are collected. \u201cIn the case of Amarillo in Texas, for example, they had a dairy processing plant that was making processed dairy products, and their waste stream discharges into the wastewater treatment plant because milk, raw milk from the local area, was coming into that plant with H5N1,\u201d Boehm said. That may not be the source in all areas, however.\u00a0There\u2019s a chance the H5 detections might also be due to human infections or from less-likely sources such as infected wild birds that might contaminate wastewater or stormwater runoff that picks up H5N1 virus on its way into sewers, perhaps from bird droppings, Boehm said. People shouldn\u2019t be unduly alarmed if H5 appears in a nearby sewer system, Boehm said. \u201cThe way that we\u2019re thinking about it is that wastewater is providing an additional tool to the nation\u201d to keep eyes on the virus amid the outbreak, Boehm said. Experts say such tools are needed because testing of cattle has been limited, and the farm workers who are most at risk of catching the virus from infected cattle often live on minimal incomes and might not want to be tested if it means they could miss days of work without pay. As of Tuesday, 81 dairy herds with infected cows have been identified across nine states.\u00a0States reporting the highest numbers of affected herds are Michigan, Idaho and Texas, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The USDA issued an order in late April requiring dairy cattle to test negative for H5N1 before they can be transported across state lines, but many farmers have been reluctant to let government officials into their farms to conduct further surveillance for the virus. Dr. Eric Deeble, deputy assistant secretary for the USDA, said last week that more than 17,000 tests for H5N1 flu had been run on cattle, with the caveat that\u00a0some of the samples were pooled, so one test may represent more than one cow. But when asked to estimate whether one thousand, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of cows had been affected, Deeble said he could not, underscoring the large degree of uncertainty involved in understanding the scope of the outbreak. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring for human infections through a representative network of clinics that submit test results for respiratory viruses to the agency and through public health laboratories.\u00a0It\u2019s also hoping to conduct an epidemiological study to better understand the risk of transmission between animals and humans on farms. In a study published May 29, the CDC estimated that there was a 72% to 77% chance that current surveillance would detect one human case of H5N1 in an emergency room or urgent care clinic monthly, provided the person had symptoms similar in severity to a case of seasonal flu, and there were at least 100 cases of H5N1 in the population. \u201cWhile these findings indicate that existing flu surveillance systems are likely to detect at least one novel influenza case before the virus has spread widely, CDC is asking that health care providers remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of influenza virus infection over the summer and maintain high rates of testing,\u201d the agency said in a news release.\u00a0It also encouraged providers to forward any specimens that test positive for influenza A to public health laboratories for additional testing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/h5n1-bird-flu-in-wastewater/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_laser-hair-removal-devices-wellness", "text": "With hotter weather often comes more skin showing\u2014and for many that means increased sense of pressure to get rid of body hair. Diet culture already makes summer a tricky time, with advertisements and headlines about celebrities emphasizing the importance of a \u201cbikini body.\u201d Adding a social expectation to remove hair from legs, underarms and bikini area can make it the season of body consciousness. If you want that hair gone, there are a lot of options to address the hair: laser, at home devices, waxing, creams and shaving, said Dr. Deirdre Hooper, cofounder of Audubon Dermatology in New Orleans. While they are all generally safe, she noted that there are some things to consider if you choose to use one of these methods. Laser hair removal The most effective way to get rid of hair in an area long-term is to get laser hair removal procedures in a practitioner\u2019s office, said Dr. Suzanne Kilmer, the founder and director of the Laser & Skin Surgery Center of Northern California and clinical professor at the University of California, Davis Medical Center in Davis, California. \u201cA laser is the most effective way to remove hair because it uses a particular wavelength of light that\u2019s going to perfectly target your hair based on your hair color and your skin color,\u201d Hooper said. Laser hair removal treatments are offered both at dermatologists\u2019 offices and places like medical spas. The safest bet is to have the procedure one in the office \u2013 especially for darker skin tones, Hopper said. \u201cThe darker your skin type, the more you really need to vet who is doing the treatments,\u201d Kilmer said. Only certain wavelengths can be used on darker skin types, and a cooling system is important to get effective hair removal without burn, she added. \u201cIf you have dark skin, don\u2019t even try going to (an inexpensive medical spa) because I get all the burns from those places,\u201d Kilmer said. At home devices You might have seen advertisements all over your social media pop up for devices marketed to be like at home laser hair removal. These tools aren\u2019t new however, Hooper said. They have been around for more than a decade, and they aren\u2019t really laser treatment, she said. Whereas lasers are a targeted beam, at home devices use an intense pulsed light (IPL) of a wide range of wavelengths to work on different hair types and skin types, Hooper added. At home devices are much less expensive than office treatments, generally safe and usually do reduce the hair in that area, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get good results with an at home IPL \u2013 probably 60% to 75% of what you could get with an in-office laser procedure \u2013 and it\u2019s done at your convenience at a lower cost,\u201d she said. However, you may be spending your money on the device only to realize that you want a more effective treatment, Kilmer said. \u201cThey may get temporary hair removal, but it\u2019s very difficult to get good permanent hair removal,\u201d she said. There is also a big safety caveat, Hooper added. The IPL devices target pigment, not hair necessarily. If you have darker toned skin or have a tan, you are at a greater risk for the device burning your skin, she added. \u201cI have treated three of these (burns) this spring already in my office,\u201d Hooper said. Hooper suggests consulting with your dermatologist about if your skin is a good candidate for IPL devices, using them when you haven\u2019t had recent sun exposure, testing on small areas first, and keeping in mind that different parts of your body will have different levels of pigment. Waxing, creams and shaving Waxing and shaving are time honored methods of hair removal, Hooper said. The thing to keep in mind if you go the waxing route with your hair removal is that as hair grows back and tries to pop through the skin, those with coarser and curlier hair are more likely to get in grown hairs, she added. Using a cream dissolves the hair, leaving it less stubby and not quite as noticeable, Kilmer said. But they can be irritating for the skin. Like waxing and creams, shaving isn\u2019t going to stop your hair from growing back \u2013 but contrary to a popular myth, it doesn\u2019t make you grow more hair either, Hooper said. It is common for skin to get more irritated in the summer if you are shaving more frequently, she added. No matter what body parts you are shaving, Hooper recommends doing it at the end of your shower or bath when the hair and skin have had some time to be exposed to water. And a razor with few blades is better, because there is less of a chance of micro nicks in your skin. \u201cActually, some of the less snazzy razors that only have two or three blades are less irritating,\u201d she said. Immediately after, you can use lotion to moisturize the skin. Just be sure it doesn\u2019t have fragrance, which can be irritating, Hooper said. If you do get irritation when the hair starts to come back, use aloe vera for redness and over the counter cortisol cream to calm the irritation, she said. But if you are looking for less hair, less ingrown hair and less maintenance, your best bet is going to be laser hair removal first with the at home devices as a runner up, Hooper said. \u201cTry to find a way to see someone who can do a laser on you who is safe and knows about the risks associated with laser \u2013 ideally a board-certified dermatologist,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/laser-hair-removal-devices-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Two teams of scientists have discovered a theoretically habitable planet, smaller than Earth but bigger than Venus, orbiting a small star about 40 light-years away. The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said. But though the exoplanet could potentially be habitable for humans and is relatively \u201cnear\u201d our solar system in astronomical terms, it is unlikely that anyone will visit there soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not reachable, it\u2019s 12 parsecs away,\u201d said Palethorpe, adding that it would take about 225,000 years to reach Gliese 12b with the fastest spacecraft that currently exist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2013_07_02_health_tuberculosis-tb-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at Tuberculosis (also known as TB), an infection, caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that usually affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain.  About TB Two types of TB exist - Latent TB infection (non-infectious) and TB disease (infectious). Latent TB infection:- A person infected with latent TB shows no symptoms and may not feel sick.- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.- It is not possible to spread TB bacteria from the infected person to others.- Individuals with a latent TB infection may never develop the disease, as bacteria remains dormant. In other cases, especially involving people with a weak immune system, the bacteria may become active and cause TB disease.- Treatment is required to ensure the infected person does not develop active TB disease but in some cases preventative treatment may not be an option. - Without treatment, about 5-10% of individuals infected with latent TB will develop the disease.  TB disease:- Symptoms of TB of the lungs include coughing up blood and chest pain.- Other symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills and fatigue.- It is possible to spread TB bacteria from the infected person to others.- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.- Treatment typically involves a combination of drugs taken for six months. - Persons with a weak immune system, such as those with HIV or diabetes, are more prone to catching TB disease.  Facts TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings. Germs can stay in the air for hours.  In 2022, about 10.6 million people worldwide became ill with TB, and 1.3 million died (including 167,000 with HIV). In 2022, a total of 8,331 new TB cases were reported in the United States. Up to 13 million people in the United States are living with latent TB. Timeline 1546 - Italian scientist Girolamo Fracastoro hypothesizes that TB is contagious.  1679 - Dutch scientist Francis Sylvius details the impact of TB on patients.  1865 - French military doctor Jean-Antoine Villemin proves the illness can transmit from human to animal or from animal to animal.  1882 - German doctor Robert Koch identifies the bacterial strain as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 1800s - Tuberculosis causes as much as one-quarter of all deaths in Europe during the 19th century. Famous people who die from tuberculosis include John Keats, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte, Anton Chekhov and Franz Kafka.   1921 - After years of trials involving animal testing, French bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin successfully administer a vaccine called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in an infant whose mother died of TB. 1930 - In Germany, more than 70 infants who received the BCG vaccine die of TB. It is later concluded that the vaccine was contaminated in the lab.  1944 - Microbiologist Selman A. Waksman and his associates at Rutgers University report the discovery of a new antibiotic called streptomycin. 1944 - Physicians H. Corwin Hinshaw, Karl H. Pfuetze and William H. Feldman successfully use streptomycin to treat a patient with TB. 1952 - A scientific journal publishes studies heralding the success of a breakthrough treatment called isoniazid.   1985-1992 - Tuberculosis makes a resurgence. Scientists attribute this to several factors, including the spread of HIV.  1994 - The World Health Organization declares tuberculosis a global emergency.  1995 - The WHO launches Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course (DOTS). It is a treatment plan containing five components, including standardized recording and reporting.   2008 - The WHO reports the highest rates of MDR-TB worldwide.  December 8, 2010 - The WHO endorses a new test that diagnoses tuberculosis within hours instead of months. 2018 - A promising new vaccine called M72/AS01E is shown to be effective in many people already infected with TB.  2021 - A study concludes that a four-month multidrug regimen to treat TB is as effective as a six-month regimen.

{"id": "2024_05_30_health_bird-flu-michigan-third-human-case", "text": "A\u00a0third person in the US\u00a0has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle, the\u00a0Michigan Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0said Thursday.\u00a0This is the second human case reported in the state and the fourth ever in the US. This time, in addition to some of the eye symptoms seen with previous H5N1 cases, the farmworker\u00a0reported a cough and other respiratory symptoms\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0more typical of human influenza infections, the health department said. \u201cThis individual had respiratory symptoms, including a cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes,\u201d Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a briefing Thursday. \u201cWhat the respiratory symptoms tell us, more than anything, is that this virus, like many viruses, can present in more than one way, and for that reason, we should remain alert, not be alarmed,\u201d he added. Experts said that the addition of respiratory symptoms doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the virus has become more dangerous or that it may transmit more easily from person to person.\u00a0Instead, they say, the person probably developed lung symptoms because of the route of infection, perhaps by breathing in infectious aerosols in the milking parlor instead of rubbing their eyes with contaminated hands. \u201cWith the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye. With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow,\u201d Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief\u00a0medical\u00a0executive for Michigan, said in a news release. \u201cNeither individual was wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.\u201d About 220 people are being monitored in Michigan because of potential exposure to the virus, Shah said. Michigan, the state with the highest number of dairy herds reported to be infected, is also beginning to conduct blood testing to see how many workers may have antibodies to the H5N1 virus, which would reflect past infections or exposures. The CDC agreed that the risk to the general public remains low. But this case highlights the elevated risk to those who work with infected animals. The CDC has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. \u201cPreviously, we focused on the importance of eye protection, given the conjunctivitis in the first two cases, but this case also underscores the importance of barrier protection, things like masks and other forms of protection for dairy workers, particularly those who are working with affected cows,\u201d Shah said. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them. This is the third human infection known to be caused by this highly pathogenic form of avian influenza that\u2019s currently infecting dairy cattle in the US. None of the three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission. The other two cases involved eye infections, or conjunctivitis. The most recent worker had some mild eye symptoms but was not diagnosed with conjunctivitis. The person had direct contact with infected cattle\u00a0and notified local health officials that they were feeling sick.\u00a0Their symptoms are described as mild. The patient has been given the antiviral medication oseltamivir, the same active ingredient as Tamiflu, and they are isolating at home. Their family members have not developed symptoms, but they have also been offered antiviral medication as a precaution. None of the other workers at the dairy farm has gotten sick, and they are being monitored, the CDC said. \u201cGiven the high magnitude of interactions between people and dairy cows as well as with contaminated milking equipment, it is unsurprising that there are more human infections,\u201d said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University who is studying how the virus is transmitting in dairy barns. \u201cEvery time the virus is able to replicate in a person, there is the potential for the virus to adapt to humans and gain molecular features for replication in the respiratory tract and to spread person-to-person,\u201d Lakdawala said. Flu viruses are classified by two of the proteins that sit on their outer envelopes: H, or hemagglutinin, proteins and N, neuraminidase, proteins. CDC testing has confirmed that this third person carries a flu virus with an H5 protein, and the agency will do further sequencing to determine whether the N portion of the virus is N1, as is suspected. It expects to have those results in the next few days. The CDC confirmed Wednesday night that the person had an H5 influenza infection and forwarded the results to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that it was moving forward with a plan to repackage 4.8 million doses of a vaccine against H5N1 that is stored in bulk form in the Strategic National Stockpile. The bulk supplies would be put into multidose vials so they could be distributed and administered more easily. Officials said Thursday that before the vaccine would be given, it would need to go through certain regulatory steps. They also said there\u2019s not currently a plan to offer or recommend the doses to any specific  group of people. The fill-and-finish process to repackage the vaccines will take at least a couple of months, officials said in the news briefing. In the meantime, Michigan\u2019s health department is advising people working on poultry or dairy farms to get a seasonal flu vaccine. \u201cIt will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu viruses,\u201d the department said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/health/bird-flu-michigan-third-human-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_health_juul-vaping-products-fda", "text": "The US Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday it had rescinded marketing denial orders\u00a0for vaping products from Juul Labs Inc., although it has not yet decided whether the products will ultimately stay on the market. Juul said Thursday its products will remain on the market during scientific review. On Thursday, the FDA said court decisions since then \u201cestablish new case law and inform the FDA\u2019s approach to product review to maintain the agency\u2019s commitment to issuing final decisions that are appropriate on both the scientific merits and the law.\u201d In 2022, the FDA\u00a0issued a marketing ban on Juul products, including devices and tobacco and menthol-flavored pods. The marketing denial order was stayed weeks later as \u201cscientific issues warranted additional review,\u201d but had not been rescinded. Juul appealed the decision and the products stayed on store shelves pending the appeal. Recission of the marketing ban \u201cis not an authorization or a denial and does not indicate whether the applications are likely to be authorized or denied,\u201d the FDA said Thursday. \u201cThe agency\u2019s continued review does not alter the fact that all e-cigarette products, including those made by JUUL, are required by law to have FDA authorization to be legally marketed.\u201d As of the end of May, the FDA says it has only authorized 23 e-cigarette products and devices after the products have undergone what the FDA says is \u201crigorous scientific review\u201d that includes toxicologic assessments. To get the green light, the products must also be appropriate by the FDA\u2019s product standard. In a statement, Juul said it\u00a0looks forward to \u201cre-engaging with the agency on a science- and evidence-based process to pursue a marketing authorization for JUUL products.\u201d The American Lung Association said on Thursday that it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the FDA\u2019s decision. \u201cThe Lung Association is deeply troubled that the marketing denial orders for Juul have been rescinded and urge FDA to issue marketing denial orders for all of its products. Juul is largely responsible for the youth e-cigarette epidemic from 2017-2019. These products and its manufacturer clearly do not meet the standard for protecting the public health. FDA must\u00a0follow the law and not permit any Juul product or other tobacco product to be sold in the U.S. prior to it receiving a premarket authorization,\u201d said Erika Sward, the association\u2019s assistant vice president of nationwide advocacy, in a statement. Juul has remained one of the most popular e-cigarette products on the market and are also among the most popular with young people. For the past decade, the FDA and US Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s annual National Youth Tobacco Survey has found that in general e-cigarettes are the most popular tobacco products among young people. In a statement, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids cited the popularity of the brand and said, \u201cthe FDA\u2019s continuing delays in reviewing Juul\u2019s marketing applications are unacceptable and harmful to America\u2019s kids.\u201d \u201cThe FDA should swiftly finish its review and again deny marketing applications for all Juul products given Juul\u2019s primary role in causing the youth e-cigarette epidemic and the continuing popularity of Juul\u2019s products among youth,\u201d Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids CEO and president Yolonda Richardson said in part in the statement. \u201cThere is no question that Juul fueled this epidemic by introducing a sleek, easy-to-hide product that was sold in appealing flavors including menthol, marketed in ways that appeal to kids, and delivered massive doses of nicotine that can quickly addict kids. Juul\u2019s history shows that its products are highly appealing to kids, and it cannot be trusted to act responsibly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/juul-vaping-products-fda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_health_mdma-ptsd-fda-advisers", "text": "A federal advisory committee on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly against of the use of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. The novel treatment has the potential to transform a field with significant need, but the committee had concerns about the integrity of the particular trials up for review. After hearing presentations from the US Food and Drug Administration, treatment sponsor Lykos Therapeutics and members of the public, the independent committee voted on recommendations to be made to the FDA. Two of the 11 committee members said that they considered the treatment effective, while nine said that it was not. Only one committee member said that the benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks as presented, but the other 10 voted that they did not. This was the first time FDA advisers have considered a psychedelic drug for\u00a0medical\u00a0use. MDMA is known as an entactogen, a class of psychoactive drugs that produce experiences of emotional communion, relatedness and emotional openness. It\u2019s currently classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and changing this status would be a marked shift. The FDA has final say on whether the treatment is formally approved. The agency often follows recommendations from its independent advisory committees but does not have to do so. About 5% of adults in the United States \u2013 about 13 million people \u2013 experience PTSD in any given year, according\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the National Center for PTSD. But current treatment options \u2013 including antidepressants and some specialized forms of cognitive behavioral therapy \u2013 are limited in their scope and effectiveness, with few alternatives available to help those don\u2019t respond well to them. At Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Lykos Therapeutics presented positive data from two late-stage clinical trials that used MDMA in combination with therapy to treat PTSD. Many of the FDA advisory committee members applauded the exploration of this line of treatment and lauded the potential it holds, but several shortcomings \u2013 notably regarding bias in efficacy data and missing information about safety \u2013 raised critical doubts. About 200 people participated in the Lykos trials, with a treatment program that involved three eight-hour sessions where participants took MDMA in the presence of two therapists. The MDMA sessions were spaced about a month apart, along with additional therapy sessions. \u201cParticipants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms,\u201d the FDA wrote in a briefing document about the studies. But the agency also noted that \u201cseveral factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment for this application,\u201d posing key questions for the members of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee to consider. The studies were designed to be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the MDMA treatment and who didn\u2019t. This type of study is considered the gold standard because it helps reduce bias in results by minimizing the effects of external factors. But MDMA\u2019s hallucinogenic effects have \u201cprofound alterations\u201d on a person\u2019s state of being, and the vast majority of participants knew which group they were in simply by the nature of their experience. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that conducts independent reviews of treatments, tests and procedures, also cited \u201csubstantial concerns about the validity of the results\u201d of the Lykos trials in a report published in March. Those concerns centered around bias, both from the unblinding of the trial and from other influences on patient perspectives. In addition to blurry data on efficacy, there were concerns about safety data, the FDA said. MDMA is known to have potential for abuse, but the FDA cautions that the research did not appropriately assess this as an adverse event in the context of the treatment program. Reports from illicit use of MDMA suggest that it may pose risks to both heart and liver health. The phase III clinical trials showed \u201csignificant increases in both blood pressure and pulse\u201d among participants, the FDA said, but certain related assessments were incomplete. And liver health was assessed only in small groups from earlier phases of the clinical trials. The unique factors of this type of treatment and the complexity of the considerations at hand were acknowledged throughout the committee meeting. \u201cI absolutely agree that we need new and better treatments for PTSD, especially in the somatic treatment space. However, I also note that premature introduction of a treatment can actually stifle development and stifle implementation and lead to premature adoption of treatments that are either not completely known to be safe not fully effective or not being used at their optimal efficacy,\u201d said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer, deputy director for research at the National Center for PTSD. As a member of the advisory committee, he voted against the treatment. \u201cI think this is a really exciting treatment. I\u2019m really encouraged by the results to date, but I feel that both from an efficacy and a safety standpoint it is still premature.\u201d Dr. Walter Dunn, a staff psychiatrist at the Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California Los Angeles, was the only committee member to vote in favor of the treatment on both questions of efficacy and the balance of risks and benefits. His confidence in the risk-benefit analysis was low, he said; psychotherapy is an integral component of this treatment program, and it could be \u201cthe greatest strength of the treatment\u201d but \u201calso its greatest liability\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s not within the FDA\u2019s scope to regulate, he said. And specific guardrails the FDA outlined to be put in place with approval of the treatment to protect patient safety were incomplete. \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m voting yes because I\u2019m putting on my clinician hat,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWorking in the VA, as a former servicemember myself, I have colleagues who deployed who have PTSD, and this has the potential to make a to make a difference. Now, that\u2019s not without its risks.\u201d The questions are all familiar to Lykos, and the company has had conversations with the FDA throughout its research, CEO Amy Emerson told CNN before the meeting. \ufeffThe advisory committee meeting is the \u201cnext big milestone\u201d in the process and an opportunity to gather even more information, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just such an urgent patient need for new treatment options, and we really use that as our guiding light as we develop MDMA-assisted therapy,\u201d she said. \u201cAll along, we\u2019ve been really committed to safety, and that will always be top of mind.\u201d There is growing interest and support to explore the use of psychedelics as therapeutics. Along with MDMA, drugs like ketamine and psilocybin mushrooms are being studied in clinical trials to treat a variety of mental health disorders. \u201cDepression, PTSD, eating disorders \u2013 they\u2019re all different. You can\u2019t just lump these together and say, \u2018Psychedelics are good for this,\u2019\u201d Emerson said. \u201cYou need to study it, you need to look at the safety and efficacy profiles of each, and we have to be careful to not treat these things as panaceas or like a magic bullet.\u201d The Lykos treatment is the first to reach this point in the process, and the way the FDA and its advisory board proceed could set key precedents. \u201cIt\u2019s an early but exciting moment. The promise is there, the potential is there, and we just have to find out through careful study and time how impactful these medications will be,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Many questions remain about the specific conditions needed to achieve effective use of this treatment, and even the most supportive experts caution about\u00a0the limitations of the treatment and recommend additional research. \u201cI hope that the drug gets approved but in a way where it can be made available and monitored in a responsible manner,\u201d said Dr. Rachel Yehuda, director of the Center for Psychedelic Psychotherapy and Trauma Research at Mount Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee. \u201cMy fear would be that we stop being curious, we stop asking the right questions, we stop trying to figure out mechanisms of action, we stop trying to perfect and scale like we do with any other treatment.\u201d It\u2019s critical to protect vulnerable populations who may benefit from this treatment, experts say. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that psychedelics are probably uniquely susceptible to the blurring of the boundaries between strictly applied medical treatments that are provided by experienced clinicians under very well-monitored circumstances versus recreational use, so there\u2019s a great interest in trying to get this as right as possible,\u201d said Dr. Jon Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s research council and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \u201cThe last thing you want is for a promising treatment for a devastating condition to go off the rails in an unbounded, unmonitored kind of use.\u201d Also, the trials have excluded people who may be most vulnerable to substantial side effects of MDMA, such as adolescents and those with coinciding conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and it\u2019s important to continue gathering data to understand how the treatment works in these populations, he said. \u201cAny\u00a0FDA\u00a0approval\u00a0of\u00a0MDMA\u00a0must\u00a0be\u00a0accompanied\u00a0by rigorous regulations, strict prescribing and dispensing controls, comprehensive patient education, and ongoing monitoring and surveillance systems,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association wrote in a letter to the FDA\u2019s advisory committee. In addition to potentially setting a precedent in mental health treatment, the particular treatment program that Lykos has studied is \u201clabor-intensive,\u201d Yehuda said. It requires a significant amount of investment \u2013 both logistically and emotionally \u2013 from participants and providers, which is challenged by the shortage of mental health professionals in the US. \u201cWe never had a situation where something that the government had deemed harmful gets a 180 and becomes an approved treatment for a condition,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, the question is, \u2018Are we going to be able to use the moment in a way that really furthers the mental health of our population?\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/mdma-ptsd-fda-advisers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}

In an open letter posted to the agency\u2019s website on Thursday,\u00a0it\u00a0urged states to\u00a0warn the public more strongly about the dangers of raw milk\u00a0and to\u00a0test\u00a0herds that produce it for sale. The\u00a0FDA\u00a0also recommended that states use their regulatory authorities to stop the sale of raw milk\u00a0within the state or\u00a0in areas where dairy herds have tested positive. On Thursday, Minnesota became the 10th\u00a0state\u00a0to report infected herds.\u00a0According to the US Department of Agriculture, 82 herds in the US have tested positive for the H5N1 virus. The FDA doesn\u2019t allow the sale of raw milk across state lines, but several states allow the sale of raw milk for human consumption within their borders, with varying requirements. Some states allow raw milk to be sold as pet food labeled \u201cnot for human consumption,\u201d\u00a0understanding that what people do with the milk in their own homes is up to them. Raw milk\u00a0can carry high levels of the H5N1 bird flu virus because the virus appears to infect cows through their udders.\u00a0It is not yet known whether people can get bird flu by drinking milk contaminated with the virus.\u00a0 However, cats living on farms with infected cows have died after consuming unpasteurized milk, and three\u00a0dairy\u00a0workers exposed to raw milk have been infected. \u201cGiven the current and potential future risks that HPAI H5N1 virus poses to our nation\u2019s public health, as well as the health of our nation\u2019s food-producing animals and wildlife, it is important to work together to minimize the additional exposure of humans and other animal species,\u201d wrote Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, who is leading the agency\u2019s H5N1 response. Beyond bird flu, the FDA says health risks of raw milk include illness, miscarriages, stillbirths, kidney failure and death. In addition to stronger warnings about the dangers of consuming raw milk, the FDA is asking states to monitor dairy cattle herds for signs of illness that would indicate infection with H5N1 bird flu virus and tell farms to safely discard milk from sick cows. Any raw milk or raw milk products from exposed cattle that are fed to calves or any other animals should be heat-treated or pasteurized, the FDA said. The FDA is also calling on states to implement surveillance testing for the presence of H5N1 virus in dairy herds that might be engaged in producing raw milk and to report their results to\u00a0state and federal regulatory agencies. The agency said it would soon share new research and data on both bird flu virus in raw milk and raw milk products.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/health/with-bird-flu-infecting-dairy-cattle-fda-asks-some-states-to-curb-sales-of-raw-milk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_health_meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness", "text": "Twenty years ago, Dan Harris appeared to have it all. He had joined ABC News in 2000 by age 29, and had covered the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, in addition to other historic events around the world. What viewers didn\u2019t see was the tumult behind the scenes: Harris experiencing depression from his time as a war correspondent and anxiety from working in a high-pressure industry. He tried to stay afloat by using cocaine, ecstasy and prescription sleeping pills. It would all come crashing down on June 7, 2004, when Harris had to sub for anchor Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. While reporting news updates, he had a nationally televised panic attack that \u201cwas the direct result of an extended run of mindlessness, a period of time during which I was focused on advancement and adventure, to the detriment of pretty much everything else,\u201d Harris wrote in his 2014 book, \u201c10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works.\u201d But this moment, though frightening, would be the catalyst for a journey that propelled him from anguish, drug abuse and being a meditation skeptic to mindfulness \u2014 and to a total occupational overhaul. Now, his career focus is meditation and happiness, and helping others struggling with the thought traps keeping them from a more mindful life. It did take a few years for him to get to meditation, after trying out different psychiatrists and therapy. Before Harris began meditating in summer 2009, \u201cI had no real understanding of it except for a baseline reflexive hostility,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was I raised by atheists, but they were also recovering hippies. They had forced me to do yoga and go to granola health food stores, and we did a lot of camping, and I just found all that sh*t very annoying.\u201d Raised by scientists, Harris was convinced by seeing the scientific research on meditation \u2014 studies that showed meditation can lower blood pressure, boost your immune system, and alleviate anxiety and depression. A regular practice can also rewire brain regions associated with stress, focus, compassion and self-awareness, science has shown. He also credits the work of Dr. Mark Epstein, a psychiatrist and Buddhist then in private practice in Manhattan, and Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, another scientist who teaches a secularized form of Buddhist meditation and is a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Masschusetts Medical School. (In the preface of the recently released 10th anniversary edition of his book, Harris acknowledges how the focus on Western scientists and gurus devalues the contributions of Asian and Asian American people, and how he has been complicit and tried to rectify these mistakes.) Harris is now a meditation expert himself. \u201cI find that I just am less yanked around by my urges and thoughts and emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I screw up, I\u2019m quicker to apologize. I\u2019m more focused on the baseline level of calm that I didn\u2019t have before.\u201d When it comes to the benefits, perfection isn\u2019t one of them, he noted. \u201cI retain the capacity to be a schmuck,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s more like you can get better with a little bit of work over time. And that work will build on itself \u2014 the 10% compounds annually.\u201d \u00a0 Harris tackled some common barriers to trying meditation for CNN and suggested how you can overcome them. Change \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll try\u2019 One of the most common excuses people have for not meditating is thinking they won\u2019t be able to focus or sit still long enough. But Harris contends that if you notice you\u2019re getting distracted while meditating, that\u2019s actually \u201cproof that you\u2019re doing it right.\u201d Distractibility is an evolutionarily beneficial aspect of the human condition, as it keeps us safe, he added. \u201cClearing your mind is impossible unless you\u2019re enlightened, or you have died.\u201d Therefore, the active \u201cseeing of the distraction is proof of success,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause what you want over time in meditation is to understand how the mind works.\u201d \u201cThe whole point of meditation is not to stop thinking \u2014 it\u2019s to focus on one thing, usually the breath coming in and going out. And then every time you get distracted, you start again and again and again,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat starting over is like a bicep curl for your brain, and that\u2019s the mechanism by which the brain changes.\u201d Getting familiar with the fact that you\u2019re thinking is key for developing the skill of recognizing thoughts or feelings and intentionally choosing what to do about them, rather than unconsciously and automatically reacting. It\u2019s similar to when you\u2019re exercising for the first time, and the first couple weeks might be challenging, Harris said. Then it can get easier, but it\u2019s not supposed to be effortless. Others feel they can\u2019t find the time or don\u2019t know where to start. But when you want to form a habit, the best move is to start small, Harris said. Start at one minute of meditation daily for a couple weeks before increasing your time, he recommends. Over time, you might notice yourself moving from extrinsic motivation \u2014 such as being advised to do it or reading the research on it \u2014 to the intrinsic motivation that helps you maintain the habit because you feel it\u2019s helping you. There are many free or inexpensive resources that can help you get started, such as those on apps, YouTube or Harris\u2019 own website, or in books, he said. And some cities have meditation or mindfulness centers where you can learn from a teacher and practice with others \u2014 another great way to maintain a habit since it keeps you accountable. The fear of being well Some people are also of the mindset that \u201cthe only way to survive is to be, like, constantly neurotic\u201d lest they lose their edge or ambition, Harris said. But consider prominent and successful advocates for meditation that include athletes, musicians, TV hosts or corporate executives, such as LeBron James, Oprah Winfrey, Arianna Huffington, Jerry Seinfeld, LinkedIn Executive Chairman Jeff Weiner and ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. \u201cDo these people seem like they\u2019ve lost their edge?\u201d Harris said. \u201cDo you think your edge will go away if you\u2019re more focused, less emotionally reactive and a little bit calmer during stressful situations? No, actually the opposite is true.\u201d READ MORE: One habit could reduce your fears of public speaking, criticism, failure and more Harris\u2019 own story is also a testament to how your relationship to work or your values can change once you have reached a healthier place \u2014 and how the success in that newfound reality can be different, but maybe even better or more fulfilling, than what you had imagined or planned. \u201cThis is not the version of success the pre-meditation version of me thought was what I wanted. I wanted to stay in network news and climb as high as I could,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut this opened up a whole new realm for me. I publish books, have my own podcasts and social media feeds, and I continue to have opportunities. I started a company, and I\u2019m exploring a new one. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more potential than I had imagined, and I am absolutely not less ambitious.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/health/meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_health_fda-vaccine-advisers-covid-shot", "text": "Another new version of the Covid-19 vaccine will probably be coming this fall. The US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s\u00a0committee of independent advisers\u00a0voted unanimously Wednesday to recommend that the agency tell vaccine manufacturers to update the Covid-19 shots so they will be more effective against the JN.1 lineage of the coronavirus. The committee voted on the question, \u201cFor the 2024-2025 Formula of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., does the committee recommend a monovalent JN.1-lineage vaccine composition?\u201d All 16 of the advisers voted \u201cyes.\u201d The decision now goes to the full FDA. If the agency agrees with its advisory committee, the new shot will be a monovalent vaccine, offering protection against one coronavirus variant. Some previous vaccines have been bivalent, meaning they were formulated to protect against two variants. There are a few virus variants in circulation now, but they are relatively similar. JN.1 and its descendants KP.2 and KP.3 are the versions of the virus that are most common in the US right now, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA told the advisory committee Wednesday that studies have shown that currently available Covid-19 vaccines appear to be less effective against the variants that are now in circulation. When manufacturers updated their vaccines last year to better match the variants that were in circulation then, it seemed to offer better protection. \u201cMatch does matter somewhat,\u201d said Dr. Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cJN.1 has continued to evolve, and it makes it somewhat difficult to pick the particular specific strain to be used\u201d this year, he told the committee. Because of manufacturing timelines, experts have to make predictions now if they want a new vaccine for fall. This is what the FDA\u2019s committee has done for the past couple of years, and \u201cI think it\u2019s worked pretty well,\u201d Weir said. Covid-19 cases are relatively low right now. Only 3% to 4% of people who are getting tested are positive for the virus, said Dr. Natalie Thornburg, acting chief of the Laboratory Branch of the Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC. By comparison, at the peak of the Omicron surge in late 2021, test positivity rates were at 30%. Hospitalization rates are also the lowest they have been since March 2020, Thornburg said. Many people have some protection against the disease through vaccination or because they\u2019ve had Covid before. People who got the current Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 which was updated last fall \u2013 have protection from serious disease and death across all age groups, but as with past formulations, that protection wanes over time, Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles, vaccine effectiveness program lead with the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the committee. The advisers agreed that more people need to get updated vaccines. Only about 25% of adults have gotten the most recent shot, according to a presentation to the committee. In only the fall and winter months last season, Covid sent more than half a million people in the US to the hospital and killed 40,000, according to data presented at the meeting. The people most likely to get seriously ill or die were unvaccinated, Link-Gelles said, and among the children who were hospitalized, half had no underlying conditions. \u201cThis, I think, emphasizes the need for vaccination regardless of underlying condition, status or age,\u201d she said. The Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers told the committee that they have done some work to prepare for the FDA\u2019s decision on the composition of the vaccine. Animal and lab studies show that shots made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax that target the JN.1 variant seem to work well and are safe, the companies said. Novavax said its updated shot would need to be the JN.1 version because its protein vaccine takes about six months to make, and that\u2019s the version it has been working on. The company said it could get the shot to US warehouses by August. Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines can be developed more quickly, and those companies said they could have either a JN.1 shot or a KP.2 shot ready for fall. Moderna said it could supply the US market by mid-August, and Pfizer said its shot could be immediately ready upon approval. The committee discussed but did not vote on whether the shot should match JN.1 or KP.2. Most of the members preferred JN.1 so Americans would have an option to get an mRNA vaccine or a more traditional protein-based vaccine. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told the committee that the FDA will take these recommendations into consideration as it makes its final choice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/health/fda-vaccine-advisers-covid-shot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "health"}}
